Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Yes, President Obama has much on his plate. Three major crises - Ukraine, Israel, and even our own border. But he has a giant staff, and if he has time for a bunch of fundraisers -- even today all the way to California and yes while this one is a little bit snarky, if he has time for lots of golf, and he does -- he needs to keep a simple promise and order someone on giant staff to answer the Whitehouse.gov petition about Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi. It takes two seconds.
The president could just turn to an aide on Air Force One and say get it done. Two seconds. Not much effort and it would keep a promise. And on May 31st, the Tahmooressi petition on the White House website reached the 100,000 signatures the target set by the White House for when the White House promises to respond. Sergeant Tahmooressi is still waiting, and the White House is ignoring him, ignoring the petition and ignoring its own promise. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And don't tell me it has only been one month and 22 days since the 100,000 mark for the petition was met, that's plenty of time. Don't believe me? Well, my colleague, Sean Hannity, did a little research and discovers the White House answered a petition on its website asking for its beer recipe in only 12 days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't know about you, but I think a Marine in a foreign prison is more urgent than a beer recipe. But this does expose White House priorities, doesn't it? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
