'Off the Record,' 12/2/14: Politicians have know that government waste has been a huge problem for years and it's only getting worse. Yet, they never handle it

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Capitol Hill, what a nightmare! Republicans and Democrats fight over almost everything and that means nothing gets done in Washington. But what about waste?
There are billions of dollars of waste. It's staggering how much there is. You would think that Republicans and Democrats would join hands on that one and work together, since how can anyone not hate waste, right? That doesn't happen. I just don't get why. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Politicians know all about all the waste. We told you about a watchdog report about the number of phony IRS filings by prisoners exposing 37,000 phony filings in 2007 to 137,000 in 2012. That cost you taxpayers $70 million in bogus refund. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's a huge problem, and one going on for years. Well, instead of handling it and being good stewards of your money, our politicians just let it get worse. They just seem like they don't give a damn. And politicians just can't blame the IRS for not telling them about it. Congress has IRS oversight power. Their job is to stay on top of the IRS. But it's not just the politicians, it's the media, too. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When you mention waste to the media, many of the media say well, that's just Washington. That's a lousy attitude. Ways of stealing, it's stealing from you. Time for someone to give a damn. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
