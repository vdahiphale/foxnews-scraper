MARK STEYN, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. I'm Mark Steyn. Tucker is out for a court ordered recount of histurkey giblets.I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. One thing Americans should not bethankful for, however, is the various election systems that afflict thenation, about which regardless of whoever you think won the presidency, toomuch is now known.If Georgia runs the January Senate runoff the same way it ran this month'sgeneral election, in defiance of its own rules and with obvious codswalloplike a supposed burst water pipe shutting down the count, if they do itthat way next time, then the Democrats will win both seats, take control ofthe Senate.And if that happens, and like the mythical pipe burst of Fulton County, atplay, salad deluge, a transformative deluge from a Senate that will sweepaway institutional obstacles and stack the odds against any meaningfulalternative to the Democratic Party for years to come.Direct from his Thanksgiving dinner with a maximum of nine persons from nomore than two households, here is Chuck Schumer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Now, we take Georgia and we change the world.QUESTION: I'm sorry, can you repeat that, Mr. Schumer?SCHUMER: Now, we take Georgia, then we change America.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: When a guy spells out what he is going to do to you, don't actsurprised when he does it to you good and hard.President Trump has now joined the fight in Georgia. He and these twosenators were both on the receiving end to one degree or another of anelection racket whose flaws the state has already admitted to.Just eight weeks ago, this rather curious supposedly Republican Secretaryof State announced that at least 1,000 people had voted twice in theprimary. And that this was a serious intentional fraud upon the people ofGeorgia, quote: "Those that make the choice to game the system are breakingthe law. And as Secretary of State, I will not tolerate it." Oh, he soundedso Butch way back when in September, but he seems to be a lot more tolerantof it just two months later.So the President will be holding rallies in Georgia to help these senatorsover the finish line, regardless of how many double voters turn up orwhatever torrent of burst sewer lines closes down the counting centers fromAtlanta to the sea. This is the new Georgia were told, it's no longer areliable red state. It's all purple now. It's all swing state-y now, wherea moderate Democrat can run to the center and unseat a Republican.So how centrist, how moderate is Kelly Loeffler's Democrat opponent. He isthis moderate. He's anti-gun. He is anti-cop. He is anti-Trump, and morethan that, he is anti-old you enablers of Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE IN GEORGIA: And if it is truethat a man who has dominated the news and poisoned the discussion formonths needs to repent, then it is doubly true that a nation that canproduce such a man and make his vitriol go viral needs to repent.No matter what happens next month, more than a third of the nation thatwould go along with this is reason to be afraid. America needs to repentfor its worship of whiteness.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Aha. Does that sound like a viable swing state moderate to you?The Susan Collins of Georgia? Or does that sound like a crazy radical theGeorgia Democrats are going to need the Shenanigan Express going fullthrottle down the track, to drag to victory.Half the G.O.P. are in indecent haste to move on to the so-called post-Trump Republican Party. And I can understand why that's deeply demoralizingto the 80 percent of the President's voters who think the election wasstolen.I'm just a simple Canadian used to primitive systems of paper ballots,whose votes are counted where they are cast, as opposed to being drivenaround in unmarked vans half the night hither and yon.And I confess I don't understand those Republicans saying, well, yes, butit wouldn't be enough to change the result, as if there's aconstitutionally acceptable figure for the number of civil war veteranspermitted to vote.What I do know is that this talk is very dispiriting to G.O.P. voters andthat suits the Democrats just fine because if they can get enoughRepublicans to stay home in Georgia, they might not even need to pull theold Fulton County overflowing toilet next to the ballot box routine.Georgia Republicans need a record turnout in January to put Perdue andLoeffler beyond the margin of error, beyond the margin of lawyer, andbeyond the margin of sewer.You know who'd be within his rights to shrug his shoulders and walk away?President Trump. Instead, he is heading south because he knows what willfollow if Georgia goes down.Do you like that U.S. Supreme Court Thanksgiving decision striking down adecree from commissar Andrew Cuomo's Department of ReligiousMicromanagement that says you can have no more than 10 people in a 700-seatchurch? It was a narrow five four decision because Chief Justice JohnRoberts joined the lefty judges' opposition.The rock-ribbed Bush appointee apparently agrees for the moment that stateofficials should have the power to deem a church less, quote, "essential"than a bicycle repair shop for months, and if necessary, years' on end. Thelosing party defendant Cuomo has dismissed the ruling as quote,"irrelevant" and blamed it on the courts infusion of politicize Trumpjudges.The Democrats don't mind politicized courts, as long as they're politicizedin the right direction. A third of this bench was appointed by Trump. Theydon't like that and they're not going to put up with it and they'll add newjudges to the court to ensure Andrew Cuomo need no longer be irritated bypassing restraints on state power.Aside from court packing, they are also game for Electoral College packing.If they win those Senate seats, they will be adding new states. First,Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia that hey, why stop there? Americantroops have been running around Helmand Province in Afghanistan and theSunni triangle in Iraq for 20 years now.How about Hillary's liberated Libya? Its polling places work better thanWayne County, let's make them states; or incendiary Afghan goat herds notyet sufficiently reliable Democratic voters.And then there's the easiest fix of all: abolishing the filibuster, so thatthe so-called world's greatest deliberative body no longer needs todeliberate its weight of 60 votes, 51 will put them over the top and theyenable them to put tens of millions of people living in the countryillegally on the express check-in for U.S. citizenship and democraticvoting.A couple of new states, a handful of new Supreme Court justices, millionsof new voters. Now, if you're an existing Democrat voter, you may bewondering, none of these things seem to have anything to do withhealthcare, or the economy or any public policy that affects my life oneiota.And you're right. We hear all this nonsense about how maybe Amy Klobuchardoesn't agree with AOC, about the green New Deal, or mandatory non-binarypronouns for the last three binary Americans. But one thing all Democratsare in complete agreement on is new levers of democratic power, becauseunlike the Republicans, the Democrats are serious about power. And whenthey get it, their priority is to get more of it and keep it.California is a one-party state, New York is a one party state,Massachusetts is a one party state, but there's a lot of states out thereand these guys are in a hurry. And maybe with two Senate seats, they canjust get it done nationally, once and for all.That's what's at stake in Georgia.Joining us now is the CEO of American Majority, Ned Ryun, and the author ofa book called "Restoring Our Republic" and Ned, if this Georgia thing goesthe wrong way, restoring the Republic is maybe going to take a couple ofgenerations or longer.NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: If ever, Mark and Trump isleading by example in going down there on Saturday to do rallies andwhether people like it or not, barring a miracle in the presidential, youknow, cocaine, Mitch on the G.O.P. Senate is the only thing standingbetween us and a political cataclysm.And I'll remind the base of which I am one, the last time we really triedto punish the establishment, we ended up powerless at being able to stopObamacare being rammed through, so there's a season for everything, and nowis not the season to punish the establishment. It's not a time to bediscouraged.But we can be honest about it, Mark. Will a G.O.P. Senate Majoritydisappoint us? Of course, it will. You can bank on it? But will they stop70 to 80 percent of the madness? Absolutely.As you were pointing out, they'll stop the legislative filibuster frombeing removed. They're going to stop the Supreme Court from being packed.They're not going to give statehood to D.C. or Puerto Rico. Are they goingto disappoint us on immigration? Yes, but I would remind any senator on theballot in 2022 to think very hard before you do anything stupid onimmigration.In the meantime, it's all hands-on deck in Georgia. America is at sea. Wehave until December 7th to continue doing voter registration, you can bedoing door knocks, phone calls, peer to peer texting. You have to hold theline in Georgia on January 5th to give us a chance at some semblance ofsanity for the next two years.STEYN: Let me ask you this, Ned. Apparently, there's already been, I think,700,000, three quarters of a million mail-in ballots. What's the stop thisgoing like the last election night where the Republicans were ahead wheneveryone goes to bed, and then at 4:30 in the morning, oh, we start gettingthese mysterious deliveries and suddenly the Republican lead vanishes?RYUN: Well, I would remind people, it's very hard to un-bake once all thevotes are counted, stop the voting in the middle of it and make sure allthese votes are valid. I mean, that's one of the things that could havebeen done in Pennsylvania a couple of days after the election when Trumpwas still up by a couple hundred thousand votes. Hit a stop on that votingand actually prove the validity of these votes.In the meantime, that's the first step. But Mark, the next four years isall about election integrity. If Republicans don't actually make that apriority between now and 2022, and 2024, they are complete and utter fools.STEYN: Oh, yes.RYUN: So I would tell the base, do not be discouraged. Go vote in Georgia.And trust me, in the 2022 primaries, you can punish the establishment toyour heart's content, and I'll be right there alongside you.STEYN: Preach it, Brother Ned on that election integrity. There's no pointtalking about healthcare or foreign policy if the guys in the governmentshouldn't be in the government because they weren't elected legitimately.RYUN: That's right.STEYN: Thank you, Ned. If you are an identity politics enthusiast, thisyear's election has yielded the conundrum of a lifetime. How did a supposedwhite supremacist President managed to completely decimate his opponentamong Hispanics and Latinos all over the country?On Wednesday, a prominent celebrity Netflix producer by the name of BarackObama offered a theory according. To this Netflix honcho, Obama, all thoseHispanics are just too dumb to realize that Donald Trump is a racist whostereotypes people.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's a lot ofevangelical Hispanics, who, you know, the fact that Trump says racistthings about Mexicans or puts detainees, you know, undocumented workers incages, they think that's less important than the fact that, you know, hesupports their views on gay marriage or abortion.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: So there you have it, according to Barack Obama, Hispanics are justbitter clingers as bitter and clingy as white men, but instead of guns andreligions, it is instead gay marriage and abortion policies.Everyone else who disagrees with Barack Obama is some kind of a bit ofclinger and if you start to get the sense that this guy is obsessed withrace and identity and wants to use it for political purposes, shut up.According to Barack Obama, that's something only a bitter white male wouldthink.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: That story that they're hearing from FOX News and Rush Limbaugh and,you know, in some cases inside their churches, you've seen created inRepublican politics. This sense that white males are victims, like they'rethe ones who are like under attack, which obviously doesn't jibe with bothhistory and data and economics.But that's a sincere belief. You know, that's been internalized. That's astory that's being told.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: So it's FOX News and Rush's fault. When will Barack Obama admit thepossibility that some of these 73 million Americans can think forthemselves?Deroy Murdock is a contributing editor at "National Review." Always good tosee him. And he joins us now.Deroy, it's almost as if he is just going through the motions on a lot ofthis stuff. You don't get the feeling he is actually engaging with theAmerican people on it.DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Mark, it's great to be with you. Idon't know if he is going through the motions or not, but we've heard thissort of thing from Obama before and it's just disgusting.I'm struck by a number of things. One is in that clip you saw attackingPresident Trump for supposedly putting illegal aliens in cages. Guess whobuilt the cages? Obama. Those are his cages. He built them, and the peoplethat were put in them were basically a lot of kids who came up to the U.S.without their parents and they had to be put somewhere and that's maybe notthe ideal place to put them, but put them somewhere they will be saferather than running around out in the desert where they just dehydrate todeath and that would be far worse.So he is the guy who built the cages and he never takes any blame for thatand he should.But more than that is a tremendous sense of ingratitude on the part ofObama and his wife. They always talk about what a racist country this is,how bigoted it is. And they never focus on the fact that he was elected in2008 With 69.5 million votes, 53 percent of the total; re-elected in 2012,with 62 million votes, 51 percent total. He won a majority in each of thoseelections.His book so far sold 1.7 million copies. His wife's book has sold 10million copies. It is selling so many copies in fact, it is as yet to gointo paperback.STEYN: Wait --MURDOCK: And she is --STEYN: Do you think anybody actually reads those books? Or actually opensthem? Do you think there's one man, Deroy, who was actually -- actually gotto page 720 of Obama's book, honestly?MURDOCK: I guess they're working through it slowly, you know, they may buythese as acts of virtue signaling and just put them on their bookshelves toimpress their friends, but at least they're buying them, you know, andagain, if this were such a racist country, would people be lining up to buytheir books, lining up in 2008 and 2012 to vote for Obama?And then you've got his successor, Biden, his running mate is a blackwoman, half Jamaican, half East Indian, and they got 78 million or 79million votes. So if this is such a bigoted country, why do people keepturning up to vote for these people, to buy their books, and Michelle Obamaright now is the number one most popular woman on the Planet Earth.So rather than this endless parade of ingratitude on the part of theObamas, they should say thank you, America. Thank you for being so warm tous and warm to our family, for be such a loving country to us, and insteadthey treat this place as if it were apartheid South Africa. Shame on them.It's disgusting to watch and it just turns my stomach.STEYN: Just quickly, Deroy, who is number two on that list of the mostpopular women in the world?MURDOCK: It's is number one, Michelle Obama -- number one is MichelleObama. Number two is Angelina Jolie and number three is Her Majesty, QueenElizabeth II. The story of the crown, I might add on that thought,excellent show.STEYN: Okay, go Her Majesty, we need to get you up in the up in therankings. We need to get the Queen up in the rankings. We need to get theQueen up to number one there, Deroy.MURDOCK: Absolutely.STEYN: A Pennsylvania -- thank you, thank you. A Pennsylvania State Senatorinvestigating the integrity of the election results was vaporized fromsocial media today. What happened? And what did he find out about theelection? That's straight ahead on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEYN: A Pennsylvania State Senator by the name of Doug Mastriano held ahearing on Wednesday afternoon concerning allegations of voter fraud inthis month's election. Oh my. That didn't make Big Tech happy, so todayTwitter disappeared Mastriano.Of course, after an outcry, Twitter yet again claimed that it was all justa big misunderstanding. To be fair, it could be that the fact checkingcensors over at Twitter are still recovering from their massive veganoverload that they consumed during Indigenous Peoples Day that wouldexplain how Twitter managed to censor a sitting Pennsylvania State Senatorwhile also missing something surely even more dodgy coming from theCommunist Party of China.China's state run newspaper tweeted all available evidence suggests thatCOVID-19 did not start in Central China's Wuhan, oh, no, no, no, no, no,but may come into China through imported frozen food products.So lean cuisine did this with a bit of mac and cheese. Probably with somehelp from the Swanson's. Is this double standard in censorship in SiliconValley, a sign of China's new social media strategy?Gordon Chang is a senior fellow of Gatestone Institute, author of "TheGreat U.S.-China Tech War," and he joins us. Gordon, you have to marvel atthe way even on the "Chinese People's Daily," their so-called journalistable to type in that this came into China from some frozen gelato importedfrom Italy or whatever the theory is. Do even the Chinese take thisseriously? Or is this just the latest scam for global consumption?GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: Yes, I don't think thatthe Chinese people take this seriously. They know where this diseasestarted. They know where the first patient was. That was Wuhan.But you know, Mark, China's government and the Communist Party since earlyMarch have been propagating the notions that the disease came elsewhere. Sofor instance on March 12, the Foreign Ministry spokesman in a tweet saidthat coronavirus patient zero was in the United States.That's an official statement of the Chinese government saying that thesaying that the coronavirus started here and then that's spokesman saidthat -- or insinuated that the U.S. Army brought the disease to Wuhan. Andof course that is completely false as well.STEYN: Everybody though, from the World Health Organization, to theEuropean Union, to Facebook and Twitter, takes China very seriously, thetheory of opening up China was that when they had a big capitalist economy,they'd embrace Western notions of freedom.Instead, we seem to be embracing Chinese notions of free speech, where ifyou dispute the official version, Twitter and Facebook will abolish you.Why are we getting more Chinese than China is getting Western?CHANG: Well, a couple things. First of all, Silicon Valley is leftist, butalso China and people in Silicon Valley know and the second reason is,people in Silicon Valley know that China can impose great costs on Chineseand U.S. tech companies, and also can offer great rewards.So for instance, you know, China could let in Twitter, that would be anenormous commercial opportunity, at least Twitter thinks so. Or it canimpose these costs of allowing, for instance, Twitter's competitors intoChina, or just cyber attacking Twitter into the ground.So clearly, the people in Silicon Valley know that they have got to be niceto China, and this is really anomalous, because the President of the UnitedStates, a country that Silicon Valley is in has much less power than, forinstance, Chinese autocrats.STEYN: Yes, that's what is so bizarre about this, Gordon, that actuallythese aren't really American companies anymore. Somehow, they have managedto become almost subsidiaries of the Chinese Politburo.Thank you very much for that, Gordon.As we mentioned, the Supreme Court ruled this week that New York'srestrictions on places of worship are illegal, the Cuomo brothers didn'ttake that news well. We'll tell you what happened, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEYN: This is a FOX News alert. United Airlines has reportedly beganoperating charter flights today so that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is readyfor distribution once it's been approved by the Food and DrugAdministration.The flights are being chartered between Brussels International Airport andChicago International Airport O'Hare. We will continue to monitor anydevelopments with the vaccine's progress. It's all coming from a small townin Belgium, but so do lots of good things like fries with mayonnaise andthe Smurfs.So, now we've got a third one, the coronavirus vaccine.In a ruling on Thanksgiving Eve, the new Amy Coney Barrett court threw outAndrew Cuomo's arbitrary coronavirus restrictions on houses of worship. OnThursday, Andrew Cuomo reacted to the news that his tyranny is not in fact,legal.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I think that Supreme Court ruling on thereligious gatherings is more illustrative of the Supreme Court thananything else. It's irrelevant from any practical impact because the zonethat they were talking about has already been moot. It expired last week.So I think this was really just an opportunity for the court to express itsphilosophy.(END AUDIO CLIP)STEYN: Supreme Court rulings are irrelevant. Good to know. Thank you,Governor. To be fair, it's easy to single out a Cuomo for rank hypocrisy.Just today on Twitter, the Governor's brother, the exquisitely sculptedbodybuilder Chris Cuomo explained why he is not giving up smoking."My lungs are okay. We all know the guidance. Now you do you. I do me." Inother words, rules and guidance for the little people. It's an attitudethat's endemic in the Democratic Party from Nancy Pelosi to DianneFeinstein to Gavin Newsom to that mayor in Denver.Back in April, Tucker confronted New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy aboutthe crackdown on churches in his state. Here's how he dodged the issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Large gatherings arebanned, but liquor stores are deemed an essential service. You have closedchurch services and synagogue services and arrested people for attemptingto attend them. Did anyone say that maybe practicing your faith might beimportant to someone's mental health?GOV. PHIL MURPHY (D-NJ): Listen, I think we've had a very good commonground with faith leaders of literally every faith who understand this.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: Was there ever any scientific basis for these restrictions on churchworship? Marc Siegel, FOX News medical contributor, and the author of"COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science" joins us. Dr.Siegel, you're a man of science. What's the science that says a bicyclerepair shop is irrelevant to COVID, but that worshipping God is a superspreader?DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: You know, there was neverany science behind that, Mark. First of all, it's a historic day when theSupreme Court rules like this on behalf of the Constitution and the FirstAmendment. So hats off to the Supreme Court to have that courage in theface of the secular reality that we're facing more and more here.You know, you realize a place like St. Patrick's Cathedral has over 3,000people can go in there, but under those red zones that the Governor wastalking about, well, they may be off for today. But maybe be back ontomorrow. You could let 10 people in there.And the same with Temple Emanuel, over a thousand people, under the redzone, you could let 10 people in there; under the orange, it would be 25.That could come back.And what about the fact that the churches and synagogues have tried so hardto have physical distancing? To set things up carefully? And when you're inprayer, you know, you're not screaming like you might be in a bar whenyou're getting drunk.And by the way, Neil Gorsuch -- Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch said,how come -- and he's quite right about this, how come a bar and a liquorstore and a bike shop are essential businesses, but a church is not anessential business? Have you been in a liquor store lately, Mark? Whenyou're in a liquor store, people have their masks hanging off, they'rebuying their gin and their vodka, and they're hardly obeying anyrespectable boundaries.And I've been in bike shops, because I'm a cyclist and a mountain biker,and I am telling you what I'm doing during this pandemic, I'm fixing my owntire. Now, for some people, liquor might be their religion. I mean, maybealcohol is somebody's religion. But it's not the same thing.And I think that essential businesses are churches and synagogues. By theway, to go beyond Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch here, you know thatinsurance brokers are considered as essential business. We may look at asecular soulless future where only insurers are around like something outof Kafka.STEYN: Yes. I know.SIEGEL: So finally, I want to say this. We're in the middle of a pandemic.It may even be a biblical plague, Mark. It may even be a biblical plague,right? So what can we do in the face of this? We can get together and wecan pray.STEYN: Right. And oddly enough, that's why 400 years ago, the Puritans setsail for Plymouth Rock to be able to worship freely in public. And fourcenturies later, we need to get a five-four Supreme Court decision onwhether what the Puritans came looking for is still legal in America.Dr. Siegel, thank you very much. We always appreciate hearing from anactual medical professional.On other networks, it is unhinged news anchors who have been passing offgarbage science all week. Watch as one former expert on Russian collusionshares his knowledge of epidemiology on air.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: As there is a small surge or medium sizedsurge for travel on the Thanksgiving Holiday that will surely mean morekilling in many more thousands of households before Christmas.Joe Biden is the only President we have today who is leading the publichealth crusade against the coronavirus.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Meanwhile, at CNN, one anchor complained that dumb ungratefulAmericans should be more like the British and respect the advice of theirbetters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)`ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: It's a tragedy, really. And Doctor, I have tosay I come from a nation where we respect and follow public health advice,knowing it's going to save lives. Why do Americans distrust healthrecommendations? And what might that attitude mean, when it comes to takingthe COVID vaccine?(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: Well, it might be they distrust health experts because all thoseexperts have been wrong for almost a year now.Steve Krakauer is the founder and editor of the "Fourth Watch" podcast, andhe joins us. How long can this deference to experts who get everythingwrong and ricochet from one thing to another. Whenever and whatever it isthe ninth month, have we got another six months of it? Another year?STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, "FOURTH WATCH": I don't know. But I think thepublic has sort of caught on at this point. I mean, look, it's just anotherexample of the absolute condescending way the media talks down toAmericans. And you know, frankly there's no there's no real basis for it.I mean, you look at the track record that you talk about and you showedthat Chris Cuomo tweet that came out earlier today. We know the guidance,you know, you do you and I'll do me. I mean, Americans are not just likegoing out and you know, gathering in mass groups in their homes. We'rebeing responsible.The idea that we need lectures from the media or from politicians to, youknow, crack down on this is completely ridiculous. And, you know, it's alsothis idea of, like, selective outrage and really selective outspokenness.You know, we don't get a lot of lectures from the media when there'sthousands of people in the street on the Saturday after the election, youknow, right next to each other with a little cloth between them all, at theabsolute most.There were no lectures at that point. That's okay.But when it is people gathering on Thanksgiving or any other day, there'sthis thought that everyone just needs the media to crack down on them.STEYN: Well, in the example you mentioned, the doctors actually say thatsystemic racism is a public health issue. I don't know whether Pfizer hasmade a vaccine for that in some town in Belgium, but they should certainlybe working on it.What's so bizarre about this, though, is that you're beginning to get theimpression that people have actually forgotten the way normal life wasbefore March, that the longer it goes on, the easier it becomes to keep itgoing, Steve, that's the worry here.KRAKAUER: Yes, no. I think that there is -- there's a real sense that thatwe are, you know, again, the lecture continues. It is people that are soout of touch. And honestly, I mean, I don't -- if it's just sort of theself-isolation that happens, and we've been fed it from the media. We haveseen it, I mean, whether it's schools, which for all throughout the entiresummer, July and August, we're told because Donald Trump wanted to have inperson school, we were told that schools are absolutely this big danger.Then all of a sudden schools start closing and you know, the kids of thejournalists that "The New York Times" are stuck at home. And now all of asudden, you know, the real science is starting to be looked at and said,oh, you know, maybe, you know, the, the bars and the restaurants are alittle bit more dangerous than the school.So, you know, it's all this reactive nature. No one is really following thescience here. And we're stuck with where we're at now, which is a distrustof the media, which has not been clear on it.STEYN: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Thank you for that, Steve. Good to haveyou with us.There was more Indigenous Peoples Day violence in Portland this week.Gender Studies majors weren't having a good Thanksgiving and they wantedthe world to know about it.We'll talk to a former Navy SEAL about how to deal with this up next onTUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEYN: Welcome back to a special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. InPortland, unhappy transgender and colonialism majors toppled a war memorialstatue as other Joe Biden voters spray painted anti-Thanksgiving messages,anti-American messages on businesses across the city.Jack Carr is a former Navy SEAL and he has some ideas for how to deal withthis. Jack, these are memorials to four-star generals. They basically honorthe poor bloody infantry who served in all these wars across the years.This is an assault on the very idea of service of your nation.JACK CARR, FORMER NAVY SEAL: Well, it really is. And it's -- when I firstsaw this this morning, my first thought was is, it's heartbreaking, but notreally all that surprising in that after a summer of riots with looting anddestruction, this is the natural path, especially when its behavior that'sencouraged by the majority of media and a political class who see it asbeneficial to their platforms.And not only do these politicians and the media encourage this behavior bybeing silent in many cases. They also supported it actively with tweets,with speeches, with sound bites. And one commentator on a primetime showactually said that show me where it says protests are supposed to be politeand peaceful.And I brought along my copy of the Constitution here. And he wouldn't haveto go any farther than the First Amendment where it says the right of thepeople peaceably to assemble.I mean, it doesn't take more than a month or two to read this thing. And itmight be on Audible.And the other part of this, of what happened last night in Portland is thatthere was a pre-Thanksgiving post that Antifa put out on Facebook thatsaid, "Eff Thanksgiving and organize your own direct action."And this is interesting, because direct action as defined by the Departmentof Defense says short duration strikes and other small scale offensiveactions conducted as special operations in hostile denied or politicallysensitive environments, which employs specialized military capabilities toseize, destroy, capture, exploit, damage, designated targets.And so I looked up direct action on Google today. And I also looked at myold dictionary that I grew up with it's not in here, but if you look up onGoogle, there is a definition. And that definition says the use of strikes,demonstrations or other public forms of protest, rather than negotiationsto achieve one's demands.So a nonviolent approach where at the very core of the military definitionis violence.STEYN: Yes, that's an amazing way of putting it, actually, Jack. Thank you.Thank you for that. Thank you for joining us tonight.Employees at a major publishing house broke down into tears recently,because it turns out that the prospect of publishing a book is just toomuch for them. We will tell you what manuscript led to the mass mourning,next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEYN: Welcome back to a special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.According to "Vice" Magazine, multiple employees at the book publisherRandom House have been crying at their desks all week. The reason? RandomHouse is about to publish a book by psychologist, Jordan Peterson.One employee warned that Peterson's book will quote, "negatively affect mynon-binary friend." This isn't the first time that the left has gonecatatonic over views they disagree with.Earlier this month we spoke to Abigail Shrier about Target's decision tostop selling her book on the surge of transgender identification amongyoung women.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Why do you think the censorship of your book has been soaggressive and so unapologetic just out in the open? What is that?ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR: You know, woke activists have taken the positionthat we are never allowed to question anyone's transition, no matter theirage, the circumstance or the incredible lack of adequate medical oversight.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEYN: She is not alone. On Wednesday, we spoke to Alex Berenson aboutAmazon's determination to censor his book as well.Chadwick Moore is here with "Spectator, U.S.A." and he joins us now.Chadwick, these guys shouldn't be working in publishing. If you'retriggered at the thought of publishing a book with which you disagree andit brings you to tears, maybe you should be better off working as a baristaor doing casual agricultural labor.CHADWICK MOORE, "SPECTATOR U.S.A.": I'd have to agree with you. If I werein that editorial meeting, I think my first reaction would be if I weremaking -- if the subject of a book we commissioned was making people cryand scream, I would first think, wow, did we make a good business decision.Secondly, maybe these people need to be fired and the people who hired themought to be fired. With all of these -- but this is nothing new, and look,look at the talent pool that they're pulling from and this is the same inbook publishing in these ones great and still, in many ways, very, verygreat publishing houses, very iconic American brands.And we see this in journalism as well, it is infiltrated with these wokeactivists who come, you know, the sort of Marxist, it's the pipeline fromthe Ivy League and the Marxist college campus into what was once theintelligentsia of this country publishing, in journalism and in books.And instead, we get this outcry over frankly, you know, I was thinkingearlier today, you know, the censorship especially of books is nothing new,even throughout the West, even in this country. You know, we did haveblasphemy laws in this country on the books for a very long time. And someof the greatest works of literature that we still read, you know --STEYN: But it wasn't book publishers employees who were trying to get bookscensored.MOORE: Exactly.STEYN: What's weird -- I know -- I know one of the guys at Random House. Heis a great publisher, but the company's been doing all this sensitivitytraining anti-racism courses, ally-ships, if you engage in say socialengineering with your employees, why be surprised that it works and theydon't like you anymore?MOORE: And here's what we really need with all this billions of dollars theindustry is pumping into diversity training and ally-ship and safe spaces,maybe we need to start training managers on how to delicately deal with andshut down these woke bullies, these social justice cretins.Maybe we need to start investing in those courses, hey, both sides aregoing to have their own shake. We can have the sensitivity training hereand then how to deal with these people when they get too out of hand whenthey start crying, when they start hurting business because that's reallywhat a lot of this comes down to.Target you know, as you mentioned earlier, immediately reneged on theirdecision to ban Shrier's book and it became a bestseller afterwards. So goand go broke as they say, right?STEYN: Yes. Absolutely, Chadwick. You have got it there. They should firethem like Reagan did with the air traffic controllers. I think that wouldwork.That's about it for us tonight. Thank you, Chadwick.Tucker is back on Monday, you'll be glad to hear, but you should tune ineach night at eight to the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity,smugness and groupthink and don't forget to DVR the show if you haven't setthat up already.Have a great evening.
