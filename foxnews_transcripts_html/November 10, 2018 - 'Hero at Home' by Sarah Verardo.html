In "Hero at Home," Sarah Verardo teaches Americans of every age how to view the wounds of our veterans with understanding and compassion. Through a sweet and patriotic tale, Sarah reminds our nation of the pride and respect we owe those who served and their loved ones. As a devoted wife and caregiver to Mike, doting mother to three beautiful young girls, and committed veteran and caregiver advocate, there is no one more qualified than Sarah to write this story. I encourage every family and classroom in America to read Hero at Home and discuss the timeless American values it teaches us. -- Elizabeth Dole
