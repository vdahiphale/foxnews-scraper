GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Waters - and she snowboards on a bottle cap -- Dana Perino, "The Five."
New arrests in connection with Monday's terror attack in Manchester. Authorities are still hunting down the bomb maker before the jihadis can strike again. Details ahead. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, expecting wisdom from a popstar is like expecting sonnets from a gerbil. Except last night, Bono said this of terrorists: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {

        }
      
BONO, SINGER-SONGWRITER: They hate music. They hate women. They even hate little girls. They hate everything that we love. And, you know, the worst of humanity was on view in Manchester last night and so was the best as people took perfect strangers into their houses and queued up for blood banks. And Manchester has a undefeatable spirit, I can assure you.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: He's right. Islamists see fun as evil maybe because it's missing in their ghoulish, cowardly lives.
Pop singer Morrissey from The Smiths -- you remember them -- went even further. When the Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham called the attacker "an extremist," Morrissey asked "an extreme what? An extreme rabbit?" This is the same mayor who said the jihadist was a terrorist and not a Muslim. Sorry, guy, he's both. But to avoid the bigot stigma, the mayor avoids a truth -- which is a pattern. BBC News claims calls were made to a terror hotline about the bomber years before he struck. So, why no action? Could it be again the fear of appearing bigoted? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But at least some entertainers are starting to reject this. Maybe they realize that hugs won't bring peace, but a willingness to fight does. You want to know how pop music actually flourished? How The Beatles were able to sing All You Need is Love? You can thank veterans who dispatched heinous enemies in some really ugly wars, giving pop music center stage in long periods of peace. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, can music survive under a caliphate? I doubt it. ISIS has no use for Coldplay. Bataclan, the Pulse nightclub, Manchester -- all young people, all music fans, all targets. So, maybe it's time we speak less of love and more about evil. Maybe it's time for All You Need Is Guns.
So, Jesse, what do you make of Bono? He's always a clear-eyed thinker in this thing and I think he kind of like explained it fairly succinctly.
JESSE WATERS, CO-HOST: Yes, I think it was a very courageous thing for Bono to say. I remember after 9/11 in this country, there was a lot of unity and you had people like Bruce Springsteen, liberal guy who is doing free concerts for a lot of these victims; George Clooney, liberal guy raising a lot of money; and even Hillary was out in Ground Zero; Schumer; Bush; everybody was together. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you think after 9/11, everybody came together, everybody wanted to go after Afghanistan, there was a lot of bipartisan support. That dissipated.
But when pop stars, especially liberal pop stars, can speak the truth about evil, it galvanizes people that are apolitical, young Americans, liberal Americans to say, you know what, it's OK to say radical Islam, it's OK to describe the heinous acts that these people are committing.
And it gives the license because when you're able to do that and you're clear-eyed and you're united, it enables the country to come together and actually defeat evil instead of just kind of placating it like we've been doing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Kimberly, entertainers, I think, should step up because it seems to me recently with these examples, they're targeting their fans because I think the belief you can't be a fan of their God if you're a fan of a popstar. So, it's almost like some kind of sacrilege because you like - you go to a Ariana Grande and not a mosque. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, shouldn't more popstars be speaking out?
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes. I think it's courageous because people do listen. They have a voice. And Bono is exactly right. They hate our whole way of life. They hate everything about Western civilization. They can't stand the freedom that we have in this country as women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How horrific to target specifically young girls, women and their parents that are going to a concert like this. This was no accident. This was specific. And if you see under Sharia law nothing but disdain for women, for children.
You have young girls being sold into slavery by ISIS, being raped and tortured, horrific things. Some of them so bad that you don't even hear about them in the media. They don't even want to talk about them on the news. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But this is the reality of the situation. You have to be able to face it. You have to be able to deal with it and use a variety - a platform of weapon to be able to target them. And by that, I mean, yes, social media and popstars and education. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you've got to be able to put out your own propaganda to match theirs because otherwise you have people that will be attracted to this, people like the president calls them evil losers, people that specifically are looking for somewhere to go for some relevancy in their lives, and they're just sitting there, waiting for something like this and for radical jihad to soak into them, so that they can commit some of kind of act that they think is significant, so that their life has some matter to it, some importance.
GUTFELD: Dana, most entertainers, they prefer the safe route. So, it's about going online and saying hashtag love, peace, let's live in harmony, all that stuff. At a certain point, shouldn't they just stop that and say love is not enough, it's time to act. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, musicians used to be radical. So, like, that was one of the things that - musicians push the envelope, especially on cultural things. And, in fact, one of the big stories - especially out of the civil right movement was really that musicians were actually helpful to try to bring people together, but they were pushing the envelope too. They would make people question past practices. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Interesting thing here is that, in Western civilization, we send our children to concerts. Abedi's father sent him to die, to kill other people.
And so, when you're dealing with that type of an ideology, I'm not exactly sure how you fix it, but you mentioned something last week - I don't think it was on air - but we were talking about the Toby Keith concert in Saudi Arabia and, of course, there weren't women allowed, so there was a little bit of controversy, but the truth is that actually young Muslim people like our culture, they like the music, they maybe have to listen to it privately.
So, if I were the politicians and there's some new people on the scene, Theresa May, Macron, President Trump, why not recruit some of these musicians actually help. Call upon their patriotism, ask them to help to either put on big event. They actually have the power to reach a lot more people than we do.

        } else {

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: (INAUDIBLE) that will solve everything.
GUTFELD: That would be interesting. But they have these amazingly historical concerts, Juan. We remember Live Aid, but nothing - you could raise - for global warming, climate change, you name it. You can get them. Celebrities will show up like that. But why not for this? Why not for this? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Well, that is courageous.
WILLIAMS: I've been here - when you guys says, you know what, these people, these artists, they are speaking out about climate change or discrimination, who listens to them?
GUTFELD: That's easy. Because that's easy, Juan.

        }
      
GUTFELD: That's so easy.
WILLIAMS: It's easy to say and I'll say it right now. Terrorists are bad, evil and slimy people who want to kill us. Is that hard to say? No.

I think you have to get away from simple kind of - oh, if Bono says that we made a breakthrough, no, we've got to find effective ways to combat this.

        }
      
Dana was talking about - this is an age where we have to effectively produce our own positive images to contradict the idea that they're going to be martyred, that they are smarter or they're being courageous when they do horrific acts like we saw in London or Manchester.
GUILFOYLE: She's right and this is part of it.

WATERS: If it's just Republicans or if it's just right wing people in Britain or America that are leading the charge against ISIS and the country is not unified, and the rest of the left is sitting around listening to Katy Perry and swiveling their thumbs and afraid to say radical Islam, it's not going to work.
But if you can get someone like Bono or Ariana Grande to say, hey, this is evil, it's going to rally people that don't usually pay attention. That's a good thing.
WILLIAMS: (INAUDIBLE) after 9/11 - you were describing how everybody rallied here, President Bush's ratings were up through the roof. It's not only that you could be in Republican enclaves and see support. You could be in Democratic enclaves. You could be in Harlem and see flags everywhere.

In fact, I think President Bush spoke about that when he was driving out to Yankee Stadium. So, everybody was behind. That's what we need here. We need a commitment, and yet what you hear is people say, oh, it's the immigrants. We've got to slow down the immigration or we've got to crackdown on - I just think that's the wrong approach.
GUTFELD: I think we should crackdown on the left who have created a climate of moral relativism. It's different to 2001. We have gone down a really dark bad road where people are incapable of judging evil for fear of being accused of bigotry, which is why when those people call the hotline, nobody listens.

In the 70s, we had people come to my classroom to teach us about cults, right? It was at the time of Jim Jones and SLA and all these weird movements, yes, were going around and we were scared out of our wits.

So, he said we've got to do something about this, mom, and I think we have to go and bomb them, not the children, but them. And, in fact, I might have to strap you to the bomb to go and - I know you would do a very good job and get them. I'm like, how sweet.

But Morrissey's other point, which was like - Morrissey is an unusual guy. A militant vegan. Like, if he goes to a concert or if he has a concert, every single vendor cannot have meat there and it causes just a major hell.
But, anyway, on this, not only did he go after the mayor of London for not condemning radical Islam or ISIS, he also said - went after the Prime Minister saying it's easy to be tolerant when you're protected.

Number two, surveillance. Understand you live in a modern world and freedom and security go together.
WILLIAMS: Yes. I think most Americans agree with you. I don't think people are comfortable being called haters of people who believe -
GUTFELD: Exactly. That is the whole strategy. The whole strategy is that Islamophobia as a term is designed to shut people down. It's time to say, screw it.

PERINO: He asked like what we should do. There's lots of different things you can do. But one of them is that cultural diplomacy actually works very well. The State Department even has an entire wing or an office, but they use sports and cultural diplomacy to try to spread messages that we want to deliver. So, we should support them.
And I think that the new politicians that are meeting this Friday or tomorrow in Brussels, at NATO work together and try to bring something together. What could hurt?
GUTFELD: Brussels, there's a protest against Donald Trump. A march against Donald Trump in Brussels. Where's your march against radical Islam? Brussels where there are terrorists, where there are cells in Belgium and they're having a protest against Trump, I would use the finger, but I realize it's inappropriate.

Joining us now for more on that effort is chief national correspondent Ed Henry. Ed?
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Kimberly, good evening. There is a desperate search tonight for the bomb maker that involves not just the British police, but also their military, a sign of just how intense the situation is at this very hour.
Remember, ISIS took responsibility for the attack at Manchester Arena. I've spoken to people inside the Trump administration who are deeply concerned that the terrorist who made the bomb that killed so many people is still at large and could mastermind another attack at any time.
British and US intelligence officials tell us their assessment is the suicide bomber who died in the attack, Salman Abedi, had recently visited Libya where he could've gotten training, but he was essentially a mule who was outside the arena and set off that bomb that was put together by someone else who's on the run right now.
British authorities are trying to close in on the bomb maker with a series of raids that stretch from UK to Libya where Abedi's father and younger brother were detained, while Abedi's older brother was one of several people taken into custody in the UK.
All of this is why the British Prime Minister Theresa May has increased UK's terror threat level from severe to critical and ratcheted up all of this even more by sending British Army troops to guard major landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Westminster and the British Parliament. The Prime Minister declaring that the "spirit of Manchester is far mightier than sick plots of depraved terrorists," though there was real concern tonight about that bomb maker who's still at large.
Kimberly, back to you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: OK. And thanks for that update. Dana, you made a comment earlier and talking about the children and parents sending their children to these concerts. But this man, this terrorist, his father sent him to die.
PERINO: Right. And so, again, that's also something that Benjamin Netanyahu said the other day after President Trump made remarks in Israel. He said, if the terrorists had actually been attacking a Jewish child that he wondered if Prime Minister Abbas would actually have said the same thing about terrorism being so evil.
And that's why - the ideology is what is so difficult. The thing about the Libya connection I think is very troubling because Al Qaeda and ISIS have both been trying to expand. Al Qaeda in the Maghreb, AQM, has been frustrated that ISIS has been getting so much attention.
You have thousands of migrants leaving the Libyan coast for Italy and then dispersing throughout Europe and possibly the world. So, we now have to have a ton of resources spent to try to find this one guy, plus all the other ones that we're trying to find. So, we are asking a tremendous amount of our intelligence community and law enforcement in order to do this.
But I thought that Tom Joscelyn of "The Weekly Standard" today wrote something very interesting. ISIS first claimed responsibility and said there were 30 dead. OK? It's pretty easy to check the news report that it's actually 22 dead and 15 injured.
It could be that you're seeing now either some sort of a metamorphosis or a combination or a merger between ISIS and AQM or some sort of way that they are utilizing these young people and you don't even realize it's happening. So, we could see this is actually evolving even more.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. But very good point. OK. So, Greg, what do we do now about this here? Because, obviously, we see the UK (INAUDIBLE) tremendous resources and also really induct intelligence operation that we work quite well with. If they can hit them there, you think about here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Well, first, they should get - all their police officers should get guns. The fact that they don't have guns - I'm not saying that that would've prevented this, but you might have an edge if you have guns.
And also, we have to acknowledge that there is a network involved, which rejects the lone wolf assumption that we always go by. The network wants us to adopt the lone wolf assumption because if you only believe in lone wolves, you don't look for the network.
So, whenever you hear the lone wolf story, say that's - for now, that's something to entertain later. I also think his return was a red flag. We have to think about that. Who is in charge of watching the red flags. Do we need more people in charge of running? Should we hire more, create a bigger industry? 
And again, I return to my earlier point why did they miss the red flag because political correctness prevents you from focusing on obvious risks because that would be bigoted. You cannot profile. If you profile, you're done.
GUILFOYLE: So true. Political correctness is making us weak, Jesse.
WATERS: It does. Political correctness kills. And it looks like that might have had a contributing factor here. Think about all the issues we're talking about. We're talking about refugees. We're talking about extreme vetting. We're talking about a country like Libya where the Trump travel ban targeted. We're talking about family members that were implicated in this that Trump was criticized for raising the issue whether or not to take these guys out.
But let's talk about what really is going on here. This happened from Libya. President Obama and Hillary Clinton toppled Qaddafi. They led from behind and left a failed state because they didn't win the peace. ISIS has taken over those militias. It's chaos. Now, there's training grounds there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Is Obama or Hillary responsible for the failed state in Libya? And not only that. Obama withdrew from Iraq and created a vacuum where ISIS took over. Is he accountable for that? He didn't enforce a redline in Syria and has now over - a huge refugee crisis, which is now infecting Europe. Is Obama responsible for that?
So, no one is reporting this is all the aftermath of a failed foreign policy and everyone is talking about Islamophobia or Trump. That's not the issue.
WILLIAMS: Oh, no. Not at all.
WATERS: Not the issue at all, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Let me help you. Lock them up. 
WATERS: I don't need your help at all.
WILLIAMS: Get Obama. Lock him up. What kind of policy is this?
WATERS: Well, what did I say?
WILLIAMS: Because it's not a failed foreign policy. I think the situation has changed. Even Greg said it earlier. It's a different situation.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: And to reiterate, the point here is, we've got a different situation in Libya, different situation in Syria.
GUTFELD: I'd call those failed situation. I wouldn't put a rosy spin on it.
WILLIAMS: What we have here in chaos in many situations. We have to come up with strategies that are effective. That's what we're trying to do.
WATERS: We didn't have a strategy for the last eight years.
PERINO: And work together.
WILLIAMS: And that's why we had so many attacks -
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Juan, we had a ton domestic terrorist attacks under Obama.
San Bernardino, Boston, Times Square, Orlando. I mean, come on, Juan, where were you?
WILLIAMS: I'll tell you what -
PERINO: All of the above.
WILLIAMS: Keep fearmongering.
GUILFOYLE: All right. I've got to go pay some bills. Directly ahead, a lot of fearmongering from the left, Juan, about President Trump's new budget plan. Hillary Clinton has joined in on the hysteria. When we return. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Some of President Trump's top aides were on the hill today to defend his new budget proposal. It's predictably come under heavy fire from Democrats. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: This budget along with the relentless attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act shows an unimaginable level of cruelty. 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Food out of the mouths of babies. Housing from seniors and our veterans. 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's like one punch in the face after another to hard-working people. 
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: It is not an overstatement to say that some children will die because of this.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: OK. Late-night hosts are on the attack as well.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: This budget makes huge promises. It can't possibly deliver. It could leave millions of Americans without necessary services like health care or even food. It's basically the fire festival of budgets. 
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: This budget cut things like the food stamp program, Snap. And the show for health insurance program, Chip. I know this is an unpopular position these days, but I believe children should go to the doctor and eat.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right, Kimberly, the Trump budget is going to kill babies and take their food. 
GUIFOYLE: We've heard this before, haven't we? Because Republicans or conservatives are demonized more than ISIS, they want to starve children. They don't want to take care of them. They're going to cause the death of everybody including people's favorite grandmother. I mean, it's really hysteria. It's not at all trying to build and unite and make sure the people have excellent health care coverage. This kind of hysteria and terrifying people I think is making people sick to be quite honest. Physically, mentally. 
WATTERS: I mean, Juan, you guys are attacking Trump's budget harder then you attack ISIS. Do you have a leg to stand on since President Obama for eight years never even proposed a balanced budget? 
WLLIAMS: You know, I'm just amused -- let me treat you seriously for a second. 
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Because I want to honor and respect this concept. You think this is just the left. Guess what, I'm reading in the newspaper, Senator Cornyn from Texas, a good conservative says this budget is dead on arrival. Nobody is taking this seriously. Hold on, freedom caucus chairman, Mark Meadows, he says he draws the line at cutting meals on wheels for seniors. Mark Walker, chairman of the Republican study committee, says cuts to children health care, not going to happen. These are conservative Republicans, Jesse. 
WATTERS: It's an opening salvo. That's how Trump negotiates. Do you know, look at where were spending some money on here, climate change, musical, $7 million on grasshopper research. How about this, $3 million on lesbian, obesity study.
GUIFOYLE: Did you read that one, cover to cover?
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: He stopped for the pictures. 
GUIFOYLE: Juan. 
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Juan is saying is actually true. That's why it's hard to actually get this done. But the truth is that until people in Washington are willing to actually come together and deal with some of the bigger things, then you're going to actual have less money to spend on discretionary programs like Snap or Chip. I do think the Democrats need to explain to us why -- I can understand why you increase snap benefits, food benefits basically after the 2008 financial crisis. I get that. But, if President Obama had such a great economy, and now we're at 4.4 percent on unemployment, and those numbers haven't come down at all, why is that? There's a problem there that they can't answer in terms of the policy. So I do think it's a little bit of rinse and repeat. We've heard all of these complaints about this before, but until both parties are willing to come together and actually deal with the increase, social security and Medicare, there's going to be less money for other things. That's just the way it's going to be. 
WATTERS: Greg, what do you think about the budget? 
GUTFELD: Well, you know what, I've just realize it's time to start playing their games. You know, we sit here and every year we are told that we kill children, the elderly, the disabled, the vets. Liberal programs for over four decades have killed more people than cancer. See, I can do it too. If you do it, if you can say it without any backup, I can say stuff like that, too. De Blasio says children will die. How many police officers have you put in harm's way by marginalizing their jobs, by saying that, you know, you had to tell your kids to be careful with the police? How many cops lives did you put in jeopardy when you did that? So screw you. By the way, you know the other thing too? It's like some of these are reductions in increases. So it's like saying you're going to get a 5 percent raise instead of a 7 percent raise and somehow you're a monster. If you try to make any subtle, tiny change, people will say -- it's such a gimmick. And you get away with the gimmick because the media lets them get away with it. If you say Republicans are trying to make babies die, then the media goes, Republicans are trying to make the media die. It's collusion. Yes, collusion. 
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Jesse, one more thing tomorrow. Can you find some video of the EPA climate change musical? 
WATTERS: Yes. And if I can, Kimberly will perform it for us. Next, an unbelievable story here in New York City, the mayor, De Blasio, marching a parade that's honoring a terrorist, ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Major controversy here in New York City. The organizer of the annual Puerto Rican day parade plan to honor a terrorist on June 11th, Oscar Lopez Rivera has spent over 35 years in prison for his role at FALN, a Puerto Rican national group responsible for over 100 terror bombing here in the United States. President Obama commuted his 70 year sentence before leaving office. A number of sponsors have pulled out of the parade, but New York's Democratic mayor, Bill De Blasio, still plans to be there and marched behind Rivera. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I believe this parade is very, very important part of the -- life of our city. The parade committee made a choice this year on someone to honor. That does not change the basic nature of the parade. Whether you agree with that choice or not, it's still the Puerto Rican parade. And my point is I will be there to honor the Puerto Rican people. I intend on marching. It's as simple as that. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: All right, Greg, way to take a stand by the mayor. 
GUTFELD: He's the worst person on the planet. I mean, look, in Manchester, right now, they're searching for a bomb maker. He's celebrating one. I mean, this is a guy who started an organization that was involved in over 120 bombings. Bombings that killed people and injured police officers. Imagine the police officers that have to protect this parade. That is their job. That's what they're going to do. But protecting and celebrating somebody who normally targets that parade. What it is with progressives and terrorists? They claim to be for peace but then they drop to their knees for people like Bill Ayres and this joker. It's like they fall in love with the idea of the revolutionary. The revolutionary. No, they're terrorists. They killed innocents. 
PERINO: It's a weird sort of way, Juan, for them to be captured by political correctness in a different way than what we're talking about earlier. 
WILLIAMS: It's exactly right. I mean, I think there's no defense for it, to my mind. I think that's why we see big companies. I think it's so right. You know everybody from Coca-Cola, even Goya, which is a Latin food companies has -- we're not doing this.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Love the beans. 
WILLIAMS: Let me just say, I remember when back in the '80s, you had the Irish parade here, and you had an IRA guy out front as the grand marshal, and you had the cardinal -- I think it was Cardinal Cook who spurned him. 
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: But you have to say no. And I think we have to be consistent. 
PERINO: Would De Blasio take any blowback, Kimberly, if he had said no? I mean, able to withstand it, don't you think? 
GUIFOYLE: It's so awful in so many ways. It's just terrible. I mean, look, I'm half Irish, half Puerto Rican. I don't know why my people having all these parades. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUIFOYLE: I don't know. I don't know. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUIFOYLE: Let me tell you something.
(LAUGHTER)
GUIFOYLE: Which side do you want? I don't know. So, De Blasio doesn't surprise me because this is a man who has treated the police officers and law enforcement with disdain and disrespect. And really as you mentioned earlier, Greg, made the streets less safe for police officers to even be able to do their job. So this is really just consistent with his lack of regard for public safety and for the men and women that serve and put it on the line every day in blue. I applaud Goya. I love your products, and way to take a stand on this. 
PERINO: Jesse, what do you think about President Obama actually commuting the sentence, what kind of message does that sound? 
WATTERS: Surprise, surprise. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Is that where you got your nice tan in Puerto Rico? Were you doing some research for the parade? 
GUIFOYLE: Yes. Just down the street. 
WATTERS: Looks beautiful. I love how De Blasio threw the parade committee under the bus. He's like, oh, it's the parade committee. If was in the parade committee I'll be a little angry. You know the mayor just throws you under the bus like that. I don't like De Blasio. He doesn't like me. So I don't have anything good to say. I think he actually might win re-election, which is scary. I can't believe I'm saying that.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Kimberly has got to run. 
GUIFOYLE: A law-abiding Irish-Puerto Rican.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: President Trump will be attending a big NATO summit tomorrow. Does he still think the organization is obsolete? Analysis, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: When we take care of other nations and when we take care of NATO, 28 nations that laugh at us, and I think all but five are like, you know, way delinquent. And I'm going to ask very nicely for the money. I'm going to say, listen, you've got to pay up, folks. We're defending these people. You've got to pay up. It's obsolete.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Wow. That was candidate Trump just last year voicing his opinion of NATO, calling the alliance obsolete because member countries weren't paying enough or doing enough to address terrorism. So it will be interesting to see how tomorrow's summit goes down in Brussels, where the president arrived today. So what do you think, Greg? 
GUTFELD: About what? I wasn't listening.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Wacky stuff. 
GUTFELD: Take that in extreme position. Take that in extreme position creates chaos, forcing the other side to respond, and he gets them to move toward him. Every position begins as an act that moves toward agreeable. I do this at restaurants with my wife because she's always worried about how much I eat. I ordered a butt load of food and then she says no, no, no, but I'm left with what I want, what I really wanted which is the plate of salt and pepper pork chops well done. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: You're sad, right? 
WILLIAMS: Dana, is it possible that, in fact, you know, what the president said was absolutely right, only five countries that paid 2 percent of their GDP for defense, but he was suggesting somehow that they should pay it to the United States. I don't think. 
PERINO: Well, I think that was just on the campaign trail. I think, obviously, when you become president, you understand a little more fully how much you need organizations like NATO. And I think -- two big issues are going to be burden sharing, so when you're talking about the money, and counterterrorism, and they have great reasons to talk about that. Russia will also been large, and I think the NATO allies are going to explain their concern about Russian involvement in Ukraine, and the president had also said on the campaign trail that he would help protect Ukraine, so there's a lot of those issues. And the other thing I think that he will ask for because this is a decision he's going to have to make soon is he will ask NATO countries to help more in Afghanistan and Iraq for training for the military and police. 
WILLIAMS: So Jesse, what about that Russia issue that Dana raised? Is he now committed that -- if an attack on a NATO country, the United States will honor its NATO commitment? 
WATTERS: You know, Russia is in bed with Trump, Juan. So, you know, we're just going to let Russia walk all over NATO. We're not going to pay off -- yeah, is that the conspiracy now that Trumps wants to weaken NATO so that they could let Russia take over. I don't think there's anything to do with that. Greg is right. Strong opening bid. You say they've got to pay up and they have to pay up now. And, you know, they rattled their cage. Obama asked nicely and no one listen to him. Trump was tough and now they're coming to the table and it is working. 
WILLIAMS: What about Germany? 
GUIFOYLE: Well, everybody's got to pay, Juan. The E.U. and the majority of our allies are not capable really, you know, of defending itself without military assistance from the United States. I think it should be equitable. People should pay their fair share to be able to be part of this alliance. Especially now more than ever we need cooperation. And that cooperation goes across all lines, which is financial as well, sharing intelligence, working together in communication and standing united against terrorism and problems that we're all facing that we all relate to. So, I mean, I think NATO has a place. I think it can be very effective if we put in the right amount of resources and it just can't be the United States every single time, dipping into our well, every time. 
WILLIAMS: I was surprised that Germany is not on the list of the five countries that paid 2 percent. It's Greece, Poland, Estonia, and the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Where's Germany, anyway? One more thing, up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: One more thing, let's go to Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, with Memorial Day and the start of summer on the way, city boys like me, we start to think what are farmers doing these days? Well, there they are, water skiing, seriously. Check this out. In Quentin Connealy Cornfields, they were flooded in Nebraska, so they attached a wakeboard to an all-terrain vehicle and he went surfing among the cornstalks. Connealy is about a mile from the Missouri river in Nebraska, but he said they never seen this much rain. So while this was fun, this city boy is hoping that he finishes the rain in time to plant some more corn, my favorite summer dish. Kimberly, I hope you like corn.
GUTFELD: All right, enough. 
GUIFOYLE: I love street corn, delicious.
GUTFELD: Dana. 
PERINO: I'm going to go with podcast promo. The Perino and Stirewalt, I'll tell you what, podcast was recorded today. We've talk -- let's see, the terror attack, President Trump's foreign trip, we talked about the Republican budget that just got proposed, and a memorial day, a little Stirewalt type of tutorial on that. And we talk about this. This is a picture of a bear -- it looks like a professional picture, right? No, on contrary, my mom, Jane Perino, took that from her car on her road trip through West Virginia.
GUTFELD: What's he's doing in the tree? 
PERINO: Well, we'll discuss that on the podcast. You have to tune in.
GUTFELD: I think it's perverse and I'm disgusted by it. Where am I, Kimberly? 
GUIFOYLE: Yes, thank you so much. 
GUTFELD: You're welcome.
GUIFOYLE: So this memorial day I would like to point out a fantastic book by my friend, Karen Bond, she's the mother of fallen U.S. navy seal, Aaron Carlson Bond, from SEAL team six. Sadly, Aaron, an American hero perished on August 6th, 2011, along with 30 other Americans that were shot from the sky while rushing into battle. And losing Aaron really change her life, had a profound impact as you can imagine. And in this book, World Changer, she really wanted to provide parents with advice on how to raise children who will leave a mark in indelible imprint on the world, much like her fallen beloved son, Aaron. And I'm happy to say that Karen will also be my guest tomorrow night on Hannity, Sean will be on vacation for two days and I will be in for him, so you can all watch that as well. 
GUTFELD: All right. Another podcast plug, but this one is good. The One, my guess is Shelby Steele, wrote one of the greatest book ever called, Shame. Buy his book. Listen to the podcast. All right, it's time for this. 
PERINO: Oh, a twofer. 
GUTFELD: Greg's pet news. I'm so excited I bought a dog everybody. I bought a dog. Check him out. It's a poodle-potamus. I got him at a local pet shop. It's amazing. It's a hairless poodle-potamus. It's an actual dog. And isn't it beautiful. Loves the water, Juan. Just like you. Loves the water. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: This is fake news. 
GUTFELD: This is not fake news. It's either a hip zoo or poodle-potamus. Now to Jesse. 
WATTERS: Another scandal involving Russia. Role the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(FOREIGN LANGUANGE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That's right. And Democrats are now calling for a special counsel. 
GUTFELD: Nice, exactly.
PERINO: Oh, the clear glasses.
GUTFELD: Thank you. I just changed while Jesse was talking. 
WATTERS: Clark Kent.
GUTFELD: Thank you very much. All right.
PERINO: Now do you go to your other job?
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Don't miss an episode. "Hannity" is up next.
