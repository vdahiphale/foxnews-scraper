OPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: I never considered the question even a possibility. I just thought "Oh. Oh."

DAVID RUBENSTEIN, THE CARLYLE GROUP: Right. Because it's clear that you don't need government experience to be elected president of the United States. Right?

WINFREY: That's what I thought. I thought, "Oh, gee, I don't have the experience. I don't know enough. I don't" -- and now I'm thinking, "Oh."

"Oh." She was joking, of course, but there are worse ideas. See that rebuttal to Trump? Out of ideas, the Democrats rebooted "Mayberry RFD."

But Oprah is an icon who, unlike traditional politicians, could match a wild card like Donald Trump. And if she won, she could give everyone a free car.

And how different is that, really, from most Democrats? And consider who her running mate could be. Steadman or Gayle. She could replace the Cabinet with her book club.
I kid, but she's quite a story. Born into extreme poverty, not having a pair of shoes until she was 6 years old, she became the richest black American of the 20th century -- worth billions. She's the walking, living, breathing reminder of American opportunity, capitalism and optimism. She's rugged individualism at its best.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

However, there is scandal in her life. Her name is not really Oprah. It's Orpah. So who is she really? "Oprah" or "Orpah"? Could she be a Russian spy? We'll need an independent investigation, perhaps by Dr. Phil.
But really, this is fake news. The real news is that the Democrats and the media are already thinking about 2020. It's natural in team-sport politics to only see elections as the game and not all those days in between. It's like the next four years are the world's longest halftime.
Was there ever a time when the bubble stopped thinking about the next election for maybe one month and just focused on the country? Imagine if on your job, you're only thinking about keeping your job four years from now. You wouldn't get much done. Maybe in government, that's good.  </pre>
