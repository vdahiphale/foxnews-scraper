     Video  Rove: It's going to months of Democrats demanding the unredacted Mueller report 
Fox News contributor Karl Rove shares his predictions following the release of the minimally redacted Mueller report on 'Hannity.' 
This is a rush transcript from "Hannity," April 17, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Buckle up for tonight's "Hannity". Brace for impact. Tomorrow morning, the Mueller report will be released and Mueller madness begins.
Our sources telling us tonight, minimal redaction. The American people will see this and still the media mob of Democrats, Trump haters everywhere will get there one last itsy-bitsy chance to breathlessly, hysterically, hyperventilate over nothing. A baseless, a vengeful hoax, a Russian collusion witch hunt that has come up totally and completely and utterly empty. No collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No matter what sentences, paragraphs, pages Democrats, the mob and the media fixate on, none of it changes the outcome. We already know the outcome. If you can go to Vegas, you can bet on what I'm telling you.  Four separate investigations now have cleared Donald Trump and the Trump campaign, including the also powerful special counsel filled with investigators who are, almost all of them, big time Democratic donors, supporters of Hillary, even somebody who went to her victory party, and a former lawyer of Hillary. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
After 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 court orders, interviews with 500 people, the Mueller report -- this is directly from the report -- concluded, quote: The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government and its election interference activities, which, by the way, Devin Nunes warned us about in 2014. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No one inside the Trump campaign, that means Donald Trump, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. No one. That is now a fact. Two and a half years, you've had your tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, your daily lies and the media mob, the Democratic Party working in unison, in one voice, to slander, smear, besmirch, and destroy a duly elected president and everybody around him.
They have for two and a half years flat out lied to you, we -- the American people over and over and over again. And we've got the proof.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Trump is seeing more and more of the walls closing in on him which is why he is becoming increasingly desperate.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What if he refuses to open the White House door?  What if the Secret -- or if he fires any Secret Service agent who would allow the federal marshal? What if Donald Trump simply decides, I don't have to follow the law? I refuse to be held under the law, no marshal can get into this White House?

Can anyone ever really believe the collusion truther Rachel Maddow ever again? She and all these others conning their viewers. And, by the way, many for a lot of financial gain.
Tomorrow, they will give it there one last college try. Good luck. And you can expect more of what you just saw on steroids and human growth hormone.

It's over. They lost again. It is election night all over again and 2016, and here's the sad reality, they'll never apologize. They won't retract false reports, retract their politically motivated daily hysteria.
Their breathless, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, impeach, collusion, collusion, collusion insanity! Never. They will never own up to being a part of the biggest, most dangerous fraud conspiracy theory ever perpetrated against we the American people.
And when they finally realized they lost and they did and they lied and they did and they failed on a spectacular level and they did, they're just going to move on to the next lie, and then next lie, and the next conspiracy theory. And they're going to act as if this never happened, badgering, hope you forgot.

As I've said mainstream media, so-called journalism is dead in America.  The fools who claim to have a monopoly of facts, they don't want to report Mueller's key findings. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let me go back from the Mueller report. The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. Mueller words, not Hannity. A direct quote from the Mueller report. An undeniable, irrefutable fact.
This is the paragraph that the liars on the left can barely bring themselves to acknowledge. But with the fake collusion narrative dead and buried, you can already see the mob switching their narrative. Or maybe we will get him on obstruction. We need his tax returns. We will have a memorandum of understanding and we'll agree to go after him on this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, get this, obstruction of justice from a crime that was never committed. How can you obstruct without the underlying crime? By the way, with the statute of obstruction, you need intent, that is required by law when one has consistently and repeatedly and loudly, like the president, rightly proclaiming his innocence. He acted the way innocent people act, they are outraged. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, of course, the president was never charged with obstruction, not by Mueller, not by the attorney general's office, not even Uncle Rod Rosenstein. And tomorrow in the report, you might see information about, well, the president, he fired Jim Comey. That is not obstruction. Even Comey pointed out, the president can fire an FBI director for any reason or no reason at all, and you might hear -- if they will hang on to evidence about, well, the president talked about firing Rod Rosenstein, and other officials like he talked about firing Mueller himself or the president wished a 33-year-old veteran, a hero who served this country in combat, General Flynn would not get in trouble.
The president talked about, this is ridiculous. I hope he doesn't get in trouble. But guess what? The president never fired Rosenstein, never fired Mueller, never fired Sessions, never fired any of the Democrats hired to sustain the witch hunt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He never stopped the investigation. In other words, he never impeded, he never obstructed. He didn't impede against the case against Lieutenant General Flynn or any other target of this witch hunt.
And shouting from a rooftop that you're innocent as the president has, that you're a victim of a witch hunt, that's not a crime. Expressing frustration about injustice is not obstruction. Talking is not obstruction. Thinking about something is not obstruction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kind of like, like Rod Rosenstein, another deep state rat talking about wearing a wire because they wanted to spy on the president. Or conspiring and talking about using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, there are officials right now in our DOJ right now, they actually had those real conversations but none of them are being charged with the crime because they didn't act. They didn't commit. One in this case, well, maybe the others did, though, which we're going to get to.
In this case, well, they didn't wear the wire. They didn't use the 25th Amendment. They never acted. They talked about it, talking is not a crime.
Now, if the Democrats, the hate Trump media mob, if they really cared about obstruction and when you hear these people tomorrow, OK, I've got a great case for them. Why oh why oh why did they ignore the blatant obstruction of justice committed by one of their own, their favorite candidate, Hillary Clinton?

Now, we know she violated the Espionage Act, it's a fact. She stored classified, top secret information on an unsecured server. Here is the law. Irrefutable and you can see it right there, incontrovertible and overwhelming evidence, even Comey admitted she did this. And she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, washed the hard drive with Bleach Bit, remove the SIM cards, had an aide destroyed her devices with hammers, just in case those emails were still on there.
Now, the media mob that will be so outraged over obstruction tomorrow, this was the biggest slam dunk obstruction case ever. It had an underlying crime and intent, the intent in this case: destroy the evidence of the crime. More media, more liberal selective, phony moral outrage, that's what you'll see tomorrow.
Remember in the Kavanaugh case, oh, they were -- I believe, I believe.  Where are the "I believers"? Because we have serious allegations of rape and violent sexual assault right now against the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia. All the "I believers" are quiet.

By the way, Hillary was never charged with her crime because her investigation which we now know was rigged by the deep state. Just the upper echelon, not rank-and-file. And that's why Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, is not rightly investigating the investigation into the Clinton email scandal. And in this case, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. It's now crystal clear we on the show and we have this ensemble cast, radio and TV, staffs, the people you see all for the last two years, we've been right all along. The Clinton investigation was fixed in her favor by a few high-ranking bureaucrats wanted her to be president, wanted to Trump to lose.
Well, President Trump faced a modern day political persecution at the hands of those very same people, the same people that gave her a pass rigged her investigation. If the deep state was really concerned about collusion and why is there no investigation into collusion? We now know Ukraine is begging to give them evidence. They are admitting they colluded to help Hillary in the 2016 election, thanks to John Solomon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We also know Ukrainian government official dead this and is admitting this and has evidence to this fact, to impact the 2016 election. So, is Robert Mueller going to be reappointed to investigate the Clinton campaign and only high Republican donors?
And what about Clinton's bought and paid for dossier? Yes, the dossier with of all things, imagine this, Russian government lies, misinformation, propaganda now debunked. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, tonight, according to "Politico", we are learning that the DOJ inspectors report will likely target the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele. That's fine, but the real focus should be on the person that paid for that lying dossier. Those that never verified that dossier and committed a fraud on the FISA court, those that leaked the information in that dossier to their friends into the media, so they leaked it before the election to influence the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And those that use it to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, of his constitutional rights and use those Russian lies to commit a fraud again and again, four separate times on the FISA court to spy on the Trump campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, thankfully, our calls for truth and justice are all about to be answered. After Mueller madness, hysteria and breathless reporting tomorrow begins to die down and it will, this is what's coming next in the coming days, months, weeks. There is a complete avalanche of truth that will start to cascade down on all of the deep state bad actors, the corrupt media, the Democratic Party, all the people missing in action and what is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in American history.
We are talking about criminal referrals coming from Congressman Devin Nunes. More criminal referrals we expect from the Horowitz report. His report on the FISA investigation, committing fraud to FISA court judges. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They knowingly lie to those judges. Let's not forget the Uber investigation on leaking by these officials. The 302s, conversations, Christopher Steele, Bruce Ohr, the applications, the FISA applications themselves, especially the last one, pages ten through 12, 17 to 34.
Then we'll get the Gang of Eight information. What did the FBI know and when did they know it? We might get information on Christopher Steele from a court in Florida.
And this is very important, AG Barr's investigation into spying. They spied on the Trump campaign. It happened. Now, these investigations will bring a lot of bad actors to justice. The consequences will be steep and today, we have been right about everything that has transpired surrounding the deep states abuse of power, the witch hunt into president.
And tomorrow, you will see the last mass hysteria, freak-out on this topic.  They'll be another one. And it will pass.

Now, this week I nearly had a heart attack. Why? Well, a columnist from "The Washington Post", they make get a Pulitzer like "The New York Times" for their hoax coverage, he had the courage to admit any article titled -- look at this: FOX News has been right all along. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Gary Abernathy, I'm worried for his job tonight. He writes, quote: FOX News hosts like Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and especially Sean Hannity have been slammed for spending nearly two years clamoring for an investigation of the investigators. It would behoove serious journalists to put aside their political biases and delve into the story that might actually be worthy of Watergate comparisons, even if it includes the painful admission that FOX News has been right all along.
Wow, imagine that. Talk show hosts right again. We have listed all the times we have been right and they have been wrong.
You know, I am a talk show host. I sometimes report straight news, I have hundreds of hours of coverage. We've done investigative reporting like vetting Obama. We have for the last two years. We also offer strong opinions, I don't hide it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sometimes we talk about sports, culture and even laugh and have fun. Like if you are talk show host, you're like the whole newspaper. You're a member of the press, the free press in America, and every news division in this country was wrong. Except I will say, people in our news division like Catherine Herridge, Ed Henry, I'm not going to name everybody.
We had -- we even had our own sources. I have my own sources. And, by the way, I will protect them to the grave.
And, by the way, I hope Mr. Abernathy, I hope you don't get fired. The truth actually got out "The Washington Post."
Only one small part of our promise to hold a deep state accountable.  Investigations taking place right now, in the DOJ, in Congress are the only thing standing in the way of this country becoming a banana republic if we don't investigate investigators, lock up the bad actors, this country will be over as we know it. Almost be held to account, including those who rigged Hillary's probe, prosecuted Trump, spied on a political campaign, try to rig a presidential election, attempted a deep state coup on a duly elected president of the United States. If justice is not served, say goodbye to our democratic republic, say goodbye to your freedoms. You can say goodbye to your precious rights endowed by our Constitution and creator, God.

We must protect also the 99.9 percent good people in the FBI, the intelligence community that protect the innocent people here and around the globe, premier agencies around the world. It's only 1 percent that did wrong. We either cut equal justice that we deserve or we will have no country.
Here now, Fox News contributor, a big part of our ensemble cast right here, Joe diGenova, Sara Carter and Victoria Toensing.
Good to see you all.
Joe, when you said the first time on this show, bad cops -- being the son of a prison guard for 25 years my mom and my dad, a family court probation guy and family full of cops and two FBI guys, it stung. But there is that -- those 10, 12 people. It's not the rest of them.

JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Sean, the day of the news conference that James Comey gave exonerating Hillary Clinton after accusing her of a series of crimes, I called him a dirty cop.  That's what he is, he remains that today and disgraced.
Tomorrow morning, a clean cop, Bill Barr, the new sheriff in town, is going to hold a news conference at 9:30 a.m. By doing so, he will confront a rebellious, abusive Congress under the charge of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. He will start a process which is going to lead to a series of federal grand juries to hold accountable all the people you are talking about and he will conclude without saying it tomorrow that it all started in the White House.
Barack Obama knew about this from day one. He authorized it. Brennan and Clapper informed him. Everybody knows that's where we're headed and it's about time because a lot of very innocent people have been hurt. Not just Donald Trump who has been absolutely outrageously harmed by what President Obama authorized and now, the chickens are coming home to roost as Reverend Wright used to say in Chicago.

HANNITY: You always make me laugh. It is not fair. I can't focus.
Victoria, let me ask you -- by the way, all three of you have been a big part of this ensemble for two years. We have all gotten beaten up for it.  Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, Joe, you hate it.
Victoria, I want to know two things. What is going to happen? And do you really believe that justice will be served for these bad actors?
VICTORIA TOENSING, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Justice will be served and the columnist Gary Abernathy who should do another column very soon and asked this question, what did Barack Obama know? And when did he know it? How many meetings where they're at the White House about this Russian investigation?
We know there was one on January 5th with Obama, Vice President Biden, Sally Yates and James Comey. And they discussed the Russian investigation because later, Susan Rice tried to cover it up two weeks later and said, oh, we had this meeting but we would all agree we would do everything by the book. Oh, yes, wink-wink. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {

        }
      
How many other meetings where they are the White House? For how long did they go on? I hope that's a more columnist start asking that question.
HANNITY: Well, amazing.
Sara Carter, you've been with us from the beginning. But we also -- we've all had our sources, everyone on the show and so many others I can mention now. And we know the avalanche. To the extent you can, explain to everybody what you know is coming? I tried to explain it my own way.
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, we certainly have a number of sources, Sean. I known -- I don't know who yours are. I know who mine are.
I can tell you this, that there is an avalanche that's going to be coming within the next two months. Let me fix this -- and it is going to be huge.  There are a number of indictments that are on the way. There's going to be a very serious investigation into what had happened and what had transpired since the Hillary Clinton investigation by the FBI, all the way through the origins, the very beginning of the investigation and to then candidate Trump and those within his campaign.
And this is going to be significant because they are going to look for these origins, and I think -- I agree completely with Joe and with Victoria that it's going to lead all the way back to the White House. And that is what I'm hearing and I'm talking about the Obama administration.
HANNITY: Strzok and Page thought right into Loretta Lynch's office, didn't they? There's a circular firing squad forming -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

CARTER: A circular firing squad, and Brennan, as well as Comey and Clapper.
TOENSING: Get lawyers. Get lawyered up.
HANNITY: Buckle up. Now, this is -- you all have been right. Thank you for all that you've done, all of you, and so many others that are not here right now.
But coming up, John Solomon, he has an important report about Mueller's findings that will rattle the deep state ahead of tomorrow. Also, Gregg Jarrett.
And later, outrageous hypocrisy from the left. Karl Rove examines the 2020 radical wannabes, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Welcome back to "Hannity."

So, with the Mueller report set to be released tomorrow, "The Hill's" John Solomon out with a brand-new article, look at there: Ten Post-Mueller questions, and what's important about this, could turn the tables on the Russian collusion investigators.
John, I want to ask you about that and I also want to ask you about what Obama's White House involvement in this probe. We saw Page and Peter Strzok point directly to Lynch's office. And I want to know what she knew and when she knew it. I want to know what Obama knew, and Rice knew and Clapper knew and Brennan knew.
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: I think it is such an important question and it has gotten lost in the last few years as we have debated the narrative that has not been true. But one text message has always stood out in my mind, Sean, and it's in my column again today. I mentioned it, and that is a text message from Pete Strzok and Lisa Page after one of the first foundational meetings after they launched the Trump investigation and the text says, the White House is running this. The White House is running this.
I covered law enforcement for 30 years. The White House doesn't normally run counterintelligence or Justice Department investigations. That text has remained in my head for a long time. And over the last few weeks I've been reporting, I think Victoria, in the last segment, something really important, she said, January 2017, there was one White House meeting, I think next week, we'll be talking about a meeting one year earlier where the origins of the Trump collusion case begins, a whole year earlier.
And I guarantee you, it will have been inside the White House.
HANNITY: So, you are saying it started in 2015?
SOLOMON: No, 2016. January 2016, the beginning of Donald Trump's --

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: We know the FBI began in February -- I'm sorry, in July 31st, 2016.
SOLOMON: I'm going to say six months before the effort to get Trump was launched. And I think next week, we'll be talking about some pretty interesting evidence. But I think it is so important for us not to step back from all this, and remember, this had to start somewhere and a lot of resources had to be put into it.
Who did it? What did they do? What did they know? What did they keep from the court? That's my column was about today.
There are so many questions. I interviewed all the people who are working in the I.G. probe, the Senate judiciary probe around the Attorney General Barr. I tried to come up with the 10 seminal questions. If we get them answered, I think we'll be able to ask ourselves and answer honestly --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Anything in my monologue that you disagree with that's coming?  The cascade of information, the avalanche I'm predicting?

        }
      
SOLOMON: I don't. I think it's going to be a very difficult time for the investigators, particularly those who lead the FBI, who made Christopher Steele look more trustworthy than he was.
HANNITY: Great Jarrett, you know, "The Russia Hoax: Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump", and here we are.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Your amp today. I thought of you when I read that.
GREG JARRETT, THE RUSSIA HOAX AUTHOR: Well, the Russia hoax has now been exposed for all to see and the witch hunt has ended. It'll end formally tomorrow no collusion, no obstruction of justice and then Sean the real investigation begins for conspiracy to leak unmasked names of reporters and classified information. James Comey stealing government documents and leaking them. You've got a whole group of people who lied to judges concealing evidence, deceiving them. That's a wide variety of crimes. And if people at the FBI and the Department of Justice were using their positions of power for political reasons to abuse the legal process, those are crimes as well.
HANNITY: Hang on. Did they rig the Hillary investigation?
JARRETT: Absolutely they rigged it.

        }
      
HANNITY: OK. With--
JARRETT: The DOJ rigged it and so did Comey. 
HANNITY: OK and even Page and Strzok say, there is a circular firing squad amongst all these deep state people in trouble, which is interesting, we have 53 more closed door testimonies that we can get. Now, did they also try to rig the 2016 election with the phony dossier?
JARRETT: Yes. I mean they were spreading this phony dossier all over Washington. Congress, the Gang of Eight to many members of the media in order to bring the election--
HANNITY: And did these people try to basically commit a coup and unseat a duly elected President?  JARRETT: And when that failed, they try to coup again. Thanks to Rod Rosenstein under the 25th Amendment and considering recording the President to gather incriminating information.  HANNITY: Yes. All right. John can't wait for your report. That's a hell of a tease. I just want you to know. I heard every bit of that.
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
HANNITY: Don't think I missed a word. All right. Thank you both. And thanks for being part of our ensemble coverage throughout the two years. Coming up, not only is Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke, well he's a hypocritical cheapskate, we have the report coming up, he's using World War to actually need to defend the New Green Deal.

HANNITY: Just breaking this half hour. House Democratic Chairman's calling on AG Barr to cancel his press conference tomorrow. Good luck. The same Nadler by the way didn't want to release the Starr report. You really want to stop freedom of speech in this country. Good luck with that.
We'll continue to follow that. But first Democrats, the most generous people in the world. They really are. When it comes to spending your money, comes to spending their own money, turns out they're actually beyond stingy. Especially Robert Francis, Bozo, O'Rourke, his 2017 return shows gave a measly 3 percent of his $366,000 income to charity by the way over a 10-year period. He only went over 1 percent. One time. Now, O'Rourke is downplaying the whole thing, lecturing us that he contributes in ways that are "immeasurable". Not money. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community and my state. And now of my country. There are ways I do this that are immeasurable. and there are ways that I do this that are measurable. There are charities that we donate to that we've reported and itemized, others that we've donated to that we have not. But I'll tell you I'm doing everything I can right now, spending this time with you, not with our kiddos, not back home in El Paso, because I want to sacrifice everything to make sure that we meet this moment of truth with everything that we've got.  (END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: I said 3 percent. I made a mistake. I apologize and retract something the media won't do, which they need to. It was 0.3 percent. That's it. And while O'Rourke pretends to be a working man of the people, he has assets worth millions. Father-in-law with the multi-billion-dollar real estate empire that helped launch his political career and of course this hypocrisy is nothing new. People like Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, other comrades of the Left crusading against capitalism every day turns out that they're eyeing the big bucks as much as anyone.
Senator Sanders bragging that he's a millionaire, because his book was good. And Ocasio-Cortez today reportedly retaining Hollywood powerhouse CAA to write a book of her own. See the pattern here. Campaign Against Capitalism, reap the benefits of capitalism. Lecture us on prudence and equality. Donate little to charity. Generous with your money and they travel on private planes more than any other person that you ever meet, especially those running and then they want the New Green Deal with no planes or cows.

Anyway, joining us now we have - Karl Rove is with us and this is just a small part of the campaign. First, before I get to the double standard and generous with other people's money. You've been through a little of this yourself as special counsel. Name was Patrick Fitzgerald. So, what happened to Scooter Libby. I think a great injustice happened there. And my question to you is now that we have the exact words that say no collusion. And then you know they didn't go after Hillary for real crimes, the Espionage Act and real obstruction with intent. We know this is our last gasp. What's next for them. 
KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I believed it was their last gasp. I think tomorrow is the beginning of the next chapter. You're right.
HANNITY: Towards impeachment.
ROVE: No, I think it's going to be first and foremost focusing on, they want the entire document. And that's going to lead then to charges that he obstructed justice. And then it's going to be Katy Barr (ph) the door. Well go through this. It's going to be months and months in my opinion of demanding the completely unredacted copy of it. 
HANNITY: Karl, we're only getting minimal redactions. It's reported--
ROVE: And Barr has also apparently said that he will show the entire unredacted report to certain members of Congress. But nonetheless people like Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler are going to be calling for the immediate and total release of everything. And you see it in the language of Nancy Pelosi who says that Barr is usurping the responsibility of Congress. Congress is supposed to be the judge and jury, not our legal system. But the Congress is supposed to be.
So, I wish I thought--
HANNITY: OK, but the problem Karl--
ROVE: Incidentally one minor thing. What's the one connection between Hillary Clinton's investigation, the Russia collusion charge and the special prosecutor that I had to go through, and the answer is James Comey appointed the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald. Jim Comey is the man who said Hillary Clinton was innocent. Even before he interviewed her, and James Comey is the man at the center and one of the people at the center of the Russia collusion investigation.
HANNITY: Karl, I'm telling everybody there is an avalanche of evidence about to come out that is going to blow up this entire story. The biggest abuse of power scandal in our history. It exists. We've gone over it regularly. Let's talk about our connected, so we now four separate determinations. The FBI nine-month investigation. House intel, bipartisan Senate committee and now the Mueller Report definitively no collusion. Fine. Keep going after that and then run on the New Green Deal, how does that impact 2020.  ROVE: Yes. Well, I think by the time 2020 rolls around and I suspect they'll get smart that candidates will get smart you'll notice the candidates are not talking to the same way that Schiff and Nadler are. In fact, I thought it was interesting. Bernie Sanders in the Fox Town Hall on Monday went out of his way to say, if we spend all of our time attacking Donald Trump, Democrats will lose. So, you're going to see a dichotomy between most of the presidential candidates particularly the ones near the top of the heap and the people who are the chairs of these committees in the house because they have nothing.
First of all, they're all emotionally involved in this and they have nothing to go on in the house and nothing to do except vent their spleens. And that's why we're going to continue to see Adam Schiff. We're going to see to Nadler and the others go in that direction. 
HANNITY: They want to eliminate the Electoral College stack.
ROVE: Oh! Yes.
HANNITY: And the New Green Deal. So is that - they've already on record on these things. 
ROVE: Yes. And we've got to take each one of these things seriously and go Adam. Three-part attack. This thing is bad policy. It's not in keeping with our values and we, the conservatives have got a better idea. Got to be prepared to do it on all fronts and all from top to bottom. Members of Congress, members of the Senate, governors, state legislatures. Top of the ticket. We got to go. We've got to go out and treat it seriously, don't mock it. Go straight out and explain to the American people how bad it actually is.  HANNITY: Here's my prediction, once the American people see that they did rig the investigation into Hillary, who did violate the law and obstruct justice. Once they see, they tried to impact the 2016 elections, they tried to undo an election. American people have had it and spy on a campaign that's all coming out in detail with evidence. Karl Rove, good to see you, sir.
When we come back, Trace Gallagher has the latest, how prosecutors are reportedly going after Lori Loughlin's daughter now in the college admissions scam. Plus remember, liberals they talk a big game human feces, needles, big problem, San Francisco in Nancy Pelosi's district. We have the evidence. Larry Elder and Dan Bongino.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: By the way, the fake news stereo already started. News Hour Tonight, New York Times alleging Trump's attorneys have consulted with the Attorney General about the contents of the Mueller report.  OL. Let me educate you fake news people, because you're obviously dumb. There is something called executive privilege. The President in this case had a right to exercise it. It's all - they're all over this. It's over.  Another overblown hyped hysteria story by the hate Trump media. Switching gears, new developments tonight in the ongoing scandal surrounding the nationwide college admission scam. Joining us now from our West Coast newsroom is our own Trace Gallagher. Trace 
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, The Daily Mail is reporting that Lori Loughlin's daughter Olivia J. Giannulli got a letter from the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston saying, she was also a subject of the investigation. It's unclear if Loughlin's oldest daughter Isabella also got a letter. But experts say prosecutors are making it very clear, they believe the kids knew about the cheating scandal and were willing participants. And it's hard to imagine the daughters didn't think something was up when they got recruited to be on the University of Southern California, crew team knowing that neither of them had ever rowed.
They also sent pictures on their applications of them in rowing attire, on rowing machines. This is also an indication that the students themselves may face charges. And a source tells People magazine that Lori Loughlin and her husband resent how the case is playing out. "This is putting unspeakable stress on her and her family." They're having to play this all out publicly and they're fair game for jokes and memes, but also outraged by people who are saying that they are cheaters. Of course, if they accept a plea deal or get convict convicted then they are cheaters. Sean.
GALLAGHER: All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you. Another story we're following tonight reports emerging that there is "a surge of homelessness" people beginning to take shelter at the San Francisco airport. By the way, meanwhile sanitary conditions around town are so bad, there is an interactive map now on the Internet of locations to avoid because of human feces on the streets and needles on the streets. Back in January we sent our own investigative reporter Lawrence Jones to talk to San Francisco locals about the state of their city and Nancy Pelosi's district, the Senate and back there next week for an update in case you missed it. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We regret this building right here and the city hall, it's beautiful, nice scenery, and beautiful weather. Kind of makes it a drag when you walk around, you see needles, close to a playground and just feces everywhere. I mean the smell of it all.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do see like lot of needles and feces everywhere.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, the crack, the homeless has become the new normal in San Francisco?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Here is reaction, Nationally Syndicated radio talk show host Larry Elder, Fox News Contributor, former Secret Service Agent, Dan Bongino. Larry, I'll start with you. Let me go to you on the legal question. So, media already is freaking out about the Attorney General. He can't have a press conference tomorrow. Somewhere I read that we have freedom of speech in this country. I read it somewhere and then they're freaking out. Well, Barr talked to the President's lawyers. Is there something called executive privilege that would have applied as it relates to the Mueller report in this case, because the Democrats got rid of the independent counsel law? 
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST: I think so and what they really worry about Sean is that Bill Barr is going to set the agenda. He's going to have a press conference apparently before the report comes out and they don't like what he's going to say, what he's going to say is what he said presumably in that four panel.
HANNITY: And uncle Rod too.
ELDER: That there was no evidence of collusion. No corroboration. No interference with the investigation. Mueller said, apparently that he was never turned down for anything that he wanted. And what the media does not like, the Democrats don't like is that Bill Barr is going to set the table. And those are going to be the talking point that they're going to have to address. That's what they don't want. That's why they're freaking out.
HANNITY: And the only minimal redactions, the White House had the option of exercising executive privilege. Dan, apparently, they chose not to. 
DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Sean, the media has been - the media freak outs have been marked by one thing, they've been wrong about everything. I mean literally everything., I was watching you talk about that Washington Post article before it was shocking that they're finally starting to acknowledge the people on this network have been right but think about it, Larry just hinted at something. They're trying to set up now this, what's Barr hiding. They have no evidence he's hiding anything just like they tried to set up the narrative that Trump was going to fire Mueller. That didn't happen. And they're going to try to set up a narrative that Trump did in fact obstruct justice and it was Barr and Rosenstein that made that go away through some secret cabal. It's all nonsense. They've been wrong about everything. But Sean they're trying to save their reputations that have been flushed down the collective toilet bowl. They've got nothing else to go on.
HANNITY: It's worse than that though. Both of you I'll start with you, Larry. They've been - they've missed the biggest abuse of power. They've missed a rigged investigation and attempt to influence an election with phony Russian lies, an attempt to unseat with an insurance plan, a duly elected President with those lies.
ELDER: Absolutely. And let's not forget the glaring double standard. Hillary clearly should have been prosecuted under the Espionage Act for having that unsecured basement in her server on which she sent and received classified information, lied about it, sent and received information that was stamp classified, lied about that. As you pointed out many times Sean, bleach bit and destroyed 30,000 emails under subpoena. Her lawyer was sitting there with the investigators when she was being interviewed. It is outrageous.
And then for James Comey to stand up there and say she lacked the intent to win the Espionage Act, doesn't even require intent. I mean it's outrageous. This is the double standard that Donald Trump is reacting to and Republicans are reacting to as well they should.
HANNITY: Watch the mob tomorrow. Dan Bongino, you get the last 15 seconds.  BONGINO: Yes, Sean. Mark my words where they're going to have a promise, the woods procedure. In other words, they signed off according to this procedure on the information, the dossier being verified, and it wasn't. They're in a lot of trouble.
HANNITY: A lot of people are going to be investigated, many indictments coming and a lot of information. You won't believe what shady attorney wanted to inject himself in the Jussie Smollett case. Here's a hint, frequent guest of fake news. Our Villain of the Day, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Trace Gallagher back with an update on the Jussie Smollett case. Trace 
GALLAGHER: Sean, it appears Michael Avenatti was close to representing the brothers who Jussie Smollett allegedly paid to help him stage that hate crime hoax, text messages from Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx say, "so Michael Avenatti reached out. Apparently, he's coming into represent the Nigerian brothers in Smollett. I gave him your office number", a staffer replies, thanks.
Avenatti tells law on crime, "I was contacted by the counsel for the brothers and was asked to consider coming into the case to assist them. I ultimately decided not to get involved." It's interesting that Mark Geragos has been representing Jussie Smollett since February.
The text about Avenatti getting involved was March 3rd and three weeks later, Mark Geragos was reportedly a co-conspirator in Avenatti's alleged extortion of Nike. Avenatti says, Eric Gallegos was not a factor in his decision not to represent the Nigerian brothers. Finally, in her text messages, Kim Foxx called singer R. Kelly, a pedophile. Now, Kelly's attorney says, she's labeling him before he's even been tried saying it shows her office is "totally dysfunctional." Sean. 
HANNITY: All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you. Before we go tonight, we want to tune in for Mueller madness tomorrow. We're going to have huge lineup reacting to the Mueller Report. Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani, the great one Mark Levin, Sarah Sanders, Congressman Devin Nunes and much more tomorrow night, 9 Eastern. We'll never be the hate Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is in the swamp, I'm guessing.
