'Off the Record', 11/12/13: I have no sympathy for lawmakers who are now panicking about the Affordable Care Act

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I worry about Americans having adequate access to health care. Americans need help but the help must be smart and work.
As for politicians, I'm furious with some. You send them to Washington to make decisions for you, but they don't bother to read what they're voting for. And if they don't read what they vote on, why do we need them? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I have no sympathy for any struggling politician who is moaning about ObamaCare's effect on his constituents. If politicians were concerned about their constituents - meaning you - then why didn't they bother to read and understand ObamaCare when it could still be fixed before they voted yes? The only surprise from ObamaCare is the glitchy website. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The rest was obvious. It was obvious from day one that many would lose their insurance and funding. Anyone who read the bill, or thought about it, knew it would be a problem and medical device tax problem. That was also there, day one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Health care is important. Politicians should have read the giant bill before they voted. And this is not the first time I'm saying this.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');

        } else {

VAN SUSTEREN: You have no clue what it really means to the American people when it's so important. This isn't naming a park. You have to do the homework and read it. Tonight, here's an idea. Just do it. Just read the bill.
REP. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.: Now they know what's in it. I would love to see some Democrats go on the record. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VAN SUSTEREN: They still haven't read it. Nobody's read that bill. We learned about it as these issues arise. Not every bill is read by everyone, but when it will change how we do things, you ought to read it before you vote on it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

We went back and counted at least 11 times I said that here ON THE RECORD.
It's elementary. Read before you vote. You know what you're voting on. But those lawmakers do not deserve to be sent back to Washington, whoever they are, if they don't do basics - if they don't read and understand what they're voting for - get rid of them. Find someone who will do the job. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
