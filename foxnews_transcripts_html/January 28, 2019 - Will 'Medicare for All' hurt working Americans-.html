LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is "The Ingraham Angle" from Washington tonight.  This is a Fox News Alert breaking out of Houston. Four police officers shot, two in critical condition, two suspects dead. KRIV's Natasha Geigel joins us live on the scene. Natasha, what can you tell us? 
NATASHA GEIGEL, REPORTER: Well, Laura, this all came about because of a neighbor who tipped off police saying that they believe there was drug activity going on in one of the homes that is located behind me here on Harding Street. The police did their investigation and found that they were right that they indeed were selling drugs. Just slip out of the way a little bit, because see, a little bit of activity that is happening here, thankfully, this scene is clear, so it is safe for those residents to return back to their homes. This is as far as we're allowed to go since they are still conducting their investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, this all went down around 4:15 this afternoon. Five narcotics officers went to serve an arrest warrant at the home located at 7800 Harding Street right here in Southeast Houston. The officers announced themselves. That's when two people inside the home started to shoot at them. Four of the officers were struck by bullets, when one of the - and one of the officers was injured. The two suspects were shot and killed here at the scene. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, as I mentioned, we're still trying to unravel all of this, waiting for more updates, those updates are coming from our Police Chief Art Acevedo at Memorial Hermann Hospital, we're of course here at the scene. We've been able to speak with some witnesses who did confirm for us indeed, they noticed a lot of drug activity happening in this area, lots of cars driving through. Thankfully, no one was hurt here.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: All right. We really appreciate it, Natasha. Thanks so much for the update.
Joining me now, Mark Fuhrman, former LAPD detective, Bill Gavin, former Assistant Director, In-Charge of the FBI in New York. Guys, it's great to talk to you on another difficult night for the police, could have been much worse. But what we're learning tonight is more Mark and I want to get you in on this first. This black tar heroin trade, which a lot of folks aren't that up on, but I've learned a lot about it tonight. What it's doing small amounts of cruder heroin and how it's marketed, how it's brought in by the Mexican cartels. Of course, Texas right at the zone of conflict there. What can you tell us Mark? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER LAPD DETECTIVE: Well, this isn't new Laura. Black tar heroin, 30 years ago, we were taking it off the street. And it's just - it's a cycle. When you need to have - when the demand for heroin is high, but the cost is high then the reduced product of heroin is sold to the people that can't afford pure heroin or very high content heroin. So, it's much the same as crack cocaine was a derivative of powder cocaine of which people couldn't afford. So, that's the problem.
And then the second problem you have is, when you have narcotics, you have firearms. And when you have narcotics in an investigation, you have to have the product there when you serve the warrant. So, the suspect and their traffic actually dictate the time and place when you're going to serve the warrant.  INGRAHAM: I want to play for you, Bill. This was Art Acevedo tonight is a police chief in Houston talking about how the neighbors just got fed up with the druggies and the cartel flacks in this neighborhood wreaking havoc on it. That's what he said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ART ACEVEDO, POLICE CHIEF: We could not do what we do without the community we serve. This all began because a neighbor had the courage to say, we're not going to put up. We think that there is dealing dope out of this house and we don't just ignore that. We immediately passed it on to our narcotics division. They began this investigation, was able to actually determine that narcotics dealing, street level narcotics dealing, black tar heroin was being dealt out of this and we know the poison that's killing so many kids not only here in Houston, but around the country. They immediately started an investigation and that's what they were there tonight.  (END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Bill, you see this in so many American communities, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, LA and it all goes back to the same issue. We got people willing to sell these drugs coming across the border. We're going to talk about this later in the hour about how this is not a crisis with a few of our guests, but the police are going in there. A lot of times, they're outgunned.
BILL GAVIN, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, IN-CHARGE, FBI: They certainly are. I think Mark has just nailed it. The bottom line is the most difficult job in the whole world is that police officer who has to make that entry based on the information given to him by great people in the neighborhood. They put their lives in danger, every single time they do something like this, but they go ahead, and they do it anyway. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I listen to the Chief and you know earlier in the day, it was brought out that he has to do the job with more people to protect and less officers to do it. Somebody has to take a look at what's going on in terms of supplying and supporting the police and supporting additional police to do the job that's necessary for that Chief Acevedo to protect the city of Houston.
INGRAHAM: Mark, you have 500,000 more people in the Houston area, 300 fewer police to do this. Now, people are saying that nothing's aren't crises. That sounds like a crisis to me and yet they're still asked to go and serve these warrants. They still get protested by all the usual suspects. They get tired unfairly with police brutality. And no wonder they can't recruit people, or they don't have the budget. They're busting at the seams here. And the frustration from the border, I mean from the police union tonight was also felt in that press conference.  FUHRMAN: Well, when you look at recruitment for the police department, an honorable profession that is taking so much heat and its unjustified heat 99 percent of the time. And then you look at some young man with a college degree looking at the world and what he wants to do, and he goes, why do I want that grief.
So, the ones that do end up there, they have a lot of motivation, they have a lot of heart. And I will say that a narcotics search warrant on an active pad that's dealing narcotics is the one of the most dangerous search warrants you're ever going to serve. The suspects are violent, sometimes they're using their own product. They have weapons and they will respond to officers in a violent way as they did in this and the officers luckily returned fire and killed both suspects. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: And 85 percent or so, this black tar heroin as Mark has been around for a long time, but it's traffic by the Mexican cartels. So, that's what's coming into the contrary. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FUHRMAN: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: And it's about 30 percent crude, Bill. Friends of mine and FBI down in McAllen, Texas, they tell me quite a few stories, disturbing. I mean the brazen nature of these cartels and then we've got Democrats on Capitol Hill saying, no, it's not a problem. We're a nation of immigrants. Yes, we're a nation of immigrants. We shouldn't be a nation that's hospitable to the drug cartels.  GAVIN: It's absolutely crazy, Laura. And I'll tell you what's going to happen out of this. You know, we've got two perps that are dead that shot and wounded four police officers and somebody, I will guarantee you, somebody will make the accusation that the police acted indifferently and killed these two people on purpose. I'm telling you, it's going to happen because this is what our country has emerged into, not protecting and not putting up and not protecting the police officers and standing up for what they really believe in, and the horror that the police officers has to face every single day of their lives doing something like this. Mark is right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: You'll find a plaintiff's lawyer, who will be willing to file that lawsuit.
GAVIN: Absolutely. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: You'll have the immunity claims, but it'll tie people up, because you invariably will have a wrongful death claim even if it's in the case like this where they're trafficking narcotics. You know it's only going to happen. By the way, last year Mark and this is after one year of decline. Last year in the United States, a 144 police officers were killed in the line of duty. 52 were killed by gunfire. That's a big number. That's a lot of people dead and where are the movies - think of all the movies made. All the SAG Awards, all the Hollywood and not enough movies made about police officers who were brave and not getting paid a lot and getting protested and still showing up every day and now they die--  FUHRMAN: You know Laura, when you have that number, that number is shocking all by itself, but you have to remember in the last 30 years, law enforcement has evolved in the equipment and the method that they approach investigations and even traffic stops with all the technology that they have and all the different types of weapons and all the different types of weapons and all the different types of surveillance equipment. And you have these many officers killed in the line of duty. I mean that is huge. It should be a third of what it was 30 years ago, not three times as much.

INGRAHAM: And over the weekend, there were a pair of stories that demonstrate just how intense the Left is on rewriting ethical codes and conscripting what can and can't be said. Democrats move left and eat their own. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.
In the 20 years that I've been covering our border issues, it was always at least one point of agreement on both sides of the issue. That new immigrants should work hard to speak English, because doing so would help ensure their success here and also speed up assimilation.

TOM BROKAW, JOURNALIST: I also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder assimilation. That's one of the things I've been saying for a long time. They ought not to be just kind of fight in their communities, but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English and that they feel comfortable in their communities. And that's going to take outreach on both sides frankly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: How dare he say that speak English in their - fierce outrage poured in almost instantaneously, especially from the 2020 herd seeking an edge in the radical beauty pageant. Congressman Joaquin Castro is tweeting to Brokaw. Tom Brokaw for a celebrated NBC News journalist who spent years chronicling American society, you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country. Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary.  And that's not all folks. It got worse both on and offline for Brokaw.

INGRAHAM: Well, this is how bad it's gotten in the Democrat party though. Of course, a lot many Latinos have assimilated. But the main point here is English has become controversial. Assimilation in some quarters has become controversial. So, to be an authentic, credible Democrat today, you have to believe that the party's views of just a few years ago are now basically racist, xenophobic and hateful.

This is insane. Now, something similar unfolded at Duke University over the weekend as well. The politically correct fanatics and academia put another trophy on the wall when Assistant Professor Meghan Neely, who headed up the University's Biostatistics Master's program was forced to step down from her post this weekend. Her crime in an email, well, she sent to grad students last Friday. And in it she said two faculty members had come up to her to complain about students loudly speaking Chinese in a common area.
So, she wrote that both were disappointed that the students weren't working to improve their English. Neely's big sin was urging them to quote, commit to speaking English 100 percent of the time while on campus, perish the thought.

Again, it wasn't a slam on Chinese, it was kind of a ham-fisted way of encouraging folks to speak our language while in our country, studying by the way at one of our premier universities.

        }
      
Now, it was ultimately to help the students compete for projects and employment. Why is that a bad thing? The horror. Again, the accused profusely apologized for her language offense. But it didn't matter. The damage was already done.
Now look as I've said many times, I speak Russian, I speak English, speak English most of the time, speak Spanish. It's terrific for kids to speak multiple languages. Being bilingual, trilingual, that gives kids a huge leg up in this economy and a lot of options. But at the same time, English is our national language. And folks who want to come here legally should learn to speak it.
There is nothing racist about saying that at all, unless Obama, George W., and pretty much every American President is also racist. And if an American who is shopping in a store gets impatient when a cashier can't speak English, that doesn't necessarily make the patron a xenophobe or a bad person. They're frustrated.

You know what I was thinking today, what would Teddy Roosevelt think today. Remember what he said so eloquently in a letter read shortly before his death that he had written in 1919. He said in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on exact equality with everyone else. There can be no divided allegiance here. We have room for but one language here and that is the English language for we intend to see that crucible turns our people out as Americans of American nationality and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house.
I want to become just a polyglot boarding house. It's not just though that the English language requirement can set off today's Democrat conformity police, not just that. Even a two term Vice President isn't immune. Biden, Joe Biden was rapped last week for daring to say a nice thing about a Republican.

Now, continuing even a famous comedian is forced to play by the shifting rules of the left today. Remember when it was announced that Kevin Hart was going to be the host of the Academy Awards.

So, that is great news for the Houston Police Officers community and all of Texas, and frankly, everyone in the United States. So, that's great news.
As you've heard in The Angle, the Left are moving the goalposts once again on speech and policy. The latest skirmish is over whether assimilation for immigrants is a good thing and whether they should practice English as U.S. residents.
Joining me now for reaction is Republican Strategist, Alfredo Rodriguez and Immigration Attorney, Gunther Sanabria. It's great to have both of you with us.
Guys, I said in The Angle that I love languages. I do a decent job of speaking Spanish, although I was embarrassing myself during the break. My Russian is probably better. But I love languages. I took them some fourth grade on and think it's a huge help for kids to speak multiple languages.

At the same time, why is it now an offense for Tom Brokaw, Gunther to say, people should do a better job of assimilating. Why is that a sin for which he must apologize and frankly, it was embarrassing for a man with a career like Brokaw. Putting aside all the other stuff that was he was accused of last year, but embarrassing for him to prostrate himself on this issue of speaking English?  GUNTHER SANABRIA, IMMIGRANT ATTORNEY: Because it is offensive, it fails to recognize whether Latinos have been doing all these years. We have candidates in politics. We have Ph.D. We have professors.
INGRAHAM: He wasn't talking about them.
SANABRIA: Exactly. But it's just how he said it and who he is. That is the problem. We need to be a bit more conscious. The Latino community have done a lot in this country. We have been here for many years. I'm Latino myself. I'm an immigrant. So, let's not forget what he means and especially at this time.  INGRAHAM: But do you actually think that - Tom Brokaw is about as liberal as they get. I mean I've heard Tom Brokaw trash you know the likes of Fox News, Talk Radio for being anti-immigrant. I mean I've got three immigrants living in my house. OK. I'm all pro-immigrant. So, people tell me that I just laugh at them. But he's so "tolerant", greatest generation. That guy has an amazing career. And when they throw Tom Brokaw on the fire, I think this has gone crazy now.
SANABRIA: Even more reason, because who he is. He has a microphone. He has the ability. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: So, you can't say assimilate?
SANABRIA: Some people can. Some people cannot.
INGRAHAM: Do you think everybody assimilates in the country? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SANABRIA: I think somebody - everybody tries, everybody tries to do better.  INGRAHAM: Not everybody tries. No way. Spend some time in Northern Virginia, not everybody tries.  SANABRIA: Everybody comes to the United States for one reason to live better. All the immigrants come to the United States to live better.
INGRAHAM: I didn't doubt that.
SANABRIA: And that means learning English. That means working. It's just how he put it and how he ignored who we are and what we do in this country.  INGRAHAM: Alfredo, Tom Brokaw, now the latest victim of the PC hit squad and their ranks are going to get smaller and smaller and smaller. Kevin Hart's out, you've got Biden criticized for saying, it's good to work with the Republicans. Now Brokaw's thrown on the funeral pyre.  ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, first let me say how extremely sad it is that the left has so perverted our political discourse that now any time you disagree with them, you're immediately labeled a racist or a bigot. It's truly unconscionable.
Second, Tom Brokaw is absolutely right. Whether you're Latino or any other ethnicity, you ought to assimilate into American society. You ought to learn English. You ought to embrace American values. Now that doesn't mean that you need to relinquish your heritage. It doesn't mean that you can't be bilingual. It simply means that if you choose to emigrate to the United States, if you choose to live in the United States, you ought to embrace American values learn English rather than isolate yourself and reject those values.  INGRAHAM: Yes, but everyone said that. I mean Obama said that. Bush said that. This was what everyone said even if they disagreed on policy like you've got to learn English, learn our history, we don't want to be a polyglot boarding house that's going back to Teddy, Teddy Roosevelt. But his point is, it's not just a place to come to work. America is an ideal. It's an idea of freedom and liberty. And part of that freedom comes from having commonality. We have no foundation, except I'm going to come here to make a buck. That's not enough. That's not going to hold us together long- term. Language is important, it doesn't mean other languages aren't great. And I happen to love the Spanish language. But you've got to have more than that. Otherwise society starts to crumble. That's my view.
I want to look at the screen here just so people have a sense of where we're going in this country. U.S. residents who speak a foreign language at home. Very interesting. In 1980, 11 percent of U.S. residents spoke a foreign language at home. It went up every decade. It's now doubled in 2017 to 21.8 percent.
Gunther, in addition, 67 million people according to the U.S. Census do not speak English at home. 48 percent of residents speak a foreign language at home in America's five largest cities. 85 cities, in which a majority of residents spoke a foreign language at home in 2017, 85.
SANABRIA: I mean those numbers are affected by the number of immigrants in the United States. 1980's, we have the amnesty that allowed 3 million people become citizens, but-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: That is now 20 million.
SANABRIA: Roughly 20 million. So, that is affected by those numbers. But again, back to Tom Brokaw. He said something the wrong way, OK. No immigrant understands better than myself.
INGRAHAM: Do immigrant activists ever say anything the wrong way? I mean I hear them on television, but they say the most outrageous things like well American history is racist. The founding is racist. You're living on stolen land. I mean they accuse us of--
SANABRIA: Two wrongs don't make it right. And I'm not saying, they don't. Sometimes they do and I correct them.
INGRAHAM: But what did Tom Brokaw said that was wrong?
SANABRIA: Is how, he said--
INGRAHAM: What, specifically, what did he say that was wrong? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

SANABRIA: He assumed we don't assimilate to the United States.
INGRAHAM: No, he said, Hispanics have to - I think he said Hispanics to do a better job.
SANABRIA: A better job, exactly.
INGRAHAM: Of assimilating. But he said, because it's good for their communities and we should all both sides need to do a better job.
SANABRIA: But it's the way he is saying it, He's ignoring what they--
INGRAHAM: I'm still not getting it. The way he's saying it. What do you mean?
SANABRIA: Well, a lot of people are not going to get it. And the Latinos, we get it.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: We are committed to ending illegal immigration. But we are equally committed to allowing people the right to earn their way to become an American citizen if they work hard, play by the rules, learn English, and avoid criminality.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have never required that for a permanent resident.  It is a higher standard.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: All right, well, from Menendez to Dick Durbin -- Dick Durbin said, give them a chance to earn their way into citizenship, learning English and the basics, which that was the best bite, the basics of American history. That is Dick Durbin. But I'm telling you, Gunther, I think immigrant activists would actually serve themselves and their cause if they said, that's a great point. Let's learn American history. That's not trash it.
SANABRIA: It's not an issue to learn English. To become a citizen, you have to take a test. And the test is in English, and the test is about American history. That's a fact.
INGRAHAM: But Univision, and so forth, Univision, which is pretty well produced, by the way, but Univision, Telemundo, they have made it much easier to live in the United States, as have English people living abroad in Europe. You've got English speaking TV, you've Spanish speaking television, right?
SANABRIA: It's out culture. Because it's our culture, and we need it.

SANABRIA: I see them evolving. There's a lot of people for my country, from Peru, that came to America, and I see their Latino culture evolving.  They mix food, American food with Peruvian food. They change --
INGRAHAM: I'm hungry now, thanks. Thanks a lot.
SANABRIA: They change their styles, they change their education, they learn Peruvian history, the American history. I think it makes a much broader community when we accept what the Hispanic community means in America, and not just disregard what it means, and say they need to assimilate.
INGRAHAM: Disregarding -- I think it's very -- it's like when you come to someone's house, if you didn't live here and you come here, and you are expected, just like you have rules in your house.
SANABRIA: Exactly.
INGRAHAM: A visitor, I come in your house, if you like people to take their shoes off. I don't take my shoes off. You're like Ingraham, get you shoes off. All right, it's your house.

SANABRIA: But if you come to my house, if you don't like broccoli, I won't give you broccoli. I will let you eat whatever you want. I will let you eat your food if you want to. And if you don't like my food, it's OK. But my point is, he should not dismiss what we are, especially at this time, Laura. We are talking --
INGRAHAM: Brokaw is literally so liberal. He is so pro-immigration, immigrant. I just think you guys start to lose your credibility if Tom Brokaw is now basically considered racist.
SANABRIA: Where's the line then? Where's the line. Today, it's Hispanics. Tomorrow it's African-Americans. It's always the minorities.
INGRAHAM: First of all, they are almost not a minority in California.  Hispanics are almost a majority.
SANABRIA: And in 25 years, we won't be a minority.
INGRAHAM: Right. So then what is -- 
SANABRIA: We'll wait and see what happens.

INGRAHAM: OK, yes, OK. All right, do we have Alfredo back, yes? Alfredo, we lost you for a moment.
ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I'm sorry.
INGRAHAM: Did you just disappear, Alfredo? So you can respond to this idea that everyone has to welcome the Hispanic experience and their perspectives, and that makes for a better country. If it's a melting pot, I would agree. It does make a much better country. But the melting some people are concerned is not happening.
RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely. Everybody remembers John Edwards two Americas. It seems that the left today wants to embrace two Americas. They want to embrace in America with a certain group of individuals who wish to enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that America offers, yet wish to isolate themselves, not learn English, and refuse to embrace American values.
And then you have another set of individuals who not only celebrate and appreciate the freedom and opportunity that America offers, but they in turn make positive contributions to their community and to their society.  The left would have you think that assimilation is some harmful, nefarious medical procedure, and it's not. Assimilation doesn't mean you need to relinquish her heritage. It doesn't mean you can't celebrate the traditions of your ethnicity. It simply means that you learn English, you embrace American values, and if you choose to live in United States, why wouldn't you do that anyways? Otherwise, what's the point of living here?
INGRAHAM: I was talking to friends the other day, Italian immigrants, born in Italy. They were like, we came here, we still speak Italian, but we're Americans. Our families encourage us to speak English. It wasn't an idea that you were going to start trashing American history, or criticizing -- America allowed you to come in. So we are grateful, we're grateful to be here. That is a great immigrant story. And I think we love immigrants to come here and be part of the great American experience. But the English thing, I think they're going to lose support with this English thing.
RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely.

INGRAHAM: And Tom Brokaw did not deserve that. But I love having the conversation. Thank you, both, Gunther and Alfredo, thank you so much both for coming on.
And coming up, Democrats are very excited about Kamala Harris. Could she be the next, well, kind of Obama 2.0? And coming up, we'll expose some of the damaging plans she has for Americans, you bet, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I am running to declare once and for all that health care is a fundamental right.
(APPLAUSE)
HARRIS: And we will deliver that right with Medicare for all.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It sounds so good. We've been telling you that we're going to keep an eye on the Democratic 2020 candidates and their radical ideas that could harm working Americans. Not could. Would. The star of tonight's edition is none other than Kamala Harris.
And Senator Harris, who announced her candidacy for the Democratic ticket for president in 2020 this weekend, is running to finish what Obama started. She is promising free everything. But what does this mean for America? And how well her Medicaid for all agenda impact you and your health care? The long lines of the Canadian health care service in our future.
Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui. He's the CEO Foxhall Cardiology, and he's one of the premier cardiologists, frankly, in the world. Dr. Oskoui, great to have you on. Explain for the layman why this fantasy of Medicare for all will be harmful to the practice of health care and their health care.
DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: I'll keep it very simple.  Let's use the analogy of a supermarket. It buys wholesale milk for $3 a gallon and sells it to the consumer for $1. The doctor is the farmer, they consumer is the customer. What happens? Customer is happy, the doctor is happy. But eventually the store goes bankrupt because it is only selling the milk for 30 percent of what it costs.
That's exactly what is going on with Medicare. Medicare taxes, over the lifetime of patients who pay in, only cover 30 percent of the current costs. And that is not a conservative talking point. That is actually the data from the Urban Institute, a very liberal think tank in Washington.  Everyone is happy, but we are not paying for it. We are simply putting it on a credit card. And as F. Scott Fitzgerald said so elegantly, how did you go broke? He said, at first, very slowly. In the end, very quickly.
INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, isn't it the case that if it's Medicare for all, there will be theoretical access to care, whatever we call that, but there will be a two-tiered health care system. The very wealthy will be able to go around this whole system, go to their concierge care, pay out-of-pocket huge amounts of money if necessary to go to a doctor who will not be part of this. Won't that ultimately happen? So this idea of egalitarianism in health care, that is out the window.
OSKOUI: I think you are absolutely correct. That's already starting to happen now. But as everybody gets pinched because the system simply can't afford to do this. Remember, when you bring even more people in, it's going to bankrupt even faster. Eventually, we'll all going to be the V.A., except the 0.1 percent who can afford concierge doctors.
INGRAHAM: Doctor, thank you very much. We're going to be covering this as this campaign goes on because the fantasy will be exploded through facts.
And a newly released survey revealing that 61 percent of American millennials -- that is ages between 18 and 24 -- have a positive reaction to the word "socialism," beating out capitalism at 58 percent. Of course, they do, when they hear free health care, free college, without understanding anything about who pays for it.
Joining me now, someone who knows a thing or two about capitalism, Andy Puzder. He's the former CEO of CKE Restaurants and the author of "The Capitalist Comeback." Andy, this is terrifying. When you hear the YouTube generation comment about socialism, it's kind of all a fad. It is the cool crowd, the in crowd, why not? You don't have a heart, money is not that important. It's about love and tolerance are getting along, until you're Tom Brokaw and then you're thrown in the fire. What do we need to do here to turn this around?
ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CKE RESTAURANTS CEO: It is terrifying, it's not surprising. The problem here is misconceptions about capitalism and socialism that are really taught as the truth in our progressively controlled education system. What we really need to do is change the perceptions. Capitalism is not based on greed. Socialism is not based on benevolence. When you are talking about capitalism, you are talking about a system where the way you succeed is by meeting the needs of other people.  If you are in business in America, the way that you get ahead is by satisfying the needs of your consumers. Look at your grocery store. It's all products where entrepreneurs are trying to get your attention so they can provide you what you want at a price you can afford. So that really takes the desire to improve your life and expands it out other people.
INGRAHAM: But when Republicans say, look at Venezuela, that is not enough.  I keep telling my Republican friends, don't just say, do you want to become Venezuela? Because I'm sorry, but most millennials don't have a good grasp on even what is happening in Venezuela. If it's not a top-of-the-line on their Facebook or their Instagram, it's not going to be something you delve into in any depth.
PUZDER: Which is why I think we need to let millennials know, socialism is really based on greed. Even if you look at countries like Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, if you are standing in a food line --
INGRAHAM: I like that.
PUZDER: -- you're not really thinking about what the person in front of you or behind you needs or wants. What you are thinking about is how you get the most for yourself from a limited supply that the government makes available. That is true with health care, too. If you are waiting in line for health care, you're not worried about the next guy's health care.  You're worried about your health care. And the way you get more in a socialist society is by pleasing the people in power, who always looked -- look at Kim Jong-un in North Korea. People are starving. They can't find food. Does it look like that guy has missed a meal? Or Maduro in Venezuela.
INGRAHAM: Don't fat shame him.
PUZDER: It doesn't look like Maduro has been killing his pets to eat or selling garbage to survive. These are government officials, they do very well in a socialist system that's based on greed, not a capitalist system where you get ahead by meeting other people's needs.
INGRAHAM: What would you say to Trump right now? If you want to bring more young people into more of a conservative populist movement, what do you do?
PUZDER: I think the first thing we need to do is do a better job of messaging the president's wonderful economic accomplishments. I don't think those are getting through to people. They're certainly not getting through to millennials.
INGRAHAM: Where is his cabinet. Where is Ben Carson? I love Ben Carson.  You never see Ben Carson.
PUZDER: He's a great guy. He should be on TV all time. He is a great communicator.
INGRAHAM: Great. But I want to see Ben Carson more. I want to see -- where is Perry, Governor Perry? You never see him either. Where is the cabinet?
PUZDER: Or even Larry Kudlow --
INGRAHAM: I love Larry Kudlow.
PUZDER: Get Larry on TV. There are people who can convey this message, there should convey it. There's great news. There hasn't been an economic surge like this maybe in my lifetime but certainly since Reagan.
INGRAHAM: Andy, if the socialists get their way, they are coming for your wallet. They are coming for your wallet.
PUZDER: They're coming for your wallet.
INGRAHAM: They're coming for your wallet, your money and your decisions and your freedom.
PUZDER: And your freedom.
INGRAHAM: It's got to be simple messaging a la Reagan and beyond. Andy, come back soon. We're going to be exploding these months all year long, so we want you back regularly.
PUZDER: Thanks, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Coming up, the shutdown is over, but we still don't have a wall.  Of course not. Caravans are on the way.
And a new report reveals a convicted terrorist just took control of a drug cartel right at the U.S. border. Congressman Mark Meadows and Obama's former border chief join us next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Breitbart News is reporting that Hector Raul Luna, a convicted terrorist who attacked the U.S. consulate with a grenade and an automatic rifle fire, he has taken over a dangerous cartel near the Nuevo Laredo, Texas, metropolitan border area. Now, this area of the southern border is the only urban location along the entire U.S.-Mexico border that doesn't have any fencing or security barrier whatsoever. And we are less than three weeks away from another possible government shutdown.
Joining me now is Mark Morgan, a former border patrol chief under President Obama, and along with Republican Congressman Mark Meadows from North Carolina, Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. So Mark, let me begin with you. What options does the president actually have, and what about your reaction to this story that this man, who targeted U.S. citizens, is now operating this cartel right at that border?
MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF UNDER OBAMA: Laura, I'm glad you bring this to the attention of the American people, and I hope they are paying attention, because this should illustrate to them that the cartels are alive and well and they are absolutely a threat to this country. And after 9/11, we learned a lot. One of the things we learned is that as a law enforcement, as a government, we cannot just be reactive in nature. We have to be proactive in preventing something. And that is exactly what the president's plan does. The wall is -- we cannot be reactive. We have to be proactive. So are we going to wait until a terrorist cell comes across and between the ports and does something bad to the American people before we decide we need a wall? It doesn't make sense.
INGRAHAM: Barack Obama back in 2006, I was watching this old video tonight, and he said -- actually, let's play the snippet of it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Because we live in an age where terrorists are challenging our borders, we cannot allow people to pour into the U.S. undetected, undocumented, and unchecked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Congressman Meadows, are we supposed to believe in 2006 when he was talking about terrorists pouring over our border, and now it's all solved? Are you kidding me? How do Democrats look at themselves in the mirror? That's President Obama. I'm like, that could be President Trump today. But everything, just as I said in "The Angle," everything is shifting. They are going far, far left, and we are supposed to cheer and be like, this is all lovely, everything is free and open borders and it's all going to be dandy.
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: And the casualty is a safety our communities. But no, it hadn't gotten better. In fact, we have four caravans. You've got more that are starting.
INGRAHAM: Why shouldn't they come?
MEADOWS: The lead in that you talked about in terms of the connections, it was just -- the horrific, graphic details of what they've done in terms of dumping bodies and body parts all over. Listen, we've got to get this right. We have to make sure that guys in his profession have operational control of the border. Let's trust our border patrol chiefs to tell Congress what should be the priority. And let's allocate the money. So hopefully we will.
INGRAHAM: They are not going to do it. Nancy Pelosi will not give one thin red dime -- no, thin dime to the border, it's not going to happen, so the president is going to have to declare a national emergency, correct?
MEADOWS: And he might have to. But I will say there have been a lot of good discussions, and I think if we get away from the wall, the concrete wall discussions, strategic border barriers, strategic fencing in certain areas, I can tell you --
INGRAHAM: What does that mean?
MEADOWS: I think what it is, is really border barriers that may not be constructed out of concrete but out of steel -
INGRAHAM: He's already said that.
MEADOWS: He has said that.
INGRAHAM: But the sensors on drones, every time I hear sensors and drones, you are not serious.
MEADOWS: Listen, it is like having your front door open. If you have a lock on it, you have to have a front door. Would you just have a camera on your front door and say, anybody can come in, and we're going to monitor that? We've got to be serious about it. But I can say that the president is willing to act. I talked to him a number of times over the weekend. He is willing to act. He's wanting to make sure that we do not provide amnesty. I think that was the big cry that you heard, I heard on Friday.  He said, no, what we want to do is secure our border first.
INGRAHAM: Well, when we look at this, and we see, Mark, people on the left claiming racism. They say that Tom Brokaw is now a racist and a xenophobe for talking about assimilation into America. That's something everyone always agreed upon. Immigrants -- we always focus on Hispanic immigrants because they are so numerous, and we love our Hispanic legal immigrants, great people. But people from all over the world have always come here and understand that you have your culture, my mother had her polish culture, we loved it. But you come and you become part of the American experience.
But the Americans experience is now considered toxic because the founding of the country is considered by many on the far left to be racist. When that's the case, all bets are off. That is a scary place for a country to be. Close it out.
MORGAN: It is. We talk about the wall, the argument -- the discussion is so fast, Laura, it goes right to you are a racist if you are for protecting this country. So if I want to stop bad people from coming in and doing bad things to the citizens, if I want to stop drugs coming in to leading to 60,000 drug overdoses, I'm a racist. That's unbelievable to me. And we have to stop that.
INGRAHAM: You need more than the president and you, excuse me, and a few others out there. We need the whole cabinet has got to be out there supporting him. And I hope Mitch McConnell is watching tonight because we need to be out there supporting the president's agenda, as well. Thank you both for being here tonight. We're going to be tracking this all year long, and there's going to be new developments night by night. Stay right there. We'll be right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite.
Think back to you when you were a teenager. What was the most embarrassing thing your mom could do?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come on, get out of the car.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, no. That's during a snow storm. That is tragic and it's Backstreet Boys.
