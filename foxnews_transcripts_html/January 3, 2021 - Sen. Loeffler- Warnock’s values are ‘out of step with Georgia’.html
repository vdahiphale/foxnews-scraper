We are live from Georgia International Plaza for the battle forthe Senate.Two runoff races two days from now that will determine the balance of powerin Washington. If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,their party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Ifeither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, MitchMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Bidenadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already casttheir votes in these crucial races.Meantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy ofGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,we'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator KellyLoeffler.But first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on thecampaign trail -- Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, early voting data showsRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's wherePresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run upthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, avisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)OSSOFF:  But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the nextchapter in American history.DOOCY (voice-over):  Republican candidates agree, but for differentreasons.LOEFFLER:  We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we'regoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.DOOCY:  In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat RaphaelWarnock.LOEFFLER:  Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered forinvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.DOOCY:  Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.WARNOCK:  Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should besitting in that seat.DOOCY:  And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantiningafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusingDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.PERDUE:  This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involvedwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.DOOCY:  Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.OSSOFF:  We have two United States senators who, when they learned aboutthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first callwas to their broker.(END VIDEOTAPE)DOOCY (on camera):  Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people thatthey come across. For example, yesterday at a campus launch, organizerssent volunteers away with this chant. "Door knock for Warnock, vote yourOss-off" -- Bret.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  All right. Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.Joining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.Good morning, Senator. Welcome to "FOX News Sunday."SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA):  Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.BAIER:  We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, onas well. He declined.Thank you for being here.It's a little cold for Atlanta.LOEFFLER:  That's okay, it's going to warm up.BAIER:  Yeah, that's right.Senator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- weare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 millionGeorgians have already voted.Where did you and your team see this race right now?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to getout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is onthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast betweenthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, governmentcontrol.We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was goingto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda isnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-runhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents ofchange.Radical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that wouldfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.BAIER:  We are going to talk about that in a minute.Are you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoingchallenge to the election?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to knowthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure thatthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.But from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over thelast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that inearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffsand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see arecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will winif our voters turnout.BAIER:  This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten otherRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator JoshHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn'tan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not onthat list.Why not?LOEFFLER:  Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,and I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia andall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objectiveright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottomof what happened in these elections.We know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's whatwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.He's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.BAIER:  So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, hetweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here inGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal andinvalid.Do you agree with that?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came downto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for DavidPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.He's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going totell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, becausethis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.We won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose thefuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish thefilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raiseour taxes, and the list goes on.Georgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.BAIER:  But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, butJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you saywhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybespecifically from Georgia?LOEFFLER:  Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one ofthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for thispresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are goingto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking veryclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.BAIER:  Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have calledthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.Senators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasinga statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.They failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated incourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. Iacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, hadirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won thiselection.Is he right?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a waythat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's whatI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.But the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win onTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that nextstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,and then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for howthese elections were handled.BAIER:  But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturnany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?LOEFFLER:  Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 openinvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen toomuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.(CROSSTALK)BAIER:  And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases thathave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, wherethey haven't found that evidence.LOEFFLER:  Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.We need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because theintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protectthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,and that's what I'm looking at right now.This is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.BAIER:  Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On thecampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you knowyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack onyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  When she heard about thecoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her ownwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 millionworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he saysover and over again on the trail?LOEFFLER:  Well, this is a political attack that has been completelydebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.The mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassedbecause it's completely debunked.BAIER:  So it didn't happen?LOEFFLER:  Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,this is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer fortheir radical policies to change America.The radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are thathe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. Hewas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. Hewon't answer those questions.That's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'mhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounceMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attackedour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.He said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised FidelCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is outof step with Georgia's values.BAIER:  A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump mayhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to notsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Thenby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which hethen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which youoriginally supported and voted for.Why didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.He's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in themilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and ournational security.But, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure thatGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matterif we don't win on the 5th.Look, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.Raphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding themilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run healthcare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.That's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'mfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.BAIER:  Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying howimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a bigdefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.How would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came outof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don'tknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue tostand with our men and women in the military.Raphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. Hesaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.BAIER:  Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's vetoon the NDAA?LOEFFLER:  Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.Those are what's on the ballot right now.I'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largeststate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have foughtfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we aregoing to continue to do that.But if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded andworse.BAIER:  I won't belabor it but that's not a "yes" or "no" whether you wouldsustain the veto or not.LOEFFLER:  That's right.BAIER:  OK, you're not answering that.Listen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said votersin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimitedpower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote tokill the filibuster.What do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?LOEFFLER:  Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to takeGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.He's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, itwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he wouldabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally changethis country, pack the Supreme Court.My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questionsabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court withliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule oflaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everythingthat's under attack right now by the left.So we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, wewon't get a second chance.BAIER:  Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.This is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of theU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militiasinside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forcesare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.What should the response be if that happens?LOEFFLER:  Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he'smade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for thefirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerousJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.So we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's ourfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to thispresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.BAIER:  And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.Senator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank youvery much for your time.LOEFFLER:  Thank you, Bret.BAIER:  Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.Up next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake inthese runoffs.Plus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on tocontest the election results -- as "FOX News Sunday" continues from theGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,many of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not beenheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak upfor my constituents in this process.SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  This is just grossly responsible by SenatorHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in ourdemocratic process.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object tocertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday andthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.It's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman JasonChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for "The Wall StreetJournal", and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.Jason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOPsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point andelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority toconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputedstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify achange in their vote if needed.Your thoughts on this move?JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Look, if they're going to askCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's noreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.That's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates andI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House whoare concerned about it.Now, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but Idon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, becausethere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated andlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the Houseare doing.BAIER:  Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answerwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,Attorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not seeenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressureis still on Trump allies.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Look, let's just take thevarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and assuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, theRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the peoplechoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people'sright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.This is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it'sshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.Why not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as youpointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this andfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of theseelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities mighthave existed.Nothing that would change the results of the election, but it doesundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to thecredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If theDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.BAIER:  Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?CATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, Bret. I think you'reabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and Housemembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.What we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these membersare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from theirconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,taking a stand and defending the president and we know the president hasbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wantingpeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in thecourts.And so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sortof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you'reseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they areup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024and how this might play for them then.BAIER:  Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the voteseventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6theventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it'swritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.CHAFFETZ:  Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will gothere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there aremillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fairand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they expressthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?I don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,you know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for usas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't thinkit will pass.BAIER:  Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others aresaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this isin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this andthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any onejudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.CHAFFETZ:  But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congressand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States ofAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.They actually posed this question to Congress.And so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want toobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's notjust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.BAIER:  All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we dothink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicansgoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and tocome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for theparty?WILLIAMS:  I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at thisjuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as youmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.Well, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sortof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? Idon't get it.But he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to sayas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal toPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out anyagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulusspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president'sveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellowRepublicans.So, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look atthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's aboutRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't thinkthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing tochallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you'retalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracytheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about Americanpolitics when it doesn't go our way.BAIER:  Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president cantake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.Panel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.Coming up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus aboutwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strangebedfellows.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Trump is right in saying that's not enough. Weneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on thisissue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the reliefchecks stand next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.This afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in andlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who hasserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but herpath to victory is a narrow one.Joining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, HakeemJeffries.Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.BAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.What do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think dividedgovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all theHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of thelegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?JEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Bidenis the next president of the United States of America, believing that hehas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy toaddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.Joe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, asthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, isgoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for himand those who didn't.And here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as wellas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf ofthe American people.BAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed forthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosiwill lose?JEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United StatesHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name intonomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House DemocraticCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she'sdone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leaderthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials andtribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, hashelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing inthat capacity.BAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but howdoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,and steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow pathbecause of the votes that you have?JEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House DemocraticCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believein the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, theaspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with theUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tentapproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people isincredibly important.We've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over thelast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issueslike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First StepAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the UnitedStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreementthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with PresidentTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the Americanpeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as hepushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.And so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in apractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. Thatapplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. Thatapplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's aRepublican or a Democrat.BAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --the House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules packagefor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena andinvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, "he" or "she"would become "member" or "delegate" or "resident commissioner." "Father"and "mother" would become "parent," while "brother" and "sister" wouldbecome "sibling."Are these the things that are the priority going after the Trumpadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk aboutgender-neutral terms?JEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crushthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans whoare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good ofeveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first100 days. That will continue to be our focus.This is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a centurycontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And sothat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focusover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadlypandemic behind us.BAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?JEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of governmentat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's aDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And wehave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on anyexecutive branch.I wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward withrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.When we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with ourconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we tookthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to befocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health carechallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring goodpaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be ourguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden andKamala Harris to build back better for the people.BAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutrallanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from theelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking theywere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that saythey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that thisis an example of that. How would you respond to that?JEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusiveas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the Houseat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,that would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason whywe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, sixyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think thatthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the mostinclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possibleway of the American people.BAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the directpayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,beginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then thenegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this neweffort to get more direct payments.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate Americareceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic.I would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and theywill be going out soon.Who is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnelland the Senate Republicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 directpayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was beingheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin andSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.So people looking at that scratch their heads.JEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is thatMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust tothe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in theHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those directpayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting ina tremendous way.Now, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democraticside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth ofdebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1percent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was notgood public policy in my humble opinion.I think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we'reproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be partof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and theafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That'swhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join theAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many HouseRepublicans in getting this done.BAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on thisholiday weekend. Happy New Year.JEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.BAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with theBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to thecritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats andRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what canhappen in government.SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men andwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'llappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member JackReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of thedefense spending bill.And we're back with our panel.Catherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heardSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do aboutthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.As you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more aboutcontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?CATHERINE LUCEY, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Yes, it was interesting, Bret,how senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,obviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need PresidentTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicansknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a hugeturnout for Election Day.I think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it wasa notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we'veseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot ofsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest theelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to dothat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buckhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisanpiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concernedabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.BAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of theSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently afterJanuary 20th.JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,the margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or twosenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. Andeven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her lifeto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,but she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But everysingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that andreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.I think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislationif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservativemove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.BAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, thatthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates toget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? Imean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of themoderates?CHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderatesactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the partyhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, "thesquad," and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over thebarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, underNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.BAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday andhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the twoand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two andits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that MitchMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block muchof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,these radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold ofthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may haveto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderatesbecause his margins are smaller.On the House side, I think that's also the case.Now, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or notshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether ornot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. Butshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, evenwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be avery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmerRepublican majority in the Senate.BAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's goingto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four membersshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.LUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we moveforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on theidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he hasrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go backa very long way.But he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,you know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- youknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities andparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remainsto be seen.BAIER: Yes,And, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?CHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I thinkRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but getout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicanshave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --the wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousandlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Dothey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.BAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show upbecause they're angry?CHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.I think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You'veeven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. Butthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the bigconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.Every vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or theother.BAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all. We'll see you nextSunday.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week."
