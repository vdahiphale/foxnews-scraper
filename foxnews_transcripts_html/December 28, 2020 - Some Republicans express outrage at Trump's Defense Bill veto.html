BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Emily. I think that was GregGutfeld dancing there, thank you. Good evening. Welcome to watching, I'mBret Baier.Breaking tonight, just moments ago, the House voted to give strugglingAmericans $2,000 checks to replace the $600 relief checks. The presidentsigned into law late Sunday after leaving many wondering what he would do.The House is also after that vote to provide the $2,000 is also now workingtowards overriding the president's veto of the National DefenseAuthorization Act. The Democrats are depending on Republican cooperation toaccomplish both.We have Fox team coverage, Rich Edson with the presidential wish list forcuts from Congress. But begin with Chief Congressional Correspondent MikeEmanuel in the latest action on Capitol Hill moments ago. Good evening,Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Yes, Bret. Good evening to you. The vote on those COVID stimuluschecks wrapping up moments ago 275 in favor to 134 against. The politics ofit fascinating with President Trump and top congressional Democrats allpushing to get this done. To this point, Senate Republicans appear to bewhat could hold Americans back from getting more help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Every Senate Democrat is for it. Butunfortunately, we don't have the Republicans on board. Today I am tellingDonald Trump don't just talk about it, act.EMANUEL (voice over): Some Senate Republicans sound skeptical aboutspending more at this point.How can Republicans vote against more aid when millions of Americans arestill unemployed through no fault of their own?SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): Yes, because it's terribly untargeted, right? Whywould we be sending $2,000 to people with a six-figure income who've had nosuspension, no reduction of their income at all.EMANUEL: But House Democrat says this is about helping those really inneed.REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): It is not for the wealthy. This will be forindividuals of $75,000 or less. So yes, we absolutely need to do that.EMANUEL: Some Republicans are calling for cuts elsewhere, or at least wantto read the fine print.REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): I am open to the $2,000 checks. That is not theonly aspect of the bill Nancy Pelosi is bringing to the floor today. She iswell known for loading it up with partisan provisions.EMANUEL: There's also the issue of President Trump's veto of the $740billion National Defense Authorization Act. It passed the House and Senatewith a veto proof majority. Now a national security Republican isencouraging his colleagues to vote to override.REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): This is a great bill, this goes after China,Russia does a lot to shore up our cyber defenses, which as we've seen areextremely vulnerable. To sustain the President's veto after you voted forthis bill, I just don't understand.EMANUEL: But some on the progressive left say that is where spending shouldbe cut.REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): We can't find money to get $2,000 into the pocketsof Americans, the priorities are wrong. And so, I'm not going to vote tooverride his veto.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): The final vote on the defense bill could be close.Some Republicans have signaled that while they voted for the bill, they mayside with the president now. That vote could wrap up as soon as later thishour, Bret.BAIER: And if it does, we'll bring you back for breaking news. Mike,thanks.At the 11th hour as we mentioned, President Trump did sign the COVID reliefgovernment funding bill, while at the same time demanding Congress removewhat he calls unnecessary spending items. Items like millions of dollars tocount fish and to research the impact of downed trees.Correspondent Rich Edson has details from West Palm Beach, Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Days after urgingCongress to make major changes, President Trump signed it anyway. A massivespending bill designed to address the pandemic and avoid an approachinggovernment shutdown.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am asking Congress to amendthis bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for acouple.EDSON: The president says he also signed the bill, "With a strong messagethat makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed. I willsend back to Congress a redlined version item by item."The president has previously singled out $40 million for the KennedyCenter, one billion for the Smithsonian Institution, $154 million for theNational Gallery of Art and more for fish management, fighting invasivespecies, wildlife data, technology for chicken production and foreign aid.All part of the annual government funding bill; the Democrats, Republicansand the administration took months to negotiate. Congress would need toapprove any cuts. The president signed the massive bill from his Mar-a-Lagoresort that was also focused on his return to the capital city. Tweeting"See you in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. Don't miss it. Information tofollow!"The president's supporters are planning a rally in Washington, the same dayCongress meets to formally count the electoral votes from the Novemberpresidential election.As set out in the Constitution, some Republicans may object to thoseresults. Other say, the party needs to move on.KINZIGER: I'm concerned to an extent about January 6th, because if youconvince people that -- you know, Congress can change a legitimateelection, you could see people being driven to violence.EDSON: If a member of the House and Senate object to a state's electoralaccount, that would trigger a debate and vote on whether to exclude thosestates' electors. The measure would have to pass in the House and Senate tosuccessfully deny those electoral votes.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (on camera): Vice President Mike Pence will preside over that jointsession of Congress which has largely been a ceremonial role. Though now,several Republicans have filed suit to give Pence the authority to choosepro-Trump electors instead of the certified Biden ones. Legal experts havesaid that the challenge is unlikely to succeed, Bret.BAIER: Rich Edson in West Palm Beach, Florida. Rich, thanks.The COVID relief payments help send all three major stock indices to recordhigh closes today. The Dow gaining 204, the S&P 500 jumped 32, the NASDAQfinished ahead 95.President-Elect Joe Biden took part in the national security and foreignpolicy transition briefing today. Afterwards, Biden said many nationalsecurity agencies had been hollowed out and his transition team he said isnot getting the needed information. He called it "Nothing short ofirresponsibility."Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich joins us from Wilmington with the latest.Good evening, Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. This was a warning President-Elect Biden's team is not getting whatit needs. His central message was the Trump administration left the countryexposed citing disrepair of international alliances and absence from keyinstitutions, weakening national security and foreign policy. Biden citedthe SolarWind's hack as one example of a challenge his administration willinherit, the scope of which they're still figuring out.And he specifically called out the Office of Management and Budget andDepartment of Defense saying political leadership obstructed his incomingadministration, leaving a potential window of confusion, our adversariescould exploit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've encounteredroadblocks on the political leadership at the Department of Defense and theOffice of Management and Budget.Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need for theongoing -- outgoing and from the outgoing administration in key massivesecurity areas. It's nothing short in my view of irresponsibility.HEINRICH (voice over): Biden also praised career agency officials whofacilitated his team's work so far, including those at FEMA who arecoordinating vaccine distribution.But Biden made no mention of the pandemic relief and spending billPresident Trump signed into law last night following pressure this weekendfrom lawmakers and from Biden. But he did voice support on his way out thedoor for a new bill the House passed tonight over $2,000 direct payments.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support the $2,000 direct payment, sir?BIDEN: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera): There was no Q&A with reporters. However, we didlearn tonight vice President-Elect Kamala Harris and her husband will bereceiving the COVID-19 vaccine tomorrow. Harris will receive hers oncamera, Bret.BAIER: Jacqui, thank you.Authorities have identified the man believed to be behind the Christmas Daysuicide bombing in Nashville, Tennessee.

When the blast hits the spotwhere he stood, it showered with debris.JAMES WELLS, METRO NASHVILLE POLICE OFFICER: I was literally getting readyto walk back toward that R.V. and you watch the video, you can see thatmoment of clarity for me when I heard God say go and check on topping.TOBIN: After a warning from cops, Jeffrey Rasmussen and his family escapedas the blast shook his family car.JEFFREY RASMUSSEN, ESCAPED EXPLOSION: The way I see it like -- I mean, twoangels showed up on our doorstep Christmas morning and happened to be inpolice officers' uniform.TOBIN: Not everyone got out of the blast zone in time. The only one killedwas the bomber himself identified through DNA analysis as 63-year-oldAnthony Quinn Warner of Antioch, Tennessee. The bomb was parked at the AT&Tbuilding. Investigators say Warner's late father worked for AT&T.Reports quote an unnamed investigator saying they're looking at paranoiaover 5G technology as a motive, but nothing concrete as to why.DAVID RAUSCH, TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: The definition fordomestic terrorism, we haven't met yet. Trying to determine if there's anideology that this person was trying to push by their act of violence. Andso, at this point, that question has not been answered.TOBIN: One neighbor told The Associated Press Warner told him thatNashville and the world would never forget him. Other said they never heardan ideology from Warner but didn't know him well.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was just a loner. (INAUDIBLE) anything like thatwould come out of him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wave to people, you know, but he just never got --not a freely willy buddy, he never talked to anybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: Physical evidence gathered from the scene is being analyzed todetermine what the bomb was made up. Police say Warner was not on theirradar. All that shows up on his record is marijuana possession for resalefrom back in 1978, Bret.BAIER: Mike Tobin live in Nashville. Mike, thanks.Outside of Nashville, Rutherford deputies arrested a man who they say drovea white box truck that was blaring a similar message as the R.V. thatexploded on Christmas Day. Multiple agencies surrounded that truck beforesending a robot in to check for explosives. None were found.James Turgeon was charged with two counts of felony filing a false reportand one count of tampering with evidence.Nearly 1.3 million people went through U.S. airport checkpoints on Sunday,the highest one day total in more than nine months despite warnings thattravel will lead to more cases of COVID-19.This as California's governor comes to grips with the failure as cases inhis state surge despite one of the strictest lockdowns in the country.National correspondent William La Jeunesse has our report from Los Angeles.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): The bottom line is if we don't act now, ourhospital system will be overwhelmed.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):That was Governor Gavin Newsom three weeks ago. Today, however, hospitalsin much of the state remain overflowing.NEWSOM: It is clear and understandable that it's likely those statehomeowners will be extended.LA JEUNESSE: Once praised for early lockdown measures. Today, Californiahas the nation's highest infection ratio, prompting some to ask what wentwrong.DR. CHRISTOPHER TAICHER, EMERGENCY MEDICINE: I had 90 patients under mycare at one given time, ran upwards of 20 cardiac arrests. Having to spreadthe work, having to spread our staff thin is one of the greatest challengesthat's happening.LA JEUNESSE: With schools closed and kids at home, hospitals cannot findthe nurses to handle the surge. Vaccines are rolling out but only 10million so far, half as fast as hoped by year's end.DR. VANESSA WALKER, CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE: It's really up to the publicand what they're going to do over the next couple of weeks as to whether ornot we're going to push our healthcare staff to potentially dangerouslevels.LA JEUNESSE: But with a million Americans flying every day, many believethings will only get worse.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: As I've described it as a surge upon a surge.LA JEUNESSE: Call it frustration, fatigue, a lack of trust. California nowaverages 37,000 new cases a day.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm all for safety and everything, I got that. But aboveand beyond, I think it's overreaching.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do wonder whether playgrounds for example, are betteroff closed or not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fact that we're closed, I think was unjustifiable.LA JEUNESSE: This Beverly Hills restaurant even tried to hold a secret NewYear's Eve party that got caught when someone told the city.WALKER: Our plea to everybody is to please don't gather, don't do indoorevents.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (on camera): So, the surge Fauci refers to is the lag betweeninfection or rather exposure and hospitalization. And the fear is that theaccess to New Year's infections will show up in mid to late January, Bret.And that Beverly Hills restaurant just said that secret party at New Yearswas a joke, back to you.BAIER: Not so secret now. William, thank you.Coming up, a former camper comes forward with allegations of abuse at acamp run by one of the candidates in Georgia as Election Day draws near forthe Senate runoffs down there that will decide which party controls theU.S. Senate.Also ahead, Russia seemingly remains unscathed after hacking U.S.government agencies, but that may not be the case in 2021.BIDEN: We need to close the gap between where our capabilities are now andwhere they need to be.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All it takes is one successful offensive measure for anation state actor to get in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The teenager who shared a three-second video of a high schoolclassmate saying a racial slur back in 2016 tells The New York Times he hasno regrets even as the woman could not attend her dream college after heposted the video this past June.Mimi Groves, who is now attending a community college, has apologized forthe video.

Among them, former PresidentAbraham Lincoln, due to his past treatment of Native Americans.Other former presidents are also considered problematic in San Francisco,including Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Theodore Roosevelt.

The San Francisco mayor says the district's priority should begetting its 54,000 students back into the classroom.The pressure is on in Georgia with just about one week to go until ElectionDay in the senate races that will decide the balance of power in theSenate. And as we close in on January 5th, the accusations are ramping upand one Georgia teenager is catching the attention of two Republicans.Correspondent Steve Harrigan is following the race from Atlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Georgia's twoRepublican senators are battling to bring 18-year-old American, SkylarMack, home in the Cayman Islands where she has been in jail since December15th for violating COVID protocols.Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler wrote to the U.S. embassy inJamaica, "It is the sincere hope of her parents that she can safely andexpeditiously return home to continue her studies as a pre-med student atMercer University.Perdue and Loeffler are also battling to hold onto their jobs in runoffraces January 5th that will determine which party controls the Senate forthe next two years.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey all.HARRIGAN: The high stakes have led to a record fundraising. Perdue'sopponent, 33-year-old Jon Ossoff raised $106 million in the past two monthsalone, compared with $68 million for Perdue.JON OSSOFF (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, GEORGIA: It's not just that you're acrook, Senator.HARRIGAN: Personal attacks blanket the airwaves.

Bret.BAIER: Steve Harrigan in Atlanta. Steve, thanks. Up next, what tools theU.S. may have in its arsenal to fight Russia in cyberspace.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago, where nearby Rockford, an Army SpecialForces sergeant has been charged with an apparent random shooting at abowling alley, Saturday night. Three people were killed there, three othersincluding two children wounded in that shooting.An attorney for Duke Webb says her client may suffer from post-traumaticstress disorder. The army says Webb had four deployments to Afghanistan thelast ending in July.Fox 59 in Indianapolis, where a federal judge rules the Justice Departmentunlawfully rescheduled the execution of the only woman on federal deathrow. The decision potentially sets up the Trump administration to schedulethe execution after Joe Biden takes office.Lisa Montgomery had been scheduled to be executed this month, but a delaywas given after her attorneys contracted COVID.And this is a live look at Louisville, Kentucky from Fox 41. One of the bigstories there tonight, a Kentucky man goes viral for an unconventional wayof clearing the snow in his driveway.Timothy Browning decided a flamethrower was the way to go and it proved tobe efficient means, obviously, of melting the snow. It seems like much morefun obviously than shoveling, but authorities say please don't try this athome.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The suspected Russian hack into a series of U.S. government agenciesappears to be the top of mind for both the outgoing and incomingadministrations. Correspondent David Spunt has the latest from the JusticeDepartment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: It certainly appearsto be the Russians.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Just days after top U.S.officials blamed the Russia for a cyber-attack that affected thedepartments of commerce and energy, Russia appears to remain unscathed.BIDEN: This attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. Weneed to close the gap between where our capabilities are now and when theyneed to be.SPUNT: President-elect Joe Biden indicated today that the U.S. will not usea go it alone approach to the multiple foreign policy flashpoints ahead.The United Kingdom and other NATO allies are reportedly developing cyberweapons for protection.Experts expect Biden's cybersecurity team to focus heavily on the top threecyber threats: Russia, China, and Iran.LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY EXPERT: Hopefully, the nextadministration and the one after that will start to get a bit more specificas to what the United States' policies will be.SPUNT: Cyber-attacks on private companies ramped up significantly in thelast decade with more than 20 major incidents according to a Fox Newsanalysis. They include attacks on Capital One, Yahoo, MarriottInternational, Equifax, and eBay.Cyber-attacks for national security purposes may be part of the UnitedStates arsenal. In 2010, a computer worm called Stuxnet caused severedamage to the Iranian nuclear program. The United States has never takenresponsibility for the attack.GARBER: You can play defense as much as you want in terms of cybersecurity.But all it takes is one successful offensive measure for a nation-stateactor to get in.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): In the middle of this pandemic, intelligence agenciesare paying close attention to hospital systems to make sure foreigngovernments do not launch an attack online. Bret.BAIER: We'll stay on it. David, thank you.The Brexit referendum was voted on the summer of 2016. Now, more than fouryears later, the United Kingdom and the European Union have an agreementpending formal approval.Correspondent Benjamin Hall looks at the long process and the road aheadfrom London.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over):4-1/2 years after the U.K. voted to leave the E.U. and with just four daysto go until the transition period ends, E.U. ambassadors today votedunanimously to approve the deal to which they agreed on Christmas Eve.On Wednesday, the British parliament will also vote though it's considereda mere formality. By agreeing on a deal, the two sides have averted a hardBrexit, which would have meant crashing out with no trade arrangements inplace. Instead, they now have a vast free trade deal. No tariffs, noquotas, and full access to each other's markets. Britain's finance ministersays it's a new dawn.RISHI SUNAK, MEMBER OF UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENT: It gives us a fantasticplatform to go forward, maintain tariff-free access to European markets,but also capitalize on new opportunities.HALL:  There are expected to be hurdles. New checks at the borders may leadto long delays at ports. The U.K. is now bound to a level playing field onregulations, so it can't undercut the E.U. And British fishermen had hopedfor greater control over U.K. waters, preventing European fishermen fromcoming in and fishing them. Billions have been set aside to help businessesadjust.MICHAEL GOVE, MEMBER OF U.K. PARLIAMENT:  I think business is broadly in agood place, but inevitably, with any change, with any transition, there areoccasional bumpy moments, and that's why the government is there to helpbusiness be ready.HALL:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, though, says it will all be worth itbecause the U.K. now sets its own rules. It's no longer beholden to theEuropean courts. It controls its own immigration, and it can strike tradedeals around the world. It's already signed 58 worth about $270 billion,and has now been talking directly to the U.S. for another.(END VIDEO TAPE)HALL (on camera):  This Brexit deal has not pleased everyone, but there iswidespread agreement that it's better than no deal, and that the U.K. cannow put it behind them, move forward, and start a new era outside of theEuropean Union. Bret?BAIER:  Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you.Up next, the panel joins me to discuss President Trump signing the COVIDrelief, government funding package, and Congress' trying to override thepresident's NDAA veto, plus the House just voting on those $2,000 checks.First, beyond our borders tonight. At least five people were killed inseparate attacks across Afghanistan, raising concerns about the fate ofpeace talks that have been suspended until at least next month. No one hasclaimed responsibility yet for those attacks.A Chinese citizen journalist who reported from Wuhan during the coronavirusoutbreak has been sentenced to four years in jail by a Chinese court for,quote, picking quarrels and provoking trouble according to her lawyer. Thereports of crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire pictureof the outbreak's epicenter than the official narrative from China. TheUnited Nations Human Rights Office has called for the citizens' release.The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has begun the process of recognizingaround 80,000 black South Africans who served as part of the nativemilitary corps in World War II. The black volunteers were forbidden tofight by their white leaders, so they worked as laborers, guards, andmedical aides.Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  I am fighting, Senate Democratsare fighting for $2,000 per person.REP. ELISE STEFANIK, (R-NY):  When it comes to the $2,000 checks, it'simportant to remember that the $600 is not for a family. It's perindividual and per child.REP. MO BROOKS, (R-AL):  Someone has got to show me how we're going to payfor it. How far before we ultimately go into a debilitating insolvency andbankruptcy that's going to do great damage to our country?REP. JOHN GARAMENDI, (D-CA):  Suddenly the deficit hawks seemed to havereturned. They certainly were not there back in 2017 when the Republicanssupported a trillion-and-a-half dollar tax cut, almost all of which, 80percent, went to the super wealthy and big corporations.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The president signed the COVID relief, the stimulus, and thefunding for the government, but said he wanted $2,000 going to everyfamily. The House at the top of this hour just voted 275 to 134 to do that.Now the Senate will take up that $2,000 per person making $75,000 or lesstomorrow, and Democrats are jumping on this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DAN KILDEE, (D-MI) DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP:  President Trump changed hismind and supports this legislation. That's why we acted. We would haveincluded much larger payments in the legislation had he spoken up sooner.But it's never too late to do the right thing. President Trump stood up. Wesupport this legislation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Democrat from Michigan there. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York,chief political correspondent of the "Washington Examiner," formerTennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., and "Washington Post" columnist MarcThiessen.Marc, there are a lot of Republicans, particularly on the Senate side, whomay be put in a box here, an uncomfortable box, and perhaps the biggest twowill be running for Georgia for Senate in January 5th in that runoff, DavidPerdue and Kelly Loeffler.MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  No doubt. The Senate is notgoing to approve a $2,000 payment to the American people because it's nottargeted to people who are struggling or who are having trouble. That'swhat the unemployment increases is for and the other paycheck protectionaid is for. But Trump has put them in the box. And basically this helpednobody on the Republican side. It's going to put those Republicans, as yousay, in a box. It's making him look like a lame duck because he can't getit passed.And he's taking what should have been a victory and turned it into adefeat. The Democrats have been blocking this legislation since July, andthe reason was they didn't want to give Donald Trump credit. Now that it'sfinally passed, instead of taking credit, he makes Americans go throughChristmas wondering whether the aide that's expiring is going to be therefor them. He puts the Republicans in the position of potentially having tooverride his veto on this and be crosswise with the president, and he'sgiven Pelosi and Schumer a cudgel to beat them up, saying Trump supports$2,000 checks, why don't you? So it's just a disaster all the way around.BAIER:  Yes, and you're not alone in sharing that. The front page of "TheNew York Post," the opinion section of "The Post," which endorsed PresidentTrump, had this as the front cover today, " Stop the insanity -- Mr.President, stop the insanity. You lost the election. Here's how to saveyour legacy."Byron, where do you think the end game is here? He's going down to Georgia,the president is, in two different places to try to rally Republicans downthere, Dalton and Valdosta, that have seen early voting less than theythought it was going to be for Republicans. But he is really focused,still, on January 6th, and what happens about the final stand to try tosave his presidency.BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  He saida lot more about January 6th than he has about January the 5th. Thepresident obviously is a big supporter of in person Election Day voting,and not going down there for the second time until January 4th is all aboutgetting the Republicans to turn up at the polls in person on Election Day.This whole idea of the January 6th thing where Republicans in the House aregoing to protest the ratification of the Electoral College results,Democrats actually did that in 2001 and 2005 and in 2017. Didn't work forany of them, and it's not going to work for the president. So he wants tohave, I think, a large crowd of his supporters in Washington, but the factis what happens in the House chamber is that the election of Joe Biden inthe Electoral College will be certified.BAIER:  Yes. And it will be. There's not -- we don't see any surprises,predict any. We will follow every aspect of that and all sides. Back to thepayment and the money distribution, Harold, the $2,000 check. Here isSenator Pat Toomey over the weekend about where this is coming from in theSenate minority leader.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA):  This money isn't sitting on a shelf. We're goingto print it or we're going to borrow it. And I think that the aid should bemuch, much more targeted. It should be targeted to people who have actuallylost their job, small businesses that are actually in danger of goingunder.SCHUMER:  It's up to the Senate. Every Senate democrat is for it. Butunfortunately, we don't have the Republicans on board. Today, I am tellingDonald Trump, don't just talk about it, act. These Senate Republicans havefollowed you through thick and thin. Get them now to act and support the$2,000 checks.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  I understand the criticism of Republicans who lost their gumptionto fight over the deficit and debt. It stands, the debt, at $27 trillion.Eventually we as a country are going to have to deal with that, but neitherparty has wanted to. It is this not the time, Harold?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  Happy holidays toall, and glad to be with you again. I would say this is probably not theright time to be focusing on the kinds of things that politicians now wantto conveniently focus on. You have millions of Americans who stood in linefor food between Thanksgiving and Christmas, millions, not thousands, butmillions.I know Senator Toomey and I actually like him, but he has to realize thatthis is targeted, and Marc, who is my friend, this is targeted. It's up to$75,000 per individual. That doesn't mean everyone earning $74,999 isreceiving this money. It means that millions of Americans earning $20,000and $30,000 and $40,000 and $50,000 a year who since March have gotten onepayment, yet we have seen a number of incredible things done to help bigbusiness in the country. And I don't bemoan them, but at the same time weshouldn't disadvantage and discriminate against main street in the country.So I hope Republicans, Democrats alike, and there is blame to go around.Byron is right, both parties share some of the blame. But for PresidentTrump at this hour to say now he wishes the payments to families wereraised to $2,000 or individuals to $2,000, excuse me, when he had thatopportunity before, I think it does one thing and one thing onlypolitically -- it confuses Republicans in Georgia, which certainlyadvantages Democrats heading into that all-important runoff in earlyJanuary.BAIER:  Let's remember, his treasury secretary was involved in everyconversation for months, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and called thedeal a very good deal at $600 a person payout before the president decidedthat the number was $2,000.Marc, just moments ago the House now has enough votes to override the vetoof the National Defense Authorization Act. That's two-thirds, as you take alook live here. This is going to be a big veto override. It's going tohappen likely in the Senate as well. What does this mean? And again, we putit through the prism of the Georgia runoff because January 5th is justaround the corner.THIESSEN:  Yes, well, Georgia is a very military-heavy state. The DefenseAuthorization Act has been passed and signed into law for 59 straight yearsuntil now. And now Kelly Loeffler and Perdue, they have to decide do I voteagainst a three percent pay raise for Georgia military -- Georgia citizenswho are in the military, or do I vote to overturn the president and turnoff the Trump base for bucking the president? Again, he's hurting his partyby doing these insane things.And finally, just pushing back on what Harold said about the payments, ifyou're making $75,000 a year and you haven't lost your job, you don't needthe $2,000 payment from the U.S. government, from your neighbors. This isnot targeted. There are lots more targeted ways to get help to people. A$2,000 payment to anyone making $75,000 or less is not the way to do it.FORD:  Let me be on record just saying this. I don't mind if someone ismaking $74,000 a year and they get an additional $2,000 in light of therun-up in the stock market, in light of the run-up for the wealthiest inthe country, I have no issue with that. But I can assure you, this istargeted and every one of those families needs every bit of these dollars.THIESSEN:  Not targeted to people who are hurting from COVID.BAIER:  There you go. This is the debate that is in both chambers. Thankyou, gentlemen.Next up, the latest iterations of cancel culture.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I do get a sense sometimes now amongcertain young people, and this is accelerated by social media, there is thesense sometimes of the way of me making change is to be as judgmental aspossible about other people, and that's enough.Like if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or usedthe wrong verb or -- then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself,because you see how woke I was, I called you out.(LAUGHTER)OBAMA:  That's not activism. That's not bringing about change. If allyou're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Former President Obama talking about the woke culture in 2019.We're back with the panel. A couple of stories fit under this category. Oneis a "New York Times" story in which the headline is "A racial slur, aviral video, a reckoning. A white high school student withdrew from herchosen college after a three second video caused an uproar online. Theclassmate who shared it publicly has no regrets." The racial slur sheapologized for was from 2016, a three second video, but she is nowattending a community college. She couldn't get into the college shewanted. Critics say this article glorified this culture and celebrated thishigh school student's vengeance about posting this video. It's kind of beentalked about, Harold. What about this? Some words carry more weight thanothers, even years later.FORD:  I'm a believer in redemption in second chances, and if any of uswere to have our lives determined or judged or judged and determined bywhat we did in high school, we might all be leading different lives. I dohope we don't direct our ire at the young man that shared those wordsbecause I believe the young lady, although she gave a heartfelt apology,and should not have this held against her as she moves forward in life. AndI think she's learned from it. I hope the young man learns from it. But ireshouldn't be directed at either. I think it's important when hateful andracial language is used that we learn from it. But everyone deserves asecond chance, and I hope this young lady gets one.BAIER:  Yes, and you think back to all kinds of different scenarios.Remember Nicholas Sandmann talked about cancel culture at the RNC, Marc.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NICHOLAS SANDMANN, FORMER COVINGTON HIGH STUDENT:  I learned what washappening to me had a name. It was called being canceled, as in annulled,as in revoked, as in made void. Many are being fired, humiliated, or eventhreatened, and often the media is a willing participant.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  And he won a lot of money in that case about his case on the mall.But then you have other places like San Francisco that is trying to -- orlooking into possibly renaming schools from presidents, a long list ofpresidents, who they say are, quote, problematic.THIESSEN:  Yes, no, that's absolutely right. On the video point, I feelsorry for this generation, because when Harold and I were in high school,and Byron too, we could -- not that any of us would have done this, but wecould do stupid things and it wasn't documented on video and it didn't liveforever on the Internet. This generation of kids can't do anything stupidbecause it's going to follow them through the rest of their lives.I remember when I took my kids to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp, Ishowed them the story about the girl who is now known as the Auschwitzselfie girl because she took a smiling picture of herself as a teenager onthe railroad tracks, and forever she's going to be considered that. So thisgeneration can't make mistakes. And I just feel badly for them that youcan't be -- when you're a sophomore you should be able to be sophomoric andnot have it ruin your life.BAIER:  That's a good point, especially good advice for young kids.Byron, a final word here, we should point out, there are many other thingsthat are more important than this, but every once in a while these storiesbubble up, and a lot of people start talking about them, so we thought wewould.YORK:  Well, Harold talked about the young woman whose admission wasrescinded, and young man who had put out the video of her. The other partyto mention here is the University of Tennessee, which withdrew heradmission after this social media fracas starts out. And she was 15 yearsold, she was a high school freshman. She used the n-word. She had heard itin rap lyrics. She had heard other students do it. She shouldn't have doneit, she did it on a three second video, and this young man waited until hecould release it at a time he thought it would do maximum damage to her.And the people who should be the adults here are the University ofTennessee, which should have looked at this and said this is allunfortunate, don't do it again, and your admission still stands.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you so much. Happy New Year. When wecombat, some holiday gifts.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, two brave fighters. It was a big moment for nine-year-old Julian who rang the bell at Cincinnati's Children's MedicalHospital to mark the end of chemo treatment. Julian spent six months in thehospital, six months there for a rare disease, dyskeratosis congenita, oneout of a million actually get it. But he left, as you see, to a cheeringtunnel of medical staff.And in an unforgettable holiday gift, U.S. Marine Daniel Ceballos surprisedhis mother as she was eating breakfast. The two embraced for the first timein eight months as the crowd at the Orlando restaurant celebrated hishomecoming. We love seeing those. Fun to be in that restaurant, right?Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the "SPECIALREPORT," fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
