JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five." 
We're just 13 hours away from one of the most highly anticipated Senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his private conversations with President Donald Trump. It will be the first time Mr. Comey has spoken publicly since the President fired him on May 9th. We are already getting a preview about what to expect from Mr. Comey.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And chief national correspondent Ed Henry has the details from the White House tonight. Ed, what do we say?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Well, good evening, guys. A pretty good day for President Trump today because top Intel officials testified and sort of a preamble to this on The Hill and suggested that the commander-in-chief did not improperly pressured them to interfere with this Russia probe and the teaser we are getting of James Comey's testimony tomorrow -- backs up the commander-in-chief's account that then FBI director told him several times he was not under investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And even when Comey will detail his February Oval Office meeting with the President where Mr. Trump asked that he let the probe of General Michael Flynn go, Comey and top advisors did not share this with FBI agents. Comey says, because, quote, "We also concluded that given that it was a one-on- one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account." Signaling that even he admits it's a high bar to prove obstruction of justice. But even so, there could be real political damage to this president as Comey testifies about their January dinner, for example. 
He is going to testify, quote, "A few minutes later, the President said I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I did not move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence." Awkward and a bit dramatic perhaps from Comey which is why advisors for the President are telling me tonight they are bracing for two things tomorrow.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Number one, even if it turns out to be a nothing-burger, the mainstream media can build up the drama so much to make it look like it was devastating for the President and the other thing is, even if it turns out to be a relatively good day for the President, he can mess it up by live tweeting the hearing and making matters worse -- guys. 
WATTERS: Ed, thanks a lot. You didn't know but nothing-burger is a band phrased by Gutfeld.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think I just popped a vessel. 
WATTERS: Kimberly, Trump's attorney just came out and says, the President feels totally vindicated, based off of these prepared remarks that Comey is supposed to deliver. You know, based off his remarks, Trump might not even have to live tweet tomorrow because this is pretty good news for the President for the most part. Do you agree? 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, and that's why the attorney came out and made these the President feels vindicated because what so far that we have been able to review and that prepared statement which is quite detailed is that the statements are consistent with what the President said transpired between the two of them.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, if there were any other witness there, any other recording, there really isn't anything to contradict or provide an inconsistent statement to what the President said occurred in the conversation and by this way, multiple times, multiple occasions, he was assured in fact that he was not the subject of an investigation, so it shows them truthfulness on the part of the President and I think it diminishes any kinds of supposed, you know, motive or intent to say that oh, he wanted to fire Comey because, you know, he was under investigation by the Russians. 
So, at least in terms of the President, that gives him some cover there and validates his statement. So, I think that was important. 
WATTERS: Yes. He did come away and validated based off of these prepared remarks. Dana, the networks and all the cables have decided they will going to go live tomorrow.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yes, including --

GUILFOYLE: Dana Perino!
WATTERS: Oh, Dana!

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Yes. I will be on in the morning. 
WATTERS: I walked right into that plug. I didn't even realize it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

PERINO: Even though you were insulting us at the same time.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Do you think these prepared remarks take the wind out of the sails of some of this intense excitement, from some of these baffling network? 
PERINO: Yes, I do. I actually think that that's why Senator Byrd, a Republican on the Senate Committee and Director Comey agreed to release it today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WATTERS: Okay.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Because they don't want it to be -- I think that they don't want it to -- 
GUILFOYLE: I don't think -- 
PERINO: -- they wanted to be that dramatic. I'm not going to say that word that Greg hates because I would like him too much for him to pop another vessel. I do think that the Democrats' high hopes for James Comey are going to be dashed again.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: He is like losing the football with them. However, I do think that based on the written testimony, I can understand both sides of this. I can understand the President wanting to clear his name saying that this investigation is a cloud. I wanted to be cleared and couldn't you just publicly say what you are telling me? 
WATTERS: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: I also understand the separation of powers and I respect them and I think that the independent judiciary is so important and I believe that FBI Director Comey was prudent and how he handled it and I think that's what we will see tomorrow, is that a public servant caught up in a situation where you have Hillary Clinton doing this terrible thing of, you know, having her private email server. Then running for president. Him having to get in the middle of that. Making I think a mistake -- 
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: -- to comment on that and not recommend a prosecution and then getting himself into this situation. Because what he said in the written testimony is that, he wanted to avoid a duty to correct. If, in fact, it changed --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: -- that he became a subject of investigation. Which could be worse for the President in the long run. So, I think that the director was being prudent. I don't think it's necessary for the White House to trash Comey's reputation and I think that they should go tomorrow, have a great infrastructure event and just forget about it. Let the lawyers statements stand and let your story gets handled. 
WATTERS: Greg, speaking of forget about it.

WATTERS: There's a moment according to James Comey's recollection where the President of the United States sent across him and demanded loyalty, is that how people in New York talk? Is that kind of par to the course because Chris Christie came out and said, that's how bosses around time in the city frame things? Are you buying that or not?
GUTFELD: Kind of, I think what we learned is that Trump is guilty of being Trump.

She was there just hanging around. By the way, the problem with Trump being Trump is that part of it is his responsibility. But every time I was hired for a job, there was always an employee orientation day where they kind of tell you the rules. But apparently, you know, the rules, number one, don't meet along with the FBI. Number two, don't demand loyalty. You did that in real estate, you did that in Queens but you can't do it here. But the thing is, this is the mark of somebody who is not a politician. And this is what happens. I just want to add another note about this Comey memo. It's like a golden corral buffet. There's something for everyone. 
PERINO: Yes.

WATTERS: Juan, Janet Turley (ph), law respected legal, said that although some of these comments by President Trump were maybe not mature, there is nothing criminal about them. Do you agree? 
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yes. Absolutely. There is nothing criminal as of yet. I mean, the closest we could congest is the idea that there is a basis for saying that he was trying to interfere with an ongoing investigation by asking FBI director, can you see your way to let this go? 
WATTERS: Right.
WILLIAMS: That Mike Flynn is a good guy. But the question then becomes one of intent. And for people like Turley, that is the measuring stick and can you prove that the President had intent to block or interfere with an ongoing federal investigation?

WATTERS: And that's a very high bar. 
WILLIAMS: It's a very high bar as he said and I think Kimberly said this. That given that there is no independent corroboration -- 
WATTERS: Right.
WILLIAMS: Or maybe Ed Henry say, how are you going to prove that? I will say this, it's very interesting to me that we had a story out indicating that President Trump was asked by Attorney General Sessions, do you want my resignation? And the reason for this apparently is that President Trump was upset with his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. And then we have also news that FBI Director Mueller went to the Attorney General and said, you know what? I'm uncomfortable being with this president. I feel like he's trying to --

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Yes. And it preserve the independence and integrity of the investigation. So, this would indicate that he did feel to some extent that this guy, he was after something. He says, in fact, one of the conversations, that the President told him, I am trying to lift this cloud. Which I am told this, the New York business term. Right? I am trying to lift this cloud, can you help me, right? We'll talk about the -- in the next segment more conversations with intelligence community officials but today they get in trouble because they won't even say. 
PERINO: They wouldn't say it in public session. 
WILLIAMS: Correct.
WATTERS: Right. And they said they would say it in private session because they don't want to say these things in front of a worldwide audience and that makes perfect sense. 
GUTFELD: In New York, lifting a cloud is smoking a joint. 
PERINO: Really?
GUTFELD: Yes.

WATTERS: How would you know, Greg? 
GUTFELD: I watched it.
(LAUGHTER) 
GUILFOYLE: But I think what's important here is that there isn't any time that Comey thought that the President was trying to get them to stop an investigation. 
WATTERS: Right.
GUILFOYLE: It wasn't in anyway colluding. It wasn't in anyway obstructing justice. So, you don't have that there. So, how are you going to prove that? You are going to just imagine it? Because the person who was in the room, that was the subject of that discussion and that conversation is telling you that it wasn't problematic, that it didn't rise to the level because straight shooter Comey, if it was, then he would have had to report it and actually make it the subject of an investigation and say that this is something that was improper. 
So, as far as it goes, saying that it was concerning. That was it. But never did he feel that this was something that he had to do or was compelled, you know, to do. When you hear President Trump talking about, you know, expecting -- that is who he is. Anybody who knows him. Loyalty is a big thing to him.

        }
      
WATTERS: Right.
GUILFOYLE: That's his deal. That is the way he rolls. That's his say. Comey also gave you his further insight to back up what Greg said which is, you know, this is the man, I think that he didn't quite understand what was appropriate to discuss with the FBI director. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. I agree. 
GUILFOYLE: But that does not show any kind of, you know, specific intent to commit a crime or do anything. He saying, I don't think that this is a president or a man that actually quite kind of knew the ropes, as to how we do things around here. 
WILLIAMS: But I would just add, go ahead. 
PERINO: So, he has been the CEO of a private company for a long time. I just don't think that that's necessarily -- not understanding basic rules of the road when it comes to government and separation of power. When you work for the government and when you're head of the government, you pledge your loyalty to the United States of America. Not to any one man. And that's is just a fundamental principle of America. That is not something that you have to learn during the transition. That's just something -- 
GUILFOYLE: Right.

PERINO: -- that we, that founding fathers put that in the constitution for a reason and it helps them.
GUTFELD: I don't think I would know that. Honestly, if I ran for president, I would be treating it just like everything else I did. If I thought that somebody was like, you know, after me, I would say, why are you doing this? Can you, you know, lighten up. I think that's how New Yorkers talk to New Yorkers. 
GUILFOYLE: President Obama had done that. And excuse us, well, he is new to the Senate and -- 
GUTFELD: Yes. Believe me. They did use that excuse. They did use that excuse a lot.
WATTERS: But I also think President Obama assumed that Eric Holder had his back. 
GUTFELD: Right.
WILLIAMS: No. Sessions is a longtime leading supporter, early supporter of President Trump. But I think, just to pick up on what Dana was saying, I think what we are seeing here is a president who feels very isolated. Nobody he can trust. He can't trust Jeff Sessions? Wow. And the second thing is, he just doesn't have -- I think everybody at the table said this tonight, he doesn't have a sense of how you have a responsibility bigger than loyalty. When you are the President of the United States.

GUILFOYLE: He has a core group that he trusts I think. You know, that surrounds them. 
WATTERS: That's right.
GUTFELD: It's Jared.
WATTERS: Coming up. The nation's top intelligence officials appeared on Capitol Hill today. Where they had some surprising things to say about the Russia investigation, details ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right. The Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers testified today on Capitol Hill. Were they disappointed many senators by refusing to comment on any personal conversations they had with President Trump as we were saying in the first block. Rogers and Coats said it would be appropriate to disclose discussions with the President in an open session but they were more forthcoming when asked if the White House ever tried to influence an investigation.

SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: Are you aware of any efforts by anyone in the White House or the executive branch looking for advice from other members of the intelligence community about how to potentially influence an investigation? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're talking about me?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. 
RUBIO: Has anyone ever come forward and said, I just got a call from someone at the White House asking me, what is the best way to influence someone on an investigation? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never received anything.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no direct knowledge of such a call. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: All right. So, Juan, let me start with you. I talked to a Democrat today who is friendly with some of the Democrats on the Senate investigation, you know, on the Intel Committee. And they think that after today's testimony and what they know about what former FBI Director Comey will say tomorrow, they don't think that there's going to be anything new. They think it actually continues to be a distraction. And in drumbeat, they said that it's like putting another log on the fire but this is not going to be at an end-all be-all. So, do you think the Democrats are little disappointed with the buildup to this hearing? 
WILLIAMS: Well, I think you have to be disappointed if you saw it as CNN reported that there was going to be testimony from, you know, the FBI director, suggesting that in fact the President had said something explicit in terms of "don't do it." And that if there was a clear evidence of intent, which would then lead to obstruction of justice, which would then lead to impeachment, so, if you were not a Trump fan, this was going to be your nirvana. You're going to get rid of this guy. That's not happening apparently on the basis of anything that transpired today or likely that transpired tomorrow. 
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: What we do see Dana that I think that you and I will disagree on is in the testimony from Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence, and Mike Rogers, the National Security Council guy -- that they refuse to answer questions. So, the Democrats -- but I would also say, Marco Rubio and the Independent Angus King of Maine, became infuriated with them. And said, wait a second, why are you unable to come before our committee as we are trying to review the facts and then say oh, we can't talk about this. We will tell you privately. But of course there are no private hearings scheduled. 
PERINO: Well, I do think that Kimberly, the President benefits from having people around him who are experienced and established in Washington who don't overreact to things when President might have said, hey, what do you think about this? So, they didn't overreact. So, they don't think it's that big a deal but I guess an argument could be made that if this is all going to be repeated in in the press anyway, should they have just been able to say that in public session today and put it to bed so that there's not speculation about what they said behind the scenes?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: I guess, I think, you know, it's hard, because you want to kind of get the right position which is -- tell the truth, be transparent about what happened but don't even engage in set of things that are not, you know, relevant. Or that seem to kind if be more like, you know, Russian gossip. You know, the kind of thing that people are looking for this -- very distracting. The Democrats you can see were getting very frustrated today because they wanted to get something there. And everybody was have it, make it their moment to expose it. But the problem is, Comey went ahead and leaked his own testimony. Right? 
PERINO: Right.
GUILFOYLE: He went ahead in conjunction with the chairman, Senator Burr. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, absolutely. And so, that's what happened. And so now, you have people like CNN, who completely reported false information, it's a complete letdown -- is Comey going to radically change his statement tomorrow and make some kind of wild, inconsistent statement? I don't think so. I think he is going to stick to his script and exactly what he said today which is based on his accounts that he took. That were right after contemporaneous in time with his conversations with the President. 
So, there you, that suggests reliability, and credibility. And you are hearing it from the man himself. This is what happens. These are the facts. And I will also tell you subjectively what I felt at the time, which was that he didn't feel that any other action should be taken going forward, that he didn't find any wrongdoing on the part of the President and he didn't think that the President was trying to end an investigation or, you know, influence him in that way. 
PERINO: Yes. Greg, you can imagine these two gentlemen have enormous responsibility and protecting us from threats of all sorts, foreign and domestic. So, can you imagine if they are probably sitting and they're thinking, we've got a lot to do? 
GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, Iran got hit.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Right.
GULFED: Stuffs going on in this world and they're dealing with this stuff and it kills me to watch politicians getting angry over people who are acting just like them. You know, they learned it from the best. 
GUILFOYLE: They all used to be there. 
GUTFELD: Yes. This hearing was nothing more than a bunch of old people asking the same question over and over again. It was like, you know, a bunch of -- 
GUILFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE) 
GUTFELD: Yes. I'm getting there. It's like a 24-hour diner and somebody keeps asking how late you are open. They shouldn't call it hearing. They should call it a hard of hearing. They need hearing aids. And everybody showing so much respect, they would have to wind up to get to the question. If you cut all of that stuff out and got to the meat and bones, it would be shorter than a Ramon's song from the first album. But it is, it's about one group of people going after another group of people and they're relentless. I have to give the Democrats credit. They are absolutely relentless. I wish the Republicans were like this with the real scandals during the last eight years. The real Democrat scandals, if they were like this, who knows. 
PERINO: Last word to you, Jesse. 
WATTERS: Well, I mean, what happened during this real Democratic scandals I think Eric Holder -- he say, invoked executive privilege when they were trying to get to the bottom of "Fast and the Furious," you had Lois Lerner taking the fifth on the IRS scandal, you had Hillary basically wiping her server claim. That was more evasive I think than some of the answers that were given today. Of course these guys don't want to go up there and say what their private conversations were with the commander-in-chief, in front of the entire world. That's obvious. 
Today was just another nail in the coffin for this so-called Russian-Trump conspiracy. Everybody out there on that table, said that there is no effort by anybody at the White House to influence any of their investigations. This post-story is fake news. It didn't happen. So, I think a lot of Democrats are sitting around just waiting for the next thing to happen because they don't have anything going on right now. 
PERINO: Which post story? 
WATTERS: Remember they said that President Trump tried to influence the DNI and the NSA guy, they say, hey, Comey, slow down this investigation -- 
WILLIAMS: They wouldn't say it. 
WATTERS: They said they were not influence but they didn't say what the conversation was. 
WILLIAMS: Right. So, let's be clear. 
PERINO: And that's what I am saying, he benefits from people who don't overreact and that are prudent and experienced in Washington. Like, okay, we are not going to talk about that, sir. We're going to move on. 
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: Okay. And we're going to move on. Directly ahead, we will tell you why authorities aren't tracking enough terrorists. We've got that, stay tuned. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Today's hearing was supposed to be about surveillance. Since they didn't get around to it, I will.
 The civil liberties faction who hate surveillance operate on a lie: that security infringes on freedom. No, security enhances freedom, which insures our survival. Especially now when we are at war with a disease. Now, libertarians love to twist the Ben Franklin quote when he said that, "Those who would give up liberty to purchase safety deserve neither." It's not about surveillance. But a tax dispute over who pays for frontier defense in Pennsylvania. Ben would have been fine with the NSA.
What civil libertarians miss is our enemies realize that our love of liberty makes us vulnerable to their apocalyptic goals. They use our dedication to freedom to infiltrate, kill and then inevitably rid us of that very same freedom.
So, what's the answer? We must realize that the survival of liberty requires a coexisting exception, one that allows us to stop the attacks on said liberty. This co-existing exception should sit beside our rights. Think of it as a bouncer whose job is to stop those people whose belief systems run counter to our freedom. So these anti-terror programs are not in conflict with liberty but act as a tougher, more muscular pal, there to help, making sure that you are safe from dirty nukes, bio-terror and beheadings. Because it's hard to be free when you are dead.
K.G., are you tired of hearing this security infringing freedom argument? You're supposed to stop there and never one dark, all, maybe they go together? 
GUILFOYLE: This is the problem. When you think about it, someone in your life, being harmed, losing their life, been injured or maimed due to terror that could have been preventable if you actually had the will and the stomach to allow for a little bit of an investigation or intelligence gathering? Do you have a problem with that? Why does human life -- why is it valued so much lower than the right to go ahead and get some information to someone to prevent a loss of life? This is what bothers me so much. How much do we need to see in London and Manchester and here on our own soil in San Bernardino, and in Orlando? How much is going to be enough? That is not. It was do something about it, it sounds like Theresa May has actually come to terms and groups with this and is saying enough is enough. We've got to do something about this. Be very clear about what they intend and they will go to any length to be able to commit acts of jihad across the world to accomplish their roles. What a real are we willing to do? Is a small sacrifice too much to ask? 
GUTFELD: It is interesting, you know Jesse, and they know our system so well. They know our system allows them to actually work within it. They want Sharia law. Radical Islamists want -- they don't want freedom. Because we are free, we allow competing ideas into our country even ideas that destroy us. 
WATTERS: It's a catch-22. That is why a lot of these people can come here and fly under the radar plot plan, because we don't survey you mosques. We allow freedom of expression and religion. We don't banned hates -- you hit the nail on the head. Privacy is worthless if you are in a coffin. It's funny how the conversation has changed, since the beginning of the Bush administration. When the initial surveillance was unveiled or reported, I think it was The New York Times who broke that story -- it was huge news and civil libertarians were furious and there were protests on the streets and President Bush was a tyrant, shredding the constitution and then President Obama expanded the program. Trump is now reauthorizing the program. He might have been the victim of some of the abuses of the program. I think right now and the threat changes you have to change the tools in your toolbox. And that is what we're doing. That is just smart. 
GUTFELD: Dana, even in the hearing there was one point when they said the programs they were talking about saved countless lives internationally. Oh, you don't have to worry about America -- there haven't been people coming from this country or that country since 1975. These programs have actually extended people's lives, saved lives internationally. 
PERINO: Right, because the monitoring happens between emails from overseas into the United States or vice versa. We are able to share with our partners if we are able -- and have a good relationship and ability to protect people or to disrupt plots. At that something you don't want them to say in open sessions. Because we don't want them to know how we do it. What Ed Snowden did was so damaging. As Jesse was saying, the terrorist's threats, they evolve with the technology so we have two as well. It doesn't mean we have to give up our civil liberties but we have to honest about what we are going to accept as President Trump is actually calling for the re-authorization of the section 702 program. I think it would be good to have the debate and make all of these members of congress vote on it before the August recess. 
GUTFELD: What do you think, Juan, is the 702 collection valuable? 
WILLIAMS: I was just thinking why can't, Greg and I talk about climate change and have a big blow up on this show? I know how to have a blow up on this show. What we should tell the audience is in fact, the reality is, the biggest threat to re-authorization came from President Trump and Republicans, allies who said Mike Flynn was unmasked under the private act of section 702 and ask a ton of question today about isn't proper to unmask people and they had been told by the intelligence community, gee, we keep a strict record of who we talk to, who request unmasking or normally the names of Americans are redacted in this transactions, you are just monitoring conversations. 
WATTERS: That is unfortunate for Democrats that there's a paper trail of the unmasking. 
WILLIAMS: No there is not, I think they are glad there is, Jesse. This is nothing unusual and nothing improper was done. But I would say to you, that this is the threat. That somehow, they have politicized this issue and not in the way that you described, Greg, but they politicize it to be somehow an attack on President Trump. If that is what it has ever been about. 
GUTFELD: I will resist the blowup that you so badly want to -- 
WILLIAMS: I think you should feel a little chillier. 
GUTFELD: I am. I feel very cold. A trash Trump tour abroad, headlined by President Obama, Vice President Biden and former Intel Chief James Clapper, next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
GUILFOYLE: After President Trump won the White House, President Obama said he would do everything he could to help him succeed. Sadly, he has not honored that pledge. He was trashing his successor while abroad and his Vice President and former Intelligence Chief piled on from overseas. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) 
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In Paris, we came around to fight climate change. An agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership, it will still give our children a fighting chance. 
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: United States has had moments of turning inward in the past. We have always overcome it, just as we will overcome this. 
FORMER INTELLIGENCE CHIEF JAMES CLAPPER: I think if you compare the two, Watergate pales in my view. Compared to what we are confronting now. 
(END VIDEO CLIPS) 
GUILFOYLE: Tough. 
PERINO: Especially on that last one, with Clapper. If you find yourself in a situation, you can say in front of an international audience, something that is true. Which is, there are two investigations that are underway, there is a special counsel, Robert Mueller and that the Intel committee. I will refrain to comment and I know it's hard when you get asked questions like that but I think there's a way to try to avoid it. I'm thinking back to 2009. When President Obama's team worked to try to dismantle the legacy and programs from President George W. Bush on the global war on terror, in particular, Gitmo and saying some pretty harsh things about it. President Bush was very quiet. But Vice President Dick Cheney was not. He was extremely effective. The dual speech he had against President Obama? He is going to want to defend his legacy. Even if it's veiled, it still hurts. On foreign soil, it's still hard to take. 
GUILFOYLE: All right Greg, proper or improper? And what is it expected? 
GUTFELD: Has there ever been any topic that has warranted and caused more conversation in our modern lifetimes than Donald Trump? Not even the weather. People talk about Trump as though it is a separate weather event. Wherever you go, people are going -- the house the Trump over there? Pretty strong, we had a lot of trouble last night. We had to dig it out and shovel to Trump out of our driveway. It keeps piling up. I wasn't upset with that stuff because it's just what people talk about. President Obama talking about the Paris Accords, we need to give our children a fighting chance. It's not predictable, cheap happy clich, that the left always uses. If you come out against something, kids are going to die. But if you look at the Paris accords, that would be more harmful to children, because it's diverting trillions and trillions of dollars away from clean water, cleaner air -- all sorts of causes that could use that money. It will have almost negligible effects on the climate over a hundred years so actually if you vote against the Paris accord, you are trying to give children a fighting chance. And if you are for the Paris accord, you want children to die. How do you feel? 
GUILFOYLE: Just say it. 
WILLIAMS: I think Greg Gutfeld is going to burst. 
GUTFELD: I'm using your toolbox. 
WILLIAMS: No you are not, because you want to pretend -- let's move on. Facts don't exist. 
GUTFELD: I am giving you 20 seconds to give a fact. 
WILLIAMS: How about his, 5 of the last six years have been the hottest in history. What happens when Jim Clapper says oh, you know what? The president says the people in Intelligence Community All right Nazi that is pretty strong language coming from the president. 
GUTFELD: He started that trend. 
WILLIAMS: He is the president, Greg. 
WATTERS: Jim Clapper also said there was no evidence of any collusion between Trump and the Russians and now he says it's Watergate. So get your story straight. 
WILLIAMS: No, no, no when you are going after America Institution. 
WATTERS: It doesn't have anything to do about the testimony he gave about collusion. Let me just finish, I think President Obama obviously a little upset, because his library is going to be empty. In Chicago, after President Trump has proved to dismantle his legacy. No Obamacare, no Paris, the only thing left is the Iran deal. No one wants to visit that wing. And then you have Biden out there saying we need to be more engaged. Biden was the one that pulled out of Iraq and let Syria unravel and didn't protect our allies. 
PERINO: Are you worried about Biden running, Jesse? 
GUILFOYLE: He practiced that all night. All right, straight ahead, full- grown full-blown Trump derangement syndrome and not just on the set, but from some Democrats today, details after this break. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WILLIAMS: Whether its climate change, Sanctuary cities or the travel ban, Democrats had been opposing President Trump in nearly every turn, but it hasn't been enough for Democratic Congressman Al Green of Texas. He wants to take things to the next level. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
AL GREEN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN: I have engaged in the process of drafting articles of impeachment. By articles of impeachment, they are being reviewed. At some point, if no one else does -- I will file articles of impeachment to impeach President Donald J. Trump for obstruction of justice. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WILLIAMS: You have Green joint behind thereby sure Sherman Congressman from California, Kimberly and the argument is that by trying to get Comey to lay-off of Mike Flynn, there's a basis for a charge of obstruction of justice. 
GUILFOYLE: That is laughable. He can take as articles of impeachment and help me with my winning pad for my dog and line it everywhere. There is no evidence to support that. They have over promised and under delivered. There will not be in impeachment of President Trump. There's no evidence that shows any collusion, any obstruction of justice, anything of the sort. Now, what are the Democrats going to do? What are they going to say to the constituents after they've been huffing and puffing, having the Russia vapors. 
GUTFELD: Weaning pad? 
GUILFOYLE: It keeps the house clean. 
WILLIAMS: Kimberly's point is well taken by a number of Democratic leaders. Adam Schmidt on the Intelligence Committee, Linda Sanchez, one of the leaders it says too early. Not enough facts. 
WATTERS: You guys have been saying that for quite some time. That is fine. I think you guys keep saying that. Push impeachment, behead people, and boycott this. 
WILLIAMS: They say don't do it. They are saying Green is wrong. 
WATTERS: Oh, they are saying Green is wrong? 
PERINO: Jesse. 
GUILFOYLE: Jesse... 
WATTERS: He is like the guy at the bar at 2:00 in the morning. And he tries to buy everybody a shot, but all his friends are not there anymore, he is that guy. Not even Pelosi -- is trying to buy -- -- 
WILLIAMS: Dana right now the polls had 43 percent of Americans want to see Donald Trump impeach and by the way this is just for Gregg but let him in on it, 63 percent professors want impeachment. 
PERINO: They will have to deal with headlines like this every day. They will miss opportunities to comment on the health care bill that -- there will be a vote before the August recess in the senate. That will go to President Trump for his signature. They need to not be so consumed with his impeachment. 
WILLIAMS: So Gregg, how would you impeach him, Greg? 
GUTFELD: It's like how you would spend your money when you win the lotto. It's never going to happen. Donald Trump is a fork. Republicans see them as a spoon and Democrat see him as a fork. 
WILLIAMS: But is like Lotto, you got to play to win. 
GUILFOYLE: Somebody won the lotto again today, somebody who didn't need the money, President Trump. 
WILLIAMS: Control, "One More Thing" up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WATTERS: Time now for "One More Thing." Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: We want to wish a very happy birthday to the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. He is 58 years young. And he looks fabulous. 
GUTFELD: I hate it when people say 58 years young. I banned that phrase. 
GUILFOYLE: They decorated with balloons and he is with his buddies and sent a nice tweet out today. He addressed NASA's newest class of astronauts. He is a very, very nice man. 
WATTERS: He is the president soon, if Al Green gets his way. Dana. 
PERINO: In the New York City subway, I have learned to use it. They don't let dogs on this. If you have a service dog, it is ok or if your dog can fit in a bag. I love New Yorkers because they figured out a way to put all these big dogs in really big bags. I got a little help from our fans. We are going to try it tomorrow. 
GUILFOYLE: That is hilarious. 
PERINO: I'm working on it. 
GUTFELD: Greg's amazing plugs. And no, they are not on my head. I got an article up on FoxNews.com/opinion it is my thoughts on terror, once again. Also, my podcast is up. It is Foxnewspodcast.com. It's an interview with Susie Breitbart. We talk at length about her husband and what she has been up to. I think it's the first time she is ever spoken in an interview. 
WILLIAMS: Check this out. All right everybody, check this out, in Los Angeles, a female peacock walks into a liquor store. Sounds like Dana's corny joke. No, this actually happened. The bird walks in. A store manager says he wasn't aware of the situation until the customer says, what about that big bird over there? The bird caused 500 hundreds of dollars worth of damage in 90 minutes. 
GUTFELD: Certainly no thunderbird. 
WATTERS: This is a resort in Ochoa Rios, Jamaica. This is one of the lifeguards sliding out of the water slide, apparently. This is not a fake video. He has been practicing this for two years. 
GUTFELD: It is fake! 
WATTERS: This is tearing up the internet right now. He crosses his legs and sits upright. 
GUTFELD: You are not listening. 
WATTERS: I choose to believe! 
GUILFOYLE: Did they investigate this? 
WATTERS: Hopefully not, because I want to believe this is true. Thanks for watching, "Hannity" is up next.
