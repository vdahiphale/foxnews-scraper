'Off the Record,' 1/6/15: Our tax code is huge, and so complicated, not even anyone in Congress understands it

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Do you know what is insane? This. Now, that is the U.S. tax code. Look at it. Look how big it is. Incredible, isn't it?
Blame both Republicans and Democrats. They're the ones who have both been adding to the tax code all these years, sticking in special deals for the lobbyists' pals, too. But do you want to know what is more insane than the giant size of that tax code? It's that members of Congress don't understand the tax code. That means most, if not all, don't even do their own taxes. They can't. They have to go out and hire someone themselves. Wild, isn't it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The very people who vote on the tax code can't figure out what they voted on? So today, as the new Congress gets sworn in and with all the promises from Congress and the president to end gridlock, my message for them is this: For God's sake, fix the tax code. And if you won't, at least give the rest of us the same deal Reverend Al Sharpton has. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
