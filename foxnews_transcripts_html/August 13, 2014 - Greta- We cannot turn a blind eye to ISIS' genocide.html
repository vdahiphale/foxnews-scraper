Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I hate war, and I'm war-weary. And I know you feel the exact same way.
These wars have been tough and really tough for some families. Some wars are necessary, but not all. The U.S. can't police the world, and we can't solve every problem of every nation. We have a lot of problems here at home we need to attend to. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How do we decide when we should get involved with problems thousands of miles away and for people we haven't even met? I would go back and forth. Only, I can't stand to see people suffer. But I'm not in the military, so I won't be risking my life in war. Others, our troops, will be doing that. So how do we decide? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Last night, at 7:00 p.m., ON THE RECORD, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North said this: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH, FOX HOST, "WAR STORIES": If we don't take steps now to prevent this from happening, 25 years from now our kids and grandkids will say, what were you doing, because you can't claim you didn't know about it? People still say they didn't know about the Holocaust until the 1940s. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Ollie is right. What happened to Jews in the Holocaust is absolutely unthinkable. Some claimed not to know. But this time, we all know. No one has an excuse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What is going on in Iraq could be genocide, and the world looked the other way 20 years ago with the genocide in Rwanda. Let's not make that grievous mistake again. We have to stop ISIS, whatever it takes. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
