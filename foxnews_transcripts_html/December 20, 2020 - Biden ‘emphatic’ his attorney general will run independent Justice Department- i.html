CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.President-elect Biden's nominees facing scrutiny from both the right andleft, one month from inauguration day.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  They are people of the highest character,varied experiences and background.WALLACE (voice-over):  Joe Biden putting together his administration, butwill the Senate vote to confirm his cabinet? Plus, growing pressure for aspecial counsel to investigate the president-elect's son Hunter.We'll discuss it all with incoming White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki,only on "FOX News Sunday."And is this the last COVID relief package or will there be more to come inthe new administration?We'll talk with a number three Republican in the Senate, John Barrasso.Plus, the most serious hack ever of the U.S. government and all signs pointto Russia. We'll ask our Sunday panel what's at risk and how the U.S.should respond.And our Power Player of the Week, a mission to lay wreaths at ArlingtonNational cemetery goes on despite COVID.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.It may be Christmas week but the nation's capital feels under siege thesedays. Congress is working through the weekend, still trying to strike adeal to provide more than $900 billion in COVID relief.Meanwhile, the pandemic is setting new records every day for infections,hospitalizations, and deaths. And if that isn't enough, we're learning moreeach day about a devastating cyberattack of government agencies, apparentlyby the Russians.In a moment, we'll speak with Jen Psaki, the incoming press secretary inthe Biden White House.But, first, let's bring in Mark Meredith with the latest on fast-movingdevelopments on several fronts -- Mark.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, lawmakers reached a major --were able to pass through a major conflict overnight in their effort tomake a deal on the economic stimulus package. A deal on this could happenas early as this afternoon, this as the government is set to run out ofmoney yet again tonight.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH (voice-over):  Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer telling leaderslast night that a deal is very close, now that Republican Senator PatToomey has agreed to drop broad language that would have limited theFederal Reserve's powers past the pandemic.SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA):  Fiscal and social policy is the rightful realm ofthe people who are accountable to the American people, and that's us.MEREDITH:  Democrats had accused Toomey of trying to limit President-electBiden's economic options come January.Meantime at the White House, President Trump continues to keep a lowprofile, except on Twitter.On Saturday, he tweeted: China, not Russia, may be responsible for amassive cyber attack that hit government and corporate networks. His tweetcontradicting his own secretary of state.MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE:  This was a very significant effort, and Ithink it's the case that now can say pretty clearly that it was theRussians that engaged in this activity.MEREDITH:  Lawmakers from both parties blamed Russia for the hack and aredemanding retaliation but the president appears focused elsewhere. He'sdemanding more investigations into claims of voter fraud and the Bidenfamily.(END VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH (on camera):  Attorney General Bill Barr is set to leave his jobon Wednesday. Meantime, there's been a lot of chatter about the possibilitythe president could try to appoint two special counsels, one to investigatehis claims of voter fraud, also Hunter Biden.So far, Chris, no comment from the White House -- Chris.WALLACE:  Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thank you.And joining us now, incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki.Jen, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday".JEN PSAKI, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning, Chris.Great -- thanks for having me, Chris. Great to be here.WALLACE:  This week, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, JenO'Malley Dillon, talked about working with Republicans. And here's what shesaid: I'm not saying they're not a bunch of F-ers. Mitch McConnell isterrible.She later apologized for the words but not the sentiment.Why does President-elect Biden think he's going to be able to do businesswith such people?PSAKI:  Well, first, Chris, I know everybody is busy around this holidayseason, but I encourage everybody to read the full context of herinterview, and what she really talked about through the course of theinterview was the importance of working together, that compromise isessential, that we need to listen to one another.So, you know, of course, I'm sure her mother didn't like the word she used,but that's a sentiment that the president-elect has sent all of us andwe're expected to work toward that goal.You know, I don't think we are naive, Chris, about how hard it may be attimes. There is disagreement in Washington, we all know that. We've allbeen around this town for some time, but we're hopeful that because of thecrises we're facing from the pandemic, to millions of people out of work,that we'll be able to make progress. And the deal that we're seeing cometogether is a small sign of evidence of that.WALLACE:  Then, there are the Biden nominees for top positions in thecabinet, which are drawing fire from both the right and the left.Here are some examples of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  It's so disappointing to see him continue to rollout these far-left nominees that belied the points he's made since theelection that he wants to govern and a sense of unity or from the middle.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  If you're asking me, have we seen the kind ofprogressive appointments or nominations that I would like to see, theanswer is not yet.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  When Republicans say there's no chance they'll confirm NeeraTanden as budget director, when some Democrats say they won't approve awaiver to let retired General Lloyd Austin serve as defense secretary, doesPresident-elect Biden, Jen, think that they're bluffing?PSAKI:  I don't think President-elect Biden would nominate anyone he didn'tthink was qualified and didn't think should deserve consideration andconfirmation by the United States Senate.And, look, we didn't expect that every nominee would be embraced by everycorner of our political system. That's simply impossible in the environmentwe're living through. But all these nominees, many of the ones you'vementioned, have already spent time meeting with members, Democrats, manyhave met with Republicans. That will continue in January.And we are hopeful that the Senate will move quickly to confirm nomineeswho will be addressing the crises we face, Chris.We need people leaving these departments to help address the pandemic,rebuild our place in the world.I don't think anyone would question the qualifications of people like JanetYellen, Tony Blinken, Ale Mayorkas and many others who the vice president -- the president-elect has nominated.WALLACE:  After the Electoral College voted this week to make Joe Biden thepresident, he said this. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  The flame of democracy was lit in thisnation a long time ago and we now know nothing, not even a pandemic or anabuse of power can extinguish that flame.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Does the president-elect believed -- his use of the phrase abuseof power, does he believe that President Trump has engaged in an abuse ofpower in the way he has contested the selection?PSAKI:  Look, Chris, we've had a lot of conversations about thisinternally. There's been dozens of lawsuits, as you know, across thecountry that President Trump has tried to overturn the election through.They've all failed.What our focus at this point is, is on getting the president-electinaugurated a month from today, facing the pandemic, getting the pandemicunder control, putting millions of people back to work. It doesn't take usto say there have been moments where there haven't been abuses of power.Others have certainly said that, but our focus is on doing the work of theAmerican people, and we're trying to keep our blinders on with that.WALLACE:  Well, let me ask you about a report in "The New York Times"today, as recently as Friday, President Trump in the Oval Office discussedthe possibility of seizing voting machines, even discussed the possibilityof invoking martial law.Your reaction to those reports?PSAKI:  Well, Chris, I'll leave it to others you will have on your paneltoday and others you have as guest to explain what on Earth is happening inthe Oval Office and the White House.But, you know, as I noted, it's actually a month from today that President-elect Joe Biden will take the oath of office and there's just too muchgoing on in this country, from thousands of people dying every day ofCOVID, to millions of people out of work, to relationships that have longbeen frayed over the last four years for us to worry too much aboutwhatever is happening in the Oval Office.We know that although he has tried to challenge the results of theelection, they were certified this last week. Leadership of the RepublicanParty has acknowledged the outcome of the election. And we started to seesome work together to get nominees confirmed, to get packages in place.That's where focus is going to be in the weeks ahead.WALLACE:  You have said several times and it's exactly right that a monthfrom today, Joe Biden will be on the west front of the Capitol and take theoath of office.Does the president-elect care whether Donald Trump attends theinauguration? Does he even want him there?PSAKI:  I would say it's not on the top-ten list or even longer than that,of his focus or priorities at this point time. Chris, as you know, andyou've covered many transitions, I've been a part of transitions myself.This is not a traditional transition, but I will say we have had a greatdeal of cooperation from the men and women who have been serving the civilservice at agencies across the government. That's been encouraging.They are the heart and soul of the government and how the governmentcontinues year after year after year through Democratic and Republicanpresidents. There have been limited, you know, cases of, you know, abruptbehavior, including at times from the president himself, the president ofthe United States himself.But our focus is, we're not going to worry about that. Our focus is ongetting the president-elect inaugurated, on pursuing our agenda movingforward, on getting the pandemic under control, on taking on the herculeantask of distributing the vaccine, which is going to be a big part of ourfocus in the first couple of months. And so, we're not too worried aboutwho does or does not attend the inauguration.WALLACE:  Stephen Colbert asked President-elect Biden this week about theinvestigation of his son, Hunter, and this was the response from Mr. Biden.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  I'm not concerned about any accusations that have been made againsthim. It's used to get to me. I think it's kind of foul play. But look, itis what it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Afterwards, you clarified that when Mr. Biden talked about foulplay, he was talking about politicians, Republicans playing politics withthe attacks on Joe Biden. He wasn't talking about the investigation itself.So let me ask you directly, does the President-elect Biden believe that theinvestigation of his son Hunter on tax issues, does he believe that's alegitimate investigation?PSAKI:  Well, first, Chris, let me say, to the credit of FOX, you reportedthe context of the question accurately, which had nothing to do with aninvestigation. It was about Hunter being used as a political cudgel in apartisan way and a question to the president-elect about how he would workacross the aisle and work with Democrats and Republicans to get thingsdone. So, that was actually the question.To his credit, through the course of that questioning, he said, regardlessof the attacks on his family at times, he would do what's right for theAmerican people.There will be -- he's working and thinking now, no decision has been made,about who he's going to nominate to be the attorney general. He's beenemphatic that that person will oversee an independent department. He'slooking for someone of the highest level of integrity.And that person, whomever it is, will be overseeing whatever investigationsare happening at the Department of Justice, and that's how it should work,frankly, Chris. So that's what we will be rely on -- relying on movingforward.WALLACE:  Let me -- let me pursue that a little bit with you, Jen, becausethere is a lot of concern among Republicans as to whether or not PresidentBiden is going to stop the investigation of his son.So, a couple of specifics here -- does he promise to let David Weiss, whois the U.S. attorney in Delaware, who is currently conducting theinvestigation of Hunter Biden,  does he promise to allow him to finish thejob? And what does he think of President Trump possibly appointing aspecial counsel to conduct an independent investigation of Hunter Biden?PSAKI:  Well, let me be crystal clear, Chris, and I appreciate you askingthis question. He will not be discussing an investigation of his son withany attorney general candidates. He will not be discussing it with anyonehe is considering for the role, and he will not be discussing it with thefuture attorney general.It will be up to the purview of a future attorney general and hisadministration to determine how to handle any investigation.As you know, U.S. attorneys are -- that's a personnel decision. We're farfrom there at this point in the process, given we haven't announced yet anattorney general, a commerce secretary, a labor secretary, an educationsecretary. We have few more to go.But we're going to allow the process to work how it should, which is for aJustice Department to be run independently by the attorney general at thetop.WALLACE:  Finally, there has been some criticism recently fromconservatives, including some conservatives on FOX News, about the factthat First Lady to-be Jill Biden goes by the title "doctor".I wonder, what is the Bidens' reaction to that given the fact that so manypeople over the years -- I think of Dr. Henry Kissinger, the Reverend Dr.Martin Luther King, have gone by the title doctor even though they're notmedical doctors, and nobody seems to have made a fuss about that?PSAKI:  That's exactly right, Chris. It's a bit perplexing to me and I'msure to millions Americans, that with thousands of people dying every dayof COVID, millions out of work, that anyone wake up in the morning anddecide that the focus they need to have, the way they contribute to societythat day is to question whether or not Dr. Jill Biden, someone who is stillteaching, who has a PhD in education, should be called a doctor or not.Of course she should. As anyone who works through that challenging processof getting a PhD. It's a really silly, sexist, and absurd conversationthat's happening a bit in society, and I appreciate you asking me about it.WALLACE:  Jen, thank you. Thanks for your time.PSAKI:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Please come back and merry Christmas.Up next, relief for millions -- PSAKI:  Merry Christmas to you too and happy holidays.WALLACE:  Thank you.Up next, relief for millions of struggling Americans and businesses hangsin the balance as Congress is still negotiating over a COVID reliefpackage. A member of the Republican Senate leadership, John Barrasso, joinsus next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Lawmakers are still working on a deal to close out negotiationson a nearly trillion dollar COVID relief package. It would provide morethan $300 billion in aid to small businesses, $300 a week in federaljobless benefits and $600 in individual stimulus checks.Joining us now from Capitol Hill, the number three Republican in theSenate, John Barrasso.Senator, where do we stand on COVID relief talks? I understand there's alot of parliamentary rigmarole, but what are the chances that all sideswill sign on to an agreement today?SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): This gets done today. No more delays. We're notleaving until we have relief of the American people.People are hurting, people need help and there are two things we need to doto write this final chapter on coronavirus, and one is to get peoplevaccinated. We're doing that now. Twenty million people will be vaccinatedby the end of this -- by New Year's Eve.But we need to provide help for the American public, people who have beenstruggling, until we get enough people vaccinated that we can fully get theeconomy back on track. And that means people back to work and kids back toschool. So direct payment checks to the American people, $600.For people who are watching, Chris, if they got a check last time, theywill get a check again this time. Adults and children.For people who are out of work, through no fault of their own, $300 a weekfor enhanced unemployment going into next year. And for the smallbusinesses and the working families all across America, we were going to domore paycheck protection loans so those small businesses can stay open, sopeople can get paychecks all the way through.This has been a very successful program. Thirteen thousand small businessesin Wyoming have used this program. It's a little more specific this time inthat the business has to be fewer than 300 employees and they actually haveto show a loss. But that's the way we get this disease behind us.WALLACE:  I -- I want to just hone down on one point specifically. I knowthat you worked out the issue about emergency lending authority to the Fed,but then just after midnight last night, this morning, President Trump saidhe wanted to see the direct payments higher, bigger than the three -- $600to each American who got one last time. I take it you're not going to goalong with changing that part of the program?BARRASSO:  We need to get this done today. The president is right in thatthis is no fault of the American people.Chris, we should have done this months ago had not Mancy Pelosi playpolitics through the fall because of the presidential election. She'sadmitted as much. We've had a bill pretty comparable to what we're going topass today and we've offered it by Republicans time and time again. TheDemocrats beat it down 40 different times. This has been wrong. The delayhas been too long. We need to get it done now for Christmas. WALLACE:  After the Electoral College voted this week to make Joe Biden thenext president of the United States, Senator Mitch McConnell addressed theissue on the Senate floor.Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The Electoral College has spoken. So today Iwant to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  You were asked that same day whether or not Joe Biden is now thepresident-elect, and you dismissed it as a gotcha question.How, Senator, is it a gotcha to ask who is going to be the president onemonth from today?BARRASSO:  Well, first, you know how the press is sometimes in the halls ofCongress. If you don't give a one-word answer, they're not satisfied. Italked to them about the fact that the Constitution Article Two SectionOne, and the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, and I accept what hashappened in the election and with the Electoral College.Look, I was one of over 70 percent of the people of Wyoming proud to helpand vote for President Trump. Over 70 million Americans have done that.He's done remarkable things. I don't believe we would have a vaccine todayif it weren't for President Trump's determination. And all of us(INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  Senator --BARRASSO:  And so it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to, but theElectoral College has now certified the election. We have thatConstitution. And I accept the outcome of the election.WALLACE:  Well, so let me ask you directly, will Joe Biden be the nextpresident of the United States?BARRASSO:  Yes, he will.WALLACE:  You accept that?BARRASSO:  I do.WALLACE:  OK, that -- that wasn't so hard.You wrote an article for "The Wall Street Journal" recently in which youcriticized how Democrats delayed confirming members of the Trump cabinet inthe month he came in, in January of 2017. I want to put up on the screenwhat you wrote.Mr. Clinton had 13 out of 14 in January when he came in. Mr. Obama, 11 outof 15. Senate Democrats made sure Mr. Trump only had three.Senator, are you going to play the Democrats' game of delay, what they didto Donald Trump back in 2017, or can you promise swift confirmation of hisnominees, and are there any of the names you've heard so far who youconsider dead on arrival?BARRASSO:  Well, a couple of things. It looks like the Biden cabinet wouldbe third term of the Obama administration. And that didn't sit really wellin Wyoming.We have a role to advise and consent on these nominees, which is why theelection coming up in Georgia is so critical in the control of the Senate,and why I want to make sure that Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue getelected there, because if you don't -- if you want accountability, and notjust a rubber stamp for a Joe Biden cabinet, you need to have people likeme as chairman of the Energy Committee.So we'll have hearings, ask the tough questions, but we are not going toforget what happened with President Trump's administration and the delayedprocess that went through it. The -- so it's not going to be a garden partyif the Republicans are in the majority. These nominees are going to have torun the gauntlet.In terms of specific nominees that you ask about. I'm from Wyoming. It's anenergy state.Here's my concern. With regards to energy, Joe Biden has repeatedly saidthat he's against a lot of exploration for energy, a lot of exporting ofenergy. So his nominee for the secretary of energy has said this. She said,we ought to be doing everything we possibly can to keep fossil fuel energyin the ground.The impact of that on our economy, on jobs, it is -- it cuts the throat ofmy state, our economy, the men and women who work there, the energy thatAmerica needs. It's going to drive up costs significantly for Americanfamilies. So you bet I'm going to ask tough questions.WALLACE:  Finally, President Trump says that he is going to veto the NDAA,the Defense Authorization Act that funds the Pentagon, funds an Air Forcebase in your state of Wyoming, and that includes 26 new measures that woulddeal with cyber defense. This, of course, in the -- in the wake of thisterrible cyber hack that we've -- that we've had this week.If the president goes ahead with his promise, and he says he's going toveto it, then he would have to, by this Wednesday, will you vote tooverride that veto, sir?BARRASSO:  Well, first, I would discourage him from vetoing. I wouldencourage him to sign it, especially with this new cyber hack where we wereblindsided. Chris, as a nation, six different agencies have been attackedin our government. And this has been going on since March.We need to have a forceful, affective, punishing response so people pay aprice for this, think twice about doing it again. And one of the thingsthat the president could do in spite of his concerns about the NationalDefense Authorization Act is to sign this, let this bill become law. That'swhat my recommendation is to the president so he doesn't face the situationof a veto override.WALLACE:  And in 15 seconds, will you personally, if he goes ahead andvetoes it, as he says he will, will you vote override, sir?BARRASSO:  We need to have this signed into law. I'm encouraging thepresident to do that. If it comes to the House and -- and to the Senate,I'm going to be in a position where I'm going to have to make thatdecision. It would be much better for the country for the president to signit.WALLACE:  Senator Barrasso, thank you. Thanks for joining us. Good luck oncoming up with that deal you promised for today on COVID relief and happyholidays, sir.BARRASSO:  We're going to get it done. Merry Christmas, Chris.WALLACE:  Thank you.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday panel to break down the massive hack ofthe U.S. government and what it means for some of the nation's biggestsecrets.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, one of the biggest cyber attacks in history puts theU.S. government and some of its top secrets in jeopardy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  It has all the hallmarks and fingerprints ofVladimir Putin project.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel how serious is the risk to nationalsecurity? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): This is nothing short of a virtual invasion by theRussians into critical accounts of our federal government.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Democratic Senator Dick Durbin assigningblame directly to Russia for the massive cyber hack of U.S. agencies.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Co-founder of "The Federalist" Ben Domenech, Susan Page of "USA Today," andFox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, we are learning more about this massive hack of U.S. governmentagencies and also private businesses every day. We now know what we believeto be the Russians breached the State Department, Treasury, HomelandSecurity, Energy, including the agency that maintains our nuclear weaponsstockpile, and the National Institute of Health, plus other departments.And the attack began as early as last March.Ben, how serious is this breaching of our -- our government computer wallsand is a cyber act of war?BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, "THE FEDERALIST": Well, first, I think it'sincredibly serious. Obviously, you can't underplay that. I will say thatmany of these agencies have actually had problems in the past, particularlythe nation's nuclear labs, that should be concerning to all of us.As for the act of war language, I think that's a little irresponsible.Traditionally, of course, acts of war have included kinetic action, or theloss of personnel or material. I think that this is something that's alittle too early to say in that regard.I'd like to see more of the evidence regarding this attack. What we knowabout it. Where it specifically came from in terms of the Russiangovernment. And I think that that's something that the American peopleshould expect after having so many of these intelligence experts comeforward, make serious claims regarding this being an act of war and thelike. I think that we deserve to know a bit more about what went on here.And particularly why something that started in March has taken this long tobecome known by us. I mean was everyone asleep at the wheel? There's someserious questions, I think, here that need to be answered. And that needsto be something that I think is brought to the American people before wemove forward with any kind of response.WALLACE: Susan, there's another question a lot of people are asking, whichis why President Trump has been so silent about this attack since word cameout.Here is Mitt Romney this week on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Not to have the White House aggressively speakingout and protesting and -- and taking punitive action is really, reallyquite extraordinary.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Yesterday, the president did speak out to downplay the hack,tweeting, the cyber hack is far greater in the fake news media than inactuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control.Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens becauselame stream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing thepossibility that it may be China. It may!Susan, how do you explain the president's response, a direct contradictionof what his own Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, that he believes it'spretty clear now it's Russia, and people across the government saying thiswas a very serious breach?SUSAN PAGE, "USA TODAY": Well, Chris, I think one of the continuingmysteries of the Trump presidency is his attitude towards Russia, hisfriendliness to -- his unwillingness to hold Russia to account, even tosuch egregious actions as we're seeing now with this cyberattack. I don'tthink we really understand that yet. I hope one day that we will.But here we find a new president about to take over in one month with the -- kind of with the same situation that Trump faced when he took over, whichis his biggest foreign policy challenge is going to be figuring out how torespond to Russian aggression in 2016. It was Russian effort to meddle inour election. And now this incredible act of aggression against ourgovernment and more with this cyberattack.I agree with Ben that we need to learn more about what exactly has happenedand why it took so long for the united states to identify this act ofaggression.WALLACE: Juan, the fact is that President Trump has basically been out ofsight now for almost a week while there are a lot of things, a lot of veryserious developments going on, not just the cyber hack.Here is Senator Chris Coons on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): President Trump, what is he doing today? Is hehelping respond to the pandemic? Is he helping us pass a bipartisan reliefbill? Is he helping us respond to this Russian attack? No, he's sending outtweets about an election that's been over more than a month and he'spreparing more pardons.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Juan, what's going on here?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: It's not a partisan assessment,Chris. You know, it's not just Senator Coons. By all accounts, thepresident has been preoccupied, busy if you will, tweeting out conspiracytheories, nursing grudges to explain why he lost the election.Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump partisan, has said the president still seeshimself as pursuing every vote, as if the election is still going on. So Ithink you have to understand, that's the president's mind-set at themoment, this kind of sulking and grousing.And I must say, it has helped him in one regard, he's raised $200 millionplus that he can now carry beyond the White House with him in terms of apolitical action committee and the like.But I think it's -- it's not a partisan statement to say that hisnarcissism has allowed him to look away from the extraordinary amount ofdeaths we as Americans have been suffering due to COVID, to look away frommuch of the stimulus talks that hopefully are drawing to a close today.And, of course, to -- I mean it's unbelievable, you know, just to go backto what Ben and Susan have said, his attitude about what is a very serioushack into America's information systems. And that could undermine theoperation of our government.WALLACE: Let's find out whether or not it's partisan.Ben, is it unfair to ask where President Trump is as the nation faces allof these challenges, not just the hack, but COVID relief, the explosion ofthe pandemic. Is it unfair to ask where the -- why the president isn'tfocusing on that more, at least in public?DOMENECH: Well, I think the president's response to the pandemic is thedelivery of the vaccine that we've seen happen in this past month in a waythat is absolutely unprecedented.To go back to the hack issue for a minute, as a Bush political appointee, Iwas caught up in China's hack of the Office of Personnel Management inwhich they gathered the records and the top-secret interviews related toapproval for that kind of access for millions and millions of Americans whoworked for the government, for the military and the like. What I got inresponse to that was a letter from the Obama administration promising thatI would have a credit check run, a free credit check, on my behalf and ahandful of sanctions of Chinese officials. So this whole idea that theadministration -- that this administration's response to this hack issomething that is, you know, in any way kind of held back, it seems to be alittle bit premature given the last experience that we had with a majorforeign power adversary hacking us in a very deep way.I want to know more about what happened. I want to know who wasresponsible. And I do want to see a serious response to it from thepresident and this administration and the Biden administration as wellWALLACE: All right, panel, we are going to have to leave it there. But whenwe come back, we'll discuss Joe Biden's cabinet picks and the heat he isgetting from all sides.That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): We need to conclude our talks, draftlegislation, and land this plane.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I agree with the Republican leader on this. Weneed to deliver an outcome and deliver it quickly.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: A taste of the debate on the Senate floor yesterday and thecontinuing stalemate over providing COVID relief.And we're back now with the panel.Susan, the need for COVID relief is so clear. Let's take a look at thelatest numbers on the economy. And 885,000 people applied for newunemployment claims just last week. More than 20 million workers arecollecting unemployment. And retail sales dropped 1.1 percent in November,a bad start to the holiday season.Susan, we heard John Barrasso promise us that they're going to at leastmake the deal, even if they don't pass the bill today. But given how clearthe need is, the fact that the economy seems to be headed downward again,why has it been so hard for the Senate and the House, Republicans andDemocrats, to pass COVID relief?PAGE: Yes, what -- what took so long? And the deal that they've ended upwith is the outlines of a deal that you could have predicted last April andMay in which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave up on his demandfor liability protection and Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, and Democrats in theHouse, relented on their demand for billions in state and local aid. Thatwas a deal that you could have predicted months ago. The need for it wasalso clear months ago. You know, it seems to be the responsibility goes toall of them for having taken so long to get to the point that they are now,to have some kind of deal.And this -- of course, this is not going to be the end of this debatebecause we know that President-elect Biden is going to come back withproposals for additional aid, big packages. Once he takes over, this debatewill be revisited. But I think a lot of Americans would wonder why thiscouldn't have been done earlier at a time when the need has been so clearfor so long.WALLACE: Juan, I think one reason that you're seeing progress and perhaps adeal now is because Nancy Pelosi is willing to settle for a lot less moneybecause she, knowing that Joe Biden is going to be the president on January20th, she's confident that he will come back and ask for -- for more money.A couple of questions, though, about Pelosi. One, did she make a mistakeholding out so long for $2 trillion, even $3 trillion in COVID relief, andis she making a mistake now in assuming that just because Joe Biden isgoing to ask for more money after he becomes president, that theRepublicans in Congress, particularly in the Senate, will go along andapprove it?WILLIAMS: Well, you've got to have a negotiating partner, Chris, in termsof the Pelosi strategy.Remember, President Trump and most of the Republicans, especially in theSenate, were opposed to added spending. They saw it as maybe going a littletoo far after the first spending bill way back. And President Trumpinitially joined them and opposed added spending and then changed his tuneand he wanted even more spending than many in -- Republican in the Senatecould abide.So the president and Mitch McConnell never quite got together on the samepage on this and they have been, you know, to me, the question is, whyhaven't they, given the urgency of the matter, been together to negotiatewith Pelosi? The Treasury secretary was negotiating with Pelosi for awhile, but McConnell, the Senate majority leader, didn't buy into it andthat left everything kind of in abeyance.So I think you have to say, at this point, we have a tremendous need forthis help and you have to say it's been across-the-board in terms of this.Now, in terms of Pelosi's strategy with Biden, the hope is that they canget something done, but there's no guarantee.WALLACE: Meanwhile, President-elect Biden continues to staff up hisadministration.Here he was just yesterday announcing his nominees for energy and climatejobs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: Like their fellow cabinetnominees and appointees, members of our environmental and energy team arebrilliant, they're qualified, tested and they are barrier-busting.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Ben, what do you make of the Biden team so far? The one heannounced yesterday, the ones he's announced so far. What does it tell youabout how he intends to govern? And you heard John Barrasso say if theRepublicans control the Senate, it's not going to be a garden party forthese nominees. What do you think are the chances that -- that a couple ofthem might get taken down?DOMENECH: Well, we always see one or two of them get taken down, Chris, andI'm sure that that will happen again this time. It will be interesting tosee which ones they are. There's always one that seems to stick out as alightning rod and then another one who maybe is a surprise, you know alittle bit of a dark horse candidate to get taken down by, you know, anopposing Senate.I think that what you do see generally with a lot of these choices is thatthey are very much people who are close to Biden personally and to his teamand that they are kind of checking identity politics boxes as opposed toideology boxes when it comes to pleasing the progressives on Capitol Hill.And just circling back to the previous issue, I would just note to Juan,that the framework of this deal was always there. It was there throughoutthe summer. Nancy Pelosi made a political bet that it would be better to gointo the election without it. And the ultimate reaction to that bet wasthat Donald Trump lost but so did all of her moderates who would have beensupported in many ways by having a deal of this nature go forward. I thinkthat that was a miscalculation on her part and she wouldn't have ended upwith such a narrow majority when it comes to actually getting things done.Essentially, I think the House is going to be ungovernable for the next twoyears because of it.WALLACE: Susan, let me pick up on -- on the question of the -- of the Bidenteam. Lots of criticism from the left. People like Bernie Sanders andAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez that Biden has not paid back a -- a sizableportion of the Democratic Party that helped him get elected in the firstplace.PAGE: Hey, big surprise. Biden beat Bernie Sanders for the nomination witha centrist message. He then won the White House with a centrist message. SoI think we should not be surprised if -- that he -- these appointments havea sort of centrist characteristic.I kind of agree with -- with Ben that they're -- they're -- they'reremarkably groundbreaking in terms of their diversity of race and ethnicityand gender, but they are not groundbreaking in terms of ideology. They arewell-established, very experienced people, many of them with history in theObama administration and that is the kind of administration that Joe Bidenpromised to give us when he won the election. So, no surprises there, Idon't think.WALLACE: You know, Juan, I keep thinking back to the campaign, and whenPresident Trump kept talking about the fact that Joe Biden was going to bea tool of the left, or to tool of various other interests. What strikes meabout the group that we've seen here is, yes, Biden is willing to listen toall the various interest groups in his party, both political groups andcivil rights groups and, you know, various other groups. But, in the end,he is basically doing what he wants to do. And, yes, he's certainly, and I-- I agree with -- with Ben and Susan in terms of identity politics,there's a real diversity. But it's pretty -- a group with whom, on anideological front, a policy front, he seems pretty comfortable.WILLIAMS: Chris, I think you should go to the racetrack today becauseyou've got a trifecta on the panel here. You have total agreement that, infact, Joe Biden is a centrist. He's a moderate. He was never a Trojan horsefor the far left or a socialist.WALLACE: You know, that's one of the nice things about being president, youget to do what you want to do.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday and Merry Christmas to all of you.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week," honoring America's veterans duringthis holiday season.Plus, our annual visit from the Wallace grandkids. And there's a surprisevisitor.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: It's a Christmas tradition here to share the story of how onefamily has found a way to express the meaning of the holiday season. Butbecause of COVID, it almost didn't happen this year.Arlington National Cemetery announced it would be closed to volunteers, butthe secretary of the Army quickly reversed that decision.Once again, here's our "Power Player of the Week." (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MORRILL WORCESTER, FOUNDER, WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA: We wouldn't have theopportunities if it wasn't for the people that fought for us and who gavetheir lives for us.WALLACE (voice over): It's that plainspoken wisdom that has driven MorrillWorcester for years on a mission that has touched America's heart.Each December, Worcester places wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, andthousands of volunteers are there to help him.WORCESTER: I think a lot of people think like I do, and they just want to -- you know, they appreciate the veterans and they want to show it.WALLACE: This story begins back in 1962 when Worcester, then a 12-year-oldpaperboy from Maine, won a trip to Washington. What impressed him most wasArlington, it's beauty and dignity and those rows and rows of graves.WORCESTER: Everyone represents a life and a family and a story. They're notjust tombstones. I mean those are all people.WALLACE: Thirty years later, in 1992, Worcester was running his own wreathcompany in Harrington, Maine. But as Christmas approached, he had a bunchleft over.WORCESTER: These wreathes were real fresh and right just made. And I justdidn't want to throw them away.WALLACE: He thought of Arlington and all those graves. When the cemeteryapproved, he and a dozen volunteers drove the wreaths down and laid them onthe headstones. And so it continued for years until a few Christmases backwhen an Air Force sergeant took this picture, which ended up on theInternet.WORCESTER: It kind of struck a nerve and people e-mailed it to each otherand it really went around the world.WALLACE: We were there the next year as he and his workers at the WorcesterWreath Company loaded up 5,265 wreathes. Then they embarked on whatWorcester calls the world's longest veteran's parade, a 750 mile journeythat at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles. And when they got toArlington, so many people wanted to participate.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The ceremony you are about to witness is an Army WreathLaying Ceremony, to be conducted for the Worcester Wreath Company.WALLACE: For years, Worcester paid for all of this out of his own pocket.And he started Wreaths Across America, sending hundreds to cemeteries andwar memorials around the country. But he will need help to reach his newgoal.WORCESTER: I think around 2.7 million graves, and that's a tall order todecorate 2.7 million graves. So --WALLACE (on camera): But you'd like to do it, wouldn't you?WORCESTER: I really would, yes. Sometime, I don't know how, but, hey, youknow.WALLACE: How long are you going to keep doing this?WORCESTER: I'm going to keep doing it for as long as I work, and then Iknow my family is going to continue. So it'll be here for a long time.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And so, for the 29th year in a row, Morrill Worcester got to keephis Christmas promise. This month, volunteers placed 1.7 million wreaths onVeterans graves in more than 2,500 locations, including 257,000 wreaths atArlington.And now another Christmas tradition.
