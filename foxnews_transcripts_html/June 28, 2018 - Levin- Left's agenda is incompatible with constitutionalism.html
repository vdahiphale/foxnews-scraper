SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to "Hannity." My opening monologue in just a few minutes. 
But, first, as you know, from all the reporting today, tragedy strikes a Maryland. Earlier today, an armed gunmen killed and seriously injured multiple individuals at a newspaper office. This in Annapolis, Maryland. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Joining us now with the very latest on this is Kristin Fisher.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kristin, tough day for everybody there. Can you update us on what's going on?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sean. Well, police are now confirming that this was indeed a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper. Now, we still don't know if the shooter had a problem with the paper as a whole or with individual employees at the paper. But police says this was a targeted attack and this shooter came in around 2:30 today with a shotgun and smoke grenades. 
He walked through the first floor of the building, which is this brick building just behind me, and he went through shooting and killing five people, injuring about two more. The police responded, just a ridiculous response time, one minute, maybe just over 60 seconds. Police were there. They went in and they were able to take that shooter into custody without firing a single shot.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just a horrible day here, but police across the board are saying this could have been so much worse if the first responders did not respond as quickly as they did. 
Now, a little bit more about the shooter as they did. As I said, he's in custody and police say that they are in the process of interviewing him but he has been very uncooperative.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, there was a press conference about half an hour ago. In that press conference, the Anne Arundel deputy police chief could not confirm what I'm about to tell you but Fox has confirmed with a separate Maryland law enforcement official that they were able to identify the gunmen using facial recognition software because -- they had to do that because he mutilated his fingertips in an apparent attempt to make it very difficult to identify him. He didn't have any ID on him. He wouldn't tell the law enforcement what his name was, so they had to use facial recognition software to identify him.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, that's why police are saying that he was very well-prepared for this attack. He had it well-planned. He thought it through. 
Now, police are going through the process of securing his house and getting search warrants so that they can search for the -- search his property. As for this paper, Sean, one reporter said that I can tell you this, quote, we are putting out a damn paper tomorrow, Sean. 
HANNITY: Premeditated evil. Kristin, thank you for that report. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And a real thank you to all those in law enforcement. Sixty seconds, you can't get a better response time. And it looks like they saved a lot of lives. 
All right. We turn to our opening monologue. And we'll start with today's huge showdown on Capitol Hill. 
The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the FBI Director Christopher Wray appearing before the House Judiciary Committee where they were grilled by members of Congress. It was a beat down. We have so many highlights to bring you tonight, including the worst moments from the very short tempered, extremely pompous Rod Rosenstein, who I'm told who doesn't like me.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the deputy A.G. is continuing to obstruct the U.S. House of Representatives and their subpoenas in its effort to check and do their constitutional duty and investigate actions by the FBI and DOJ. Now, House Republicans are fighting back hard, contempt, impeachment, tonight is very much on the table.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also tonight, America's left is ramping up, as I predicted, their disgusting rhetoric, political tactics ahead of the 2018 midterms, and some are actually trying to forcibly shut down Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices across the country. Others are calling for the complete abolition of ICE. 
Meanwhile many in the media, well, as we predicted, a full mental psychotic breakdown over the news that Justice Anthony Kennedy is retired. Now, it's been a very bad week for Democrats.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sit tight. We've got all of this and so much more and we are following all the details out of Annapolis, Maryland, in our breaking news opening monologue.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: So, for over a year, House Republicans have desperately been trying to conduct what is their constitutional oversight duties and properly investigate how the FBI and the DOJ handled, well, really, mishandled the Clinton server investigation. We know she committed felonies. We know she obstructed justice.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also, the ongoing Russia collusion witch hunt and the FISA abuse, lying to FISA court judges is by an opposition party candidates in an election year. Now, sadly their efforts, their document requests, their subpoenas, they have been met with nothing but obstruction and hatred, antipathy, and animus from the deputy A.G., who has a bad temper, Rod Rosenstein. 
And today, some of these House members had a rare opportunity to hold Rosenstein accountable right to his face. It started with this powerful opening statement from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. Take a look.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: The recent inspector general's report revealed bias in the top echelons of the FBI during a hotly contested presidential election. It revealed that FBI agents, lawyers, and analysts hold profound biases against then candidate Donald Trump and in favor of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. It is right out of a novel with salacious, unverified dossiers, reports of informants that appear more like spies for the U.S. government, and application of the aforementioned surveillance powers to collect on a U.S. person once associated with President Trump's political campaign. 
But it's not a novel. It's real life.

Now, next, they very ill-tempered Rod Rosenstein, who again apparently doesn't like me, I can't imagine why, he was grilled by Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan over Rosenstein's blatant effort to hide important information from House investigators. Again, this is their constitutional job, at oversight, separation of powers, coequal branches of government. 
Look at this tense exchange. It's amazing.

And, by the way, the president can demand at some point everything be handed over, and that will then be a matter of law. 
Now, although in terms of -- the president has that power. One of the issues at play here, the House investigation into possible coordination between the Clinton campaign and the FBI's initiation of that so-called Trump-Russia, which we now know to be witch hunt. One of the small part of the scandal surrounds Bruce and Nellie Ohr. 
Look right there, 2016, Nellie was conducting the oppo research for the Clinton campaign. Remember Fusion GPS? Right alongside ex-foreign spy, foreign national Christopher Steele. This of Fusion GPS, all while her husband, Bruce, a high-ranking DOJ official, was the federal government's point of contact for the same Christopher Steele.

REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: You appointed Mueller, you're supervising Mueller, and supposedly about collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia and obstruction of justice, but you wrote the memo saying that Comey should be fired, and you signed the FISA extension for Carter Page. 
So, my question is to you, it seems like you should be recused from this more so than Jeff Sessions, just because you are involved in making decisions affecting both prongs of this investigation. Why haven't you done that? 
ROSENSTEIN: Congressman, I can assure that if it were appropriate for me to recused, I would be more than happy to do so, and let someone else handle it. But it is my responsibility to do it. And all I can tell you - -

REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Russia attacked this country. They should be the target but Russia isn't being hurt by this investigation right now. We are. 
This country is being hurt by it. We are being divided. We've seen the bias. We've seen the bias. We need to see the evidence. 
If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury. If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people. There's an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied. I think right now, all of us are being denied. Whatever you got, finish it the hell up, because this country is being torn apart.

Now, Rod Rosenstein, really, when is this witch hunt end? 
And, Rod, it's your constitutional duty, checks and balances, coequal branches, to provide members of Congress with the subpoenaed documents and information they need so they can do your job -- their job and check your department.

In seven days from today, if the DOJ continues this obstruction, I urge every single member of the House to now take action to, yes, move to contempt, and he has, impeachment. Enough is enough. Trey Gowdy was right. 
And, of course, many Democrats are perfectly fine with DOJ obstruction. Their friends in the deep state have a lot to hide. 
Now, meanwhile, as Robert Mueller's witch hunt is producing literally zero evidence that the president ever did anything wrong, well, the people on the left -- they are now predictably beginning to unravel. And their favorite new target, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, it's doing the job that Congress passed, their laws.

Now, throughout the week, hundreds of left-wing protesters, they, quote, occupied ICE offices all across multiple cities, forcing some to temporarily close their doors on these demonstrators blocked entrances, they obstructed ICE employees, they attempted to camp out in front of the building. "The Hill" reported many protesters celebrated the news that their occupation actually prompted delays and some operations at the center, but, quote, this may result in some immigrants being detained for weeks longer than expected. Great job. 
Now, this all culminated in Washington, D.C., where 575 people were arrested after literally storming the center building. Multiple Democratic lawmakers were in attendance, including one congresswoman from Washington, who was arrested. Now, sadly, this anti-ICE rhetoric from the left, on TV, he's even far worse. Watch this.

HANNITY: What you heard is right, the left, Democrats in this country, literally want to abolish ICE, proving exactly what we have been telling you for a long time. This is the most important midterm in your life. And if Democrats win this November, this is what they are pushing for. 
I have been telling you, they want to impeach Donald Trump but don't tell anybody, keep it secret. Maxine, stop saying it. 
Next, they want to keep Obamacare. How's that working out for you? And, of course, they want to make sure that you get paid less. They are campaigning and saying publicly, they want to repeal the Trump tax cut and raise your taxes. 
And, of course, as you see, they want open borders. They do not want a wall. And number five, they want to destroy whoever the president picks to replace Justice Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. No vision, no betterment of the American people at all.
Democrats have no agenda, no real plan for improving this country, helping the forgotten men and women. So, their playbook is all too predictable. It's the one they use every two and four years. A campaign to smear, slam, and, besmirch, assassinate the character of any Trump Republican. We o are seeing this in the media after Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, as I predicted last night.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Joining us now to react to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's appearance on Capitol Hill, well, there she is, Fox News investigative reporter and contributor Sara Carter. 
See that book? Now, early July, it's out. You can preorder it on amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com. Hannity.com has a link. "The Russia Hoax", it will be the definitive book, "The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump". Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. 
Let's start with you from the legal standpoint. I captured a lot of inconsistencies and I know you did. 
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, one could say they were lies by Rod Rosenstein. For example, he denied ever threatening members of the intelligence committee and the staff in a January 10th meeting in which he threatened to get his hands on their emails, text, and phone records. 
HANNITY: That's a little s scary, isn't it, in America?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JARRETT: I talked to people who are in on that meeting, they use the word, "threatened," and that he said that he was threatening to obtain those texts and emails and so forth. So, that did not appear to be terribly truthful by him. 
He also wasn't truthful when he said I'm not withholding any evidence of subpoenaed records. Well, his own letters refusing to turn over the documents or evidence that he is withholding, and yet he said, I'm not withholding. 
There wasn't a lot of truth in Rod Rosenstein today. 
HANNITY: Let me get your initial reaction, Sara Carter. 
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that when Trey Gowdy, when Representative Trey Gowdy, questioned him and made his statement, saying, if you have any evidence of this, Rod Rosenstein, let's just get it out right now. Stop dragging the American public, this administration, and our country, through the mud. If you have any evidence that anything happened with the Trump administration, with President Trump, you know, get it out there. Let us know what it is. 
But he never once has done that. And if you look at the I.G. report, Sean, and you look at what happened today on Capitol Hill and how he evaded and avoided questions, I tell you, Gregg is 100 percent right, I've spoken to similar sources who have been those backroom meetings with Rod Rosenstein - - 
HANNITY: By the way, I spoke to one person, too, that was personally the victim of a temper tantrum, a direct --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARTER: Absolutely.
HANNITY: A direct conversation that was relayed to me. 
CARTER: So, Rod Rosenstein flat out lied. He lied to Congress, and he lied to the American people. We just got a call a spade a spade. Call it what it is.
And if you look at the I.G. report, I want to go back to that really quick. We look at Strzok himself, I was looking at a more detail and talking with some sources tonight, and, you know, there is one point where Strzok tried to explain the insurance policy question. Remember, in August, that text message that he sent to Lisa Page about having an insurance policy and talking with Andy McCabe, and he explains it away as saying, well, we were talking about how aggressively were going to be or how overt we were going to be with this investigation. 
And when I was talking to FBI sources about this, they said, that is so telling, because at that moment in time, when he left that out to Horowitz, when he made that statement, he was basically saying, we are going to go after Trump, even if it means going after the people around him, even if it means putting this information out there in the media, even if it means arresting people for crimes that were committed 10 years ago or maybe they're not even crimes, but just giving that aura around the president. 
So, the chaos he really has been the FBI and the people on the seventh floor and the DOJ, and not even so much the Russians anymore. I mean, real chaos in our country is coming from them. 
HANNITY: You know, Rosenstein said, I'm not trying to hide anything. And let me -- I just made a short list, wrote it down before the show. OK, we'll stop Trump, they hid that from everybody from a period of time, where he withheld the fact that Strzok was a personal friend of Judge Rudolph Contreras, which you mentioned on this program last night, they refused to initially -- remember, he begged up to the last minute, Paul Ryan, not to release but became the Nunes memo which told us about FISA abuse.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The DOJ tried to hide the fact that two of the most important investigative investigators on both the Hillary and Russia probes were vehemently anti- Trump. He didn't that out either. And remember, December 2017, five months after Strzok and Page were shut out the door, it was the inspector general that released the Strzok-Page texts. That's only the short-list, Gregg. 
JARRETT: And what did Rosenstein say of the behavior of Peter Strzok today? He called it inappropriate, which has to be the most colossal understatement of all time, especially when you consider the I.G. said that this is a man who had a willingness to abuse his position of power to influence an election. But to Rod Rosenstein, oh, you know, it's just inappropriate. 
HANNITY: The things that stand out, all three of us have talked to at least one person, I've talked to one, you've talked to two. Sara, how many sources do you have that he has a temper and that he made the threat that he denied today? 
CARTER: I have at least four sources. 
HANNITY: Four sources. OK, you are working harder than both Gregg and I. Go ahead.
(LAUGHTER) 
CARTER: I'm not. 
HANNITY: And then is refusal to recuse himself, then Strzok's actions, as you just pointed out, highly inappropriate. No, that would be rigging an investigation to influence a presidential election, and as your book says, a scheme to clear Hillary and frame Trump. That's what happened. 
JARRETT: Rosenstein said today, if it's appropriate, I'll recuse myself. 
It was appropriate a long time ago. He is a witness, investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, all rolled into one. 
HANNITY: Say that again. He is the witness -- 
JARRETT: Key witness, investigator, he's supervising the prosecution, which makes him a prosecutor, he's also the judge and jury because he decides whether any charges would be brought. 
HANNITY: Why is he -- why is the only mad at me by name and not you and Sara, right? Frankly, I'm taking all the heat for -- 
CARTER: We're feeling a little jealous, Sean. We're feeling a little jealous. 
HANNITY: They tried to steal an election, they tried to undermine it, to favor one candidate and screw the other candidate. That's why this matters and why the rest of the media ignores the story, I don't know. 
CARTER: Sean, it matters because they weaponized -- they weaponized our tools of law enforcement, the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, and everything else. This is such an enormous investigation. We haven't even talked about the unmaskings yet. 
So, they weaponized the tools -- I know, and they weaponized -- we need to get back to that. We need to have answers. It if the United States is going to move forward, if we're going to clean up our system, our FBI and our intelligence agencies, we need to know what happened. And the truth needs to come out, and the people that abused it need to be removed. 
JARRETT: One of the most striking moments occurred today when he was asked about Mueller's, not one but two clearing conflicts of interest that are disqualifying. Rosenstein said, I don't know of any conflict of interests with Mr. Mueller. He apparently doesn't read newspapers because dozens and dozens of law professors and lawyers have written a myriad of columns explaining the disqualifying conflicts of interest of Robert Mueller. 
But Rosenstein is either a modern day Machiavelli or he is the most oblivious person to ever hold such a high position. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Do you know what somebody said to me today. And I really believe the man who said this. He said, "Hannity, you are trying to do this because you are undermining Mueller." I said, you're missing the whole story.
But the more important thing that they said here is they don't get it. That they really believe that these guys, and I'll this to Sara, that think actually think that they were better, smarter and that they think they are the super patriots and we the people are stupid. And that they knew better which is why they had to save Hillary and had to undermine Trump. But now they are caught. 
CARTER: And they undermined -- the undermined the American people. They undermine the system that our nation is founded on, Sean. And just look at the most disparaging comments that Strzok and Page said about people that shop at Wal-Mart. The American people--
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: I can smell them.
CARTER: -- people in Pennsylvania.
HANNITY: No, no, no. I can smell them.
CARTER: I can smell them.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I shop at Wal-Mart. They were probably smelling me. 
CARTER: There is nothing more disgusting. Well, there is nothing more this disgusting than thinking that you know everything. 
HANNITY: Amen. Amen.
CARTER: That thinking that you know everything. And that's the reason why President Trump won. Let's be honest. People were sick and tired, sick and tired of being told they weren't smart enough, they're not good enough. They don't know what to do. And you know what? The American people said you kno what, we are smart enough, we are good enough and we don't really care what you have say. Because we live in this country and we are going to vote for whom we want to vote for. 
And if Trump hadn't have won -- if Trump would not have won this election, think about what the alternative would be. We would never know what happened. 
HANNITY: I hope -- Fox.com, please mark that, that Sara monologue. You get the last word. 
JARRETT: People like Rosenstein and Comey and Strzok and Lisa Page and McCabe and the whole gang are a symbol of corruption and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
HANNITY: We haven't been wrong on one thing. 
JARRETT: Not yet. 
HANNITY: Not yet. It's scary. And the media has ignored it. Frankly, you guys deserve Pulitzer Prizes. Amazing. I can't wait for your book. Sara, great job as always.
When we come back, don't touch that dial. I have an announcement. The great one Mark Levin and I will make it next. Straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Joining us with reaction to the predicate left wing response to the on-going Supreme Court opening, he is the host of CRTV's Levin TV. The host of the number show, Sunday night at 10 p.m. It's called Life, Liberty, and Levin. I call him the great one. 
All right. Before we get into it we do have a big announcement. Do you want to say it or shall I, Mr. Great one, sir? 
MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: I will say it. I'm pregnant! No, actually--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: No, Mark has just appointed to the Supreme Court. Yes, that will scare the crap of everybody at the time he left. 
LEVIN: Exactly. Well, I just self-identified. Well, you know, you are my guest on Life, Liberty, and Levin. 
HANNITY: For full hour.
LEVIN: So we're kind of switch roles where I interview you for an hour. 
HANNITY: Yes. By the way, that role reversal thing is a little weird for me. We already -- I think it's a great show. Thank you for having me, by the way. 
All right. Mark, Liberty -- you are probably best known for your massive runaway best seller and all your books have been number one bestseller. But Liberty and Tyranny. But I remember you wrote a book called "Men in Black." And long before anybody else you talked about this what the left can accomplish in an election. What they can't accomplish ever legislatively. 
They want to ignore separations of powers, co-equal branches, they side foreign law, and they literally want things legislated from the bench. You have you been way ahead of the curve. But this president wants to choose an originalist. I want you to go through their reaction to this opening now and what it means for the country. 
LEVIN: First of all, I want Americans to understand that the progressive ideology which you hear on the left is incompatible with constitutionalism. And so they've turned the Supreme Court, for them, into a politburo, into a all-powerful, centralized political operation where they want to control a majority of the seats.
You notice they don't talk about upholding the Constitution as written. You notice they don't talk about this article or this provision or this section or this clause of the Constitution. 
When you hear them yuck away on the other networks they are talking about abortion on demand. Same sex marriage, Obamacare and open borders. 
They give you the same left wing agenda as if they are running for president or running for the Senate that they want in a judicial nominee. That's not how it works. 
So we don't want a conservative. We don't want a liberal. We want a constitutionalist. A constitutionalist is somebody who has sworn to uphold the Constitution. Look at the Constitution, look at the words. Takes them this context. Tries to figure out what the original intent was and applies it. 
And the parties before the Supreme Court have a right to expect that that's what the justices will do. But the Democrats are telling the president of the United States, as if you don't nominate Ruth Bader Ginsberg in one form or another, we are going to oppose whomever you nominate. 
So the Republicans are going to have to steam roll the Democrats. And that's OK. The Democrats have politicize this process where they don't even make any sense. They used to support filibustering it, now they oppose filibustering it. 
They used to oppose a nomination with one year left in the presidency, now they support it or they support it, now they oppose it in mid-term elections. In other words, forget about Schumer, forget about the Democrats, forget about their agenda and let us uphold the Constitution with our nomination.
And I think this president more than most understands that. He ran for office. He had a list. He was extremely transparent. Hillary Clinton didn't have a list because the nation collectively would have puked quite frankly. 
But this president had his list. He has tremendous candidates on this list. And he said I'm going to choose from this list. So the left has had every opportunity to dig up whatever they can on these various candidates and the president is sticking to the list. 
And this is very, very important. The Supreme Court is not supposed to be more powerful than the other two branches of government. It's supposed to be independent from them. Justices are appointed for life because they're not to be political. It's gotten way out of whack. And under the left it will be more out of whack. 
Here's the attitudes of the progressives who really used to attack the Constitution, you know, as written by a bunch of white men who owned slaves. Now they pretend to support it. 
Here's the position of the left basically. They want to enshrine their ideology into the Constitution. When they say you have to support precedent, they don't really believe that. Dred Scott upholding slavery, that was precedent. Plassy versus Ferguson segregation, that was precedent. Korematsu, the internment of Japanese-Americans, that was precedent. 
Did they support that precedent? No, what they mean is the most radical decision of the Supreme Court that's what they want to compel, that's what they believe in. Not the Constitution. But the leftist direction that leftist courts have taken the Constitution. 
HANNITY: I don't even know what you wrote "Men in Black." I assume it's out--
(CROSSTALK)
LEVIN: In 2005, I think. 
HANNITY: All right. And I just, look, one of the reasons we became friends and I think we go into this a little bit I don't remember the whole discussion. But Mark, we became friends because of issues. And I'm going to tell a little bit of the story. 
With all due respect to you, I had to twist your arm to do fill in for me on radio. Twist your arm to do a weekend show. Twist your arm to do it do six to eight, then six to nine, then syndicate. And to be honest, it's been years I've been twisting your arm to come on this TV show. And now you are here. And now you flipped it and I now have to do your show. But the thing is, that brought us together is--
(CROSSTALK) 
LEVIN: Hold on. I want to comment on that. 
HANNITY: I believe in conservatism.
LEVIN: No, I agree. But I want your viewers to know something because we just did this interview. I want the viewers to know more about you know that when you're on TV. And that's what we are doing in this interview. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I hear that.
LEVIN: You've got a wonderful background. You've got a great sense of humor. You're one of the most decent human beings I know.
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: OK, that's enough about me.
LEVIN: You're on a constant attack from the left. Hold on now. You give me 20 bucks, I got to finish. You're in a constant attack from the left and I want the people to know really the real Sean Hannity. And that's what going to happen. 
HANNITY: By the way, I did something that a lot of politicians and liberals do. Mark would tried to get me to talk about me and I kept talking about issues. And finally is that, Mark, stop it, talk about you. 
Mark, your love of this Constitution has been your life study. I mean this. I absorbed this because this is important. I swear if we don't get this right, we're going to lose this country. 
We talk about rule of law, equal application of our laws, our Constitution are form of government the foundation of all of our laws. And you have been an intellectual heavyweight on all of this. Thank you--
(CROSSTALK)
LEVIN: Let me just say one thing. 
HANNITY: Last thing. Yes, not about me.
LEVIN: On the Supreme Court. 
HANNITY: Yes.
LEVIN: The progressives don't own the Supreme Court. They don't seats from the Supreme Court. When they talk about the Supreme Court has been moved hard to the right. It doesn't move hard to the right. You either believe in the Constitution or you don't. 
HANNITY: All right.
LEVIN: We define everything through the left. We see everything through the left. Stop! We want candidates who are going to uphold the Constitution--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Amen.
LEVIN: -- not drag their political agenda-- 
HANNITY: And by the way.
LEVIN: -- through the Constitution. Yes?
HANNITY: Do you like Mike Lee? 
LEVIN: I would support, if the president watching, Mike Lee is your best choice. That's my humble opinion. I think he would be absolutely outstanding. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I'm not -- I think Mike Lee would be an outstanding justice. And he is brilliant. All right. It will be a great choice. Mark, Life, Liberty, and Levin every Sunday night, the number show on cable at 10 Eastern on Sundays. And I'm unfortunately the guest and he beats me up this Sunday night. Hope you'll watch.
Dan Bongino and Geraldo Rivera, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Extremists Democrats politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE. We don't want ICE anymore. Do you know what would happen to parts of our country? It will be over-run with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. That was the president last night at a rally in North Dakota hammering Democrats for their destruction of ICE. 
Here now former Secret Agent and NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino, and author of the bestseller "The Geraldo Show" Fox News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. 
Geraldo, let me -- we have more details now on the shooter that just develop. And let me read this to you if I can. Yes, I wear glass. They don't want me to wear them on TV. Too bad. 
Maryland law enforcement they've identified him. I won't give the name out, Geraldo. But here's what we know tonight that we did not know earlier. He lost a defamation case that he brought against this newspaper in 2015. And over a 2011 column he contended defamed him. 
So, obviously, disgruntled with the paper. The column provided an account of his guilty plea to criminal harassment of a woman on social media. 
By the way, police were there in 60 seconds, Geraldo. That's how great they are. He was not cooperating with investigators. He had canisters and smoke grenades he used inside the building. He was prepared. He obviously premeditated this evil to shoot people. 
I mean, just as evil. Look, Geraldo, I want to say one thing. It really is infuriating. It's harsh as I've been against Maxine Waters, these are separate issues and her call to confront people. This is separate and apart as I said 10 times on my radio show today. 
The language is getting out of control. But there was a race today to say well, just because the president says fake news and he believes -- and as I do that the media lies. They almost were trying to say wow, I wonder if this is a Trump supporter. 
If somebody listened to any of these crazy people on the left and did something horrible, you blame the person. Words do matter, though. But the president saying fake news--
(CROSSTALK)
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: First of all, Sean--
HANNITY: -- is not bad because they do lie constantly. 
RIVERA: First of all, I salute the law enforcement in Maryland--
HANNITY: Amen.
RIVERA: -- who were there within 60 seconds. Five are dead. It was a horrible, horrible event. And yet if two minutes had gone by or three or four or if the cops chickened out the way they did down in Parkland high school it would have been far worse massacre. So God bless the cops in Maryland who did what they had to do. 
Also shame on everybody, right and left who blamed what happened today in Maryland on the civility dispute, the debate over this one saying you do this. You bad -- you. It had nothing to do with that. It was a guy with a beef, a guy with a grudge of specific grudge who warned the newspaper over social media, threaten them and then carried out his hideous attacks.
So it had nothing to do with political philosophy. This was a beef between a deranged, despicable, murderous SOB who went and vented against the newspaper he claimed had defamed him. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: And if it's the left or the right, Geraldo, it doesn't matter. Words at the end of the day, they are dangerous, but people, Dan Bongino, are responsible for their own actions. And that I would encourage people to tone it down a little bit. 
But honestly, this is, you know, there is one idiot on CNN, a moment many journalists have feared. You know what they are implying there. They are implying if you say fake news--
DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Yes.
HANNITY: -- and call these people out for being liars and an extension of the Democratic Party and left wingers. That's somehow a motivation for somebody. No, it's not. That's just telling the truth actually. 
BONGINO: You know, Sean, Twitter today was an absolute cesspool. The obsession with some people to jump to a narrative to tell the story right away--
RIVERA: Yes.
BONGINO: -- before anybody has even had a chance to mourn or, Sean, even worse, even had the chance to get the facts. By the way, I was on your radio show. You went through great lengths to put, of what, five or six caveats that you were not connecting the two. You were making a point. I was there. That yes, the rhetoric has gotten hot. 
And I said in response we could all take the temperature down. There's no doubt about it. But of course, what happens, instead of trying to solve the problem they jumped down your throat, they write the ridiculous op-eds and what happens, nobody talks, Sean, ever. 
It just becomes a shouting match in both directions. It's really sad this obsession with narratives over facts. You know, Twitter, I had to log off. I'm not -- I haven't tweeted in two hours. I can't take it. 
HANNITY: I, honestly, Geraldo, I tweet out only news and information for the most part. Now it is a cesspool. I mean, it's gotten -- you know, true -- anonymity -- anonymity, sorry, and you sit in your basement in your underwear you think you can say anything you want. 
RIVERA: That's absolutely right true. There is no governor on social media. It's puke coming out of too many mouths. It's really -- it's really disgusting. 
I have to say this about ICE, though. The story we were booked to talk about. It is not merely the hundreds of protestors who were arrested today around the country who want to, if not abolish then severely reform ICE. 
The -- today, ICE is divided into the homeland security investigations and the enforcement and removal operations. The homeland security investigation are the guys that go after the gang bangers and the drug cartels. The majority of them wrote a letter to the boss today, to the homeland security secretary suggesting that ICE be split in two. That the guys that go after the gang bangers be separated. 
Men and women be separated from those who remove the citizens, otherwise, law-abiding undocumented immigrants. Hard working like from the gardening company here in Ohio. A 146 of them were arrested. I think the agency could conceivably be split because the backlash for that horrible family separation is not just among civilians. It is even among the agents themselves, Sean. 
HANNITY: All right. Thank you both for being with us. And you know what, I feel so sorry for these families tonight. Just evil. This premeditated evil. More Hannity after this. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. We are now awaiting a press conference from law enforcement in Maryland. And this will take place in the next hour. Be sure to tune in for that. They have the latest details. It looks like a lawsuit, disgruntled. He lost. He went after the paper.
Motives really when you think about it, it doesn't matter. It's just evil. And then evil manifests itself in so many forms. We pray for the families tonight. Those who lost loved ones and those who are healing in hospitals tonight.
Thank you for being with us. We will always be fair and balanced and we're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura has a big show coming up. Laura, take it away. Have a good show.
