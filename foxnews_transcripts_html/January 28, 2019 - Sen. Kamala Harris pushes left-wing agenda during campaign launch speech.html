JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Morgan Ortagus, Juan Williams, Jedediah Bila, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
Fox News Alert, Nancy Pelosi is inviting President Trump to deliver the State of the Union address in Congress on February 5th. As you know, this speech was initially slated for tomorrow, but Pelosi rescinded her invitation due to the partial government shutdown, which has now ended.

And we'll have a lot more on that coming up in just a few. But first, the 2020 Democratic presidential primary already turning into a circus, Senator Kamala Harris formally launching her campaign where she took shots at the president and pushed a radical agenda.

SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I am running to declare once and for all that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for all. I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt free college.

WATTERS: And after calling for a wealth tax, Senator Elizabeth Warren is now publicly shaming the billionaire owner of the Washington Redskins for buying a new yacht. And according to a new report, Hillary Clinton is telling friends that she hasn't closed the door on running again in 2020. But wait, there's more.
Democrats are freaking out over former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz saying he could run for president as an independent. Liberals fear a third-party candidate can hand Trump a second term. Schultz floating the idea on "60 Minutes."

HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER STARBUCKS CEO: I will run as a centrist independent outside of the two-party system. Not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And President Trump hitting back against Schultz on twitter saying he doesn't have the guts to run. All right, Greg, a lot to pick through here.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Exciting. It's like 2016 all over again. This is going to be hilarious. They're right about Schultz, though.
WATTERS: Yeah.
GUTFELD: That's the most frightening aspect because politics has to be binary. You have to have Republicans and Democrats. You put in a third variable it throws everything off, and then it allows one side to squeak through. We saw that with Perot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So you have this imbalance. You can fix the balance though if you have two independents, like if you have the Green Party and you have this party. Green party, libertarian, right, left, and then you have four, and then it kind of cancels each other out. It's like sports, you know. You know, each team has the same number of teammates, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: It doesn't matter, as long as they're the same. Kamala, OK, that's the first time I've really heard her speak. She doesn't have much charisma. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: You don't think so?
GUTFELD: I don't think so. And she's like an auto maker who can build only have a car. So she has all the promises -- of the progressive promises -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

WATTERS: Right.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: -- that everybody applauds if you're naA_ve you'll applaud, applaud. But she's just has the other half of the car. Like, how do you get this thing going? How do you pay for this stuff? And that's -- most progressives, that's their flaw. They can only build half a car, and it's the easiest car to build. It's the promises.
And then, if you look at Liz Warren with the yacht, this is a purely adolescent belief. Hey, there's a rich person. Let's take his stuff and sell it. That's not how you do government. That's not how you do -- how you pay for a government. It's kind of sad that that's how primitive she is.

        }
      
GUTFELD: I don't think she was aware of that.
WATTERS: I don't think she was too. So he says Kamala Harris doesn't have the charisma to deliver. Do you agree with that?
JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: She's got a lot of charisma compared to Gillibrand, I'll say that.

        }
      
BILA: She does. It's funny, when you watch their platforms, do you remember when Obamacare was like a radical idea or, like, when Obama in 2008 had the Joe the plumber moments and it was spread the wealth around. We were like, oh, spread -- the redistribution of wealth. Now, you have on the Democratic side, blatant socialists coming out. Medicare for all, you know --
WATTERS: Free education. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BILA: Free education. The green new deal. And it's interesting to me because they want stuff to be free, whether you're talking about education or health care, but they don't care about the quality. And the reason that they can't talk about quality is because what makes quality better in these industries is actually the free market which they actively oppose.
I just think it's really interesting to look at what happened on the left. And when President Obama was talking about this fundamental transformation of America, so many of us were saying this is going to be a creeping normality, little by little of more and more government in your face, and everyone was saying no, no, no, he really wants Obamacare. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I said, no, he doesn't. He wants Medicare for all. And he's instituting Obamacare because he knows is going to fall and that's what people like Bernie Sanders are going to rush in with. But the fact that this has become the mainstream of the Democratic Party I think should horrify moderate Democrats more than anything.

        }
      
WATTERS: Well, they don't care about paying for it. That's not their concern. Juan, what scares you most, Schultz getting in or Hillary Clinton getting back in?
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Oh, I think it's Schultz --
WATTERS: Schultz scare.

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Yeah. Because I think that if you divide the opposition potentially that strengthens then what is really -- you know, Trump will talk about this in the next block, but Trump's poll numbers are not great even by the best measures. So, in terms of who would support him -- you also have a shrinking number of people who identify as Republican.
So when you say, oh, Republicans still support Trump overwhelmingly, although it's drifted a little bit, it's a smaller group. But if you take away a percentage of the people who are opposed to Trump to back an independent like Schultz who has lots of money, that's big trouble. And that's why I think you see Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, saying he will not run as an independent.

And you -- I think -- maybe it was Greg who mentioned, you know, what happened with Ross Perot back in '92. You can go back to people like John Anderson or come forward to people, you know -- it just strikes me that you see these people, like in 2000, you know, people said --

MORGAN ORTAGUS, GUEST CO-HOST: So, this whole Howard Schultz discussion is fascinating to me because, of course, you're talking about Ross Perot got almost 19 percent of the vote. We've had -- I looked this up today, since 1788, we've had 58 presidential elections where the third-party candidate won somewhere, roughly around 5 percent of the vote on average.
So, what the Democrats are saying is why would you run? You can't win anything, in the Electoral College you can't win. But what this could possibly be -- and I think we may be shaping up for this is one of those realigning elections in American history. And you have these like in 1912 with the progressive party actually got more votes than the Republican Party for president in that election. So, could we have a moment between Trump's popularity, between Howard Schultz running, between 30 Democrats --
GUTFELD: You need four.
ORTAGUS: -- realign American politics.

ORTAGUS: Agree.
GUTFELD: Like, if you have three, you going to end up -- it's going to be a two to one thing. So you've got to have four or six. It has to be an even number.
WATTERS: Right now, Schultz is a Democrat. He's saying he's an independent centrist. He's much more of a Democrat than he is a Republican. And that's why these Democrats are freaking out.

BILA: He's also on a book tour, this guy. So he's going out there and he wants to sell his book. And he knows if he says he's running for president he's going to get a lot of attention. But, Juan, you know, the deficit, you can't do anything about the deficit unless you look at entitlement reform. You really think that you're going to get Democrats --
WILLIAMS: Well, you certainly can't do something about revenue.
BILA: Listen, if you -- if you didn't cut those taxes, you wouldn't boost the economy. So you would wind up with an economy that was sinking and you would still have all that spending. Democrats want to spend more money on Medicare for all which they can't afford at all.

WILLIAMS: So, in other words, we can spend money to give the millionaires a tax break, but we can't --
BILA: Stop spending money we don't have and cut the taxes.
GUTFELD: Let's not spend it on people who are sick. We hate sick people, Juan. We, Republicans hate sick people.

ORTAGUS: I said that.
WATTERS: All right. And one last thing, Juan, you don't spend money on a tax cut. That's not how it works. The battle for the border wall is far from over. What the president is saying about another possible shutdown. Plus, more on Pelosi inviting Trump to deliver the State of the Union, up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Nancy Pelosi inviting the president to give the State of the Union in Congress on February 5. Hanging over this address is the battle for the border wall. The White House earlier today urging Democrats to agree to Trump's wall.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president doesn't want to go through another shutdown. That's not the goal. The goal is border security and protecting the American people. Ideally, Democrats would take these next three weeks to negotiate in good faith, as they've indicated that they would, and come up with a deal that makes sense.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: The president, however, putting the chances of a deal at, quote, less than 50/50. And he says another shutdown is, quote, certainly an option. He's also not ruling out declaring a national emergency to get the wall built. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney backing the president and his national emergency threat.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We've been working on this for months. We have been hoping for months to do it through legislation with Democrats because that's the right way for the government to function. At the end of the day, the president's commitment is to defend the nation and he'll do it either with or without congress.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: So we see a situation here, Jesse, where according to the Wall Street Journal the president is holding strong with his base. The poll was kind on the edge of when the decision was made Friday, you know, to end the shutdown, but the Journal's numbers seem to indicate, hey, the president is not doing bad with his base, despite Ann Coulter and other critics.
WATTERS: Right. And Pelosi's numbers are not looking good. She's now the most unpopular politician in Washington, D.C., more unpopular than Donald Trump, more unpopular than Mitch McConnell, and both political parties. The press buried that, though. That's in the third to last paragraph.
And the NBC News report on this poll didn't even discuss the fact that Nancy is so underwater with her popularity. But that's fine. I'm glad she finally invited the president back. She's a terrible host, though. You don't invite someone then disinvite them in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Like, it's either you're coming to the party or you're not. I like the pageantry of the State of the Union. I like seeing all the Supreme Court justices there. I like seeing Pelosi in the background next to Pence making faces. I like to see the special guests. So, I think it's a good thing that it's finally back on. And I'm looking forward to going down to D.C., Greg.
GUTFELD: No way.
WATTERS: I know. Not everybody is, though.
GUTFELD: You think it's like an episode of The Love Boat. Hey, they got special guests. You get to see everybody there. It's miserable. D.C. sucks. I hate everything about it. Sorry, Juan, did you want me to go ahead and talk?
WILLIAMS: Anytime.
GUTFELD: So this -- this borders soap opera, one thing we know, it has zilch to do with policy because the Dems have spent more and done more with a border than -- in the past than now. So we know it's the putting Trump hate before immigration policy. I have an analogy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's like when you're really into a band that you really like until you find out that, like, Joy Behar likes the band, so now you hate the band. That's the Democrats with immigration policy. They were like all for everything that's Trump's for, but now he's for it they're like, ah, nope, we're against it. And so, it's a personal thing. And that's why I think there will be another shutdown.
WILLIAMS: So, Morgan, you have a situation where the president is really holding out as a point of leverage the idea that he might declare a national emergency. But you have Senator Rubio, Senator Blunt yesterday on the Sunday shows saying they really don't like it because conservatives think that would set a precedent for future presidents to declare national emergencies anytime they want. What do you think?
ORTAGUS: Well, that's interesting. You actually saw more senators, Republican senators vote for the Democrat version of the bill to reopen the House -- excuse me, to reopen the government last Friday. You've also seen in both chambers of Congress bills that have been submitted to prevent shutdowns from happening at all.
And I think -- I mean, really, if we want to go to the heart of the matter this should have been -- we're talking about last year's fiscal year spending that we're still arguing over. We haven't even gotten to this year yet. So we have a whole another fight, you know, on all of that. And so, I do think that this sort of stuff should be done in the regular order.
In August, they canceled the senate recess in order to get all these things through. They got to vote 75 percent done. They didn't get it all done. So I don't think any of these members of Congress should get paid. They shouldn't get home.
When they have these fights, it's affecting real people. There are real friends of mine who are in the federal government, with children, who are going without paychecks. And I don't think it's fair whenever they can't act like adults that real people have to suffer.
WILLIAMS: Jedediah, what's your bet on whether or not we have another shutdown? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BILA: I mean, I think that the shutdown at this point is ridiculous. I don't think he's going to be left with a choice but to do a national emergency.
ORTAGUS: I agree.
BILA: I don't think they're going to give him the wall. I think they're hanging tight and they're saying, you know what, we're not going to give it to him. Let him have to bend. He already gave the TPS and DACA protections. He already compromised his humanitarian aid in his proposal.
So I think he's going to get to a point where he's going to have to say, look, there's a humanitarian crisis at the border. This is an emergency. You've got caravan. Latest caravan numbers upward of 12,000 people. Something has to be done.
The plan I put forth will not only prevent backlog in the immigration but will put money towards more border security agents, more lawyers. It wasn't just about a wall. But I think he was concerned about these federal workers not getting paid, and you saw three bills introduced in the House - -
ORTAGUS: Right.
BILA: -- that were motivated toward getting -- even if the shutdown continued, to get these federal workers paid. And Democrats just don't want that because they want this drama of, like, Trump, you've got to cave otherwise all of this is on your back. And I think he knows that. I think he's going to be forced into declaring a national emergency. And then he's going to get challenged in court. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, that's what I was about to say to you. He gets challenge in court and, of course, there -- you have to say what's the difference between the last two years or the last 30 days and now there's an emergency. And it sounds like, you know, the Democrats would have a strong argument that --
(CROSSTALK)
BILA: The problem is there's been an emergency. You're right. It's not new. It has national attention now because of these caravans, but it's been a national emergency for a long time. It's not getting better. The situation is getting worse. So, if somebody doesn't dig their heels in and do something about it now, when is it going to be a good time to address?
ORTAGUS: Nothing is going to happen -- I mean, Jedediah is totally right. Nothing is going to happen in the next two years to suddenly make the Democrats become more pragmatic in terms of negotiating with the president around this.
So, I agree. I think he should give it his best shot. Try to get them to negotiate in the next three weeks. But if not, declare a national emergency, fight it out in the courts, and move on to something else if they can get anything done for the next two years.
GUTFELD: I'm not going to D.C.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BILA: Welcome back. Democratic freshman congresswoman Ilhan Omar engulfed in a new controversy, this time for past efforts to convince a judge to show leniency toward a group of Minnesota men accused of trying to join ISIS. Omar writing in 2016, quote, the best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion.
We must alter our attitude and approach if we truly want to affect change. We should refocus our efforts on inclusion and rehabilitation. This isn't the first time Omar's comments have been scrutinized. She also falsely smear the Covington high school students, accused the USA of staging a coup in Venezuela, and deleted an offensive tweet about Israel.
All right, Jesse, so I'm trying to figure out what it takes to be able to say that she's radical. I mean, this is crazy what she's saying. These are people who admittedly said that they were going to go to Syria. One guy went on record and said I was not going there to pass out medical kits or food. I was going to fight and kill on behalf of the Islamic State. And she's out there fighting --
GUTFELD: Give him a chance.
BILA: Really? So -- I mean, this is not crazy what she's saying?
WATTERS: Yeah. If Minnesota wants to send radical kooks to Congress, that's their right. I mean, we've had terrible people in Congress. We've had addicts. We've had abusers. We've had molesters. We've had felons. This woman, though, is like a legitimate code pink activist, OK?
She's saying we need to fight terrorism with compassion, sympathy, and inclusion. Is she on the House intel committee because that would be really scary. I think Pelosi has a huge problem on her hands. They're going to run ads all against her next year. And she's already -- I think what she said that Lindsey Graham was being sexually blackmail.
ORTAGUS: Yeah.
WATTERS: She said horrible things about Israel. She's a problem, but she's not my problem.
BILA: Why don't you have, though, Juan, Democrats in the party that still have their sanity that want to be able to appeal the independent voters, that want to be able to appeal to normal people who recognize that compassion toward people who are actively wanting to support ISIS is a bad idea. Why aren't they're out there saying -- holding her accountable and saying this is not reflective of the party?
WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. Sounds to me like you guys have never heard of Steve King, or Louie Gohmert, or any of these guys on the right who I think, boy --
GUTFELD: Do they support ISIS?
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: This is not supporting ISIS. She's not supporting ISIS in any way. And by the way --
BILA: She has to decrease the amount of time that people who are going to fight with ISIS --
WILLIAMS: This is a very important conversation. And she's making an important contribution to it by saying if you really want to deal with fanatics you have to understand how they think. And she's saying these people felt that they were not being included, that they could not be part of the system.
She said we need restorative justice. You need to reach out to these people because you don't want more of them to come. We've all, right here on this sets said a lot of this ideology is like a cancer. It metastasizes and spreads. And you can't stop it just by use of violence or death penalties --
GUTFELD: Yes, you can. You sure can. Trump just did it. What is restorative justice?
WILLIAMS: Restorative justice is saying here is how you can become part of the community. Here's how you can make a contribution. Your life is valuable. You should not be involved in trying to kill people or kill yourself.
GUTFELD: But here's the issue, though. If a group of people and their ideology dictates that everything about your culture is evil, I don't think any amount of restorative justice is going to work. You know, she's -- the thing that bugs me about this is two things. She's defending the worst kind of misogyny probably in modern history, responsible for thousands of gang rapes, sex slavery. So she's lost the moral authority to lecture anybody about Trump, OK?
WILLIAMS: When did she defend gang rape?
GUTFELD: Read up on ISIS. OK. So, here's the thing --
WILLIAMS: In other words, it's not her.
GUTFELD: No. Read up on ISIS.
WILLIAMS: All right.
GUTFELD: She's defending people that were supporting gang rape and sexual slavery. So how do we not know about her beliefs beforehand? We were trained to stay away from honestly calling out her serious flaws because if you did, you would have been labeled misogynist and Islamophobic.
So when she rose to the ranks and won, everybody had to do the golf clap. Oh, this is great. This is so progressive. How wonderful. But we don't learn about her troubling beliefs. She was aided and abetted by a compliant media who protected her. And we -- I'm not going to say anything bad about her. Congratulations.
BILA: Yeah. You know, Morgan, she's been elevate -- I mean, she's got like a $100 to $250,000 book deal now. This is not somebody --
WATTERS: How much did you say that was?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Support ISIS.
BILA: There you go. That will be your ticket. No, but it's not only that they hadn't called her out but they have elevated her. I mean, you see her on TV all the time, getting a platform to talk about her beliefs, and nobody seems to be --
ORTAGUS: Women's magazine.
BILA: Right. And nobody seems to be paying attention to what she's actually saying. I mean, is this woman going to be -- is she also going to decide she wants to run for president?
ORTAGUS: The Democrat Party has a very serious problem with anti-Semitism that I think is festering and that they're not addressing.
Her tweets about Israel, you could look them up. What she said about Venezuela, you know, last week, talking about that it was a coup from the U.S. She took the side of the Chinese and the Russians. I mean, these are things that she is saying that is just basic research that her staff could do.
And first of all, let me say, there is a candidate, a Muslim candidate named Omar Qudrat, who was the first Republican to win a congressional primary, supported mainly by people of the Jewish faith in the Republican Party, who gave a ton of money to him. So there are people on the Republican side who are running for this, but she's the one who's been elevated, as you said, and been given this big platform.
And until Democrats start to realize -- look, just tonight, while we're on here, there's a -- there's a bill that's going through the Senate that Marco Rubio has been pushing that is a bit that is anti-BDS, which is the sanctions against Israel.
Schumer was able to get rid of the vote because he said, "Well, it's during the shutdown." All of these senators are going to start to be put on record, and they are afraid of the base, which is now becoming increasingly anti-Israel, increasingly hostile. And I think that there is simmering anti-Semitism in the base of the Democrat Party that they need to address.
WILLIAMS: I think that's wishful thinking. I don't think Democrats -- and let me say, most Jews in the country are Democrats. There's not --
ORTAGUS: Well, not this one.
WILLIAMS: We have -- we have a problem in the Democratic Party that was evident in terms of that Women's March that absolutely was a problem. But I'm just telling you this woman was elected in the state of Minnesota, has a track record in Minnesota, and those voters selected her. And that's why you're seeing her --
BILA: But she also -- she also has a track record of saying grossly incorrect, horrible things. And then she deletes tweets and has to walk them back.
WILLIAMS: You should -- you should meet the rest of Congress.
BILA: I mean, these comments that she made about Covington High School, that was outrageous. She smeared an entire group of kids with doing absolutely no research.
So I think the Democrats need to pay a little bit more attention to what she's been doing.
But moving on, the first lady scores of big win after a fake news smear. See it, coming up next.
GUTFELD: Fake news!
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Not going to D.C.! All right, the British paper The Daily Telegraph issued a humiliating apology on Saturday, admitting an article titled "The Mystery of Melania" was full of fake news about the first lady. They took it back and paid her substantial damages.
There's no point in recounting the story's lies. They're the same stuff you heard many times before, part of a larger industry built on unknown sources and bitter bias.
And it shows you the kind of year the media is having, and it's only been three weeks. But you have the Buzzfeed debacle, the Covington smear, layoffs at clickbait mills like Buzzfeed and "Huffington Post." CNN mocked for pretending they stumbled onto Roger Stone's arrest. And now you've got this brutal Telegraph humbling.
These events have one thing in common: accountability. It's new, and it's good for everyone, especially you, because you may not know how false the Melania coverage is, but you can bet she does. And that's the point. You never know what fake news is until it's about you.
Ask anyone who's ever been the subject of a story. Unless they're vacuous actors pumping a socially conscious film, it's never, ever good. It's why, love him or hate him, Trump's war with fake news makes the past two years' worth it. His disruption has exposed the hidden levers in so many dark guards: from trade to immigration to copy editing and fact-checking.
So if only one result from the Trump era is that -- is the media thinks that twice before destroying someone for fun and profit, then I'd call that a win. Wouldn't you?
All right. Every single person here has been the subject of a story. How close was the story to the facts?
BILA: Oh, I mean, I was the subject of several but when I left a particular show, I remember seeing something in The Daily Mail and reading it and being like, "False, false."
GUTFELD: Yes.
BILA: I would say 80 percent of it was false.
GUTFELD: Right.
BILA: And they put just enough truth in there, where there's, like, a tiny nugget of truth and they count on you not doing anything. I didn't do anything about it, because I was advised, "Leave it."
GUTFELD: Right.
BILA: "You're going to add fuel to the fire. You're going to draw attention to it." But the truth is, then you let it sit out there, and it drives you crazy, because you're like, "This is not me. This is a false perception. And if anybody reads it, you don't want them to walk away thinking that.
GUTFELD: Its forever.
BILA: And it's forever.
GUTFELD: It sits out there.
BILA: It's infuriating.
GUTFELD: It sits out there, but to her -- to Jed's point, Jesse, if you like -- it's why Trump is refreshing, in that he actually is willing to go chase this thing like a dog and catch the car.
WATTERS: Right. It's -- this is like Wikipedia is more accurate that some of this stuff. And they got basic facts wrong.
I think Americans need to realize something, Greg. Journalists are not that bright. These people, they didn't graduate first in their class from Harvard. They live in small apartments in New York and D.C. They don't have a lot of money.
GUTFELD: So do most of us.
WATTERS: They're boring people at parties. They -- if you line them up between bankers and advertising executives and lawyers, they rank dead last on intelligence. Think about it. They get stuff wrong all the time.
GUTFELD: You are the king of generalizations.
WATTERS: It's true. I mean, they called the White House Correspondents' Dinner party "nerd prom" --
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: -- because it's filled with nerds.
These people aren't that intelligent, but they act superior; and they hate Donald Trump. And they're riddled with errors in their stories. And guess what? All of the errors make Republicans look bad. Why is it that they never make mistakes that make Democrats look bad? It's always on the other side.
BILA: They make mistakes that make them look good. They make stuff up to make them look good.
GUTFELD: You know, Juan, you -- when I asked -- in the break, I said, "Have you been the subject of a story? And how close was it to the truth?" And you were like "Ha!" So it's happened to you, and you are a journalist. It's happened to you.
WILLIAMS: Yes. And by the way, I don't know about the small apartment. I better inform my wife and a bunch of people.
WATTERS: You've done well for yourself, Juan.
WILLIAMS: But -- but I must say that, to me, you know, when you see what happened with The Daily Telegraph, they have to pay, apparently, some million -- more than a million dollars, right, plus her legal fees. So they were wrong.
But I must say, a lot of this comes from "Fire and Fury."
GUTFELD: Right.
WILLIAMS: A lot of this comes -- I think there are now several books. I think there's a book out this week about Trump. A lot of this doesn't seem, Jesse, like it's myths. A lot of it comes from inside the Trump camp by people who worked with him.
WATTERS: They had basic facts wrong.
WILLIAMS: No they did --
WATTERS: They had dates and time lines --
WILLIAMS: There's a bigger story here about this president. That you're saying, oh -- to the audience, "Oh, just ignore everything that's negative about Trump, because these guys got it wrong."
WATTERS: That's the problem, is because the media gets so many things wrong about Republicans.
WILLIAMS: Oh, come on.
WATTERS: When they do get something right and it's real news, no one believes them when they're right.
WILLIAMS: I'll tell you --
WATTERS: They have no track record.
WILLIAMS: You want to go back and see how much attention Donald Trump got from the CNNs and MSNBCs of the world that put him on the air?
WATTERS: Just because he got attention doesn't make it accurate.
WILLIAMS: Let me say, when he goes after Buzzfeed, right, for their problems or Huff Post or goes after The New York Post, because they're laying off people, I think, man, that is low. So in other words, you're going to hit journalists who are being fired.
WATTERS: Those same journalists love getting people fired.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: They want you fired, Juan. They want me fired.
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.
WATTERS: They revel in it.
GUTFELD: Juan, The Huffington Post has rarely --
WATTERS: They're not clean.
GUTFELD: What The Huffington Post does is they repurpose articles that were done -- either Media Matters will put out something. Then Mediaite picks it up. And then Huffington Post repurposes it all, with the purpose of screwing over people who are generally to the right of them, and getting them fired. So I have no sympathy.
And I wrote -- remember, I wrote for The Huffington Post for ten years, I think. I tend to forget that.
WATTERS: It was a long time.
GUTFELD: It was a long time.
So here's -- here's the bigger thing, Morgan. It used to be rare that Joe Blow would be a target of the media. But now we're in this area where anyone tangentially related to Trump, voting for Trump --
ORTAGUS: Right.
GUTFELD: -- supporting Trump, wearing a red hat at the Washington Monument --
ORTAGUS: Right.
GUTFELD: -- no one is safe. So I think it's important now that we really go to war.
ORTAGUS: I think it's important that you bring that up, because you know, in the whole Covington thing, I almost tweeted -- just by watching the video, I almost tweeted and said, "What are these kids doing?"
GUTFELD: I did. I made a mistake.
ORTAGUS: I stopped. I stopped, and I'm glad I did. And I waited a day and looked at the news. And then you say, "Wait a minute. There's a fuller story here."
But if you talk more about media accountability writ large, Juan is right, actually. In the Republican primary, it was estimated in the general election, in the 2016 campaign, that Trump got probably, what two billion dollars' worth of free media.
So I think what is happening now is, even though they won't admit it out loud --
GUTFELD: Guilt.
ORTAGUS: I do. I think it's guilt that they realize that they let him call into these TV shows on a daily basis. They showed all of his -- every network showed all of the rallies live. They did all of these things. And now, I think that these other networks and journalistic outfits feel a little bit of culpability, and so they have overextended. And of course, you know, it's all ratings.
GUTFELD: Yes, they're -- yes.
BILA: Andrew Breitbart was talking about the war with the media before it was cool. Because everybody else was talking about elections and politicians. And he was out there saying the problem is the media. That's where your fight is. And he was 100 percent right.
GUTFELD: All right. We're not done yet. Harry Potter -- who's that? It's a guy in my garden -- taking a shot at Patriots quarterback Tom Brady but for a surprise reason. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ORTAGUS: The New England Patriots and their star quarterback, Tom Brady, are no stranger to criticism and being rooted against. But this time it's coming from a little bit of an unusual place. Actor Daniel Radcliffe. Who's that again? Well, he played harry Potter, and he is taking a swipe at Brady while promoting a new movie.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl?
DANIEL RADCLIFFE, ACTOR: Rams.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why?
RADCLIFFE: Because, like, the whole world is rooting against the Patriots. Sorry.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Should Tom Brady retire?
RADCLIFFE: No. But, like, he should just stop winning things. Take that MAGA hat out of your locker. I feel that that was a moment when, as a country, we were all like, "Come on, dude. We want to be "You're awesome' and behind you. Don't put that in there."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ORTAGUS: The hat in question is a 2015 gift that President Trump gave to Patriots owner Robert Kraft to hand off to Brady.
Greg, I feel like everyone should be rooting against Brady because he's a cheater, not because of the MAGA hat. What do you think?
WATTERS: Ooh, wow.
GUTFELD: Being as though we both went to Serra High School, I'm going to let that slide.
Two observations here. The problem with British celebrities is the bigness of the United States. So whenever they look at the United States, they have an insecurity complex. He looks over.
What did he say? He wished Brady would stop winning things. That's very British celebrity, because they prefer to be very small.
But back to the -- back to almost what I said yesterday. The smear is widening. So it's not about Trump or Republicans. It's anyone who has an affiliation or sympathy. We have a cultural witch hunt going on. "You have that hat on the locker? I can't be your friend."
WATTERS: Witch hunt?
GUTFELD: Witch hunt.
WATTERS: Where did you get that phrase?
GUTFELD: I don't know! Warlock hunt.
WATTERS: Oh, there you go.
GUTFELD: There you go. Although that sounds gross, but anyway.
ORTAGUS: Juan, do you think that malpeople shouldn't be friends with people who wear MAGA hats? Is it a racist hat?
WILLIAMS: To me, look, I mean, you've got to just be open-minded about it and say, OK.
But I must say I don't understand that you don't -- you guys don't see that this hat is loaded with meaning for people in terms of being associated with Donald Trump --
GUTFELD: What about a Malcolm X hat?
WILLIAMS: -- from the very -- yes, if you want to say that, fine. But we know what Malcolm X stood for.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And we know what Donald Trump stands for. And if it's grabbing women --
GUTFELD: Are you saying they're the same?
WILLIAMS: No, definitely not. And if it's grabbing women or talking about Mexicans as rapists and thieves.
GUTFELD: Or job growth.
WILLIAMS: If it's anti- -- no one's job growth. Wear an Obama hat in that case.
GUTFELD: The biggest history, and minorities, women and the job history.
WILLIAMS: I'm just saying there's -- I mean, and the racism, the misogyny. I think a lot of people think, "What are you doing with this hat? You don't understand what you are --"
GUTFELD: So you are smearing everybody wearing the hat?
ORTAGUS: So Jedediah, I mean, I root for the Eagles, but other than that, I choose my quarterbacks based off who's the cutest. Like, that's how I decide who I want to root for, which is very Sporty Spice of me.
What do you think about this? Can we even have a Super Bowl without people getting political? Or do you think --
BILA: No.
ORTAGUS: -- Super Bowl parties, it's going to be --
BILA: No.
ORTAGUS: -- MAGA hat versus Obama hat?
BILA: You can't, because it drives -- for some reason liberals are uncomfortable, like, with the fact that somebody disagrees. I don't know why it bothers him that somebody has a MAGA hat. Like, who cares? It's not your hat. You don't have to wear it.
It didn't drive me crazy to walk around New York City and see --
GUTFELD: Dresses like a little sorcerer --
BILA: -- a million Obama hats.
And it's because that liberal mentality, though, is a collectivist mentality. And I think a lot of times they are rubbed the wrong way. Not all, but many are rubbed the wrong way by somebody who disagrees, who doesn't see the world the same way. They can't quite understand that.
And I think we're in a world now where everything is political. You can't -- we saw with the NFL. It became super political. But people are tired, because when it became super political, people started, you know, turning the channel. And then they were brought back in when that political component was back out of it.
WILLIAMS: So you going to change the channel on Mookie Betts, who says he's not going to the White House with the Sox? Are you going to change the channel on the NBA team, LeBron James.
BILA: There has to be a space where it's not political, though, and it's not --
GUTFELD: Because -- we don't -- we separate the political and personal. Political is not personal for me.
WATTERS: For me, like, I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan, right? And he hates Republicans.
GUTFELD: He probably hates you.
WATTERS: All -- he hates me. Yes, I put all of my Will Ferrell clips in the "Watters' World" package.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I was able to separate. See how that's done, Juan? You separate.
My mom loves me, roots for me.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I have a MAGA hat. She separates.
WILLIAMS: Separate.
WATTERS: Separate.
WILLIAMS: I think Tom Brady's wife was very clear in saying, "We do not back Trump." And she was trying to get the political out.
ORTAGUS: Did she say that? I think she told him not to talk politics.
GUTFELD: Then I'll go.
WILLIAMS: And she said, "We didn't back him."
BILA: And she said that. She did say that.
ORTAGUS: OK. Well, there you go.
WATTERS: This is a new one.
ORTAGUS: So before we go -- who is Daniel Radcliffe again? OK, before we go, we have some big news. President Trump has accepted Nancy Pelosi's invitation, and Greg is going to have to go to D.C.
GUTFELD: No!
ORTAGUS: To deliver the State of the Union next Tuesday. "One More Thing" is up next.
GUTFELD: That is not happening.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It's time now for "One More Thing." I have some workout tips.
GUTFELD: Oh, no.
BILA: Oh, boy.
Graphic: "Jesse's Workout Tips."
WATTERS: "Jesse's Workout Tips." Wow. Yes, that's real. What were those, 70 pounds? I'm just warming up with those buddies.
So work out at the gym. Do not work out at the office, all right? Have you seen these exercise balls? Roll this tape, please. You know, people sit on them at their desk desk.
ORTAGUS: I love -- you have to keep these here at all times.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(WOMAN SITS ON EXERCISE BALL AND FALLS OFF)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: OK. She tried to do a little, you know -- see how it works. It doesn't work well. People are falling off these things all over at FOX News. They're unsafe, and I don't like them. So let's get rid of them. Work out at the gym, not at the office. All right?
GUTFELD: Lawsuit. I smell a lawsuit.
WATTERS: Against me?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I apologize.
Go ahead, Greg.
GUTFELD: Time for --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: I know, guys. I'm killing you with it. I'm slowly destroying your brain.
You know, porcupines, they love bananas. Baby porcupines love bananas even more.
BILA: Oh, no!
GUTFELD: Check out this baby porcupines eating a banana. I don't think I've ever seen somebody or something love a banana more than this baby porcupine. Look at that giant nose that porcupine has. And look at the way he just eats that. You know, when I watch a porcupine eat a banana all I can say to myself is --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Yes!
WATTERS: That was a pretty good one.
All right. Juan.
WILLIAMS: So, you know, there's frigid weather heading this way in New York, New England, the middle Atlantic states, but especially in the Midwest.
And right now off the coast of Dana Point in southern California the temperatures are closer to summertime, and there's a very special rainbow there to warm your heart. Take a look.
GUTFELD: Is that a --
WILLIAMS: That's a humpback whale and her calf, and they're blowing rainbows. A drone recorded this colorful show Saturday, the whales are migrating from Central America to Dana Point to feed on the bridge.
By the way, whale touring companies in that area say they have seen 42 humpbacks so far this January, compared to only four a year ago.
GUTFELD: Blowing rainbows.
WILLIAMS: Yes, so --
GUTFELD: That sounds like a euphemism.
WILLIAMS: So as your teeth are chattering over the next few days, remember the warmth and beauty of this scene off Dana Point.
BILA: Ohh.
WATTERS: So cute.
WILLIAMS: Thanks.
WATTERS: Jedediah. I'm not going to make a joke. It's just too wholesome.
BILA: Well, I have some good news. Cassie, a mixed breed, a 5-year-old mixed breed, has found her forever home. Happy puppy in Ohio. The Humane Society of Dayton shared the news on Facebook.
Cassie gained popularity after making an appearance in a commercial for a car dealership, posing as a super good girl on local TV stations. And her new owner saw the commercial, was drawn to her.
So she has been adopted into her forever home and I believe she has been adopted before it brought back, which made me very sad. So I am so happy that she has found a forever home.
WATTERS: Forever homes.
BILA: Yay.
ORTAGUS: It's fate.
So my "One More Thing" is about something that could only happen to men in a road rage accident.
There's shocking video, if you haven't seen this today, coming out of Massachusetts. Watch this as this man climbs on the hood of a speeding SUV down the highway. Richard Kamaraski (ph), 65-year-old man, and 37-year-old Mark Fitzgerald, they got in a car accident on the turnpike. Fitzgerald tried to leave the scene. This guy jumps on the hood of the car.
I mean, it's a hot mess. He stayed on there for two or 3 miles.
WILLIAMS: Two or three miles?
ORTAGUS: Sometimes the -- and the driver got up to 70 miles an hour. This is why I said this would only happen to men. Women would not do this.
GUTFELD: Second sexist thing you've said today. You are a sexist.
ORTAGUS: Luckily two motorists helped bring the dangerous situation to an end by boxing the SUV in, and the rest is history.
WILLIAMS: Greg --
ORTAGUS: Also, I will be on with Shannon Bream tonight at the 11 o'clock hour. Stay up late.
WATTERS: They should use a Gillette razor.
WILLIAMS: Did you see the guy had -- the guy had a ponytail.
WATTERS: Juan, we've got to go. Never miss an episode of "The Five." Hey, Bret.
