Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Do you know what worries me? Or worse, even scares me?
Things like this. Here is what a senior military official said last week about the fight against ISIS, also known on Arabic shorthand as "Daesh." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRIG. GEN. THOMAS WEIDLEY, CHIEF OF STAFF, COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE, OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE: We firmly believe Daesh is on the defensive throughout Iraq and Syria, attempting to hold previous gains while conducting small-scale localized harassing attacks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

He said ISIS - Daesh - was on the defensive. If they are on the defensive, that means we are winning, right? Well, less than three days later, ISIS is hanging its ugly black flag in triumph over Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's largest province. And joint Chief's of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey releases a statement calling the fall of Ramadi a serious "setback." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's a serious setback? That's it? Ask yourself this: How many setbacks is it going to take for the Pentagon to admit the Obama military strategy isn't working? First Fallujah, then Mosul and now Ramadi. They think it's just a setback? Oh, brother!
Either the Pentagon is completely out of the loop or flat-out lying to us. Either one, lying or out of the loop, is terrifying for our Pentagon. We're in trouble, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
