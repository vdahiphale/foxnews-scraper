'Off the Record,' 3/2/15: William Shatner's getting a lot of heat for missing fellow 'Star Trek' icon and close friend Leonard Nimoy's funeral because he couldn't get out of a scheduled charity event in time. Lay off - he couldn't be in two places at once

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. William Shatner, one of the stars of Star Trek and a favorite of Trekkies, is getting barbecued online for not going to Sunday's funeral for his co-star Leonard Nimoy. Now it's not just online criticism, try this: the New York Daily News dubbed him "Captain Jerk."
So, why did Shatner say he could not make the funeral? Well, he promised the Red Cross he would go to their charity event in Florida, and obviously he could not be in two places at once. Shatner said his daughters would his representatives at Nimoy's funeral. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But then, after a lot more criticism blew up all over Twitter, Shatner did jump on a plane as soon as he could, and that was Sunday morning after the charity event. But then he got to LA too late for the funeral. The funeral was at 9:00 am and Shatner did not arrive in LA until 11:30am, so he missed it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So here's my thought: For God's sake, quit dumping on Shatner. I'm sure he feels terrible that Nimoy died. Yes, while their relationship was rocky in their early Star Trek days, they later became close friends. In 2004,, Shatner posted this about Nimoy: "He's my wonderful companion through time, and I value his presence in my life more than I can say. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So I don't know about you, but I'm more interested in how my friends treat me when I'm alive than who shows up at my funeral. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
