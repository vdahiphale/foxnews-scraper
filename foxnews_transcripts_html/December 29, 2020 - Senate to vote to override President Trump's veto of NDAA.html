It also includes a closer look at electionfraud.However, the majority leader is standing firm on funding for the militarysupporting the National Defense Authorization Act that the presidentvetoed.Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel is following the latestdevelopments. He joins us now with the breaking details. Good evening,Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Bret, good evening to you. You have the Senate Majority Leaderoffering new legislation to address three of President Trump's keypriorities. Those $2,000 checks also repeal of Section 230 protections forbig tech and an advisory committee that would study the 2020 election andmake recommendations to Congress on improving security, integrity andadministration of federal elections.Democrats are calling those poison pills and want to vote on just the$2,000 checks. McConnell was vague today about timing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Those are the three important subjects thepresident has linked together. This week, the Senate will begin a processto bring these three priorities into focus.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): With no intervening action or debate.EMANUEL (voice over): The Senate Democratic Leader tried to force a votetoday on the $2,000 stimulus checks, but McConnell objected.SCHUMER: We should not adjourn until the Senate holds a vote on bothmeasures, the NDAA veto override and the House bill to provide $2,000checks for the American people.EMANUEL: Then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders tried to force the stimulusvote today and he was blocked too.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is there objection to the request for modification?MCCONNELL: I object.EMANUEL: Sanders had threatened to keep senators in session through the NewYear's holiday to address stimulus.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Working families need help now, not next year,but right now.EMANUEL: Senate GOP leadership is hoping to vote as soon as tomorrow tooverride President Trump's veto of the $740-billion National DefenseAuthorization Act, but that could be delayed by frustrated Democrats.SEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): My Republican colleagues seem more interested infunding defense than in funding the defenseless, and that's what thisdebate is all about.EMANUEL: Democrats are hoping the political calendar might help with thecritical Georgia runoffs which will decide the balance of power in theSenate and a desire for those senators to be out on the campaign trail.SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA): I'm delighted to support the president in this2000 it's really a $1,400 increment over what we've already done. And Ithink with the vaccine coming, I think this is absolutely appropriate. So,I fully support what the president is doing right now.SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): I stood by the President 100 percent of thetime. I'm proud to do that. And I've said absolutely, we need to get reliefto Americans now.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): Right now, it's not clear if the new McConnell billwould have 60 votes in favor. The same is true with the $2,000 checks bythemselves. Five Republicans are on the record in favor of the checks. Theyneed 12 to reach the critical 60 yes votes, Bret.BAIER: Mike, thank you. More on this with the panel.President Trump did not hold any public events today. But as he often does,he was happy to share his thoughts on Twitter even targeting some fellowDemocrats and Republicans. Correspondent Rich Edson has details from WestPalm Beach, Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Two bills severalcontroversial issues and a president pushing divided Republicans from athousand miles away. Tweeting: "Weak and tired Republican leadership willallow the bad defense bill to pass. A disgraceful act of cowardice andtotal submission by weak people to big tech. Negotiate a better bill or getbetter leaders, now. Senate should not approve NDAA until fixed."President Trump wants Congress to repeal an unrelated law that gives techcompanies legal protections. He also wants Congress to remove provisions inthe National Defense Authorization Act that would scrub Confederate namesfrom military installations and limit the president's authority to withdrawcertain troops abroad.SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): These are things that the president believes weshould address, and that members of the Congress and the new administrationbelieve we should address. We will address them. And we have an opportunityto do that. But we should not try to do that on this bill.EDSON: The president is also keeping up the pressure on Republicans toapprove a House measure to more than triple COVID relief checks to $2,000repeatedly tweeting messages like, "$600 is not enough."The issue has split Republicans between those who want to support thepresident and those who say they're concerned about adding nearly a halftrillion dollars to the national debt.REP. MO BROOKS (R-AL): They've got a $27 trillion debt, its money we don'thave.EDSON: This week, the president must also decide whether to continuesuspending visas for various categories of foreign workers to enter theUnited States.In June, the president halted certain work visas, citing concerns about theeconomic effects of a worldwide pandemic. That suspension expires Thursday.Conservative groups advocating greater limits on immigration are urging thepresident to extend the order.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (on camera): And business groups are urging the administration toallow those groups of workers back into the country, though if thepresident does extend this executive order and continues to ban thoseworkers. He may push this issue off to the next administration.President-Elect Joe Biden is promising to reverse much of the Trumpadministration's immigration agenda, Bret.BAIER: Rich Edson in West Palm Beach.

The President-Elect delivered a blunt warning, deaths and cases aregoing to get worse before they get better and brighter days may not comeuntil March.He also said the Trump administration has fallen short on its goals forvaccinations, both of which have been acknowledged by the Trumpadministration's Coronavirus Task Force.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: With only a few days leftin December, we've only vaccinated a few million so far. In the pace ofvaccine, the vaccination program is moving now as if -- if it continues tomove as it is now, it's going to take years, not months to vaccinate theAmerican people.HEINRICH (voice over): Biden pledged to authorize the Defense ProductionAct to boost production of PPE and vaccine material. A promise he madethroughout his campaign.President Trump has also used the wartime law to boost pandemic response.Biden also primed Congress for a COVID action package he'll propose earlynext year seeking more funding. He needed to open the majority of K-8schools within his first 100 days and to facilitate a massive vaccinationcampaign including with mobile testing sites in hard to reach communities.Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris received her first shot today and Bidenagain pledged the vaccine will be delivered free and equitably and calledan Americans to wear a mask in the meantime, praising Chris Christie forencouraging mask wearing and urging President Trump to do so as well.BIDEN: I give former Governor Chris Christie credit. He and I havedisagreed on a number of things. But I'm thankful he's now encouragingpeople to do the right thing.I hope that President Trump will listen to him.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera): The Trump administration's vaccination effortOperation Warp Speed is one area the Biden team is encounteringobstruction, a source is telling me tonight. This comes after Biden warnedyesterday his team's being sidelined by political leadership at theDepartment of Defense and Office of Management and Budget.I'm told Biden's team couldn't get a meeting with the DOD for the last 11days. Pentagon officials denying dozens of requests and critical blindspots include Operation Warp Speed, the budget and also cybersecurity,Bret.BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich in Wilmington.

AttorneyGeneral Letitia James launching an investigation in some ParCare CommunityHealth Network over allegations that committed fraud in obtaining andwrongfully distributing 2,300 vaccine doses to its clinics in Brooklyn andadministering 850 shots to the general public, ignoring state rulesspecifying that the first round of vaccines go to frontline health careworkers and long term care residents.Now, the clinic could face falsifying business record charges for allegedlymisrepresenting itself in order to receive vaccines through the state ofNew York.DR. HOWARD ZUCKER, NEW YORK STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER: We provided them thevaccine because they fraudulently filled out a form that said that theywere a qualified health center that was incorrect.LLENAS: ParCare denies wrongdoing, providing this packing slip to Fox Newsshowing they received the vaccines legally through New York's Department ofHealth.Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order making vaccine fraudpunishable by a million dollar fine, loss of state licenses and evenpotentially prosecuting patients.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): If you received the vaccine, and you knew youweren't supposed to receive the vaccine, and that was a fraudulent act byyou.LLENAS: This as the U.S. Treasury warns financial institutions nationwideto stay alert to COVID-19 vaccine related scams and cyber attacks.So far, more than 2.1 million vaccine shots have been administered andalmost 11-1/2 million have been distributed, well short of the 20 millionvaccine doses promised.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: We certainly are not at the numbers that we want it to be at theend of December.I believe that as we get into January, we are going to see an increase inthe momentum.(END VIDEO CLIP)LLENAS (on camera): And despite vaccine delays, certain members ofCongress, their staffs, two members per -- most of the staffs will havebeen moved to the front of the vaccination line while police officersworking for the NYPD are still waiting for their first vaccine shots, Bret.BAIER: Bryan Llenas in Brooklyn. Bryan, thanks.The CDC says seasonal influenza activity in the U.S. remains significantlylower than usual for this time of year. Nationwide one-tenth of one percentof those specimens tested were positive for influenza last week.We have a chart here showing from the CDC that this year's visit reportsfor flu symptoms in the red triangles at the bottom. The visits are muchlower than at least six of the previous flu seasons.One possible reason for the dramatic drop in cases, according to healthofficials, is the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronaviruscould also be slowing the spread of the flu which is transmitted the sameway.Up next, voters approve the measure. Now, many say they have been duped asinmates convicted of crimes like indecent exposure and child pornographycould now be eligible for early parole.And later, why a Georgia senate rally this week is now facing questionsover double standards in the cancel culture era.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see two black people?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No! I'm not letting him walk away with my phone!(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: New York City prosecutors are investigating this confrontation at ahotel, Jazz musician Keyon Harrold, says a woman grabbed and tackled his14-year-old son in the lobby she accused him of stealing her phone.Harrold says the hotel told him the phone was returned by an Uber drivershortly afterward.The California Supreme Court says inmates convicted of nonviolent sexcrimes cannot be denied a chance at early parole consideration. Nationalcorrespondent William La Jeunesse looks at the ruling and the response fromLos Angeles.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Out ofoffice but not the news, in 2016, former California Governor Jerry Brownbankrolled Prop 57, offering non-violent inmates' early parole.Sex offenders, Brown, claimed did not qualify.CHARLES CHUNG, LAWYER, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CALIFORNIA: His decision toexclude registered sex offenders was also informed by the promises made byGovernor Brown.LA JEUNESSE: Now, the state Supreme Court says otherwise. The propositionprovides no indications of the voters intended to exclude from paroleconsideration an inmate's sex offenses when the inmate was convicted of anonviolent felony.JIM PATTERSON, MEMBER, CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY: There's nothingnonviolent about piping, there's nothing nonviolent about raping anunconscious individual. There is nonviolent about the possession of childpornography.LA JEUNESSE: Voters experts say may have been duped.KIM NALDER, PROFESSOR, SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY: The arguments in favorand the arguments against are by proponents and opponents, and they are notvetted for accuracy necessarily. And so, it's possible that there issomething that could be exaggerated or misleading.LA JEUNESSE: Prop 57 was one of several efforts to reduce prisonovercrowding. Attorney say the ruling means up to 20,000 inmates could bereleased early, largely because only state law defines violent felonies,Prop 57 did not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are some examples of nonviolent felonies?DREW SODERBORG, CALIFORNIA STATE ANALYST: So, one thing that we noted isthat the measure doesn't define nonviolent felony.LA JEUNESSE: So, voters only knew what they were told or a single paragraphin the voter guide, something experts at this symposium for inform votersfound funny.NALDER: Where is that list posted?SODERBORG: That list is in a section of the penal code. At Section 667.5 bemaybe? I don't know how helpful that is for you.NALDER: Lies.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (on camera): It's now up to the state corrections department todetermine which inmates are eligible for a hearing in early release.Officials put the number between four in 5,000. Bret.BAIER: A fine print. William, thank you.The Justice Department says it will not bring federal criminal chargesagainst two Cleveland police officers involved in the 2014 killing of a 12-year-old, Tamir Rice. They said the quality of the video of the shootingwas too poor for prosecutors to conclusively establish what happened.To bring federal civil rights charges, the Justice Department must provethe officer willfully broke the law rather than a mistake, negligence, orbad judgment. Prosecutors concluded the evidence was insufficient to provebeyond the reasonable doubt the officers violated Tamir Rice'sconstitutional rights.Up next, we look at the Georgia senate runoffs one week before Election Dayand how cancel-culture may be impacting that race.First, here is what's some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight.Fox 25 in Boston, where a statue of Abraham Lincoln with a freed slavekneeling at his feet has been removed from its perch in downtown Boston.Workers remove the emancipation memorial this morning from a park where ithad stood since 1879.In June, the mayor acknowledge the statue made residents and visitors alikeuncomfortable.

American Airlines' first flight took off from Miami, landingsafely in New York.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. Wewill be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Georgia's Republican secretary of state just putting out thestatement, saying the presidential election results have been confirmed inGeorgia for a third time after a hand recount, then, a machine recountrequested by the Trump campaign. Today, a signature match audit in CobbCounty finished found no fraudulent absentee ballots. That coming in just afew minutes ago.One week from tonight, America will be watching Georgia decide which partywill control the U.S. Senate. We'll be broadcasting from Atlanta startingSunday. Candidates, political ads, volunteers, are already all overGeorgia, and so is controversy.Correspondent Steve Harrigan is following the race from Atlanta.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Early votingin Georgia's two runoffs is running at about three-quarters of the pace ofthe general election. So far, 2.3 million people have voted candidate JonOssoff says the reason, a strong ground game.JON OSSOFF (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, GEORGIA: We have called more than 5million Georgia voters in recent weeks. We are knocking on tens ofthousands of doors per day.HARRIGAN: Airwaves in Georgia are so saturated with political ads; thecampaigns are buying an unprecedented amount of time in neighboring Alabamaand Florida. Some voters are overwhelmed.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I definitely voted for you and Warnock but it's just,I'm a little nervous just because of all this negative talk.HARRIGAN: Democratic candidate Reverend Raphael Warnock is drawing much ofthe heat. The Washington Free Beacon reported that counselors at a camp runby Warnock in Maryland in 2002 poured urine on a 12-year-old camper, whosaid his family sued and received the settlement. His opponent, KellyLoeffler, says the incident should disqualify Warnock.LOEFFLER: This is disgusting, it's disqualifying, and Georgians deserveanswers.HARRIGAN: Warnock was arrested by police for interference when he insistedcounselors have attorneys present. The charges were dropped. A federaljudge in Georgia on Monday ordered two counties to reverse the decision toremoved 4,000 voters from the rolls due to U.S. Postal Service change ofaddress records.The judge is the sister of Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic candidate forgovernor who has led voter registration efforts in Georgia. The judgedeclined the request to recuse herself.Georgia's Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger called theruling a "direct attack" on Georgia law. He's also vowed to crack down online warming, where a political groups give away food or drinks or smallgifts to people in line to vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)HARRIGAN (on camera):  Some party leaders have expressed concern that thefight over the legitimacy of votes in the general election may lead to someRepublicans not voting in the runoff elections. Bret?BAIER:  Steve, thank you. We should point out the president just tweetedhe's like to see the signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia, theprocess, according to him, going very slowly.The Georgia runoffs have had a bit of everything, including how a questionover a double standard when it comes to cancel culture. CorrespondentLeland Vittert explains.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When the rapper BRS Kash headlineda get out the vote event for Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, he edited thelyrics of his song "Throat Baby" to "Vote Baby." The real lyrics, as heardon the music video, are far too vulgar for this program, as are many of hispast tweets about women, police officers, and sex. "Is it an accident orrape, lol" wrote Kash in a screenshot of this 2012 treat."This is who Georgia Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff had headlinedtheir event today. Will they denounce this disgusting individual?" wroteNathan Brand of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Ossoff and Warnock have ignored repeated requests from FOX News, as has BRSKash. Somehow Kash has avoided the fate of so many with old tweets orcomments. But 18-year-old Mimi Groves hasn't. This weekend, "The New YorkTimes" chronicled the plight of a Virginia cheerleader who had her worldupended by something she said four years ago. In 2016 Mimi Groves recordeda three-second video in which he used a racial slur. In late 2019 fellowhigh school student Jimmy Galligan saw the clip online. In the middle ofthis year after George Floyd's death, Galligan posted the video, and Mimibecame the center of a national social media firestorm. Quickly, theUniversity of Tennessee's cheerleading team canceled Groves' roster slot,and she withdrew from the university. That was back in June. The timing ofSaturday's "New York Times" coverage doesn't make sense to FOX Newscontributor Joe Concha.JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  How is this now a story if that videowas released in June and all of this happen six, seven months ago, why arewe talking about it now if you're "The New York Times"? Instead they'relionizing cancel culture, and this now puts it on a national stage.(END VIDEO TAPE)VITTERT:  For her part, Mimi Groves says she will spend the rest of herlife trying to explain that she's more than that three-second videorecorded at 15-years-old. Many are asking if Mr. Kash, the rapper, willface the same type of scrutiny for his tweets. Bret?BAIER:  Leland, thank you.Up next, the action or inaction on Capitol Hill and how that's impactingthe Georgia Senate runoffs. The panel joins us.First, beyond our borders tonight. A 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit Croatiatoday, killing at least seven people, the earthquake destroying buildings,sending panicked people fleeing into rubble covered streets in the townsoutheast of the capital. It's the second significant earthquake this weekto hit that country.Argentina's Senate is preparing to vote on a measure that would make thecountry the first big country in predominantly Catholic Latin America toallow abortion on demand. The bill, which has already passed theArgentinian lower house, would allow for abortions up until the 14th weekof pregnancy.And in Peru, the Association of Shamans and Healers asked mother earth forthe pandemic to end and world leaders be cleansed so they can make wisedecisions. The yearend ritual gathered shamans and healers who predictbetter times ahead in the new year. Thank God for that.Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The president highlightedthree additional issues of national significance he would like to seeCongress tackle together. This week the Senate will begin a process tobring these three priorities into focus.CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The solution is a simple one.Put both bills up for a simple up or down vote, and then let the chips fallwhere they may. I believe both measures will pass, as they should. ButLeader McConnell must allow the Senate to vote on both pieces oflegislation, the defense bill and the $2,000 checks, before we go home.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is their objection to the modification?MCCONNELL:  I object.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Objection is heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today saying he's goingto wrap things together, the president's priorities here. And what do wemean in that way? Remember, the $2,000 check, there's already a $600stimulus that's going out and the treasury secretary says it could hit bankaccounts tonight, definitely within this week. To make that $2,000, then toput in Section 230 protection, and that is dealing with tech companies andprotecting them, and election integrity also part of this piece oflegislation that would look at election fraud and concerns the presidenthas.Now, it seems highly unlikely that that's all going to come together in theSenate. And you heard the objection to just voting on the $2,000.Let's bring in our panel, we'll straighten it all out, Tom Bevan, RealClear Politics co-founder and president, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at"The Federalist," and Steve Hayes, editor of "The Dispatch."Steve, this is one way, the Senate majority leader could say I'm going toput it all out there, but I'm going to wrap these things together. Notlikely the Democrats are going to go for that.STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's right. It's acomplicated matter because you have Republicans supporting some of it, youhave Democrats supporting other parts of it. I you look at what MitchMcConnell is doing, he's sort of cleverly adding poison pills to thislegislation that track exactly with what President Trump said he wantedwhen he decided to sign the big relief package and omnibus.I think what's important here is the context. This is not really a policyfight. This is much more about Republicans having to respond to a tempertantrum from the president who is trying to steal an election, basically.If you look at what President Trump is saying, this is about Donald Trump.This is not about the future of the country. This is not about the futureof the Republican Party. It's not even really about COVID relief. If reliefwere so urgent, one suspects that the president would've made this happenmonths and months ago.It's important to remember that his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wasat the center of the negotiations. He was on phone calls with members ofthe House of Representatives, Republicans, urging them to vote for the $600relief a week ago. And now the president is calling for this $2,000 relief,which complicates virtually everything Republicans in the Senate want todo, and certainly complicates the Georgia specials.BAIER:  Mollie?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  I think these areactually policy issues in play. Senator McConnell has grouped themtogether. He claimed that Trump grouped them together, but of course Trumphad tied the defense authorization with Section 230 repeal. That's theissue where big tech is afforded all sorts of regulatory protections evenas they engage in tyrannical behavior against online speech and censoringopen, free, and fair discussion of important election issues.These are actually important policy issues. Whether big tech is allowed tocompletely behave this way against conservative speech is a policy issue.Whether you believe in the conservative populism where after the governmenthas shuttered all these businesses and destroyed a chance for a family tomake any money this year, whether they should get a $2,000 compensation isa policy issue. Whether you care about election integrity is a policyissue.And so even though Mitch McConnell seems to be doing this to kill thechance of any of these things actually happening, it also provides a chancefor a marker to be laid down where people can say where they stand on theseissues as well as on that defense authorization, which is one of the bigsticky points there is whether presidents can at any point end some ofthese wars that were started by previous administrations, or whether neverending war will have to just continue into perpetuity. That's an importantpolicy issue as well.BAIER:  It seems like the veto will be overturned. We'll see what thatvotes comes down. But when you talk about politics and the Georgia Senateraces now just a week away, the $2,000 stimulus check, take a listen, andthere are the races. Take a listen to Senators Loeffler and Perdue on thisissue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DAVID PERDUE, (R-GA):  I am delighted to support the president in his$2,000, it's really a $1,400 increment over what we've already done. It'sthe right thing to do for people in Georgia.SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA):  I've stood by the president 100 percent of thetime. I'm proud to do that. And I have said absolutely we need to getrelief to Americans now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Tom, they were quick to point that out today.TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER:  Yes. Perdue and Loeffler, theyare reading the tea leaves. They are going to stand with Donald Trump. Theyneed to stand with Donald Trump because they need his voters to turn outfor them on January 5th. And he's going to go down there January 4th andmake the case not only for the $2,000 but also for these two Senatecandidates. And so they were quick to jump on board with this proposalbecause obviously it's in their best interests.BAIER:  And speaking of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act,here's Senators Cornyn and Markey on this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN CORNYN, (R-TX):  We will address them, and we have an opportunityto do that. But we should not try to do that on this bill and risks theloss of this important piece of legislation now in its 60th year ofadoption.SEN ED MARKEY, (D-MA):  My Republican colleagues seem more interested infunding defense than in funding the defenseless. In this moment of nationalcrisis, we are able to afford spending three quarters of a trillion dollarson a bloated defense budget, but we can't give hungry and sufferingAmericans $2,000?(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So Steve, the politics of this are tough in Georgia, too, on theveto override.HAYES:  Yes, they sure are. I think Tom is right. It's definitely the casethat David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler don't want to be seen as contradictingthe president. They are the ones who have their political fates potentiallytied to him in just a matter of a few days.I think what you've seen from other Republicans, though, is an increasingwillingness to distance themselves from Donald Trump as it becomes clearerand clearer that he's not going to be the one who is controlling thefuture, their immediate future, their immediate political future. I thinkwe'll see some last gasps of those who are clinging to the president onJanuary 6th, the day after these special elections in Georgia. But you haveseen with the willingness of Republicans to break with the president on theoverride of the NDAA and I think on the checks that he's not in control ofthe party the way, certainly the way that he was before November 3rd.BAIER:  But I would say, Mollie, the Senate majority leader is acting likehe's at least listening to the president, whether he brings that forward tosuccess or not. What about the politics in Georgia when it comes to thepresident? He is going to Dalton where Republicans have not seen the earlyvote total they expected in that specific area.HEMINGWAY:  Yes, it is true that many Republican voters very much likePresident Trump and they were excited to vote for him. He got 74 millionvotes nationwide. And without him being on the ballot, it's very importantthat he be able to get those people who were inclined to vote for him tovote for these Republicans who are up.It's going to be a close race, though. It was already close when it wasdone in November. So I expect it to be close when it happens in a few days,when the vote happens. But those Trump voters who might not be particularlyfond of a Republican Party that seems to care about things differently thanwhat Donald Trump has brought into the party, that will be the challenge,and that's why it's so important that he go down there, and also why thoseRepublican voters see that the future of this conservative populism isthrough a Republican Senate. So if Democrats control both chambers and thepresidency, that makes it very difficult to advance this popularconservatism.BAIER:  Let's dig into that Georgia runoff in just a minute. More with thepanel on that after a quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, (D) GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  Come January 5th, thepeople of Georgia are coming to get their seats back.SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA):  Raphael Warnock in Jon Ossoff, they would be arubber-stamp for Chuck Schumer's radical agenda to reshape this countryinto something unrecognizable.JON OSSOFF, (D) GEORGIA CANDIDATE FOR SENATE:  We have better and biggerthings to discuss the David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. We have the power towrite the next chapter in American history.SEN. DAVID PERDUE, (R-GA) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  The eyes ofthe world are on us right now. We know what's at stake here. We're going tohold this line against this radical socialist agenda and make sure that theroad to socialism does not come through the state of Georgia.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  One week, Georgia will decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.We're back with the panel. There haven't been many polls down there, Tom,in Georgia, and to be honest we have been a little snake-bitten by polls,so we've been not focusing too much on polls. But that's kind of your job.Give us a sense of where this race is as we head one week away.BEVAN:  I will say Trafalgar Group just came out with polls today, in fact,showing, and they took a poll two weeks ago, and they showed that two weeksago they had David Perdue up two points, now they have Ossoff up twopoints. Two weeks ago they had Kelly Loeffler up six points. Now they haveher down one point. So a move in the Democrats direction in both of theseraces according to Trafalgar, who has been a Trump friendly pollster,Republican pollster over time. So it does look like the Democrats have abit of momentum here with just a week left.And as you mentioned, Republicans are worried they are not getting theearly vote turn out. They're going to need big turnout on Election Day, onJanuary 5th, and that's going to be Trump's job when he goes down there isto energize those voters and really get them to the polls on January 5th.BAIER:  Mollie, how big a challenge do you think that is? Obviously thepresident is focused not on January 5th as much as January 6th, where hesays there's going to be a congressional effort to overturn what he feelswas an election stolen, and he has talked a lot about that on twitter andelsewhere. What about this visit and how much time he'll spend actuallygetting people out to the polls on the Senate?HEMINGWAY:  Right. This is not his first visit to Georgia, the one comingup. He'd already been down there to gin up excitement there. And that's whyhe's the person that people need to be down there because he is the onlyperson who can make people enthusiastic about it.There are problems in Georgia, though, that I worry about with peoplehaving confidence in the election. You mentioned earlier in this show aboutStacey Abrams' sister, who is a judge, saying that the state cannot remove4,000 voters who should not be registered to vote down there. You have thecase where the Trump campaign had been suing in Fulton County, whateveryone, whether they think Trump has a good case or not, agrees is thestrongest of his cases, and a judge still has not even decided to hear thatcase.And so I think people are legitimately worried that there is a lack ofconfidence in these election systems and that getting people excited to goout and vote when they are still worried about some of that might be achallenge for people.BAIER:  Some of these Democrats, Steve, are saying, listen, there won't bethis sweeping change. There are still votes that you don't know about, likeJoe Manchin in West Virginia. Is he going to vote to go with some of themore progressive or radical programs, filibuster killing, et cetera. We'vehad him on the show. But Republicans are saying, Steve, how can you trustall of that to one guy? What about that pitch about sweeping transitionalchange if Chuck Schumer takes over in the Senate?HAYES:  Yes, I think that's the Republicans most effective argument by faris to say we need a Republican majority to keep Joe Biden from havingcontrol of Congress. You want somebody to put a brake on what Joe Biden hassaid he wants to do. I think that's a very effective case, particularly aneffective case in a place like Georgia that has been red.But I think Donald Trump does complicate that case. For the reasons thatMollie suggests, I think the president going around and floating theseconspiracy theories that the elections were stolen does seed in somevoters' minds this doubt about whether it's even worth it to show up andvote. And so I think that's a complication.If you look at the swing away from President Trump from some militaryvoters, there was a "Wall Street Journal" story today saying that they weremoving away from the president. His veto of the NDAA complicates thatmatters I think as well.BAIER:  We'll watch it. As I said, we are heading to Atlanta, startbroadcasting on Sunday. Panel, thank you very much.When we come back, the brighter side of things caught on video.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, some major milestones. We talked a lot aboutGeorgia lately. Here is a story that didn't involve politics down there. onChristmas Day, Georgia firefighter Buddy Sloan proposed to his girlfriendKristina. Fellow firefighters recorded the special moment as Kristina saidyes. I don't think the backing up of the fire truck was planned, butcongratulations for that.And it was a special moment for the five-year-old Jase Black who wasfinally able to ring the bell at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital inFlorida. After more than a year of chemotherapy there, hospital staffcheering as he rang the bell, dancing his way out of the hospital. Way togo, Jase.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIALREPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid.
