Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. What's up with IRS Comissioner John Koskinen?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS COMMISSIONER: The improper criteria used to highlight organizations for investigation just by their name was a mistake. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A mistake? That is no mistake. How could he possibly call it a mistake? The IRS conduct was intentional and deliberate and done many times. A mistake is inadvertent, incidental, a one-time deal, sort of like backing into another car in a grocery store parking lot. That's a mistake. That's not what we have here with the IRS.
What was done at the IRS was intentional and done over and over and over. That's simply not a mistake. I don't know where the commissioner gets that mistake stuff or why he feels the need to soft-pedal the conduct at the IRS. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I have more problems with Commissioner Koskinen. He admits to targeting but did you hear what he called it? The use of "inappropriate criteria" - inappropriate criteria, that's all? Sort of like using the wrong fork at the dinner, that what he thinks this is? That's sounds so PC. Why won't he call it what it is. Here's the tip for the commissioner. The use of inappropriate criteria is targeting. And it stinks that he sugarcoats it. It doesn't sound like he takes it seriously when he does that, does it?
We need someone who does take it seriously. The IRS terrifies people. And the commissioner, he needs to get that and that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
