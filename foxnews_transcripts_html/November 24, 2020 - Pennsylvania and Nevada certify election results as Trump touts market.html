He got a lot offlak. He has since said he's now going to be working on Thanksgiving.And this just in, the mayor of Los Angeles has just tweeted that officialsthere are asking everyone to cancel non-essential travel.

WithPresident Trump formally granting approval for Joe Biden to receive theclassified presidential daily briefing. This on a day, President Trump madetwo short appearances, a pardon and an announcement about the stock marketjump.Correspondent Kristin Fisher reports tonight live from the North Lawn ofthe White House. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. Yes, the first appearance from President Trump was this morning inthe Briefing Room. And then, we saw him again this afternoon for the annualturkey pardon in the Rose Garden.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (Voice over): Trump walked into the Briefing Room with littlenotice.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to congratulateeverybody. The stock market, Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 30,000which is the highest in history.FISHER: And he walked out just one minute and three seconds later, hisshortest briefing ever. The president took credit for the soaring stockmarket and the encouraging news about coronavirus vaccines.TRUMP: Nothing like that has ever happened medically. And I think peopleare acknowledging that and it's having a big effect.FISHER: But he took zero questions from reporters and not once did hemention the outcome of the election. He inched closer to acknowledging JoeBiden as the president-elect with a tweet last night telling the head ofthe GSA, the agency responsible for signing off on the transition processto "do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols". Adding thathe's told his team to do the same.The president later said he will never concede, but multiple stafferswithin the West Wing took that initial tweet as an acknowledgement of sortsthat their time in a Trump administration is winding down.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows was one of the people encouragingthe president to allow the transition to begin. Those efforts began inearnest on Saturday after the Trump campaigns lawsuit in Pennsylvania wastossed out and culminated with Michigan certification on Monday.Since then, two more contested states have also certified the results ofthe election for Joe Biden, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.Governor Tom Wolf thanked election officials who he says administered afair and free election during an incredibly challenging time in ourcommonwealth and country's history.TRUMP: That is a lucky bird.FISHER: The president again steered clear of questions during the annualturkey pardon in the Rose Garden.TRUMP: Corn and cob.FISHER: But he did take time to thank those on the frontlines of thepandemic and those fighting to keep America safe.TRUMP: To keep America great. And as I say, America first. Shouldn't goaway from that, America first.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): And in another sign that this transition is movingforward, this afternoon, the White House gave the green light forpresident-elect Joe Biden to begin receiving the presidential daily briefor the PDB that is the classified intelligence briefing that the presidentreceives each morning, Bret.BAIER: Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin, thanks.Let's go inside the Wall Street numbers tonight, big numbers. ConnellMcShane in a Fox Business Network joins us from New York. Good evening,Connell.CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, good evening, Bret. Whileit has been quite a run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average optimism aboutthree potential coronavirus vaccines helping to drive the average to thismost recent milestone.On January 15th, the Dow closed above 29,000 for the first time. It thenflirted with 30,000 the next month but with the nation being hammered bythe coronavirus in March, it fell. And it fell below 19,000.Since then, helped by low interest rates, it's been a long climb back. Andthe positive vaccine news from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca has helpedwith this most recent stage of the rally coming after the presidentialelection earlier this month.And then, when word leaked yesterday, the former Fed Chair Janet Yellenwould be president-elect Joe Biden's pick as the Treasury Secretary, morebuying.And then, when the Trump administration did clear the way for Bidentransition to officially begin last night, some investors saw that today asmore uncertainty being removed, the market climb even higher.Now, today's rally was broad based when you look at it. Oil stocks likeExxon and Chevron helped to lead the way on signs of a better economic timecoming ahead of us.Shares of the electronic vehicle maker Tesla have continued what's been anincredible run for the stock helping the founder Elon Musk passed BillGates becoming on paper, the second richest human being on planet earthbehind Jeff Bezos of Amazon.Now, there certainly are questions about whether this market rally cancontinue. Some say stocks are getting ahead of themselves. Others point totoday's report a drop in consumer confidence as a sign of trouble on thehorizon.But for now, it's a focus on the positive, we have the Dow closing above30,000 for the first time ever, Bret.BAIER: Good stuff. Connell, thank you.We're getting our first look tonight at some of the just announcedperspective members of the incoming Biden administration and talk of therapid retreat from policies of the current administration is alreadybeginning. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from Wilmington,Delaware.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over): President-electJoe Biden's foreign policy plan, send experienced civil servants out topatch things up with other countries.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is back, readyto lead the world, not retreat from it.DOOCY: No America First, which has been President Trump's foreign policystrategy is no problem for the nominee to be Secretary of State TonyBlinken.ANTONY BLINKEN, FORMER GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, CNN: We need to be workingwith other countries. We need their cooperation.DOOCY: Especially, addressing climate change.JOHN KERRY, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL CLIMATE ENVOY: To end this crisis, thewhole world must come together.DOOCY: Kerry will be the face of the Biden administration's $2 trillionclimate plan.BIDEN: He will be -- there will be a principal on the National SecurityCouncil who can make sure climate change is on the agenda in the SituationRoom.DOOCY: Another seat in the Situation Room goes to National Security AdviserJake Sullivan.BIDEN: He'll lead the early negotiations that led to the Iran nuclear deal.DOOCY: National security will be reimagined by order of the president-electand will now cover terror threats plus --JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER-DESIGNATE: The pandemic, theeconomic crisis, the climate crisis, technological disruption, threats todemocracy, racial injustice and inequality.DOOCY: The nominee to run DHS Alejandro Mayorkas is being asked to dothings differently too.BIDEN: It's a job that plays a critical role in fixing our brokenimmigration system.DOOCY: Biden is also breaking with Trump and picking insiders, notoutsiders for jobs like Avril Haines nominated as Director of NationalIntelligence.BIDEN: I didn't pick a politician or a political figure. I picked aprofessional.DOOCY: America has long been a melting pot and now on the world stage, thenominee for U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will make sure there'salso a pot of gumbo.LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N. NOMINEE: In my 35 years inthe Foreign Service across four continents, I put a Cajun spin on it. Icalled it Gumbo diplomacy. Wherever I was posted around the world, I'dinvite people of different backgrounds and beliefs to help me make a rouxand chop onions for the Holy Trinity and make homemade gumbo.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): Biden transition officials are telling us tonight theyhave spoken to counterparts at every federal agency on this, the first daythey were allowed to. The president-elect to saying staffers have spokennow to Dr. Anthony Fauci but he hasn't had time to phone Fauci. And that hewould sit down with President Trump if the president asked, Bret.BAIER: Thanks, Peter. Let's talk about the transition and foreign policyspecifically Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins us again tonight. Mr.Secretary, thanks for coming back to SPECIAL REPORT.MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Great to be back with you,Bret. Thank you.BAIER: You've just returned from a trip to many places overseas. But thething that got the most attention was a meeting that was believed to havehappened. Did Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu meet with the Saudi CrownPrince on your visit to the region?POMPEO: Bret, I had (AUDIO GAP) the Crown Prince there. I had a meetingwith the Crown Prince in the Emirates. And I don't want to expand anyfurther on that. But importantly, what I was continuing to work on iscreating space for the American people, security for the American peopleand reducing risk in the Middle East.And what I took away from the gatherings is that while there is more workto do, I think each of them has come to understand that the work that we'vedone with the Abraham Accords, the work that we've done to isolate theregime in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been good for their people, beengood for the Middle East. I know it's been good for the security of peopleright here back at home.BAIER: Well, the report, Mr. Secretary was that the Prime Minister BibiNetanyahu and the head of Mossad flew to Neom Saudi Arabia to meet withMBS, the Crown Prince. So, did that happen or not?POMPEO: Well, look, I've seen the reporting, I was with each of those to uswith the Prime Minister in Jerusalem, I was with the head of Mossad inJerusalem as well. We had productive discussions. I know, I'll leave it tothem to discuss the meetings that they may have had or may not have had.BAIER: Do you expect more normalization announcements from other countrieslike Saudi Arabia with Israel before the end of the president's term?POMPEO: You know, I do. I expect more normalization (INAUDIBLE). Whetherthey'll come in the next 30 days or 60 days or six months is difficult toknow. But the direction of travels are very clear and the rationale forthat has a little bit to do with American policy. We got it right. We tookaway the excuse of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Wetook away the excuse that the United States was going to appease Iran.And so, we took that away, and in the end, it was a good sovereign decisionby those leaders. Those countries are more safe, more security, they'll bemore prosperous. I saw Emirati businessmen in Israel. I saw Israelibusinessmen in the Emirates. Good things are happening with those twocountries are coming closer and closer together. And everybody who joinedthe Abraham Accords will see the benefits for their own people.So, I am highly confident that many, many more nations will ultimatelychoose to do the right thing and recognize Israel as the rightful homelandof the Jewish people.BAIER: When you -- when you speak about Iran, you've talked about themaximum pressure campaign and how it has been effective in your words. Whatdo you say to the critics who say that Iran is closer to a nuclear weaponnow as you get ready for this transition with another team that may look atthe situation completely different than you?POMPEO: Well, they're just wrong factually about that. First, I came intoan administration, as did President Trump, where we were funneling tens ofbillions of dollars into that country, creating wealth and prosperity thatthe real tools of creating a nuclear weapon, our capacity, smart people,money. Those are the things that help you build out a nuclear weaponsprogram.The previous administration had chosen them to give them an awful lot ofthat thing, money. We've chosen to deny them.I think the Iranians had now tens and tens of billions of dollars in wealthhas been denied them as a result of the isolation which we have created.We've saved lots of lives, lots of American lives. We have to have fewersoldiers in the Middle East today because of the actions we've taken.I'm confident that that's the right policy. Appeasing terrorists, appeasingthose who have hegemonic desires, appeasing those who are underwritingmilitias all throughout the region. Destabilizing Middle East cannotpossibly be the right course of action. That will put them on the pathwayto a nuclear weapon and we should never give Iran that chance.BAIER: Have you spoken to Tony Blinken since Joe Biden has said that hewants Blinken to be his secretary of state?POMPEO: I have not. Today, we began the process to see what GSA's decisionwas, and we'll do everything that's required by law. We'll, we'll, we'llmake -- we'll make this work.BAIER: I want you to listen to the person that the President-elect JoeBiden has selected to be the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,obviously nominated to that, speaking about foreign policy andmultilateralism. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, NOMINEE, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO UNITEDNATIONS: And on this day, I'm thinking about the American people. My fellowcareer diplomats and public servants around the world, I want to say toyou, America is back, multilateralism is back, diplomacy is back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the nominee to be the U.S. ambassador tothe U.N. Your response to that statement.POMPEO: Where to begin, Bret? I remember what the previous administrationdid. They described leadership as leading from behind, President Trumpnever did that. We built our real coalitions. A coalition that crushed thecaliphate in Syria, a coalition that's pushed back against the Chinesecommunist party, a coalition that refused to appease Iran. The list of workthat we've done is great.What we -- what we said all along, Bret, and this is where I think -- Ithink I take a different path, I couldn't tell exactly from her statement.But multilateralism for the sake of hanging out with your buddies at a coolcocktail party, that's not in the best interest of the United States ofAmerica.We work with nations when we have common interests and we developcoalitions that actually deliver real results and reflect the reality onthe ground. That wasn't what was happening when we came in here to thestate department. We built that enormous teams, I'm proud of the work thestate department's done. We're going to continue to do that. It's ourresponsibility.So, long as we have these offices, it's our duty to continue to deliver onAmerican security, and we've done it well, and we'll continue to do so.BAIER: The defense secretary you worked alongside wrote an opinioneditorial or in part wrote it, former secretary James Mattis, saying this."In practice, America First has meant America alone. That has damaged thecountry's ability to address problems before they reach U.S. territory andhas thus compounded the danger emergent threats pose."That's Jim Mattis. Your thoughts.POMPEO: I have a lot of respect for Jim, but he's just dead wrong on that.America First has been at its heart, a recognition that when America issecure at home, when America does good things for our own economy, for ourown prosperity, that America will be a force for good all around theregion, and that indeed we can't deliver security -- increased securityaround the world when America is not secure.I take great umbrage of the fact it's been America alone. I would tell youthat our Japanese colleagues, our South Korean colleagues, our Indiancolleagues, our Australian colleagues all know that the pivot to Asia was ajoke, but that the United States under President Trump actually deliveredreal benefits to them.And whether it was the work that we've done to build out an enormouscoalition to go after the socialist Maduro, to go after the Cubans, theseare real coalitions. Real things that work it was in America alone, it wasus doing it with our friends and allies based on shared interest and areality that recognized central facts about what is and not pretending thatthings are as we would like them to be.BAIER: What's your greatest concerned with what the next administrationcould do when it comes to foreign policy?POMPEO: You know, Bret, I don't want to speculate. I know some of thesefolks that they took a very different view, they lived in a bit of afantasy world, they left from behind, they appeased. I hope they'll choosea different course.You know, here we are in 2020, it's different than 2015. I hope they'll seethe things that we have done, and how this is delivered. Greater peace inthe Middle East. How it's reduced risk from North Korea, where we took downwhat was a very tense situation when we came up into office.Whether it's the central recognition of the Chinese communist party as atrue threat to jobs all across America. If they'll keep those things atcenter point, center mass, I think America's trajectory will continue to beone that is safer, more prosperous, and more secure. The freedoms that wehave secured for the American people in these four years are something Ihope will continue.BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time.POMPEO: Thank you, sir.BAIER: There's a lot of people with questions when it comes to foreignpolicy, and you're the guy who has the answers. We -- thanks for coming.POMPEO: Bret, thank you very much. Have a happy Thanksgiving, Bret.BAIER: You too.There's a second part to this interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, itwill air Thanksgiving night. We'll talk about Afghanistan, his mostmemorable moment in the job, and what his future may hold.Up next, if you watch a lot of cable news, the Biden administration maylook very familiar. We'll tell you why.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Purdue Pharma is pleading guilty to three criminal charges formallyadmitting its role in an opioid epidemic that has contributed to hundredsof thousands of deaths over the past two decades.The maker of OxyContin admits impeding the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration's efforts to combat the addiction crisis. Purdue has alsoagreed to a settlement with more than $8 billion in penalties andforfeitures. But an actual -- its actual direct payment to the federalgovernment is $225 million.The Biden administration is going to look very familiar to connoisseurs ofvarious cable news stations. Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's"MEDIA BUZZ", Howard Kurtz, has that story tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I'm pleased to announce nominations and staff --HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDIA ANALYST (voice over): As Joe Bidenstarts to staff his administration, the revolving door between media andpolitics is spinning once again. As a CNN global affairs analyst TonyBlinken, who've been deputy secretary of state under President Obama, oftenchastised Obama's successor.BLINKEN: President Trump is abdicated that responsibility; he's put us infull retreat from our allies and partners.KURTZ: And today, Biden formally announced Blinken as his pick forsecretary of state.BLINKEN: Thank you.KURTZ: CNN contributor Jen Psaki who was Obama's state departmentspokeswoman has also left for the transition.MSNBC analyst Rick Stengel, a former Time Magazine editor is on his secondgo-round, having jumped from Obama's state department to fierce Trumpcritic.RICK STENGEL, He's the epicenter of disinformation around the world.KURTZ: And now, Stengel has joined the Biden transition team.Barbara McQuade, a U.S. attorney in the Obama years has also left MSNBC forthe Biden transition. Sometimes, the connections are less visible, as withJon Meacham, the former Newsweek editor and presidential biographer was anNBC and MSNBC contributor who praised Biden's victory speech.JON MEACHAM, CONTRIBUTOR, MSNBC: This is a moment where the life of thenation is intersecting in a fascinating way with the personal life, notonly of President-elect Biden but also the vice president-elect.KURTZ: But the networks dropped him from the payroll after the New YorkTimes revealed, Meacham had privately helped Biden with that and otherspeeches.At least two dozen journalists joined the Obama team, including Times' J.Carney and ABC's Linda Douglass. That musical chairs tradition is widelyviewed as routine, but Fox News drew criticism for those who moved betweenthe network and the Trump administration, including John Bolton, HeatherNauert, Bill Shine, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Larry Kudlow also joinedthe president from CNBC.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera): When political players turn into a pundits, they canbring an insider's perspective. But more of them seem to move between themedia where they can resemble a government in exile and Democraticadministrations such as the one now taking shape. Bret?BAIER: Howie, thanks.Up next, government pleas for you and your neighbors to stay home thisThanksgiving are not stopping. Huge numbers of people from traveling allacross the country. We will go live to one of the busiest airports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need this. I need this. And my family and friends needthis too.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we can't -- we can't just stop living. So, Ithink it's really important that everyone just takes the precautions.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  As we told with the top of the program, millions of Americans areignoring the government's pleas to skip holiday travels this week becauseof the coronavirus. That means airports are busier than they have beensince the start of the pandemic. Correspondent Casey Stegall takes a looktonight from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in Texas.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On the eve of what's considered tobe the busiest travel day of the year, infectious disease experts areconcerned about the number of Americans who are still moving forward withtheir holiday plans and ignoring public-health guidance.DR. MICHAEL HOFFMAN, COOK COUNTY HEALTH:  Please make no mistake thatpeople will die because of Thanksgiving gatherings.STEGALL:  The CDC advised people not only to cancel their travel plans, butalso avoid gathering with people outside their own households to decreasethe risk for exposure. Yet AAA says some 2.4 million people still plan tofly.We are heading home for Thanksgiving. We are going to go hang out with herfamily. It's going to be really fun.I'm not letting this hamper my lifestyle and life. Family and friends arereally important to me at this time of the year.STEGALL:  Almost 95 percent of all holiday travelers are expected to driveto their destinations, with AAA projecting nearly 48 million people hittingthe road. Overall, travel numbers are anticipated to be down about 10percent compared to last Thanksgiving. Millions of other Americans areheeding the warnings and staying put.It's just not worth the risk right now with the amount of people that haveit across the country at this moment.We miss not being able to see the grandchildren. All of them together.STEGALL:  And doctors insist if more people followed the guidelines, itwill pay off in the long run.HOFFMAN:  I know that this is a lot to ask, but a virtual, safeThanksgiving will potentially prevent an ICU Christmas.(END VIDEO TAPE)STEGALL (on camera):  And live here at DFW International Airport tonight,the nation's fourth busiest when it comes to overall passenger traffic,officials are predicting that the Thanksgiving volume will be down about 35percent here than it was in 2019. Bret?BAIER:  Casey, thank you.In tonight's "Focus on Faith," the pushback from organized religion againstcoronavirus restrictions. Many worshipers of different denominations arecoming together to try to fight the government in court. Religioncorrespondent Lauren Green shows us tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)LAUREN GREEN, FOX NEWS RELIGION CORRESPONDENT:  On Monday, two Californiachurches sought an emergency injunction with the U.S. Supreme Court to haltthe state's threat of criminal penalties.MAT STAVER, LIBERTY COUNSEL CHAIRMAN:  No one should have criminal threatsup to a year in prison hanging over their head simply for attending a placeof worship.GREEN:  California has some of the strictest policies rove leveled againstchurches and gatherings imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus.The church's claim that Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order, whichthreatens jail time and $1,000 a day fine, violates the Constitution'sfreedom of religion.STAVER:  You need to look at those liberties and determine how you can bestprotect the people, but the balance doesn't tip to protecting people andthrowing out the Constitution. That is the sign of tyranny.GREEN:  California is one of 25 states where houses of worship have takenlegal actions over restrictions on gatherings. Lawyers collectively sayit's a sign that America's bedrock principle of religious freedom is beingseverely tested by the pandemic. The bishop of the Catholic Diocese ofBrooklyn, which also filed a case with the Supreme Court against GovernorAndrew Cuomo, says politicians must reclassify faith as fundamental.BISHOP NICHOLAS DIMARZO, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN:  You have to recognizereligion, I think, is essentially to society just as the food stores are.They take care of the body. We take care of the soul.GREEN:  But some religious groups have hurt their cause. As this videoobtained by "The New York Post" shows, in Brooklyn, hundreds packed asynagogue to celebrate Hasidic wedding, dancing and singing, and no masks.MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) NEW YORK CITY:  There was a very conscious effortto conceal what was going on, and that's what makes it even moreunacceptable.(END VIDEO TAPE)GREEN (on camera):  The cases may go to the full court, leaving justices todecide if the benefits of protections against the pandemic outweigh thecost of possibly weakening the Constitution. Bret?BAIER:  Lauren, thank you.Up next, the simmering conflict in Georgia between the president'ssupporters and the senators trying to keep their jobs. We'll bring youthere.First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Q13 FOX in Seattle as the Seattle city council votes tocut the police budget there by 18 percent. Many activists had wanted a 50percent decrease. Several councilmembers had agreed to that, then renegedon that promise.And this is a live look at Salt Lake City from FOX 13, our affiliate there.One of the big stories there tonight, the discovery of a mysteriousmonolith in southeastern Utah. Its drawing comparisons to the structures inthe movie "2001, A Space Odyssey." It was found by state wildlife employeescounting sheep from a helicopter.That's tonight's live look outside the beltway, an interesting one, fromSPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Investigators believe California may have paid nearly $1 billion infraudulent pandemic-related unemployment claims to inmates and cybercriminals using their stolen information. Death row inmate Scott Peterson'sname was one of more than 35,000 inmate names used to file for unemploymentbenefits. Investigators say more than 20,000 of those bogus claims werepaid.The two senators from Georgia trying to hang onto their seats and preservethe GOP's majority in the Senate chamber are in a tough spot tonight.They're getting hammered from some in their own party over PresidentTrump's election challenge. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports tonightfrom Atlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a bus tour across Georgia withIowa Senator Joni Ernst, David Perdue makes the case for a Republicanfirewall against the radical left. But he and fellow Georgia Senator KellyLoeffler face discontent within their own party, from Trump supporters whobelieve the president's still unproven allegations of widespread voterfraud.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you doing to help Donald Trump in this fraud case?SEN. DAVID PERDUE, (R-GA):  I'm going to tell you that in a minute. I'll beglad to help you with that. I'll tell you that in a second. We called forthe resignation of our secretary of state is what we did. We are callingfor lawsuits. We're doing a lot.(APPLAUSE)SERRIE:  But some of the president's supporters want Georgia's Republicanleaders to do more to challenge the results. As Georgia today begins astatewide machine recount at the request of the Trump campaign, DemocraticSenate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are criticizing GOPleaders for pandering to conspiracy theories about the election.JON OSSOFF, (D) GEORGIA CANDIDATE FOR SENATE:  I'm not sure about theimpact on turnout, but the disruption of an orderly transfer of power tothe new administration has already done damage to the response to thispandemic and the response to the economic crisis.SERRIE:  Stacey Abrams and other influential Georgia Democrats are tweetinglinks to the state's official absentee ballot request form.(END VIDEO TAPE)SERRIE (on camera):  Elections officials say more than 760,000 Georgianshave already requested absentee ballots. That's more than three times thenumber requested during the 2018 election. Bret?BAIER:  Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thanks.Up next, the panel on President Trump's transition decision, and the newmembers of the Biden administration, or prospective one, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  We're already working out my abilityto get presidential daily briefs. We're already working out meeting withthe COVID team in the White House and how to not only distribute, but getfrom a vaccine being distributed to a person being able to get vaccinated.So I think we're going to not be so far behind the curve as we thought wemight be in the past. And there's a lot of immediate discussion. And I mustsay, the outreach has been sincere. It's not been begrudging so far.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Joe Biden earlier tonight on NBC talking about the transition andwhat is happening right now. The Dow is liking what's happening right now,the markets closing above 30,000 for the first time ever. There you take alook at the year to date, starting there above 29,000 January 15th, andthen closing again after that dip for the coronavirus. Success on thevaccine front, a lot of positive news on therapeutics, vaccines, how thelogistics is working. And obviously, the Biden folks will tell you it'sabout the transition moving forward.Let's bring in our panel, Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary, host of"The Bill Bennett Show" podcast, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at"USA Today," and "Washington Post" columnist Marc Thiessen. Marc, whatabout where we are now as we are still seeing these legal challenges by thepresident, although they seem to be diminishing, at least now, in a numberof these states as they officially certify. But the positive news on thevaccine front is palpable.MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  The positive news on thevaccine front is palpable, and the positive news that the Trump-Bidentransition is finally getting underway, and by the way, getting underwayfaster than the Clinton and Bush transition did. We're ahead of schedule.So all of these people setting their hair on fire that the transitionwasn't happening, it's happening at a good pace.The problem is that the president is focused on the wrong thing right now.His chances of overturning the last election are next to zero, if not zeroitself. And so he has a path to a second term, but it's in 2024. And thepath to a second term flows through Georgia and winning the Georgia Senaterace.And right now it's not just the opportunity costs, the fact that he isspending his time and energy on these legal challenges that have no chanceof succeeding, but there are -- it's because -- it's also the fact thathe's -- the Trump supporters are not -- are not -- are not energized behindhis candidates. You just showed this clip of a Trump supporter yelling atPerdue, saying what are you doing to help Trump? This whole legal thing iscreating a distraction that's going to depress Republican turnout, and itcould cost Republicans control of the Senate, and that would be an absolutedisaster.BAIER:  So speaking of that, Bill, Sidney Powell, who we thought was partof the Trump legal team, is not, doing her own filings. But one of them isgoing to be a filing in Georgia. She just talked to Lou Dobbs about thatearlier tonight. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SIDNEY POWELL, TRUMP ATTORNEY:  I think no later than tomorrow, it's justgoing to be -- it's a massive document, and it's going to have a lot ofexhibits. And the defendants are going to be folks in Georgia who areresponsible for supposedly making sure the elections in Georgia are doneproperly. And there are just countless incidents of voter fraud andelection fraud writ large in Georgia.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Now, we have not seen this filing, we have not seen all theaffidavits that are supposedly going to be filed in Georgia tomorrow. Theproblem, Bill, as Marc mentions, is that does that create a wrench in thesystem ahead of the January 5th runoff trying to hold control of the U.S.Senate?BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Well, we'll see. I understandMarc's point about the importance of Georgia and not getting in the way ofthe Georgia election. Nevertheless, you're not going to win my Georgiawithout the huge support of huge Trump supporters. And so this has to bedone carefully.Look, I don't want to be a dead ender here, one of those Japanese soldiersin the cave, but I think this election was stolen. I will not keep sayingit, but I will keep believing it. And it has to do a lot with theseabsentee ballots. There's too many statistical improbabilities, too manyanomalies, too many bellwether states that predict and didn't predict here.But the issue is very similar in Georgia. You heard earlier in your report,you announced that the fact that there's going to be so many mail-inballots in Georgia. I hope Republicans, who maybe didn't get on this forthe general, will get on this in Georgia, else we may face the sameproblem.But otherwise, the president will cooperate with this transition. But wehave to get on this thing and fix it, because there was something that wentwrong. By the way, if I'm a dead end are, half the country believes thatthis election was illegitimate. About 75 percent of Republicans and about10 to 20 percent of Democrats. There's something wrong here, still is.BAIER:  Yes, Bill, but I guess when the pushback to that is why aren't anyof these legal cases getting through? Why isn't there one judge someplacethat says I see what you mean, let's turn over this election, let's changethe tens of thousands of voters in this state. Why hasn't one judge donethat yet?BENNETT:  Right, no judge has done it yet, and a judge has to do it yet.That's for sure. A judge has to do it. I don't know about -- I don't knowabout Sidney Powell. I know Lin Wood in Georgia is a formidable guy, verysmart guy, very successful guy, represented that kid from CovingtonCatholic. And we shall see. But look, we shall see soon. There's no reasonfor us to close this thing off immediately.BAIER:  Agreed.BENNETT:  And again -- OK. I will leave it there.BAIER:  Agreed, and the legal challenges are going to continue, and we willfollow each one.Susan, meantime, the Biden transition is moving a pace, the nationalsecurity team kind of outlined today. Thoughts on the choices so far,coming really from career, for the most part, career folks, minus JohnKerry, who obviously has a political past?SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, "USA TODAY":  It would be hard to finda starker contrast with the Trump team than the team that President-electBiden has unveiled. With Trump you felt that the outsider status was anadvantage. This is clearly a group that is deeply experienced. Many of themhave experience with Biden himself back to the Senate or during his days asvice president in the Obama White House. It's a really senior group. Theyknow each other. They're generally known as pretty collaborative people,and they are, I think, ready to get a very quick start, and that'simportant to the Biden folks, because you are about to see a wholesalechange in the fundamentals of our foreign policy, as you heard Mike Pompeoprotest in your interview with him.BAIER:  Yes. Marc, quickly, the Pompeo interview with the change potentialin foreign policy?THIESSEN:  One of the things that's interesting is this new Biden team isreally the old Obama team. And that's the Obama that failed to deliverArab-Israeli peace deals that the Trump administration did. If they revertback to the 2016 way of thinking on the Middle East, that peace goesthrough Ramallah, that you can't -- detente with Iran is the key to peacerather than an obstacle to peace with Arab-Israeli peace, then they aregoing to fail, and all this progress we are having will stop.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much, we appreciate it, a littleshorter because of the interview.When we come back, helping those in need this time of year.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, the season of giving. Police officers in Brooklyntook a break from fighting crime to hand out free turkeys ahead ofThanksgiving. NYPD officers placing the turkeys in bags before passing themout to residents.In Las Vegas, police piled cardboard boxes carrying more than 2,600 turkeysinto vans and pickup trucks to be distributed to families, shelters, andchurches in need of help.And in Orlando, the Orange County sheriff's office doled out someThanksgiving chair, handing out 400 free Thanksgiving dinners to those inneed this holiday season.We'll see more of that over the coming days, and that's a good thing.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIALREPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid.
