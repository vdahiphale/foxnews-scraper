Time Magazine named Donald Trump Person of the Year. How nice, they see him as a person. Usually, he's just a stick of butter. I wonder if Mr. Trump sees it as a great honor?

PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: It's a great honor. It means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time Magazine. And it's a very important. I've been lucky enough to be on the cover many times this year and last year. But I consider this a very, very great honor. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {

Not so fast, Donald. Here is the article's opening graph -- quote -- "We have named the person who had the greatest influence for better or worse." So which is it this year, better or worse? Nice setup. Why not paint an eye patch on him? Compare that to this on People. Look at that.
 Or this, remember that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I get it: Trump's nobody's nice guy. But what pick would they prefer? Sorry. Donald Trump won. Here's why: He became president not just against all odds but by uprooting tradition. He is a historical first, exploiting social media, a bare-knuckle comic in an entertainment bubble. He did something many dreamt of trying: Slaying the beast called political correctness. He jammed the left-wing weaponry. Charges of racism, intolerance, sexism, hate: they stopped working. Trump said to his accusers, so what? Come and get me. And when they did, he had millions of Americans behind him. Trump attracted so many people who were victims of PC malice or just sick of hearing about it.
2016 saw more than the birth of a rare politician, but the death of identity politics. The pendulum swing from phobias over pronounces to jobs, migration policies and Mr. Obama's unspeakable fear: radical Islam. It was about turning outward instead of inward, country not campus. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Maybe others could have done it, but Donald Trump did. Yeah, he said some crazy stuff. But that's the risk we're willing to take in 2016. In the next four years, we will find out if it's worth it.  </pre>
