     Video  Grapevine: Supreme Court justice a victim of identity theft? 
Chief Justice John Roberts pays in cash 
Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Inflammatory Remarks
Fellow lawmakers are rebuking Republican Congressman Don Young for using a racial slur. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Alaska representative was talking about migrant workers on KRBD radio when he said this: "My father had a ranch -- we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes.... It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The offending word is a derogatory term referring to immigrants, typically from Mexico. Young apologized, saying he meant no disrespect and that the word was commonly used when he was growing up, but he understands it has a different connotation now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Speaker John Boehner called Young's comments offensive and said there was no excuse for using such language.
It Could Happen to You 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Anyone can fall victim to identity theft even a Supreme Court justice. It appears Chief Justice John Roberts had his credit card numbers stolen. He has reportedly been paying in cash for purchases all over the Washington region this week.
The Washington Post says he told a clerk at Starbucks that falling victim to credit card theft was the reason why. Huffington Post reports he told someone at a barber shop the same thing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Wrong Number 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
An abuse victim who called a helpline number provided by the Lake County Florida Sheriff's office this week got quite a surprise: "Welcome to America's hottest talk line. Ladies, to talk to interesting and exciting guys free, press 1 now."
That's right -- the number is a phone sex line not an abuse hotline.
An Orlando TV station reports the number was printed on a pamphlet given out to thousands of people over the past few years. It is unclear exactly how the mix-up happened. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Party's Over
Finally, from party hats to the paddy wagon -- an office manager for a Florida realtor threw her boss a party that ultimately led to her own arrest.
She planned a surprise party and paid for it with company money without getting permission first. That made her boss suspicious and investigators uncovered that she had embezzled more than $180,000 from the company during the decade she worked there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Police say she used the money to pay off her credit card debt and treat herself to bonus paychecks.  </pre>
