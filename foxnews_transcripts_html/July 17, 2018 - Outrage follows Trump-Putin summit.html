GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Charlie Hurt, that's true, Marie Harf, Jesse Watters, and she can log roll on a crayon, Dana Perino -- "The Five."

JILL WINE-BANKS, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: It's just as serious to me as the Cuban missile crisis in terms of an attack or the 9/11 attack. I would say that his performance today will live in infamy as much as the Pearl Harbor attack or Kristallnacht.

PHILIP Mudd, CNN ANALYST: Curious point in American government. When do we see almost a shadow government come out and say we cannot side with the government, whether it's the Cabinet or the Senate?

GUTFELD: Amazing. CNN is literally seeing shadows now. I think there's medication for that.
Now, Trump addressed the controversy today and we're going to get to that, but if he's a Russian plant, he's the worst one ever. I mean, what kind of plant would try to force Germany to cancel its Russian oil contracts? Oil being Russia's only major export besides spies.

What kind of plant boosts our military by billions which allows us to do whatever the hell we want until forever?
I say an awesome plant.
Seriously, you've got to be nuts if you think he's the Manchurian candidate. John Brennan does and he voted for a commie at the height of the Cold War. I guess he's the expert. Maybe Trump should have talked tough but sent a few billion dollars to Moscow on pallots instead.

So Donald lost the crazy pants vote, so what? The world is Donkey Kong and we're always stuck at the same level, especially with Russia. But perhaps, like North Korea, this could be different. Putin is a thug, but you can still chat with a thug while racking up points in his own backyard. Trump played nice, may be too nice, despite the media screeching for a cat fight, but I say smile at Putin's faced then screw him if you must everywhere else.
Maybe Trump should have skipped the presser altogether. But ask yourself this, if your TV was off and you're never heard about this story, would you have noticed anything different in your life? Just that it was gradually getting better: jobs, the economy, taxes, terror. Trump is winning on a lot of things. But even if you're winning, you can always do better.
All right, let's go to the news, by the way, a meaningful monologue.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Support for America's great intelligence agencies, always has. And I have felt very strongly that while Russia's actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying that, and I've said this many times, I accept our intelligence communities conclusion that Russians meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also. And a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word would instead of wouldn't. The sentence should have been I don't see any reason why I wouldn't or why it wouldn't be Russia.

GUTFELD: All right. So, Dana, I reminded myself, I have three elder sisters when I was forced to apologize to my sisters. 
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Did your mom write it for you?

GUTFELD: Yes. Yes, exactly. I'm still a little confused by the clarification. Like -- is this a genius.

        }
      
PERINO: It's one of those clarifications that if you said would or would not, you'd want to clarify it within 24 minutes.
GUTFELD: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
PERINO: . why not 24 hours. I do respect that he understood that he had to clarify. He decided to do that. He read from a written statement, didn't take questions, so there was nothing off script except for the added, but there could have been other people also, which basically negated most of what he's saying. But, I think one of the most important things he did is he recognized he had a problem with the intelligence community, and it's critical for any commander-in-chief to have a good relationship with them because you have to rely on them because your responsibility is to protect the American people and you can't do that if you don't have intel and a good relationship with them. So I think that's what he's trying to do. Words do matter. They have consequences. Being nice is fine. But I also think that, in this case, to your point about the deeds, you know, he does the right thing and says the wrong thing. 
GUTFELD: Right.

PERINO: It is better than to then say all the right things but to do the wrong things, but you could have both.

GUTFELD: Or my theory falls flat. Jesse, what did you think of the clarification? 
WATTERS: It's a gaffe if you believe the explanation that he misspoke, which is historic. He's never admitted he's made a mistake or misspoke ever. So I think this is pretty significant. But if you don't believe it and you believe he really meant to say it, then you think it's just kind of a sloppy, a little slick cleanup. Maybe he could have cleaned it up like I suggested on Tucker or Hannity, he had to wait a little longer but he definitely look upset. I just want to talk about the montage and the monologue for a little bit.

        }
      
WATTERS: There's always a constant in Washington. Republicans will always under deliver and Democrats will always overreach, because this is what they did here. He makes a gaffe at a summit and now the left is calling for a coup. We've heard this before, though. Remember we've seen the access Hollywood tape, Charlottesville, firing James Comey, the Con family controversy, separating kids, and Stormy Daniels. All of these things they've all said it's the holocaust. It's another 9/11. It's a constitutional crisis, impeachment, internment camps. But I think the country is tuning this up. We've become numb to this type of hyperbole because the Democrats always overreach. Now they want to abolish ICE. Now they're chasing people out of restaurants, and they're fantasizing about assassinations. It always ends up coming back, boomeranging them and hurting them politically, and I think this is going to be the same thing.
GUTFELD: Marie, do you think it's true that part of the problem it's the boy who cried wolf, but it's the boy who cried collusion, the boy who cried impeachment, so when it happens -- you know, it's just like, not this again because I know next week, there's going to be something that makes this look small, right?

        }
      
HARF: I don't even want to try to guess. I do think the Democrats need to be careful not to cry a crisis over everything because what we saw yesterday was genuinely appalling. And when you are asked, do I side with the intelligence community or Putin? That is not a hard answer. That doesn't require clarification. There is one answer and the president didn't give it. And my question continues to be why not? Why will the president not say that Russia did it, unequivocally? He didn't even do that today. Does he not believe it? And there's a whole host of reasons we can look at. It ends with collusion but there's a bunch of things before that, right? Is it ego? Is it he's afraid that he will look like an illegitimate president? But the bottom line is, Dan Coats, the head of national intelligence, last week said publicly, the warning signs about Russian interference today in our upcoming election is like the blinking red lights we saw before 9/11.

HARF: Donald Trump is president today, and his intelligence chief said this is like what we saw before 9/11 in terms of the threat. Donald Trump, by not standing up to Russia yesterday or today, is not countering that threat and that should be a problem for all Americans. 
GUTFELD: See, I would disagree with Coats on this, mainly because the difference between radical Islam and threats like Russia is existential. Radical Islam wants to destroy the world. Russia is just another power. 
HARF: Well, they're trying to undermine our democracy which is just as bad.

But it's not killing thousands of innocent women and children, you know, every year. Clearly, the president made a mistake yesterday in his -- in that performance, but it was just a performance. The mistake he made was he conflated the whole business about the hacking into the DNC servers and this business about collusion, and that -- when you're President of the United States, you cannot do that, especially if you're standing next to a thug like Vladimir Putin.

But, I get a little bit, kind of, you know, sort of hesitant about all of this incredible outrage about all of it because, of course, that's exactly what the press does every day and they have done for the past two years, conflate Russian meddling with collusion. They say, oh, we have proof of Russian meddling, therefore you colluded. And he -- he's a defensive guy. He's always going to punch back. And he's just defensive. But he's a bigger guy than that. He needs to ignore that stuff. People don't listen to the lunatics we're talking about collusion now. He doesn't need to answer that question. Just say that Russia meddle with our elections, knock it off, whatever, and then move on. 
GUTFELD: Yeah. I think we have time. I want to play this other sound of Donald Trump talking about the relationship with Russia that he was hoping to have.

TRUMP: The matters we've discussed are profound in their importance and have the potential to save millions of lives. I understand the many disagreements between our countries, but I also understand the dialogue and the -- when you think about, dialogue with Russia or dialogue with other countries, but dialogue with Russia in this case where we've had such poor relationships for so many years, dialogue is a very important thing and it's very good thing. So, if we get along with them, great. If we don't get along with them, then we won't get along with them. But I think we have a very good chance of having some very positive things.

FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. In the west, you've got far right parties that often times are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders were there caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more.

PERINO: Probably all the stadium could hold. 
WATTERS: Around the block, people. They couldn't let them in. It was a fire hazard. What do you think of this, especially the racial angle that he unveiled there? 
PERINO: Well, you know, I love Africa. I have a strong passion for helping people there. My husband and I spent time in South Africa where he is there. The sad truth is that, right now, South Africa is one of the most dangerous places that you can be. The law and order problems are immense. Tourism is down. And you actually have problems all throughout Africa from a governance standpoint. And so, that, I think, is some place where somebody like President Obama could actually really help. Shots against what's happening here, OK, fine. I sort of get it. But, President Trump is the president now. You can have your opinion about it. But if you really want to help, and Africa needs help, like some guidance and mentorship from a Barack Obama to leaders that are there now would be very helpful. 
WATTERS: He was probably getting a lot of pressure from some of his friends and former colleagues, you know, speak out, speak in. You've got to speak out. 
GUTFELD: Is it -- you just made me think, there is a racist leader in South Africa right now who is vowing to kill white people. I don't know if you could Google it. I don't know the person's name. But that's happening right now. Maybe he brought that up during that speech and condemned that person and I didn't hear it because I only get the stuff that the producers gives me. But I will tell you this, the one thing that I thought was spurious, a word I don't use lightly, his comment about free speech. That's absurd. The press has never, never been more vocal -- on Donald Trump. He's the best thing to happen to the press since the printing press, seriously. And when you compare that to the media under Obama, and I've said it before, the media was as compliant as a drugged patient. I mean -- and he didn't seem to mind. He didn't seem to mind, except he got very petty about certain journalists enough to investigate them. So, I mean, the fact is, he had every network but one and still that wasn't enough. 
WATTERS: Not 99.9 percent, not enough. But I know you probably think Barack Obama is right.

HARF: You've been reading my notes. 
WATTERS: Yeah, yeah.
HARF: Well, first of all, to what Dana said, something else Barack Obama is doing during this trip is doing a series of sessions for young and upcoming leaders in Africa. He has an initiative with working with them. I think that's great. And I know you think everything is about Donald Trump, Jesse, but I think that President Obama was talking about Trump but also about a phenomenon we're seeing around the world, in Hungary with Orban, in Turkey with Erdogan, in Russia with Putin. There's a global phenomenon of strong men, autocratic leaning leaders that are undermining institutions across the globe. It's not all about Donald Trump, man. 
WATTERS: I think.
HARF: And you know what, Jesse?
WATTERS: OK, go ahead.
HARF: He's right. This is a totally valid criticism and he's been very careful not to use President Trump's name directly. He's been very quiet.

HURT: But he never did that. He was classy through to the very end. 
PERINO: The only time, I think, that there was, you know, feeling like he should was really when President Obama had started the idea of going after those CIA interrogators and he was going to prosecute them, and that didn't end up happening, but he worked behind the scenes. 
WATTERS: I mean, maybe he was talking about Angela Merkel, because she regretted her immigration stance when she let all the migrants flood in to her country, and she's under a lot of pressure over there too. It's not just if, you know, you want immigration controls and sovereignty. It doesn't necessarily mean you're a racist.

        }
      
HURT: I find that to be the most appalling part of all of his comments there. But you remember the thing that Obama used to talk about when he -- in '08, he would talk about how Republicans had wrecked the car, the economy, which is the car, and now they were standing around on the side of the road with a Slurpee, and they're asking for the keys back because they want to get the car and try to back it out of the ditch. Well, that's what Barack Obama has done. He's the one standing outside of the road with a Slurpee. By a speech like this, he thinks that his opinions still matter and he wants the keys back. People are like no, you're not going to get the keys back. 
HARF: We're talking about it. It must matter to someone. 
GUTFELD: Well, he also did that thing where he gave a list of things. It's like, you know, it's like -- when you have to make a list of something to bolster your point. It means that most of the complaints are actually pretty weak. 
WATTERS: Yeah, and I don't know -- I think he's probably a little upset that his legacy has been throttled the way it has been, Dana, by Donald Trump, when you look at domestic policy. The Obamacare mandate, and the taxes, and foreign policy with the Iran deal. 
PERINO: I would say, there're three main things. Obviously, there's the foreign policy walk back that the president has done, but also from a tax policy standpoint, absolutely, regulatory policy. President Obama tried so hard to ram a lot of things through in those last several months. And because there is these maneuver that you can use in congress to turn those back, that's really unleashed the economy and it doesn't give enough attention. But the other thing is the judiciary because I think that they have now 30 circuit court judges confirmed. I mean, now on the second Supreme Court justice. That's remarkable. 
WATTERS: All right. Also remarkable, your notes.

HARF: Well, she's clearly not the expert on this issue, she's right about that. But, it is also true that the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank is horrific.

(CROSSTALK)
HARF: She's not entirely wrong, the substance. She did not look prepared for that interview and she is young, which I think it's a plus politically, often, today, particularly in this midterm. But if you're young, you cannot look unprepared. And she looked caught off guard in sort of meandered through an answer. 
PERINO: And she doesn't need to do all these interviews, Charlie. I mean, she's going ahead and win her district and then we'll see. 
HURT: Yeah. But, I mean, the thing -- you don't have to be an expert on these things. She went to college. I think she even had some sort of international relations degree. It's just stunning to me that you can go through -- get an education and be this deeply, profoundly ignorant on whether it's Palestine -- the situation there which I would disagree. 
HARF: That it's a humanitarian crisis? 
HURT: No, I don't disagree with that, but the idea that you call them occupied. It's astonishing to me because -- and there was a time where that sort of sentiment would have been branded as anti-Semitic but not anymore. But, also -- her embrace of socialism is -- I find just. 
PERINO: We have a sound bite from that. There's another piece where she's talking about capitalism. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CORTEZ: I do think that, right now, we have this no-holds barred, wild- west hyper capitalism. What that means is profit at any cost. Capitalism has not always existed in the world and it will not always exist in the world. When this country started, we were not a capitalist -- we do not operate on a capitalist economy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Greg, my dad used to say why not run for president now while you still know everything? 
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: He might still say that about me. But -- she's not alone in her thinking. I mean, there's a lot of young people on the left that think the way she does. 
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's sad. Kudos to Margaret Hoover. 
PERINO: Yeah.
GUTFELD: I thought that the follow-up question was very good. She did it nicely. It was like, excuse me, could you say something more idiotic? And she did. And I guess it shows what happens when you get far in life parodying bumper stickers slogan. And finally, somebody asked you to explain the bumper sticker that you're trying to pass off as an actual the thought. And what you have -- you didn't even have a bumper. There's no car there. 
So this is -- I often see this, too, on campus when I do campus interviews. They go up to a leftist, and they actually ask them to explain themselves, and they just fall apart. The press loves this, when Sasha Baron Cohen does it to Sarah Palin. But they don't love this stuff, because they want -- they actually believe this crap. I will say she is charming.
WATTERS: If this had happened to someone like a Palin, it would have been on every single news station.
GUTFELD: It did.
PERINO: It did.
GUTFELD: Every day.
WATTERS: Palin made a mistake? I don't remember that. 
HARF: She was running for vice president. That's a little different then a congressional seat in the Bronx. 
WATTERS: I know, but this woman has --
GUTFELD: She will be your vice president.
WATTERS: -- been crowned the socialist queen, and she's being protected. And she will be protected as she rides, because she's going to be a prolific fundraiser. And she's going to be wanted at every speaking engagement, and that's fine. 
But I think Margaret Hoover, who did a great job there, she was sent by the D.C. establishment to kneecap this person, to like cut her down to size a little bit. Because I know, and I've heard that people don't like her at the top levels of the Democratic Party, because she's taking a lot of attention. She's moving the party far left with this abolish ICE nonsense. 
GUTFELD: Where did you hear that from? 
WATTERS: I hear things. I do talk to Democrats.
HARF: He has a lot of Democrat sources. 
WATTERS: Yes, you and Juan. 
CHARLIE HURT, CO-HOST: But it is -- but it is true, and this has been coming for a long time. The crack-up that happened in the Republican Party that made think so difficult for it, with the Tea Party and stuff, all of that has just been waiting to happen to the Democratic Party, and it's happening. It's starting now.
HARF: I think -- look, I talked to a lot of candidates in the Midwest and the South who were actually quite moderate, and who were what we used to call blue dogs. So I think there's a debate inside the party. In the midterms, it won't matter as much, because we're candidates that match their districts. In 2020, it will matter. 
And I think someone like this young woman has a bright future if she applies herself correctly, and takes a deep breath, wins her race first, and becomes a productive member of the caucus. 
WATTERS: You can fudge better than that, though. To say "I don't know that much about politics." I mean, that's -- any idiot can say that. You should be able to kind of wing it a little bit. 
HARF: Well, that wasn't great. I would also point out that the U.S. government calls the Palestinian territories occupied. So it's not anti- Semitic to say that.
WATTERS: In the Obama administration. 
GUTFELD: The media is going to love her. They love her already. She is - - she is Bernie Sanders without the scent of Ben-Gay. So she's got all the ideologies there, and she's in a younger -- 
WATTERS: I think she's further left than Bernie, to be honest. 
GUTFELD: She might be. She might be.
HARF: She might be. But she also raises -- look, I don't agree with her economic policies. We do still have a problem in this country with wage stagnation and with the growing inequality between rich and poor. 
PERINO: But I have to say, wage stagnation, that argument doesn't sound as good as a no-holds-barred Wild West capitalism. That's more quotable. 
WATTERS: That sounds exciting, though. I like that. 
GUTFELD: I like hyper capitalism.
WATTERS: Wild West capitalism. 
GUTFELD: An amusement park ride. Free Market Land. 
PERINO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's not the only Democrat pushing socialist ideas. You would not believe what Chicago is considering. Up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HURT: So how does free cash with no questions asked sound to you? Some residents of Chicago could soon find out. A member of the city council is proposing universal basic income legislation that would give a $500 monthly stipend to 1,000 families. It's an idea that Barack Obama backed today during his speech in South Africa. 
So Marie, I have to ask, why -- 
HARF: I knew this was coming. 
HURT: It has to go to you.
HARF: I could feel it. 
PERINO: She has -- she already has her talking points. 
HURT: No, that wasn't on this. 
HURT: Barack Obama is right. 
WATTERS: It works for every topic. 
HURT: Tell me I'm wrong, because I'd love to be told that I'm wrong about this. But why are -- there's an alarming number of people in the Democratic Party who think socialism is great and have no problem with it. What's going on? What's wrong here? 
HARF: So I think when you or other people use the term "socialism," it's an easy way to get out of the conversation about how to make sure that there are people in the lower middle classes that are able to make more money, to better afford college or health care. 
GUTFELD: Typical socialist. 
HARF: No, no, but by saying "socialist," that almost shuts down the argument, right? We have a problem with inequality in our country. The richer are getting much richer. The poor and the middle-class have stagnated or gone down. That's a problem. 
Charlie, I'm not saying this solution is the solution in Chicago. And I'm not saying that Democrats do themselves any favors when they talk about socialism, but we need to think about how, as a country, we can do better on this, on this wage inequality. Because it's a real problem. 
HURT: Because even that, that kind of makes the point. Part of the problem with socialism is it just doesn't work. And so closing that -- you know, getting people to have a living wage and, of course, I want that, too. I want people to work. I want people to feel gainfully employed. But getting there -- you don't get there through socialism. You wind up killing a bunch of people. We've had, what, 100 million people die under communism over the past -- 
HARF: The social safety net in the country has also brought people out of poverty and -- 
HURT: There's a difference between a social safety net -- and we could even debate that --
HARF: And socialism. 
HURT: And socialism.
HARF: I'm arguing Democrats want more of a social safety net.
HURT: Only because I think that, you know, getting something for free without having to earn it hurts the person, the individual. Charity is a responsibility, and you have to do it wisely so that you don't destroy the person that you're trying to help. 
But Dana --
PERINO: Yes.
HURT: -- my question to you is, so I don't know how socialism -- I don't know how anybody makes the argument in favor of socialism. Yet somehow, Republicans and conservative still manage to lose this argument with people. How is that and what are they doing -- what are we doing wrong? 
PERINO: Well, I think --
WATTERS: When have we lost the argument on socialism? 
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Well, we're often portrayed as cruel.
HURT: The fact that you have huge portions of the Democratic Party --
WATTERS: Well, you are cruel.
HURT: -- espousing a lot of this stuff.
WATTERS: Let them.
HURT: The fighter Bernie Sanders, a socialist whatever. Socialist Democrat, whatever. Communist. 
HARF: Not Democrat.
HURT: He's -- the fact that he should have won the nomination last time, that's scary material. 
WATTERS: Yes, it's scary but he would have lost the general, and that's fine. Let him -- let him go off the left-wing cliff. 
HURT: This was -- this was -- 
PERINO: All I would say is that this idea is they don't call it socialism. They call it a universal based income. And the idea here in Chicago is a pilot program where people would get $500. And this would allow you to help you meet your basic needs. 
The question, though, is, like, is that necessary? Does that mean that you -- if you're on a welfare program, does that mean you don't need the welfare program anymore? Is it -- are we reducing that? 
The other thing, Republicans last week tried something that didn't get a lot of attention, but their new line is that the war on poverty is over. We have won it. And I'm surprised. 
WATTERS: Mission accomplished.
PERINO: Yes, but it doesn't have -- 
HARF: There's a lot of people who would disagree with that. 
PERINO: There's a lot of people who might disagree, but there is a lot to be said that there's a lot on the table right now economically that looks very good. Can we keep it going through the means of capitalism? But you're going to see a lot more of this UBI stuff. 
HURT: So Greg, would you -- would you be satisfied with a $500 stipend every month? 
GUTFELD: That's about --
HURT: What would you have to give up?
GUTFELD: -- three cans of beans a day and some cheap Mad Dog wine. I'm good. I'm good. Send it to me.
But you're right. You know, there is -- it's the untold story of the last, I'd say, ten, 20 years that the dramatic reductions in worldwide poverty are unbelievable. And even the average calorie intake in Africa --
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: -- which was always the place where there was really starvation, it's up to, like, 20, 2,500 calories a day, which is pretty good. 
OK. This -- you know, we beat the world in terms of economic systems. Yet we have this tendency to adopt the practices of the losers.
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: And I do think that has to do with some guilt and an ability of the opposing side to portray -- portray us as cruel and greedy when in fact, you know, a free market is probably the most selfless thing you could ever offer somebody. And it's nuts.
I do think there's an ominous challenge coming up, with automation and robotics. You see tens, perhaps 100 billion people unemployed or more because of automation. What do you do with those? What do these people do? And if they don't have -- if -- the only job -- if your job isn't purely social, you won't have a job. 
WATTERS: I'm just shocked that, in a city like Chicago, with Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel, run by Democrats for decades, there's so many poor people that can't get by. I just -- it astounds me, Charlie. It astounds me.
HURT: Me, too.
GUTFELD: I think he's being sarcastic.
HURT: Yes. 
PERINO: It's working.
HURT: So batter up. Juan Williams joins us live on the field of Nationals Park --
WATTERS: There he is.
HURT: -- with an all-access look at tonight's MLB all-star game, if it doesn't get rained out. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HARF: If there's one thing we all know about Juan Williams, it's that he's a die-hard sports fan. The Washington Nationals are one of his true loves, next to his wife and kids, of course. So we decided to ship him back to D.C. for a behind-the-scenes look at tonight's Major League Baseball all- star game at Nationals Park. 
Juan, you must feel like a kid in a candy store there. 
WILLIAMS: Marie, you've got it right. I'm so -- I'm sort of ecstatic. You know, it's like that John Fogarty song. The sun came out. Put me in coach, I'm ready to play. 
I'm on the field at Nationals Park. You've got to tell Greg I ran into some San Francisco Giants. Brandon Crawford. Bud Black of the Colorado Rockies just came over to say hello. He's a "Five" fan, folks.
PERINO: I know him. I know his record very well. 
WILLIAMS: No kidding. Look at that. And you know, it's just been an extraordinary time. 
Last night, they had the homerun derby. You've got to tell Jesse that Rhys Hoskins of the Phillies put on a show. 
WATTERS: Bryce Harper was the winning, wasn't he? Didn't Bryce Harper win it?
WILLIAMS: Bryce, he came back at the end in spectacular fashion and had this place rocking. Like, I'm a big fan. I'm a season ticket holder. I haven't seen Nationals Park rock like that before. It was spectacular. 
WATTERS: Well, Juan, I'm so glad that you weren't here yesterday and today, because you would have just been screaming about Trump. And we had some fill-ins that weren't as angry, and it was really nice that you were down there.
HARF: I was angry. 
WATTERS: You look great. You should put the collar up, though.
WILLIAMS: Oh? Oh, I should flip it up? Like a Jesse Watters thing. 
WATTERS: There it is.
WILLIAMS: I don't know if it will work. I'm trying. I'm trying, man. I'm trying to be as hip as Jesse, but Jesse, you're the younger generation. 
And by the way, yesterday I got to talk with the players. And Jesse, they're younger than you. It's unbelievable. 
WATTERS: Really? Younger than 40. Imagine that. 
WILLIAMS: They're all in their 20s, you know? 
PERINO: I have a question. Juan, I have a question. How did Washington, D.C., land this opportunity to be the venue for this all-star game? 
WILLIAMS: Well, this is an interesting question, Dana, because the Lerners, who own the team, have been asking for some time, and they finally got it. 
But the problem -- and this is so interesting. It's just like logistics in TV. They couldn't get the convention center, and they needed the convention center. They have a huge exhibit over there. Old-timers, hall of famers, you know, meet and greet sessions for fans. And they got it this year, so it came in. 
But this is a brand-new ballpark. I would say now about 5 years old. And so they've been angling to try to get it. And boy, has the town responded. Everything from the Library of Congress to the Congress itself, all really putting on the show for Major League Baseball. 
GUTFELD: Hey, Juan, after the rain, the field looks soggier than a truck driver's underpants. 
I was curious. Can you drink at the field? 
WILLIAMS: Yes. Can you drink? 
GUTFELD: Yes. Can you drink there or is it a dry -- I don't know. I've never been there. 
WATTERS: Juan's drunk right now.
WILLIAMS: So here's the thing. Here's the thing. So Deb Cody, who's the producer from "The Five," is with me. We got caught in the Nationals dugout and all of a sudden, it flooded, Greg. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: It flooded. We couldn't get out. And so they had to put chairs down like a bridge so that we could walk out. It was hilarious. 
But they had pumps. They brought out pumps. And they looked, like you know, stricken with fear that something was going to interfere with the game. The players are just coming out now for batting practice. But it worked. They drank it up.
GUTFELD: Wow.
HURT: Hey, Juan, Charlie Hurt here. How are you? 
WILLIAMS: Hey, Charlie. I know you're a Nats fan, Charlie.
HURT: Yes. So the number of times that I've run into you in that very park, it's kind of amazing. But I'd say, I'm rather jealous, but -- but I won't hold that against you right now. 
The real question that I want to know is after last night's amazing performance by Bryce Harper and, I mean, the dramatics of that sort of come from behind in the last final 15, 20 seconds was pretty astonishing. Is this going to turn the season around for Bryce Harper? 
WILLIAMS: Well, there's so many questions around Harper. So I was telling you guys that yesterday I got to talk to all the players. And, you know, the biggest crowds were around two players, Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles. And again, he's on the trade -- the trade block, because I think the Orioles can't afford him. 
And then the other one was Bryce Harper. And the question is, does Bryce Harper stay in Washington after this season? He's not having a great season, average-wise. He's hitting the home runs. And then the question becomes, well, is that worth $400 million, Charlie? I don't know. They've got some other people coming up.
But I've got to tell you, after last night, it's clear Bryce Harper owns this town. And his face, he's like the franchise player. Ryan Zimmerman has been the franchise player here for years. Bryce Harper is clearly the face of the Washington Nationals. And the question is, is that worth something in and of itself, even if his average is below average at the moment? 
HARF: So Juan, last question here, who's going to win tonight? American League or the National League? Put your money on it. 
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I'm a National League guy. I grew up as a Mets fan in Brooklyn. Now I'm a Nationals fan. In between, I rooted for the Orioles when Washington didn't have a team.
HARF: Right.
WILLIAMS: But the track record's pretty clear, Dana. The American League won, I think, four of the last five, if not all of the last five times. We've got Max Scherzer out here, you know, and Chris Sale of the Red Sox starting. Those are two great pitchers, but it really comes down to the back end, and we'll see who wins.
But if you had to pick, Dana, put your money on the AL. 
PERINO: All right. Got it.
HARF: All right, Juan. We will be watching tonight. Have fun. Stay tuned, because "One More thing" is up next. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: I'll get you coffee. All right. It's time for "One More thing" -- Jesse. 
WATTERS: So you know I'm a big Eagles fan, and Brian and Jillian, some friends of mine sent me an actual Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl helmet here. Do you guys remember the score? Eagles 41, Patriots 33. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My God.
WATTERS: Here we go. Get it locked in. 
GUTFELD: I hope you have -- I hope you can't get out of it. 
PERINO: Are these the friends from Nashville?
WATTERS: These are the friends from Nashville. Right here, here we go. I'm ready to roll. I can run right through a wall right now. 
GUTFELD: Yes. A wall of something. 
Dana. 
PERINO: Wall of something. OK, I love this story. A Birmingham college student walked 20 miles to his first day of work, so his boss gave him a car. Walter Carr's own car broke down the night before he was supposed to start his new job, but that did not stop him from showing up after over four hours of walking, starting at 2 a.m. And with some help from local police, he made it to work. And the company's CEO heard about this story, personally thanked him, and gifting Walter his own barely-drive Ford Escape. 
Walter wants to go to the Marines. 
HARF: Wow.
PERINO: So I feel like he's going to make it. Take a listen to him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WALTER CARR, GOT CAR FROM CEO: I love him. So this car is making it much easier to do what I need to do to help and expand myself out more.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PERINO: Good luck to you, Walter Carr.
HURT: He injured himself? 
WATTERS: I injured myself putting on the helmet. Put my finger on the strap, I think.
GUTFELD: My goodness.
WATTERS: A real football player. Going to suck that blood right out. 
GUTFELD: I think it's the wrong strap, too. I'm not sure. 
But all right.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRAPHIC: Greg's Travel Tips
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: All right. One of the things you should always learn when you're traveling is how to fit luggage into the overhead bin. After many, many repeated attempts, look at this guy. He's trying to get it in there. It's not working, not working. And it's probably a pretty obvious fix for this blurry-headed male. And then I think a flight attendant comes over, and she's also blurry-faced. It's a disorder. 
PERINO: It happens when nobody can get their bags. 
GUTFELD: Watch this. Put it in that way. By the way, more proof that we're nothing but finks. All we do is film people looking stupid. I'm sick of it. 
Charlie.
WATTERS: Like right now. 
HURT: So this is amazing. This is footage of a daring rescue on Mount Hood, which is Oregon's highest mountain.
WATTERS: I climbed it.
HURT: That's 11,000 feet. Really?
WATTERS: I did. 
HURT: Not with the helmet. 
WATTERS: I didn't, not with the helmet. 
HURT: Oregon's --
WATTERS: An ice pick though.
HURT: -- National Guard Chinook -- CH-47 Chinook dramatically made a pinnacle landing.
PERINO: Wow.
HARF: Wow.
HURT: Where the chopper backs up to the mountain and lowers its doors, and the blades are chest high as rescuers have to go out -- out of the back of the chopper to rescue this fellow. 
And the amazing thing about it is the guy that walked up the mountain was intending to commit suicide.
GUTFELD: Wow.
HURT: And changed his mind, and it's a great reminder of the extraordinary selfless sacrifice that these -- these folks, men and women in the National Guard. 
PERINO: Indeed. Excellent "One More Thing," Charlie, for your debut "One More Thing." I give you five stars. 
HARF: In that vein --
GUTFELD: All right, Dana.
HARF: -- Ron Wesley Brady Jr. is a 22-year retired gunnery sergeant veteran with the Marine Corps. He's currently on a trek on foot across America from San Diego to Quantico, Virginia, to raise awareness for PTSD and to honor his late brother, Major Brady, who took his own life after suffering from mental health issues. 
He's currently in Arkansas. He's expected to reach his end point in New Jersey sometime in September -- or Virginia, I guess, sometime in September. He's doing this to raise money and awareness for PTSD. Which is great cause. 
GUTFELD: Fantastic. Well done.
PERINO: Good guy. 
HARF: Yes.
GUTFELD: All right. Never miss an episode of "The Five." Do not fret, here's our man Bret. 
BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: Thanks, Greg. That's good.
