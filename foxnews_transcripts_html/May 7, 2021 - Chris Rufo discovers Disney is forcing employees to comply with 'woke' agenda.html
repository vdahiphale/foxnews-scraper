TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. Happy Friday.So what would happen if you gave a group of angry ignorant ideologues, thesame people who tell you that all lives don't matter? What would happen ifyou gave them the keys to the U.S. economy? We don't need to guess aboutthat, we are finding out now because all around us, there are signs thatunder this White House, things are getting dangerously flaky in oureconomy.Here's one example.The official government jobs numbers came out today. Unemployment is up,far higher than expected. Close to 14 million Americans say they want towork but cannot find a job. That's an old story. Here's the new twist.At the very moment that unemployment is rising, fewer people are working,American businesses say they can't find employees and it is obvious theycan't, go to the nearest strip mall and count the "Help Wanted" signs onthe doors. They're everywhere.Restaurants are closing because they can't find anyone to hire ormanufacturing plants. That means American now has far too many workers, butsimultaneously, far too few workers. How can that be?Another question: what happened to all the consumer products? Many of thethings that you buy and need to buy are more expensive than they've everbeen. Inflation is real, it's galloping. Yet at the same time, a lot ofproducts seem to have gone missing completely.The United States is currently experiencing shortages of chicken,generators, roofing materials, lumber, ketchup, bicycles, diapers,ammunition, automobiles, plastics, appliances, chlorine, pork, propanetanks, among many other things.Keep in mind, this is peacetime. We haven't mobilized for a foreign war.Yet, we're now getting reports that we should brace for a gas shortage thissummer. Why is this all happening? Well, because things are so great in theeconomy. That's what they're telling us on television.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This week, there were more signs that the U.S. economyis roaring back to life and they come as President Biden is proposingtrillions of dollars in new government spending.JILL SCHLESINGER, CBS NEWS BUSINESS ANALYST: It's really good news, thisweek, we found out that in the first quarter of this year, the economyexpanded at a 6.4 percent annualized rate. That is huge.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Could we see a great economy and a lousy return forthe stock market?KATIE KOCH, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think the good news foreverybody is that we're actually probably going to see both, that we'regoing to continue to see a strong economy and we also are set up actuallyfor some great equity market returns here.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: There's an awful lot of lying in financial journalism. No one eversays that, but it is self-evident.But they are telling us things are great. Why are they telling us that?Well, because the stock market is way, way up. Could it be overvalued? Idon't know. Take a look at those price to earnings ratios. Can theycontinue? Is that reality based? Should we be worried?Oh, just relax, but be sure to stock up on gasoline and diapers if you can.We could be looking at Soviet grocery shelves soon.And whatever you do, keep ignoring the inflation right in front of you. Oilprices, for example, they've risen 12 percent in a single month. Steelprices have tripled since last year, chicken breast prices have doubledjust since Biden became President.The price of eggs has increased by almost five percent. Major appliances upalmost 15. Ground beef and fresh fruits both up almost six percent. Themedian sales price of existing home sales shot up by 16 percent.And then there's lumber. Have you noticed lumber? Since last year, theprice of dimensional lumber has gone up by almost 300 percent. Want athousand board feet? That'll cost you $1,359.00. That price has never beenhigher.According to the National Association of Homebuilders, the cost of buildingmaterials adds more than $35,000.00 to the price of an average new home.Why is this happening? Well, there's too much cash in the system. That's abig reason for it.When you print too much fake money, the value of that money declines.People start to figure out that it's not real and you get inflation. That'salways true. No one disputes it.The White House just doesn't care. Here's the new Treasury Secretarytelling you not to worry about inflation because it's not a concern.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: And I think the economy is going toget back on track. I don't anticipate that inflation is going to be aproblem. But it is something that we're watching very carefully.I don't think there's going to be an inflationary problem.You know, President Biden has also proposed further substantial spendingpackages we would love to see enacted into law.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, so just keep spending trillions of made up dollars to pay offyour political constituencies because there won't be an inflationaryproblem. Right. Thanks, genius. How'd you get the job anyway?They're hoping you won't notice you can't afford anything anymore. You'llbe too distracted by the fact that you don't have electricity."The Sacramento Bee" reported a few days ago that California energyofficials quote, " ... can't promise they'll be able to keep the lights onthis summer." Oh, no lights in your home. Big deal. Just use candles anddig a pit latrine.Meanwhile, in Texas, which is supposed to be saying that, they always saythey are, "The Dallas Morning News" is telling us that, quote, "inefficienthomes" are to blame for the state's massive power outages this winter. So,it was your fault the power went out. You have the wrong kind of house.It definitely was not the fault of stupid and corrupt renewable energyschemes, the ones that were forced the entire state to roll in andwindmills which froze when it got cold. No, it wasn't their fault, it wasyour fault. Your house did it, so get a better house. Too bad lumber is soexpensive.But the question is, even if you can afford the lumber, who's going to dothe construction? As we said, in the middle of rising unemployment, somehowwe don't have enough workers.There is, they keep telling us in Washington, a labor shortage and thatpresumably is why we need to open the borders and let in millions of newforeign workers immediately.So what is going on here? Probably a lot of things; it is a huge countryand a pretty complicated country, but here's one reason behind what we'reseeing. The government is paying people to stay home. Thanks to Joe Biden's$2 trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill everything, by the way, done on thejustification of the pandemic, some people in this country are gettingchecks for up to $700.00 a month not to work.This is true across the country, even in Louisiana, and that's the statewith the lowest weekly unemployment benefits, you can still make almost 500bucks a week for not working. For a 40-hour workweek that works out toabout 12 bucks an hour, a little more actually. That's above the minimumwage.In the states with the highest unemployment assistance, you can be makingclose to $20.00 an hour for not working. And we're not attacking anyone orcalling anyone lazy, it is pretty easy to see why people aren't working.They're not nuts. They're rational.So no wonder the economy is sputtering in bizarre ways. America createdjust 266,000 jobs last month, that's in a nation of 350 million people.Economists, the people who predict these things very often incorrectly wereexpecting four times that number. The result, the unemployment numbers wereso shockingly bad that even CNBC didn't believe them at first, they had todouble check those numbers on the air.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It looks like 266,000. It looks like it was a bigdisappointment at 266, but maybe I have that wrong. Let me double check thebureau website here. One second. Yes, 266 is correct. Unemployment change,a little change, it is 6.1 percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So there's not, to restate, an actual shortage of Americanworkers, citizens who could fill jobs. They're just telling you that sothey can justify opening the borders and changing the electorate, so theynever lose another election, and no one ever takes their power away.But that's not true. What is true once again, is that the government ispaying people more not to work than to work, and so why would they work?Would you?The question is, what do you do if you're an employer and at some pointwhen we devalue the currency so completely that printing more dollars won'thelp, we are going to need actual employers in this country, and what dothey do?Well, a reporter called Nate Doughty, at "The Pittsburgh Business Times"looked into this question. He talked to businesses around Pittsburgh thathad managed to hire people. How do they do it? What was their secret? Well,they just had to double the wages.A place called Klavon's Ice Cream Parlor had been around since 1923, hikedit starting wage from $7.25 to 15 bucks an hour. They more than doubled it;a nearby Sports Bar now guarantees waiters and bartenders 20 bucks an hour.That's happening in a ton of places around the country.And big companies, needless to say, could compete more effectively becausethey have more money.A Burger King in Washington, Pennsylvania is offering a $1,500.00 bonus tonew workers. A McDonald's in Florida is giving people 50 bucks just forshowing up to a job interview. A company called Sisu Energy in Texas isoffering new truck drivers $14,000.00 a week.Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States has raised wagesfor nearly half a million employees in February. The company's averagewages now over 15 bucks an hour.In some ways, that is good news. You want to see people make more. Ofcourse, you want dollars to be worth more and now they're worth less.But there are effects of this that we could be living with for a long time.There are millions of small businesses that cannot afford to compete,they're not Walmart, and many of them will go under, because of thepressure applied by the U.S. government on the labor market.And when those small businesses do go under, what will be left? Amazon.Andrew Gruel has thought a lot about this. He is a chef. He is the owner ofSlappish Restaurant, there are several locations of it in SouthernCalifornia. He is now paying for some reference here, dishwashers, 21 bucksan hour to start. He joins us now.Andrew, thanks so much for coming on tonight. You know, I think all goodpeople look at rising wages and applaud for the people making those wages,but there are also some very strange incentives being forced on our economyby policymakers. Tell us what the effect has been on your business.ANDREW GRUEL, CHEF AND OWNER, SLAPPISH RESTAURANTS: Well, yes, thank youvery much for having me. And I wish we were talking more about ketchup andnot necessarily about labor. But in any case, look, there's multiplefactors that are leading towards this, and this is what I see with boots onthe ground, right?You know, I'm not throwing out economic platitudes here. What I see is,first and foremost, in states like California, where schools are stillclosed is that it's forcing people not to work because they stay home andwatch their children or they have to hire somebody to watch their kids,right?I would watch my own kid.CARLSON: Good point. Well, of course.GRUEL: So there's nothing wrong with that. You know, and laziness is notthe factor here. That's the most important thing.CARLSON: Right.GRUEL: And number two is that people are weary about coming back to work ifthey are only going to be shut down again. In California, as I mentioned,again, you know, people came back to work, they were fired, came back, theywere fired, came back, they were fired. And then in the last time inDecember, they couldn't even get unemployment benefits because of themisappropriation of so many dollars in California, the whole system was ongridlock.That's when we started a fund, we raised over $400,000.00 to givestruggling out of work restaurant workers money because the state couldn'tdo it. And now those same people are telling me, look, Oregon andWashington just shut down again, how do I know I'm not going to come backto work and then bam, I'm shut down?And look, the third reason is, is that a lot of people in the restaurantindustry specifically, they don't want to come back and work in anenvironment where perhaps it's been vilified as this kind of epicenter ofspread and they've got to wear, you know, triple masks and work behind allthis Plexiglas and, and it's just not the environment in which they want towork.So they're either going to sit on the sidelines and see this thing through,or they're going to enter another area of retail.CARLSON: And the fourth factor would be, if you make more by not working,why would you work? And I agree with your assessment. That's not laziness.That seems like a rational decision. I mean, these are not people makingthese policies, they are people responding to the policies in place.My concern is what happens when you kill these businesses? What are youleft with at the end?GRUEL: Well, look at what we saw through the pandemic, right? CorporateAmerica merged with the government, and they got all of this corporatewelfare, and then all of us small business owners who are paying on average22 to 23 percent taxes when Amazon is paying one or one percent taxes, weare the villains, we are the bad guys. We lose our businesses, and thenwhat happens? It gets swallowed up by you know, Walmart.CARLSON: Right. I mean, are you seeing that? I mean, the businesses thatare still open, particularly in a state like California have weathered alot. I mean, they've done a lot to persist to this point.How much more can they take before they just give up?GRUEL: Yes, well, it's already happening. People are giving up left andright. And, you know, one of the situations here is, is that we're now notjust competing with, you know, a government institution, but a lot of theselarge multi-unit corporations that have a ton of cash in the balance sheet.They're offering excessive amounts of money to draw people in, and mostlikely, not even treat their employees well, like a small business ownerwould.CARLSON: It does seem like the system is stacked against people who runsmall businesses. I mean, I don't -- I don't see another conclusion.GRUEL: And look at how many jobs small businesses in America actuallycreate and are independent and innovative and are working and boots on theground? I mean, you know, that's where there's a huge disconnect here.CARLSON: That's for sure. Andrew Gruel, I appreciate your coming ontonight. Thank you. Good luck.GRUEL: Thank you.CARLSON: Well, it's almost Mother's Day, we're going to have to change thename because "mother" has been banned. Two sexes. Fortunately, some Membersof Congress have a new name for mothers. Wait to see if it applies to you.We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: What will they destroy next? If you've been asking yourself that,here's the formula. The more wholesome it is, the more people like it, themore likely they are to wreck it and that means Mother's Day is in thecrosshairs. That's coming up soon.Some Members of Congress -- in fact, it is Sunday -- have decided that thevery idea of mother is sexist, it is dehumanizing, so they've got asolution, one that respects the dignity of mothers everywhere.Democrats are now calling mothers "birthing people."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. CORI BUSH (D-MO): I sit before you today as a single mom, as a nurse,as an activist and as Congresswoman and I am committed to doing theabsolute most to protect black mothers, to protect black babies, to protectblack birthing people and to save lives.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Imagine if that was your nurse? Whoa. Get someone else toadminister the IV drip. That was Cori Bush. She's a Member of Congress fromMissouri somehow, referring as you just heard to black birthing people, inother words, mothers.That happened during a House Committee hearing entitled "Birthing whileBlack: Examining America's Black Maternal Health Crisis." Becauseeverything is about race now.As you can imagine, some people thought this language about birthing peoplewas in fact kind of dehumanizing, reducing people to their biologicalfunction though that of course would be par for the course for Cori Bushand her friends.But a prominent abortion providing group, the abortion lobby, NARAL jumpedto Cori Bush's defense. Of course, they did. They tweeted this: "When wetalk about birthing people were just being inclusive," not Stalinist, notOrwellian, not fascist and crazy, but inclusive quote, "It's that simple.""We use gender neutral language when talking about pregnancy because it'snot just cisgender women (whatever that means) that can get pregnant andgive birth. Reproductive freedom is for everybody."Okay, so it's not just women who can give birth says a lobby that claims tobe protecting healthcare. Right.Sandy Cortez, of course, jumped in. She came to the defense of men givingbirth. She's a Biology major, too. In the process, she got so confused thatshe seemed to take the pro-life position. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): If we want to talk about PlannedParenthood, let's talk about how many lives Planned Parenthood has savedand how many babies have been born because of the prenatal care provided byPlanned Parenthood.And if you don't -- if you don't believe it, and if you've never met aPlanned Parenthood baby, I'm happy to let you know that I am one.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So America's biggest abortion provider is actually all aboutchildbirth. But what's amazing is Planned Parenthood, of course is a hugesupporter of Sandy Cortez's and there she is, cutting an ad for them. It'salmost like a radio show host reading an endorsement on the air.I wear Ray-Ban sunglasses because they protect my eyes. There is SandyCortez telling us how great Planned Parenthood is. Shamelessness.Well, a new bill working its way through the legislature in the State ofTexas would ban castration, chemical and otherwise, gender reassignmentsurgery for children, for kids. But the bill is being held up, why? Becausesome Republicans are holding it up.Apparently, they are caving to pressure from corporate interests. You'veseen that in a lot of other states. One Republican who is distressed bythis is Sid Miller. He is the Agriculture Commissioner of Texas. He issaying it out loud, and we're happy to have him on tonight.Mr. Miller, thank you for coming on.So let's just get right to it. There are not a lot of Republican voters whoare in favor of this, not a lot of Democrats, but not a lot of sane peopleare for mutilating children, but some Republicans are holding up the ban onit. Why?SID MILLER, AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER OF TEXAS: I can't believe this inTexas? Really? We're going to let our children be mutilated? Tucker, wedon't want our minors smoke cigarettes, we don't let them drink alcohol. Wedon't let them engage in sexual activity.You can't even get a driver's license when you're 16, but we will let thembe mutilated. Mastectomies, castration, gene and hormone therapy, you know,this gender modification has got to stop. It's just cowboy logic. Weshouldn't be doing it.Who has a problem with this? I don't know. They're nuts. But it is. It'sstuck in the legislative process. It needs to move.I wish our Governor Greg Abbott would use some of his, you know, politicalpowers and political capital to get this thing moving and would get itpassed. We've only got six days -- six days, if this bill doesn't pass, itis dead for two years before the legislature can come back and I'm fed upwith it.I mean, it is embarrassing for our state. Some of these children have thisdone to them as young as two years old. Can you believe that?CARLSON: No, it's beyond belief. And it's not only something that obviouslyshould not happen to children. These are not adults, they are children. Butit's also a metaphor for something bigger. I mean, if a Republican Governorcan't even weigh in on this, to what extent is he representing his voters,honestly?MILLER: Well, you know, he's just silent on it. We need him to weigh in onit. You know, I'm a statewide elected official, you know, I'm AgCommissioner, but I'm weighing in, I think it's that important.CARLSON: Are you are you worried that under the leadership of yourGovernor, nothing personal and people like him that Texas will become aDemocratic state soon?MILLER: Well, I think we have very well will be if we don't stand up forwhat people really believe in, and get rid of this woke business. I don'teven like that word. It wasn't even a word a year ago, but we need to actlike Texans. We need to act like Americans. We need to act like responsibleadults, responsible parents, and responsible legislators and politicians.We need to take action. This is an easy one. I can't believe we got hungup. We need to move and need to move now.CARLSON: A small group of crazed ideologues came into the State ofVirginia, took it over politically, won one election and changed the statecompletely and forever. Do people in Texas ever look over to Virginia andsay that could happen to us? We better take steps. We better get real aboutwhat could happen to us.MILLER: Well, you know, Texas used to be the shining light for the wholenation. Other states used to look at us for leadership and what we're doingon job creation, taxes, regulation, and now not so much.You know, they look at Texas and see something like this and they laugh atus. I can't believe though Texans are allowing that to happen.CARLSON: Right.MILLER: Wake up, people. We've got to get a hold of our state or we aregoing to lose it.CARLSON: Amen. When I when I saw the power go out because your windmillsfroze, I began to ask real questions about your governor and others. So Iappreciate your standing up. Sid Miller, thank you very much.MILLER: God bless. Thanks.CARLSON: So Disney used to be an entertainment company, now it's theentertainment arm of the Chinese government, it appears that way. They usedto be a company that represents what Americans like.We have some exclusive reporting from inside Disney that tells youeverything about what they think of America. That's straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, for generations, The Walt Disney Company was the most famousentertainment company in America. In fact, it represented America to theworld. It was in some sense synonymous with American culture.Disney, of course, produced all kinds of films during the Second World War,encouraging United States to defeat fascism. So when you hear Disney, youthink of something that's very American, very wholesome, something thatyour kids would watch.It's changed.Disney has started producing propaganda films, not for the U.S. governmentbut for the Chinese Communist Party. Not surprisingly, its seniorleadership has denounced its own historic cartoons as racist.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNY COHEN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, THEWALT DISNEY COMPANY: One of the things that we actually did during thecourse of that work was to conduct focus groups with our black colleaguesand we got some really tough but incredibly valuable feedback, includingthe following statement, which I will never forget when I read it in theresearch results. "I'm not comfortable with Disney commercializing racistcontent."So what this remark is referencing is the fact that there are titles in ourlibrary that include, frankly, racist characterizations, and we're nottalking exclusively about obscure title. There are titles that includethat, like "Fantasia" or "Dumbo" and "Aladdin."(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It's almost we're saving that tape. So here you have someone whois clearly not very smart, rolling her eyes, and because she does some kindof in-house focus group with like, 11 people, your kids don't get to watchthe movies that you grew up watching because of an unhappy person whosename we will never noticed that they were racist.It was Jenny Cohen, by the way on the screen. She is the Executive VicePresident at Disney for something called Corporate Social Responsibility.Now, we're learning that that's just the tip of the iceberg. Disney istraining its employees that the United States, the country that producedDisney is in fact evil. Chris Rufo is a journalist who has obtained a troveof internal documents from Disney. They're all part of a program thecompany calls "Reimagine Tomorrow."In one part of the training, which is called "Allyship for RaceConsciousness." Can you even imagine? Disney claims that, quote: "TheUnited States has a long history of systemic racism and transphobia." Bythe way, transphobia is a word that didn't exist like 20 minutes ago, whatdo you mean a long history of it? Nobody even heard of that until someunhappy Sociology major from Wesleyan made it up and imposed on the rest ofus.But the training, totally ahistorical training goes on to tell whiteemployees to quote, " ... work through feelings of guilt, shame anddefensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to behealed." Right, targeting employees on the race.Disney specifically tells employees to quote, " ... challenge colorblindideologies and rhetoric such as ..." and we're quoting, "all lives matter."You can't say all lives matter, so which lives matter? Why don't you tellus, Disney?In a separate training, Disney demands its employees reject the concept ofquote, "equality." So crazy, hard to believe it's real. It is real though,Chris Rufo broke this story. He joins us tonight to confirm that.So you can't say all lives matter. I am starting to get caught up on thisone turn of phrase, but it's just so revealing. Is there an indication ofwhich lives matter and which lives don't matter according to The WaltDisney Company?CHRISTOPHER RUFO, DIRECTOR, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: Yes, there is. And whatDisney is saying is that we should reject the idea of equality, that peopleshould be treated equally, regardless of their skin color and they say weneed to pursue a strategy and a policy of equity, where people achieve,quote, "equal outcomes."And this is again, the tip of the iceberg. Disney created and sponsored a21-day racial equity challenge, and told employees to complete a whiteprivilege checklist and passed around a worksheet saying that whiteemployees should defund the police, participate in reparations, and evendecolonize their bookshelves, whatever that means.CARLSON: So Disney is encouraging book burning, telling us that equality iswrong, that we're not all equal, and that some of our lives matter morethan other lives. That is so dark. I wonder where they think that's goingexactly, all lives don't matter. We're not equal, like what's the end pointfor this? Any indication?RUFO: Well, I mean, the great irony of this is that the people who are incharge of Disney are some of the richest and most powerful and privilegedwhite males in the history of humanity and they are pushing this divisive,critical race theory based ideology as corporate dogma and the only end ofthis is division. It's self-hatred.And I think it should be very clear that Disney makes its money on MiddleAmericans who go to their theme parks, who buy their content and thosepeople should know that this corporation hates you. It hates your culture,and it hates the color of your skin. And I think Americans should rejectthis kind of politics and reject the companies that are pushing it.CARLSON: Well, I couldn't agree with that more. And just to be -- I justwant to nail this down completely. You are certain that these documents arereal.RUFO: Yes, that's correct. I've confirmed them with multiple sources aroundthe company, done screen sharing, done internal verification. These aregenuine documents and videos.The video doesn't lie and this is the new ideology of The Walt DisneyCorporation. And it's really sad because it used to be a great Americancompany. Now, it's telling us that America is a fundamentally racistcountry, founded on discrimination. They couldn't be more wrong. I hopethey right the ship, but I'm not optimistic.CARLSON: Yes. And they're lying, too, because we are all equal, actually.We're all created by God. We're all equal and all lives do matter. That'sjust true. Chris Rufo, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you.RUFO: Thank you.

She isalso, and you may not have known this, an accomplished romance novelist,who has written under the plume -- nom de plume, Selena Montgomery.As promised, we got a copy of that book. We found someone to do thevoiceover and we promise you, it'll make your week.Plus, we told you earlier in the week about an arrangement between a Googlelobbyist called Frank Luntz and his roommate who just happens to be the topRepublican in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy.We asked how much exactly was Kevin McCarthy paying to live with FrankLuntz and we found out tonight. We'll tell you after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: You may know Stacey Abrams as the one true Governor of Georgia,never elected, but still spiritually in charge, but she is more than that.Stacey Abrams is one of the most talented and sauciest romance novelists ofa generation, but like so many great artists, she can be under appreciated.And that's why our senior editorial producer, the Great Tom Fox, spent$7.00 to track down a copy of one of her steamier novels, the 2006 tour deforce, "Hidden Sins."Now, most of the novel is a mystery and to be honest, we didn't reallyfollow the plotline. It's not because the writing was bad, oh, no. This isAmanda Gorman level stuff. Really, it's because our eyes were drawnreflexively to the more salacious elements of the novel, like moths to avery, very hot flame.How hot? Well, our senior producer Alex McCaskill volunteered to perform adramatic reading of the most titillating moments in Stacey Abrams'snovelty. He is still recovering from that.The recording session began innocently enough(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)ALEX MCCASKILL, FOX NEWS, SENIOR PRODUCER (voice over): Heat, like aninferno blazed in his veins. Temptation, like a song clouded his mind. Itdemanded that he slide his arms around her, that he trail his hand on longher spine to sink into the silken curls, and her nape.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "Heat, like an inferno, temptation like a song." Now we know whatyou're thinking, grammarians, hitting the simile is a bit hard. At first wethought so, but then like a half empty train at Penn Station in the middleof the workweek. We thought we could just pull away, oh, but we were wrong.We had to continue.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)MCCASKILL (voice over): Their tongues tangled, danced, and she reveled inthe movement. She splayed eager palms against his chest and tormented theflesh he found there. Too far away, she gripped his waist to pull himcloser, until she stood cradled between his hard thighs.(END AUDIO CLIP)CARLSON: "She tormented his flesh with her palms." We were tormented as weread it. As we read it more, we noticed our thighs were also gettingharder, much harder.But Stacey Abrams wasn't done with us yet. We hadn't encountered any of herdialogue yet. It was all exposition, and then it hit us, a full line of hercharacters actually speaking to one another, not just grunting, butspeaking in the language. It sent us over the top. Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)MCCASKILL (voice over): Hunger raged inside her, demanding to be sated.Wicked thumbs teased her too sensitive flesh and stole her breath, but itwould mean nothing if he didn't understand, "You're all I've ever wanted."(END AUDIO CLIP)CARLSON: Wicked thumbs. Will we ever, going forward, ever be able to callStacey Abrams, anything but wicked thumbs? We'll see, probably not.The book is called "Hidden Sins" and frankly, we feel like we've justsinned in public. You can have that feeling, too, for the low, low price ofjust $7.00.Get it. But go easy on your thighs. It'll wear them out.Peter McCullough is an eminent physician. He's an internist and acardiologist. We had an amazing conversation with him that lasted for morethan an hour on "Tucker Carlson Today." We covered a lot of ground.It was mostly about the coronavirus and how to respond to it. But one partof the discussion stuck out and we want to share it with you tonight.It turns out there is still no treatment protocol for physicians trying totreat patients with coronavirus. What? It's true. Here is part of ourconversation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. PETER MCCULLOUGH, INTERNIST AND CARDIOLOGIST: I'm a doctor, I treatpatients one by one, and I can tell you and I testify to this, I havetreated all my high risk patients. I think it would be immoral, unethical,and from a civil perspective, illegal not to do that.So that question is best posed to all the doctors and medical centers andgroups that have been treating COVID-19. We are a year into this. Where'sthe Mayo Clinic protocol? Where's the Harvard protocol? Where's JohnsHopkins?CARLSON: There isn't one?MCCULLOUGH: Do they have a COVID treatment?CARLSON: I don't know.MCCULLOUGH: Have they helped people avoid hospitalization and death? Orhave they just sat back and just received the cases as they've come in?I'm telling you, something is up. The entire world has been on defense.Maybe it's all driven out of fear, but we are not treating something thatis a treatable problem early. We are making this so much harder than itshould be.CARLSON: And people have died as a result of that, obviously.MCCULLOUGH: I testified in the in the U.S. Senate, I thought -- at November19th -- I thought 50 percent of the deaths could have been avoided becausethere was a learning curve of how we put this together.Remember, there are no large randomized trials of multidrug therapy. Noneare even forthcoming.And our naysayers have said listen, Dr. McCullough, you don't have enoughevidence.It's like, of course, I don't have enough evidence. That's five years away.And the guidelines say well, there's not enough evidence to treat patients.But what am I going to do? Let them die? Of course not.I'm telling you, I have no agenda, but I am deeply concerned that somethinghas gone off the rails in the world. It involves science. It involves amedical literature. It involves a regulatory response. It involvespopulations kept in fear and in isolation and despair.CARLSON: Okay, so you -- this is upsetting, but it's also fascinating, Ithink. You've alluded a couple times to something being up, I think is thephrase that you used.Can you put a slightly finer point on that? Do you believe that NGOs, theenormous nonprofits that have a lot of sway, it seems like in the publichealth arena are exercising influence over COVID policy and the directionthat you are describing. Is it that? Is it some international regulatorybody? Is it W.H.O.? I mean, like, what is this, do you think?MCCULLOUGH: That is really going to be the goal of investigative reportersto figure this out. There must be stakeholders, or there must be somefundamental drivers for groupthink -- now, this is a group think. It is inthe minds of people.CARLSON: Is anyone profiting from it?MCCULLOUGH: I have no idea. I'm just focusing on the sick patient right infront of me, Tucker. I can't tell you. But I have seen things in the lastyear that I can't explain as a doctor.Why are other doctors not helping with a simple illness to help thesepatients avoid hospitalization and death? Why are they not doing this?(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So the question Dr. McCullough asked and that we spoke about foran hour is that why isn't the medical establishment making a greater effortto treat people who have COVID until they get to the hospital, where someof them die?All the emphasis is on getting the vaccine, but not on the treatment. As wesaid, there is still no treatment protocol produced by Mayo or HarvardMedical School. Why is that?The conversation was fascinating. It is on "Tucker Carlson Today" on FOXNation. Highly recommended.Well, "The Daily Mail," one of the last trusted news sources in the world,has uncovered some amazing text messages between Hunter Biden and hissecretary, who has direct ties to China. We will tell you what that means,next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Frank Luntz is a pollster in Washington, D.C. who advises theRepublican Party. His real job is working for Google and promotingOxyContin in the middle of an opioid epidemic.Whatever you think of Frank Luntz, he is great to live with, to share atoothbrush with. We know that because Kevin McCarthy does it. How much doeshe pay for that? That's a question we had asked because there are of courserules in the House about accepting gifts at under market prices.Well, we learned that Kevin McCarthy paid $1,500.00 a month to live inFrank Luntz's apartment. That sounds fine until you learn the apartment is7,000 square feet and it's a penthouse.McCarthy's spokesman defended that saying that that's fair market ratebecause McCarthy is renting only one of 12 bedrooms in the apartment andit's only 400 square feet.So I guess that means that he doesn't use the kitchen or the living room.It was just a 400-square foot bathroom. It gives the term friend and familydiscount a whole new meaning. Wish you had a friend like Frank Luntz.Well, we have learned a lot more about what Hunter Biden has been up to.New messages between Hunter Biden and his Chinese-American assistant havejust been published in "The Daily Mail," which all of a sudden is anessential news outlet. Have you noticed?Our own Matt Finn has digested this story and has it for us tonight. Hey,Matt.MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. "The Daily Mail" reportsthere were some unusual messages recovered from Hunter Biden's laptop thatwas supposedly abandoned at that Delaware repair shop.Biden's Chinese-American Secretary, JiaQi Bao, offered Biden anti-Trumptalking points as Biden's father was preparing to run for the White Houseand apparently had in her possession, Biden's dog tag chain necklace thathe was pictured wearing in at least one shirtless photo.The secretary was assigned to Biden in a joint venture he and his uncleestablished with Chinese oil giant, CEFC, that venture went belly up in2018 when businessman Patrick Ho who Hunter Biden reportedly referred to asthe Spy Chief of China was indicted by U.S. officials.In an e-mail from 2018, the secretary suggests Hunter Biden take as muchmoney from that failed venture writing in part, quote: "I'm a bit hesitatedto say this to you because I don't want you to have misunderstood me as amessed up bad girl. Here's my two cents whatever money from Hudson West,please take them as much as possible."The secretary also messaged in 2019, quote: "If there's anyone who deservesto be scrutinized for doing business with Chinese it would be DonaldTrump."What's not clear from "The Daily Mail's" report is whether Biden respondedto any of these e-mails, in fact, the secretary, Tucker complained that hedid not -- Tucker.CARLSON: Amazing story. Matt Finn, thanks so much.In that story, in "The Daily Mail," there's also the claim that thatChinese woman sent oppo to Hunter Biden for the campaign. The journalistwho broke the story joins us Monday with more details.A new episode of "Tucker Carlson Today" came out this afternoon. On Monday,Dave Portnoy joins us on our set.Have a great weekend with the ones you love.Sean Hannity takes over now.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
