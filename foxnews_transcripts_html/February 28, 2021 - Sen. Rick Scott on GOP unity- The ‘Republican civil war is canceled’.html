RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  Chris, it's nice to be back.The CPAC was fun. I got to go there on Friday. I talked about theRepublican civil war is canceled.If you get out of D.C. and talk to people, they are focused on what theBiden administration is doing and what Republican stand for, and that'swhat I'm going to do --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Let me pick up -- let me pick up on that. You said Republicancivil war is now canceled, but let's look at the divide just this weekendabout CPAC.Here are some of the Republican leaders who were -- either weren't invitedor chose not to attend: Vice President Pence, Senate Leader McConnell,Governor Nikki Haley.And listen to this split among House leaders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER:  Do you believe former President Trump should be speaking at CPACthis weekend?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  Yes, he should.REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  I don't believe that he should be playing a rolein the future of the party or the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Senator, that is not a united party.SCOTT:  Well, Chris, if you -- if you look at -- if you look at what's onTV, you'd say, yeah, right, there's a division. But if you get out and talkto voters -- I talked to voters, you know, especially in Florida, you know,almost every day, and they're focused on what the Biden administration isdoing. They do like open borders. They don't like killing the Keystonepipeline. They don't like men-women sporting events.Those are things that bother people and then all the Biden administrationis not going to be good for jobs. So I'm going to make sure that in '22,when we have our elections, next elections, we're going to vote on jobgrowth, we're going to vote on secure borders, we're going to vote onsupporting our law enforcement, school choice.That's why we're going to win. That's how I won make my elections. My --you know, each of my elections was an issue election and that's you win.And that's what we're going to do. It's not going to be about -- WALLACE:  Let me -- SCOTT:  -- what TV is staying about some infighting.WALLACE:  But this isn't just TV, Senator.President Trump is expected to stake his claim as the continuing leader ofthe Republican Party in a speech today. But you have top Republican leaderslike Liz Cheney, like Mitch McConnell, like Mitt Romney who say thepresident forfeited that because of his actions after the Novemberelection.So let me ask you, is this still Donald Trump party?SCOTT:  It's the voters party. I mean, it always has been the voters party.Let's go back to 2010 and my primary. Every Republican I think in thecountry endorsed my opponent and I won.I talked to President Trump about a week ago and I told him, this is myjob. My job is to help Republican senators win all across the country, andhe made a commitment to me to help me do that. I believe he's going to behelpful, but I think other Republicans are going to be helpful.But, Chris, it is your election and when you're running, you've got to doall the things. You've got to talk about the issues important to yourstate. You've got to do your grassroots. You've got to do all these thingsto make sure you win. You've got to get prepared for your debates.That's where we are going to win in '22, we're on the right side of theissues and the Democrats are on the wrong side of the issues.WALLACE:  But -- and we'll get to that, I promise, but you know, let's talkabout Trump and his continuing hold on the party. This is kind of a loyaltyoath for the Trump party.Let me ask you a straightforward question, Senator. Did Joe Biden win thiselection fair and square?SCOTT:  Absolutely. Joe Biden is the president. We went through theconstitutional process. Joe Biden won the election.Now, do -- are there people that believe we've got to focus on making surepeople feel comfortable that elections are fair? Yeah.I've done two bills. We need to have voter ID. You need to provecitizenship. You need to show your Social Security. You can't have, youknow, unmonitored ballot box.You've got to do the things that make all Americans feel comfortable thatwe should have 100 percent participation and zero percent fraud.WALLACE:  I want to pick up on that because there are a number ofRepublican state legislatures which are talking about new votingrestrictions, and I want to ask you about at least one of them. In Georgia,the Republican-controlled House has a bill that would limit early voting,mostly to weekdays from 9:00 to 5:00. It would reduce the number ofabsentee ballot drop boxes and it would restrict early voting on Sundayswhen black churches hold Get Out the Vote events.Do support making it harder for people to vote?SCOTT:  Of course not. We need to have -- we need to create a process thatpeople can get out the vote, but we've also got to create a process wherethere's no fraud.People should not feel that their vote is ever diluted, so should you haveballot boxes that are unmonitored? No. Should you have your vote in byelection night? Yes. Should you keep voting -- keep counting the votes onceyou start seeing -- we get the results quickly? Yes. Should you signaturematch? Yes.There are some basic things we should do, but we should create a processwhere people get to vote, but make sure no vote is ever diluted.WALLACE:  But -- but let's pick up, because this specific -- the one thatstruck in the Georgia bill, you know, I know that a lot of black churcheshold Get Out the Vote events. You go to church, then you go for earlyvoting.If you restrict voting on Sundays, what's -- what reason is that other thantrying to suppress the black vote?SCOTT:  Well, I want people to -- I want people to vote. We have -- we havevoting on Sunday in Florida. You know, I think we ought to have somenational standards of what we expect to make sure we get -- so there's nofraud.You know, it worked in Florida. We have mail-in ballot systems that works.I want these things.I want people to vote. I would -- you know, I tell people what they aregoing to vote for me or not, get out and vote and participate in theprocess.But I don't want people -- I don't want people to feel like their vote waswasted because there was fraud. I mean, come on, unmonitored ballot boxes,no signature match, no voter ID, those things don't make any sense. That'swhat I'm focused on.WALLACE:  Let me talk about another issue that you're going to face, whichis primary battles inside the Republican Party in 2022, which could make itharder, your job, to take back the Senate for the GOP.President Trump has talked openly about endorsing primary candidates at alllevels to run against GOP incumbents. Let me put up a few of those. He'sgoing after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. He just backed a challenger toRepublican Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, who voted to impeach him, and thisone affects you directly for the Senate, he says he'll oppose Senator JohnThune, who is running for reelection.So will you support incumbents running for the Senate or would you supportor Trump challenger to that incumbent in the Senate in 2022?SCOTT:  I am supporting every Republican incumbent in all the Senatereleases. So I believe all of our incumbents are going to win. We have someopen Republican seats, open Democrats seats. I think we're going to get --I trust the voters. I think we're going to get great candidates come out.And look at -- look at Ohio, we have, what, five or six great candidatesthat are -- that looks like they're going to be in. We're going to have agreat primary. I think we'll have great primaries across the country.And once these individuals get to the primary, I'm going to a veryaggressive to make sure we win all these seats and we get back themajority.WALLACE:  Finally, the $1.9 billion -- $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan fromPresident Biden just passed the House. It's headed your way to the Senateand President Biden has taken to asking this question. Take a look,Senator.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  Critics say the plan istoo big. Let me ask them a rhetorical question. What would you have me cut?What would you leave out?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Senate -- Senator, what's your answer? What would you cut?SCOTT:  That's pretty easy, Chris. That's pretty easy. Oh, boy, that'spretty easy.Do we need to pay for bridges? Does it have anything to do with COVID? Dowe need to pay for tunnels for Silicon Valley? Does that pay -- does thatdo anything?I mean, if you look -- if you look at what they're doing -- listen, ifwe're focused on COVID, let's take care of the people of lost their job,let's help our businesses, let's make sure that we have plenty of tests andmake sure we have plenty of vaccines, get out quickly.But this radical left stuff -- first off, giving money to states when theirrevenues have not even gone down and we've already given them $400 billionand we don't even know how much -- how much has not been spent.I mean, we have $27 trillion worth of debt in this country. Let's spend themoney where we need to spend the money but stop wasting money. Interestrates are going up. Inflation is starting to kick in. We're going to hurtthe poorest families in the country if we're not careful.So I want to help people, Republicans want to help people. This is -- thisis just a radical left-wing agenda that they're trying to cram throughbecause they think -- they think they can tie it to COVID.If they like the tunnels so much in California, do a separate bill, see ifit passes. If they like the bridge for Schumer in New York, do a separatebill.WALLACE:  All right.SCOTT:  See if it passes. It wouldn't pass.WALLACE:  Senator Scott, I had a feeling you'd have an answer to thatquestion. Thank you. Thanks for your time this morning and we'll bewatching what President Trump has to say later today. Thank you, sir.SCOTT:  See you, Chris. Have a good day. Bye-bye.WALLACE:  Up next, now it's the turn of Senate Democrats to pass PresidentBiden's COVID relief package. But what will they do about the $15 minimumwage?We'll ask White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki about that and more when wecome right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  President Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill haspassed the House and is now on to the Senate, but there is still plenty ofhurdles there before Vice President Harris can cast the tie-breaking vote.In a moment, we'll speak with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. Butfirst, let's bring in David Spunt, traveling with the president inWilmington, Delaware -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, President Biden is moving fullsteam ahead with his recovery plan, and he's doing it without Republicansupport.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BIDEN:  Now the bill moves to the United States Senate where I hope it willreceive quick action. We have no time to waste.SPUNT (voice-over):  The eyes of anxious Americans are now in 100 senatorspoised to debate, then vote on the president's $1.9 trillion reliefpackage. The White House hoped for bipartisan support, but in a House, itwas nonexistent.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are soembarrassed by all the non-COVID waste in this bill. They are jamming itthrough in the dead of night.SPUNT:  The Democrats bill would increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour,a major progressive priority.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The $7.29 minimum wagethat exists now in many instances an exploitation of the American worker.SPUNT:  But the Senate parliamentarian rolled, including the minimum wagein the relief package would break Senate rules.SEN. BOB CASEY (D-PA):  I think it will pass if it doesn't have it in it,but I'll tell you, that's a big loss for the country.SPUNT:  Senate Democrats are already working on plan B to force largecompanies to pay at least $15 an hour or pay a 5 percent payroll taxpenalty.(END VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  Democrats want the entire plan signed into law beforeMarch 14th. That's when unemployment benefits run out -- Chris.WALLACE:  David Spunt reporting from Wilmington -- David, thanks for that.And joining us now, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.Jen, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday". JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Thank you, Chris. Thanks forhaving me on this morning. WALLACE:  President Biden has taken to asking critics of his COVID reliefbill what would you cut. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office saysthat more than one-third of the total bill, $700 billion, would not bespent this year but would be spent between 2022 and 2031. So how does that qualify as COVID relief? PSAKI:  Well, first, Chris, the focus of the package is getting directchecks to the American people, getting vaccines in the arms of Americans,and ensuring that people who need help at this very difficult time can getit.But people also have to plan. Schools have to plan to reopen. They need todo budgetary planning over the course of years. Businesses need to do thatas well. So this package is meant to, of course, provide immediate, direct relief,but also provide a bridge to help us all get through this crisis. WALLACE:  But let's take one specific area that you just mentioned,schools. The bill would give $170 billion to schools from elementarythrough college, but the CBO projects that 95 percent of that money, again,won't be spent this year, but will be spent from 2022 to 2028.And let me drill down even further, $480 million of the COVID relief bill,according to the CBO, would go to the arts, humanities, museums, libraries.Again, what does that have to do with emergency COVID relief and gettingkids back into schools this year? PSAKI:  Well, first of all, the -- 90 percent of this package goes toaddress the twin crises we're facing right now, Chris, which is getting thepandemic under control and helping the American people go back to work,helping them get the relief they need to get through this period of time. Schools are like businesses, Chris. They need to budgetary plan over aperiod of time. Some have to frontload changes whether it's to theirfacilities or insuring that if they have to hire additional teachers or busdrivers at this point of time -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE:  But we're talking about -- but we're talking about a decade fromnow, Jen. PSAKI:  -- social distancing. Well, they have to plan over the period of time. I'm sure. I don't want my kids to be going to school where they have to fire teachersnext year, or won't have to be able the facilities up -- facility upgradesI should say, necessary, in order  to insure they're going to schoolsafely. That's exactly what is included in this package. WALLACE:  Let me turn to another subject about the bill. Now that theSenate parliamentarian has ruled that the $15 minimum wage does not qualifyunder the budget rules, some Senate Democrats are talking about eitherusing tax incentives or tax penalties to get corporations and smallbusinesses to go there as part of the COVID relief bill. Does the president support that? PSAKI:  Well, I think you're referring to Senator Sanders' proposal, Chris,and we have not yet reviewed that proposal. But the Senate -- the presidentsupports exactly what Senator Sanders does, which is increasing the minimumwage for the American people, for workers who are just trying to make endsmeet, and he thinks that's long overdue. We're going to have to spend the next several days or even weeks figuringwhat the best path forward is, but he's committed to doing that. WALLACE:  You also had a busy week in foreign policy and I want to talkabout that. During the campaign, candidate Biden said that -- he promised to crackdownon Saudi Arabia for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  We're going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, infact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming valueof the -- in the present government in Saudi Arabia. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  And on Friday, U.S. intelligence agencies released this report: We assessed that Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, approvedan operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist,Jamal Khashoggi. Couple of questions, Jen. Does the president still believe as he did backin November of 2019 that the crown prince was personally responsible,personally ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi? And if he does, whydidn't he move to act against MBS personally? PSAKI:  Well, the president believes this was a horrific crime, and what wesaw outlined in the unclassified report released, as you referenced, Chris,is confirmation of the details of this crime, some that we've known forsometime. And president put -- was an advocate for releasing that andabiding by our legal obligations. Let me be very clear, though. We took specific actions on Friday. Ourobjective is to recalibrate our relationship. We've already taken steps todo that, make sure it's not a continuation of the last four years, andprevent the horrific acts that happened to journalist Jamal Khashoggi fromever happening again. That's why we put sanctions through the Treasury Department, on the deputyhead of the intelligence department, why we set -- why we -- under theMagnitsky Act designated the Saudi intelligence forces, why we've takenvery specific steps, Chris, to make sure we're sending a clear message tothe world. And that's what we announced on Friday. WALLACE:  But it isn't a clear message. In 2019, the president in a Democratic debate said that he believed thatMBS, the crown prince, personally ordered the murder of Khashoggi. That'swhat his intelligence report says. I'm asking you now, does he personally believe that MBS ordered theassassination of Khashoggi? And if he does, why not penalize him? Hesanctions a bunch of other people. He doesn't sanction the crown prince.  PSAKI:  Well, first, let me be clear that behind the scenes there are arange of diplomatic conversations that make absolutely clear to the Saudisand to others around the world, that this is going to be a different kindof relationship. And our actions make that absolutely clear as well, Chris.  Historically though, as you all know, you've been covering these issues forsome time, the United States has not historically sanctioned the leaders ofcountries where we have diplomatic relations or even some where we don'thave diplomatic relations. We understand that's a bar some are holding thisto, but our objective here from the government, from the Bidenadministration, is preventing this from ever happening again.  I should also note, we also announced the Khashoggi Rule, which gives powerto the secretary of state to be able to prevent foreigners who have shownthat they are going to threaten dissidents or journalists from traveling ona visa to the United States. This is a global issue and one we're going tobe clear in sending a message about, both privately and publicly, Chris.  WALLACE:  I'm running out of time but I got a couple of questions I reallyneed to ask you.  The president also ordered a military strike in Eastern Syria this weekagainst Iranian-backed militias. Is he sending a message that there is alink between an Iran nuclear deal and Iran's activities in the region, thatthere can't be an agreement, there can't be successful diplomacy at thesame time that Iranian-backed forces are attacking U.S. personnel? PSAKI:  Chris, he's sending an ambiguous message that he is going toprotect our men and women serving and our coalition forces. And that'sexactly what he did with this strike. In terms of the Iranian nuclear deal, we believe that the best path is adiplomatic path forward. We want to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclearweapon. That's in our national interest, that's in the global and nationalinterest. Where that sits now is we're waiting, the Europeans are waitingto hear back from the Iranians on whether they will sit at the table andhave that discussion.  But the strike this week was specifically about responding to threats andattacks that were threatening our troops and our men and women servingoverseas.  WALLACE:  The president -- or rather the Biden administration this weekreopened a migrant facility for children that was used under PresidentTrump and that unleashed a storm of criticism, as you know.  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: This is not OK, never hasbeen OK, never will be OK -- no matter the administration or party. Now, you have distinguished between what you admit you are doing and whatthe Trump administration is doing. I'm asking you a different questionthough. Isn't the Biden administration contributing to this crisis by reversing theTrump policy which called for immediately returning migrant children whocrossed the country -- unaccompanied children who crossed the border bythemselves?  There -- Border Patrol officials are saying that you are creating a surgeand that by May we could see a bigger surge than we saw during the worstmoments of the 2019 crisis on the border.  PSAKI:  Well, Chris, the vast majority of families and adults are turnedaway at the border. This is not the time to come and we have been veryclear about that.But our approach from the Biden administration is that we think the mosthumane step we can take here is to have these children, unaccompanied, kidsunder 18, not send them back to take a treacherous path forward. This is a difficult choice but that's one that we felt was the right one,the most humane one, because these are kids, they're fleeing prosecution,they're fleeing difficult circumstances in their country. And our objectiveis to treat them humanely and to keep them safe. And the reason, I should say, that we opened this facility is because ofCOVID, Chris, as you know. And that's why it's open because we want to keepthese kids safe, including at a time where we're facing a pandemic.  WALLACE:  But aren't you, by changing the facility, aren't you encouragingsome of these young people to come? Which means you're going to have abigger crisis on the border. PSAKI:  Well, Chris, we've been unambiguous and very -- being clear in theregion, this is not the time to come. And this is the difficult choice foreveryone.  But as a mother, as a parent, I'm not going to support, nor was thepresident, sending kids under 18, some at the age of 11, 12, 13, back on atreacherous trip across the border, to face persecution and difficultcircumstances in their country. These kids are coming alone and this is -- this is the choice we've madebecause we feel it's humane and we feel safe. That vast majority of anyfamily that's coming together, any adults that's coming are turned away atthe border --  WALLACE:  Right. PSAKI:  -- because we have not had time to put in place comprehensiveimmigration policies yet at this point in time.WALLACE: Finally, when will the White House pull the nomination of NeeraTanden to be budget director?PSAKI: Well, Chris, we remain committed to fighting our hearts out forNeera Tanden. We believe she is the right person. She's qualified, she'sexperienced, to lead the budget department. She brings unique experience assomebody whose lived through benefiting from a number of these programs andshe's worked on these issues for decades across the aisle. So we're goingto keep fighting for her.We knew that some of these fights would be difficult and this is certainlyone of them. But she's going to have a number of continued engagements thisweek and we are certainly hopeful we can get it across the finish line.WALLACE: Jen, there was lots to talk to about. You guys made a lot of newsthis week.PSAKI: I Know. We tried.WALLACE: Thank you. Thanks for joining us today. Always good to talk withyou.PSAKI: Thanks, Chris. You too.WALLACE: Up next, President Biden takes his first action as commander inchief in Syria and releases that report on the Saudi crown prince. We'lltalk with the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee about the emergingBiden foreign policy, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, the White House releases a report on the murder ofJamal Khashoggi, but doesn't sanction the Saudi crown prince.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY BLINKIN, SECRETARY OF STATE: What we've done by the actions that we'vetaken is really not to rupture the relationship, but to recalibrate it.WALLACE: We'll ask Senator Mark Warner about the president's decision,next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: This week, President Biden was staking outnew U.S. policy in the Middle East, but at the same time, Congress wasstill grappling with a shocking attack on the Capitol last month.Here to discuss it all, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,Senator Mark Warner.Senator, the acting chief of the U.S. Capitol Police said this week thatthey intend to keep up enhanced security at the Capitol at least throughthe president's speech to a joint session of Congress sometime next month.From all the intelligence you see, is there a credible threat of anotherattack against the Capitol?SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA.): Well, Chris, in a public reporting this pastweek, there were indications that some of the insurrectionist groups thatstormed the Capitol on January 6th potentially had a -- have interest inseeing if they can cause more destruction when President Biden gives hisState of the Union. That's coming just from the public reports. So I thinkit is appropriate that we keep that security in place.Listen, I want -- I want there to be a new regime. I'm -- I'm -- I'm thelocal guy. I live in northern Virginia. Capitol Hill is, in a sense, myextended neighborhood. I want those fences to come down as soon as possibleso that the American people can have access to their electedrepresentatives to see the halls of Congress.But I was there January 6th when those insurrectionists were willing totrash our Capitol. And if there is still valid intelligence that thatthreat continues, we've got to get this balance right. It's one of thereasons why I think it's extraordinarily important that my committee, theintelligence committee, not with a backward look, but on a forward-looking,look at these domestic, violent extremists. They're oftentimes ties tosimilar groups in Europe. Oftentimes the fact that they are amplified byRussia. The truth is, as director of the FBI, Chris Wray, has said a numberof times, this is a long-term national security threat to our country.WALLACE: Senator, let's turn to the intelligence community's assessmentreleased this week that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, wasresponsible, that he ordered the assassination of the journalist JamalKhashoggi.What do you think of the Biden administration's decision not to imposesanctions on MBS and, I don't know if you noticed, but in the interview Ijust had with Jen Psaki, she declined to even repeat the president'scontention during the campaign that he believed that MBS had ordered theassassination.WARNER: Well, Chris, first of all, let's step back.You know, Jamal Khashoggi was a journalist. He tried to hold powerfulpeople accountable, and that cost him his life. And I think if we lookback, particularly during the Trump administration, Mr. Trump took hisfirst trip to Saudi Arabia. He said business is open. Matter of fact,Donald Trump even complemented MBS, the Saudi leader, for the kind ofcrackdowns that took place during Donald Trump's tenure.And this is a very messy neighborhood, Saudi Arabia. Its record towarddissidents, towards women have been pretty dreadful for decades. They are akey ally in terms of our challenges against -- against the Iranians.WALLACE: But -- but, sir, I just have to ask you, because we've got limitedtime. Senator, do --WARNER: Let me -- no, let me -- let me finish -- sure, let me finish,though.WALLACE: Well, do you think that the -- that the president should haveimposed sanctions on MBS?WARNER: And -- and the question is this, we -- it was our intelligencecommittee -- it was our intelligence committee that passed the law thatmade this report public. And I think what we've seen out of the Bidenadministration  s they've taken the first step of sanctioning thoseindividuals around MBS. I think they need to keep open additional sanctionsagainst MBS if we don't see a change in behavior.WALLACE: Then, there was the U.S. air strike in eastern Syria this weekagainst Iranian-backed militias. It seemed that in the Biden -- in theObama administration they felt that the nuclear deal was so important thatthey didn't link it to Ian's malign activities in the region.Do you think that as the Biden administration pursues diplomacy, perhapsanother nuclear deal, that that should be linked to what Iran does in theregion and specifically that you can't have diplomacy at the same time thatIran is sponsoring attacks on U.S. personnel?WARNER: Well, I think the Iranians are always going to test a new regime.And when Iranian proxies are putting our troops in Iraq in harm's way,there needs to be punitive actions taken. And I think the Biden missilelaunch was appropriate pushback against the Iranian proxies. There needs tobe a guarantee that we're going to protect our troops. I think you cancreate a dual track where you guard our troops, but also potentially reopenconversations with the Iranians, but they will continue to press anyopportunity they see and I think the Biden action was appropriate pushback.Now, I wish the Biden team would have given Congress greater knowledge andgreater warning. We got a heads up about 15 minutes before the attack tookplace. I think it brings into question a whole new debate around theauthorization of use of military force, something my friend Tim Kaine hasbeen advocating for almost a decade now. We need to have that debate inCongress.WALLACE: Senator -- Senator, I've got a little over a minute left, I need aquick answer here.As we said, the COVID relief bill is coming to the Senate this week. Wereyou concerned at all about the questions I asked Jen Psaki about billionsof dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars that wouldn't be spent foryears, and where are you on the idea of trying to use the tax code to getaround the parliamentary issue and, in effect, either impose tax penaltiesor tax incentives to get companies to raise the minimum wage to $15?WARNER: Actually, some of the things you referenced were investments inmass transit systems that around the country are about 90 percent down interms of user ridership. I don't think we ought to completely destroy masstransit during this nonuse during COVID.In terms of -- in terms of the $15 for corporations penalty, I'd beconcerned there about those corporations then outsourcing that work tosmall enterprises that wouldn't be a penalty. I'm hoping in this package wecan narrow some of the checks to those most in need and potentially putsome broadband investment here. Broadband, I think, is absolutely linked toCOVID.WALLACE: But not using the tax code for the $15.WARNER: Listen, I want to see that proposal. I've seen the written reports.I do -- I do want to make sure that a company would not simply move theirwork from the large corporate enterprise to a smaller enterprise that mightnot fall under that penalty and somehow have the work outsourced in a waythat may not be appropriate.WALLACE: Senator Warner, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Please come back,sir.WARNER: Thank you, Chris.WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the growingcrisis at the southern border and what it means for President Biden'soverhaul of U.S. immigration policy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is not kids being kept incages. This is -- this is kids --QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) --PSAKI: This is a facility that was opened that's going to follow the samestandards as other HHS facilities. It is not a replication. Certainly not.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki defending the Bidenadministration's immigration policies against critics who say he's dealingwith migrant children the same way President Trump did.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Co-founder of "The Federalist," BenDomenech, Susan Page of "USA Today," and former Democratic CongresswomanJane Harman, director of the Wilson Center and author of the new book"Insanity Defense: Why Our Failure to Confront Hard National SecurityProblems Makes us Less Safe."Ben, what do you make of the White House contention that what they'redoing, putting these kids in migrant child facilities, is different fromwhat the Trump administration did, and are they, in effect, as I discussedwith Jen Psaki, are they creating a magnet for these unaccompanied minorsto come over by saying that they can stay in the country?BEN DOMENECH, "THE FEDERALIST" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: They absolutelyare, Chris. And I want to correct something that the White House keepssaying here about just reopening this facility, declaring essentially thatthis is a limited action. They also have opened, you know, a new facilityin Donna (ph), Texas, and they're going to be opening another one in DelRio area because -- within the coming days because of the increases ofnumbers that we're seeing, to levels that traditionally we don't see untillater in the spring.This is a situation where the Biden administration is dismantling the Trumpapproach to the border, and that is having consequences, serving as amagnet, as you've said, for more people to come over and we're only goingto see this crisis continue to grow in the coming weeks and months.WALLACE: Yes, Susan, I want to pick up on that, that there is an impactfrom the Biden decision to reverse the trump policy, which was, if you hadunaccompanied -- this isn't kids that are being separated from families,these are unaccompanied minors, 12 to 18, 19 years old, and it -- wherebefore they would turn them around and send them home, now they're sayingyou can stay. Some would argue that by saying they can stay, more of themare going to come. And, in fact, there's an alarming report this week from"Axios" that border officials now project that 13,000 unaccompanied minorswill cross the border in May, which would be worse than at any point in thecrisis in 2019.SUSAN PAGE, "USA TODAY": So this is a good example of how governing is somuch more different than politicing. So the Biden administration has madeit clear they've got a moral stance when it comes to immigration. But ithas all these real-life consequences. And while Jen Psaki talked about thedifficult choices involved for the Biden administration in making some ofthese calls on immigration, you can imagine the difficult choices thatdesperate parents are making in Central America. And they've got to look atthese policies and say, she says this isn't the right time to come to theborder. Maybe it is the right time to send our unaccompanied minors, ourkids, to the border with the hopes that they get into a facility, get into-- perhaps get vetted, get moved to live with relatives that are in theUnited States.This is not -- this is a problem now. It's going to be -- I agree with Ben,this is going to be a much worse problem in the next couple months,especially as pro-immigration groups in the United States pressure theBiden administration to do even more to implement the policies he talkedabout when he was a candidate.WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the U.S. air strike on those Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria this week.Here was a comment from Defense Secretary General Lloyd Austin. Take alook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LLOYD AUSTIN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We're confident in the target that we wentafter. We know what we did. We're confident that that target was being usedby the same Shia militia that -- that conducted the -- the strikes.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, was this a good move by President Biden,perhaps his first military action at least that we know about as commanderin chief, and what about the argument that as he moves to get back into anuclear deal with Iran, that any progress on diplomacy should be contingenton Iran's actions in the region, and at the very least that they're notattacking U.S. personnel?JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN (D-CA) AND WILSON CENTER DIRECTOR: Well,a couple of points, Chris, and -- and thank you for mentioning my book.I think this was a proportionate response and the right response.What I think was not adequate was the notice to Congress. Mark Warner isright, both the Gang of Eight, which I used to be part of as ranking memberon the Intelligence Committee, and the Foreign Policy Committees ofCongress, Joe Biden would be screaming if you were chairman of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, should have gotten fuller notice. It's alsotrue that Congress should do more to replace those authorizations to usemilitary force enacted right after 9/11 that are completely irrelevant towhat's going on now. We have done 40 military actions in 19 countries usingthe 2001 AUMF, which just applied --WALLACE: Right.HARMAN: Anyway, I think it was the right thing. And on them malign activityof Iran, I never believed that the agreement that was struck by the Obamaadministration prevented us from calling Iran on its malign activity.We're doing the right thing. We should still be talking to Iran. Theyshould expect that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.WALLACE: Right.HARMAN: Hopefully they can too, and they have an election coming up and Ithink this is smart action.WALLACE: Ben, what do you think we learned this week about President Bidenand particularly his foreign policy, both from the air strike on thoseIranian militia in Syria, and also from what he did and didn't do withregard to the Saudi crown prince and the assassination, the brutal murderof Jamal Khashoggi?DOMENECH: Well, t\o circle back to what Susan said, governing is harderthan politicking. And I think that on the -- his reaction to the Khashoggikilling, I think that that's a good example of that.The killing has been used, obviously, to create a big wedge in -- orattempt to create a wedge between this normalization of Arab states withIsrael that we saw under President Trump. I think that's going to continueto be a nagging issue.As it relates to the strike, I think the real question we should be askingis, is this a brushback or is it a prelude to more involvement in theregion? The American people, I think, have largely become convinced that weought to have most of the solutions to those problems solved by the nationsthat are in that region, and at America's foreign policy interests shouldshift to look a little bit more at the rising China and other threatsaround the world that go directly to our national interest.But I think that that's something that we don't really know yet to -- interms of what to expect from this Biden administration and it's a questionthat remains open, I think, after this week's action.WALLACE: You know, Susan, it's so interesting, with Obama, with Trump, nowwe hear with the Biden administration they keep saying we're going to getout of the Middle East and we're going to focus on the Pacific and take onChina. They never seem to be able to get out of the Middle East.PAGE: Yes. Well, you know, it's hard. Foreign policy is tough. I think whatwe've learned this week about Joe Biden and foreign policy is prettypragmatic. I mean I think that's true with the situation with the Saudis,unwilling to blow up our relationship with the Saudis because of thishorrific killing of a journalist working for an American newspaper. That isto the disappointment of some of his supporters, but it's to the relief ofsome in the foreign policy community.WALLACE: Thank you, panel.
