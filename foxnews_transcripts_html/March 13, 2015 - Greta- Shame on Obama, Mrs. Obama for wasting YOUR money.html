'Off the Record,' 3/13/15: The president and first lady took two separate planes to California for separate events on taxpayer money. How unnecessary ... and selfish!

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I am outraged. This is not fair to you nor to any other Americans. It is so selfish.
You won't believe what the President of the United States and first lady did to you. On Thursday, President Obama and first lady flew all the way across the country from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California on two different big planes. You paid for that, two planes, one for each, same day, same location. President Obama took Air Force One, a 747 jumbo jet for Jimmy Kimmel show and Democratic fundraiser. And the first lady took her own big plane, probably a 757, to do Ellen Degeneres' show. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you have any idea how much that cost to fly two jumbo jets across the United States and back? Or how about the impact on the environment? You know, shame on them. Shame on both of them. They are Americans -- there are Americans working hard in this country to pay taxes and this is what the president and first lady do to the American taxpayer? Really? That's so cold. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And don't get me wrong. I want the president and the first lady to travel very well and travel safely. But this, two planes? Selfish. Let me say it again, selfish. It makes me sick. How about you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And one other thing, I'm not sure if other presidents or first ladies did this, but if they did, they were wrong, too. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
