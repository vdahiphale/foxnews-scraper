Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Last night, I asked President Obama for his help, and tonight, I'm asking for your help to correct this injustice. I know you've heard me say this before, but I'm not giving up. It is a gross injustice that our Marine, Sgt. Tahmooressi, who did two tours in Afghanistan for us, is languishing in that Mexican prison.
He's charged with possessing weapons when his entrance into Mexico with those guns was accidental. And with an accidental entrance, you can't legally intend to possess guns unlawfully in Mexico. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm not just talking off the top of my head. We did an old-fashioned investigation. We went to the scene. We checked it out. We drove it ourselves and we have the proof. We have the videotape. And so, now you know it, too. Once that Marine made that left turn, one that most would intuitively think returns him north of San Diego and not south to Mexico, 100 yards later, without any opportunity to turn around, he was in Mexico. Accidentally. That's important. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And once at that checkpoint, Sergeant Tahmooressi volunteered to Mexican authorities he had three guns. Mexican officials didn't search his truck and find the guns. He told them. He wasn't hiding them from them. They did arrest him. And now he languishes in their prison, not knowing what's going to happen or when. But that's where you come in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You actually can help. And we need your help. Call or email your senator or your representative or both, and say, "Help bring back our Marine." Now. Don't bring him back later. We wanna bring him back now.
And you can do more. Tweet it using the #MarineHeldinMexico. You can get the word out really loud, because noise works. Don't leave this Marine behind. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
