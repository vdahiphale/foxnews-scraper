'Off the Record,' 3/30/15: A few hundred people joining ISIS not a big deal? Overblown by the media? Has former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich lost his mind?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Has former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich lost his mind? Listen to what he said Friday night about the number of people trying to join ISIS.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROBERT REICH, FORMER US SECRETARY OF LABOR: I have 600 million Europeans in America, you have 400, 800 trying to join ISIS? This is not a big deal. The press is making it a big deal. The more we talking about it, the more people are going to go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END OF VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A few hundred people joining ISIS are not a big deal? Really? Tell that to the families of those executed in the video, like the video just released yesterday. Eight innocents beheaded, and I might add, led to the be-headers by children.
ISIS is not just recruiting adults, but children, too, teaching them to kill. Bob Reich's comment that the discussion of ISIS recruits is overblown by media, well, here is my message to him: As long as this vicious group is actively recruiting even just one person to do the most awful thing to innocents, I'm going to scream loud and clear. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Reich's answer maybe to downplay it, but it's not mine. I'm going to tell it as it is. No sugarcoating from me. I will spare you the historic references. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
