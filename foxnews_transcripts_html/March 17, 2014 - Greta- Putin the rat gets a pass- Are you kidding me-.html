'Off the Record', 3/17/14: President Obama needs to step it up and slap Putin himself - not members of his inner circle - with real penalties over Crimea

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Are you kidding me? President Obama gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a pass?
He got a pass from President Obama. Putin threatened to annex Crimea and what does President Obama do? He levies sanctions against four Ukrainian officials and seven other Russian officials, but not Putin. Why? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, the Obama administration says it's because Putin is the head of state, and it is highly unusual to sanction a head of state. So, let me get this straight: The main guy - the rat, Putin - he gets a pass. What's up with that? Some weak concept of diplomatic manners? It sure is not strong diplomacy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Putin should have been the first one to get slapped with sanctions and not the last. And ready for this? After President Obama gave him the pass, Putin rolled President Obama again. Because just a few hours ago, he signed the decree recognizing Crimea as a sovereign, independent state. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't know about you, but I think sanctions on Putin's buddies and not on him is meaningless. The Russian deputy prime minister already laughed of President Obama's sanctions, saying he thinks some prankster came up with the list. And why would Putin even care about these sanctions if his cronies can't travel here or use our banks? That means nothing to Putin. It doesn't bother him one lick.
President Obama needs to step it up and put real sanctions on where it hurts - on the guy who matters, the one pulling the strings, Putin. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
