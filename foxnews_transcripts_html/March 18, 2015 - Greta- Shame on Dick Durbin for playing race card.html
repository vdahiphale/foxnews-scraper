'Off the Record,' 3/18/15: Dem senator should be ashamed for playing the race card in holdup over holdup in attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch's confirmation vote. By the way, the Senate should be ashamed for voting on Lynch already

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. And let me step into very deep waters, where it is always dangerous. I'm talking about that very sensitive issue of race.
Racism does exist, and just like other forms of discrimination and bigotry, it is deplorable. But what is also deplorable is when one of our leaders deliberately injects racism into a matter to get people really riled up rather than work for a solution. Tonight, I'm naming names: Senator Dick Durbin, who said this on the Senate floor while accusing Republicans of holding up a senate vote, an attorney general nominating Loretta Lynch's confirmation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SENATOR DICK DURBIN, SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman nominated to be attorney general, is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the senate calendar. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
That "back of the bus" comment is blatant. Senator Durbin is deliberately trying to stir up problems casting this with push racial overtones. He knows exactly what he is doing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so does everyone else. Shame on him. And by the way, shame on the United States Senate. Lynch should have had her confirmation vote already. So do it tomorrow - yes or no, but do it. And that is my "Off the Record" comment.  </pre>
