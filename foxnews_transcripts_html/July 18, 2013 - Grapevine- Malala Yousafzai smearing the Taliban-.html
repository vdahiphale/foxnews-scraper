A Message from the Taliban
The Taliban wants a Pakistani teenager who was shot by militants to come home and mend her ways. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
16-year-old Malala Yousafzai was welcomed as a hero at the U.N. on Friday. She was shot in the face last October, after campaigning for the rights of girls to go to school. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Taliban sent an open letter, written by senior commander Adnan Rasheed, accusing the girl of smearing the Taliban and urging her to return to Pakistan. Quote: "It is amazing that you are shouting for education, pretending that you were shot due to education, although this is not the reason. Your propaganda was the issue. What you are doing now, you are using your tongue on the behest of the others." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

The cover of Rolling Stone is a place normally reserved for rock stars and celebrities at the very top of their field. But tonight the magazine is taking heat for making Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev its latest cover boy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The cover is being compared to one of rock icon Jim Morrison. It is headlined: "The Bomber. How a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster."
Critics say the magazine is glorifying terrorism and sending the wrong message. Quote: "If they want to become famous, kill somebody" says criminologist Jack Levin. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Within hours, "Boycott Rolling Stone" was trending in Boston. One tweet: "Hey Rolling Stone, you could have honored any victim of the Bombing with your cover. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CVS and Walgreens both announced this afternoon that they will not sell the magazine. Rolling Stone released a statement standing by its cover.

You might be interested to know where a bunch of brand new TVs are going on your dime: to Gitmo. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Pentagon is spending more than $80,000 on TVs for the Guantanamo Bay detention center, where terror suspects are held. The Pentagon has not gotten back to us on why exactly the TVs were ordered, but it says they are not going to the detainees.
As we've reported in the past, suspected terrorists housed at Gitmo enjoy a wide array of movie selections, including the "Harry Potter" series.  </pre>
