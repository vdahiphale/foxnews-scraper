'Off the Record,' 8/6/15: 70th anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima reminds us all that we're not electing a homecoming king or queen. The President of the United States must make the toughest of decisions. #GOPDebate

Let's go "Off the Record." Before we go, and as we await tonight's second GOP debate, take another look at this. Yes, the White House. Isn't it gorgeous? Now, that's what each of the candidates, Republican and Democrat, wants to win in November 2016.
Now, I'm not going to tell you who to vote for; that's your business. But I do want to remind all of us, including myself, that the presidential race is not a popularity contest. We're not looking for a homecoming king or queen. We want a president. And what we should each ask ourselves is this: What candidate has the best judgment? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Being president is not easy. Presidents make many very tough decisions - decisions that one doesn't know is wise until long after they have been executed, And sometimes it can be years before we know if it was the right decision or not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, imagine what it was like for President Harry Truman. He lived in that house. He had to make what may have been the toughest decision ever for any president, 70 years ago today. August 6th, 1945, this happened on his order: An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, killing at least 140,000 people, but ending World War II. Imagine having to make a call like that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, judgment. Who has the best judgment to be our next president? We report, you decide, right? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
