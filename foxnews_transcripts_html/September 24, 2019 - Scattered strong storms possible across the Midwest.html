Just to the southeast of Puerto Rico, Karen weakened to a tropical depression yesterday, but is back to being a 40 mph tropical storm this morning. Karen remains fairly disorganized and is forecast to remain relatively weak as it moves through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today. Wind gusts to 40mph are possible, but of greater concern will be flash flooding and mudslides, especially across Puerto Rico.
