GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Jesse Watters,Dagen McDowell, Geraldo Rivera, and a candy cane is her walking stick, DanaPerino, THE FIVE. It's a long way from the Alamo, but an LA restaurantowner, Angela Marston, called out her city's mayor for shutting down heroutdoor business while allowing a Hollywood movie crew to set up a similardining area just yards away.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  I'm losing everything. Everything I own is being taken away fromme, and they set up a movie company right next to my outdoor patio. Theyhave not given us money, and they have shut us down. We cannot survive. Mystaff cannot survive. Tell me that this is dangerous. But right next to meis a slap in my face. This is safe, 50 feet away?Mayor Garcetti and Gavin Newsom is responsible for every single person thatdoesn't have an employment, that does not have a job, and all thebusinesses that are going under. And we need your help. We need somebody todo something about this.GUTFELD (on camera):  Now, if she were a famous actress, she'd be working.She's not, so LA's nannies closed her down. Eric Garcetti says his heartgoes out to her, but not on a plate because, you know, restrictions arenecessary, unless you're a Hollywood film crew. Because in the land ofDems, only the rich and powerful thrive. The little people get crushed.You just know Hollywood will thank Garcetti, maybe with a star on the poopencrusted sidewalk. And that's why you get into politics or entertainment.When bad stuff happens, you're always first in line for relief orexemption. On Saturday Night Live, Pete Davidson said this about the StatenIsland protesters.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  The rule is that they are supposed to let people eat or drinkoutside, and the owner said no one wants to do that because they'll go outof business. But the argument that people in Staten Island don't want todrink outside can be disproven by going to literally any little leaguegame.UNKNOWN:  They are making us look like babies.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Now, he said all that before a live studio audience,so he's doing exactly what those protesters wanted to do, work. So how didPete get around those restrictions to mock those who couldn't? SNL paidaudience members 150 bucks a head to show up, making them hired extras. Ifonly a restaurant could do that, they can't.Meanwhile, the butt of many elitist jokes, Guy Fieri, is doing more, thatany city leader to help out. The restaurateur launched a relief fund,raising21 million bucks for 43,000 workers. I await a response from thoserestaurant critics who love piling on the cheesy mayor of flavor time. Butnone of those hacks could help anyone with a real job.So as one mayor destroys small businesses while playing favorites to therich and famous, a foodie helps the little guy, or rather thousands ofthem. Hollywood should make a movie about that, they won't. So I want toplay this sound on tape from Admiral Giroir, he's the testing czar talkingabout the data and outdoor dining.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) UNKNOWN:  And what really breaks my heart is that I don't know of any datathat says you need to shut down outdoor dining or outdoor bars. We reallywanted to limit the indoor crowded places. So I think we need to do what'snecessary to turn the pandemic, but not more. That's not evidence-based.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  So Dagen, why do politicians adhere to this idea ifthere's no data behind it? Does data not matter?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  They don't have the data. The contacttracing is for crap, and they are ignorant and arrogant and incompetent andwon't admit that to the people they govern. And these business owners,these restaurant owners, they built these dreams just based on hard workand grit and and determination, and that hard work, grit, and determinationcan't save them from the hands of these politicians.I -- you know -- politicians have always said, oh, small businesses are theheart and soul of America. Well, they don't have hearts and souls. So howin the hell do they even know what they are talking about. I was raised thechild of small business owners. My parents ran a small wholesale grocery inthe south, in the rural south.And they always knew because of their size that politicians didn't give acold damn in hell about them because they weren't lining their pockets. Sothe big dot ginormous and the small, as you said, got trampled on. Mymother knew that it took other small businesses to try to save their own.And that's what -- right before she died, she said this.I wish I was rich so I could give it all away. And anybody who has a jobwho hasn't missed a paycheck, that's exactly what we are all doing.Meantime, these politicians need to get their asses fired.GUTFELD:  You know, Dana, getting -- that's a pretty great idea, 150 bucks,I had to guy watch a show. And -- because you get around all theregulations by hiring them as extras, pretty sneaky.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, imagine if the bar in Staten Island hadenough cash on hand to pay its customers to come into the bar, then I guessthey could also get around the restrictions somehow? I imagine. The -- it'sinteresting. Admiral Giroir says his heart is breaking. Angela Marston'sheart is obviously broken, and nine million people have watched that onYouTube. Eric Garcetti that says his heart is broken.Everyone has broken hearts, Americans. You can do something about it. Iknow we'll talk a little bit later about how help could come from thegovernment. But I do feel like something is happening, Greg. This pandemicis exposing government to a whole generation of young entrepreneurs whowill -- maybe they have, again, big hearts.But they will realize that a conservative viewpoint on smaller governmentis the way to preserve liberty and their ability to make a living.GUTFELD:  Yeah. You know, Geraldo, it is kind of weird to see politiciansdeciding who are nonessential workers. There is a certain irony to that.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST:  You know, I totally agree with Dana aboutthe need to rethink government's role, Greg. But you have to understand, Ihave two grandchildren in Los Angeles County. They had 25,000 cases inCalifornia yesterday alone, 9,000 in LA County. And Garcetti, and this isthe land of the fires and the earthquake, said that this, the COVID thingis the greatest threat to life in Los Angeles that we have ever faced.I think that, you know, you've got this vaccine coming down the road. Ifeel for these people. My dad owned a coffee shop and a diner that wentbroke, you know, right in Brian Kilmeade's neighborhood out in Long Island.I get it. I understand. My heart breaks for Angela. She's one of the mostarticulate spokespeople against the clumsiness of big government, and thelogic of it at times.But we have to understand there's a desperation here. These guys, these menand women that are elected, they want to save lives. We have never facedthis, not since 1918, have we faced something where you've got people dyingleft and right. Every 30 seconds, an American dies. You've got to givethese people a little slack here.Yes, they are intruding on libertarian values, and it's bad that SaturdayNight Live is mocking them, but give me a break here.GUTFELD:  I don't think -- Jesse, my issue is that they are being mocked bypeople who have no skin in the game. We can criticize all the restaurantowners or anybody who's losing their jobs, because we get to sit here andwe get to talk about it. We get a paycheck. Pete Davidson gets a paycheck.His company paid for his audience.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah. I mean, isn't that how people get paidto go to your show, Gutfeld?(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  Isn't that how you got around it? Anyway, no, I agree -- no, Iagree with both of you and Geraldo. If Saturday Night Live had been shutdown, which I think Donald Trump would have loved, but let's just say theywere shut down permanently and Pete Davidson was just starting out. He hadto scrape by, had no salary, and was forced to go underground to do hislittle skits in front of small crowds so he can make ends meet.And then was arrested and thrown in prison for just being funny, I would'vehad his back. You would've had his back. Staten Island would've had hisback. But the same thing is happening to pub owners, and he doesn't havetheir back. And to Geraldo's point, Geraldo, you can protect the sick, butyou also have to protect the healthy.And right now, you're having politicians basically create a COVID castesystem, where some people are treated like peasants and the rest aretreated like royalty. So if you're an actor, you can eat outside. But ifyou're not an actor, you can't eat outside. I mean, you can bust down abusiness' door but you can't open the door?Black Lives Matter can protest but Trump people can't? And to say thatyou're doing it to save lives, how many lives are there actually savingwith these restrictions. Seven out of the top 10 states in the UnitedStates with the highest death toll are run by Democrats. So California hasdone multiple shutdowns, multiple mask mandates, and they are going way up.So if you're going to shut people down, at least pay them the cash. Nancyis holding back the purse strings. They are playing with, what, a trillionfive? With that kind of money, you could pay each restaurant owner $10,000a month just to close doors and do take-out. But instead, they are sayingno, no, no, you're going to shut down. We're not going to pay you, and thenyou have to watch an overpaid actor eat a burrito right across the streetfrom your shut down restaurant.Meanwhile, Omar's husband, Omar's husband, just got over half a milliondollars in bailout relief, and he doesn't run a restaurant. He runs apolitical consulting firm during an election year. And he actually appliedand got the money, but they can't get the money at a restaurant.PERINO:  Wow, I didn't know that.GUTFELD:  Yeah, that just came out. That will be on tomorrow, I bet. Comingup, the return of the MAGA rally. President Trump with a big warning toGeorgia about socialism.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO:  Battle for control of the Senate getting a boost from the highestoffice in the land. President Trump in Georgia over the weekend holding arally for two Republican senators facing runoff elections next month. Thepresident warning voters about what could happen if Democrats win.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Very simply, you will decidewhether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether theywill grow up in a free country. And I will tell you this, socialist is justthe beginning for these people. These people want to go further thansocialism. They want to go into a communistic form of government. You mustgo vote and vote early, starting December 14th. You have to do it.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  Meanwhile, Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler facingoff with her Democratic challenger, Raphael Warnock, in a tense debate,Loeffler pressing Warnock on socialism. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  In your writings and your teachings, you have repeatedly praisedMarxism and the redistribution of income. Can you here and now for allGeorgians renounce socialism and Marxism?UNKNOWN:  Listen, I believe in our free enterprise system, and my dad was asmall business owner.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  Jesse Watters, your biggest takeaway from the debatelast night?WATTERS:  Well, I watched your coverage of the debate, Dana. I didn't seethe actual debate, so I'm going to have to take a pass on that. But I mean,he dodged a pretty -- a layup. Just say, yeah, I'm not a socialist. Let'smove on. But I did watch the rally in Georgia on Saturday night, which issheriff told had 25,000 people in attendance to hear Donald Trump give aringing endorsement to Loeffler and Purdue.And by  the way, I've been pronouncing her name wrong for a month. It'sLoeffler, not Loeffler. No one even told me. Yet, I pronounce KamalaHarris' name wrong once, and I'm called a bigot. Go figure. The presidentdid have a very clear message, though. He said we won Georgia. Theycheated, but -- they're going to cheat again and we are going win it again,because all eyes are going to be on Georgia this.They're not going to be able to get away with it. And I want to point totwo things that the media has said that they've debunked. Remember that bigwater main break in Fulton County when they said this big pipe burst andthey had to shut everything down? Well, they investigated it, and you knowwhat it was? No pipe burst. One men's urinal overflowed in the bathroom.That's all it was. And you know how they said, like, they were pulling outof all these ballots from under a table? They said they've debunked thatbecause they weren't pulling them out in a suitcase. It was something thatlooked like a suitcase. Meanwhile, they still counted all of these ballotsafter sending all of these poll watchers and members of the media home.And Biden put on a substantial number into his lead. So -- and the sameguy, Dana, the same guy that made up a lie about the burst pipe, was thesame guy that sent the media home before they pulled out the ballots fromunder the table. The guy's name is Ralph Jones, partisan Democrat.PERINO:  All right, all right. Geraldo, I don't know. Do you want to talkabout the debate, the rally, the busted urinal? (CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  I think that Jesse has covered the conspiracy theories quite wellthere.WATTERS:  That's not a conspiracy theory.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  That was from the law enforcement operation in Georgia. Thatwasn't from me.RIVERA:  And it has no absolutely chance of affecting the election of thepresident of the United States. Both of the candidates, Loeffler andWarnock, were impressive. She clearly is more than just a pretty face. Iliked her. I liked them both. And I think it's going to be a very closeelection. But the focus of our attention on Georgia, for one day at least,has to shift to Washington, D.C., why?Tomorrow morning, at 9:00, the parties must present papers to the SupremeCourt of the United States on an appeal as to whether the Supreme Court ofPennsylvania was right to dismiss the lawsuit that challenged the mail-inballots. I've been saying from the very beginning that only a misdeed thatwas systemic.That was categoric that could affect the whole category of a vote like themail-in ballots could affect the election. Tomorrow, the Supreme Court onthe very last day, remember, that's the day, tomorrow, the 8th of Decemberis when the states have to sort out all of the election stuff and pass itonto the electors who vote next Monday.But as of right now, the Supreme Court of the United States will read allthe papers. They have a few hours to decide. It really -- this is the onlylawsuit or legislative action on anything that has the possibility, remotethough it is, of affecting the election of the 46th president. And I thinkthat not enough attention is being paid to this case.The Supreme Court, Alito has taken the case. So tomorrow morning is goingto be a lot of action, Dana.PERINO:  Yup. Justice Alito on the case there. So of course, we will payattention to that in the morning. Greg, I was thinking, do you think it'sgood that Hollywood is so focused on the Georgia race? Like, do you thinkit helps the Democrats that they are trying to nationalize it so much? AndI don't know if you saw that even had a Veep reunion to try to raise money.And I think they're not -- they're actually helping the Republicans makethe case that Ossoff and Warnock are really too far left with that state.GUTFELD:  I hope that you're right about that, but I don't know. You know,I mean, they understand how important this election is. If the Democratswin the Senate, they are in total control, all the seats of power, right?And they also have an amplified propaganda arm in the media. So theyactually have everything.But what's an interesting contrast, it's the exact opposite of 2016 to2020. Why did we learn so much? And you said this earlier in A block, whydid we learn so much about government and the media and the politics andhow it all comes together as some sort of weird game. It's because Trumpwas not being controlled by the propaganda arm and allowed us to witnessthings that we hadn't seen before. It was essentially the most transparentperiod in history.So what we experienced was a four year red pill. And now, what you'rewatching, especially with the media, it's turning into a four year ambien.The media is now taking the pill. They are going to sleep. And we are nolonger going to be able to experience the things that we experiencedbefore, and that is why it is so important.I mean, true rebels, true radicals don't want this to happen because weneed to see the transparency. We need to see that -- we need the red pillto continue.PERINO:  That's an interesting point. I actually like it so much.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  -- about what to ask Dagen. No, it's a great point.GUTFELD:  She basically said you're nuts.PERINO:  No, no, no, no, no, I don't mean that. Dagen, let me just give youthe last word since I got off track.MCDOWELL:  A lot of the criticism of Kelly -- of Senator Kelly Loefflerthat I was seeing from the left, from people in the media, was about herfaith and her appearance. And then they were passing around photos of herhome. When all you've got is criticism of the way that this woman looks,you have nothing. You have nada. You have bupkis. They have nothing on her.PERINO:  Well, and she went into the debate wanting to make sure thatRaphael Warnock was labeled a radical liberal, and she did that that.MCDOWELL:  She called him that --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL:  She called him that 14 times, 14 times. I counted.PERINO:  All right. Coming up, caught in plain politics, critics call outNancy Pelosi for suddenly changing course on a desperately needed COVIDstimulus bill.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS:  Nancy Pelosi admitting she was playing politics, while millionsof Americans are out of work and businesses across the country are on thebrink of collapse. After a month of stalling negotiations, Pelosi finallyready to accept a smaller Coronavirus bill, all because Joe Biden is headedfor the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  -- on board with this piece (Inaudible).NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS:  Perhaps youmissed what I said earlier. Joe Biden committed to ending and crushing thevirus. What was then before was not more of this. This is -- hassimplicity. It's what we've had in our bills. It's for a shorter period oftime, but that's OK now because we have a new president.(END VIDEO TAPE)WATTERS (on camera):  Dana, did she just admit that she held up trillionsof stimulus for hardworking, suffering Americans for politics?PERINO:  Sounds like it to me, and it's so upsetting. You know, it's goingto take at least, like, four weeks from when they pass a COVID relief billfor the Treasury to get payments out to people. So you're talking aboutneedless suffering over the holidays for people that are in this positionthrough no fault of their own.And our government has completely left them down. And what she's -- notonly just admitting that she held it up for Joe Biden. But if I was amoderate Democrat that just lost my seat to all of these Republicans thatcrushed them, I would be so mad. Because if you remember, Jesse, one of thethings I kept saying is the moderate Democrats are saying we need thisrelief bill.We need it to not just a campaign on, but our constituents needed. Shecouldn't deliver it, so she was willing to sacrifice all of those Houseseats so that now they have a very slim majority in the House. And theRepublicans will likely take over in 2022 all because she wanted to helpJoe Biden win the White House. I mean, it's quite stunning. And I'msurprised that there are so many Democrats are comfortable with hercontinuing to be speaker after this.WATTERS: Yet they call her, Greg, a masterful politician over and overagain.GUTFELD: Yes. I thought that was gelato on our hands, but it looks likeit's blood. Remember, Trump shut the economy down swiftly without anyhesitation -- people forget about this -- knowing that it could destroy hislegacy. He did help create the probably historically one of the greatesteconomies ever. But he was willing to risk it rather than let people die.If Pelosi was president, up for reelection, do you think she would havedone that? Hell no. She would have like, let them eat gelato.Hey, I want to read this thing I got from Facebook. This is a great ideafrom a guy named Chip Weber for the restaurants. Restaurants should file anLLC. It's quick and easy paperwork for a production company. Have somecameras, like a phone on tripods, and film a documentary about therestaurant business or a pilot reality show in a restaurant, and then havethe public sign releases, and then you could have your outdoor dining. Verysmart, Chip.WATTERS: There you go. Just call it a photoshoot. Some of the best ideascome from Facebook. Dagen, what do you think about Nancy Pelosi? One of thereasons she gets away with stuff like this --PERINO: That will be played over and over.WATTERS: Right. One of the reason Nancy, you know, gets away with thingslike this is because there's no pressure from the media. If a Republicandid this -- and sometimes they wish we had a Republican politician as cold-hearted and is calculating as Nancy Pelosi, but alas, I can only dream.MCDOWELL: Well, she sacrificed her own members of the Democratic Party justso she wouldn't give President Trump a win. She's standing atop thesuffering and misery of not just all of the American people but herconstituents. So, she's plumbing new depths of loathsomeness in all ofthis.She actually said no to a $1.9 trillion offer from the White House. So,what she's accepting now is $1 trillion less than that. And all along, itwas about hundreds of billions of dollars in unspent money from the rescuein the spring that all she had to do was step up and reallocate. She didn'tdo that because she was trying to hand Trump a loss.I said this months ago that nothing was better than something for NancyPelosi. I have a lot of ideas about where she can stick that finger ofhers, but I will stifle.WATTERS: All right, Geraldo, did she pay a price ever for tactics.RIVERA: That's a relief. She's already paid the price, Jesse, in terms ofthe Democrats losing House seats. But I mean, from Russia-Russia, to thefake impeachment, to visit me in China Town, you know, she turned down asDagon says $1.8 trillion. She's taking less than half of what Mnuchin, theTreasury Secretary was offering her because she's dopey and prideful andcounterproductive.And I know my wife Erica is going to get mad at me for saying that, butshe's a lousy politician. She's a dictator within that party. But you know,people are seeing through it now. There's no stimulus checks involved inthe $908 billion. No one is going to get $1,200. No one's going to get the$500 per kid. These stimulus checks are going to -- businesses might behealthy, Angela with the restaurant, but this is -- this is malfeasance onan epic scale.WATTERS: All right, Geraldo will try to go for the rest of the show withouthis wife being mad at him now. Up next, the media's love affair with JoeBiden reaches new heights. Why one pundit says America is really lucky tohave him.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: The media's double standard on graphic display of the presscontinuing to heap praise on Joe Biden while constantly slamming DonaldTrump. Why? Because Biden is just so hard to hate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THOMAS FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK TIMES: We are really lucky, I think,to have a president who's just really hard to hate at a time when ourpolitics is so infused with hate. And that's one of the things that I thinkis going to do him and the country well, I hope, in the coming months.(END VIDEO CLIP)RIVERA: I'll have something to say about Tom Friedman there in just asecond. Meanwhile, an MSNBC anchor praising Biden for stonewalling aquestion. Kasie Hunt tweeting, "Joe Biden wouldn't say if he's talked toMitch McConnell. I'm just struck by the reality that will now have apresident who, as a rule, does not lie, even when it might be easier."But as badly as the press treated President Trump, one reporter,Univision's Jorge Ramos, says the media was not hostile enough to thepresident. He wrote in an op-ed, "We journalists should have been tougheron Mr. Trump, questioning his every lie and insult. We should not have lethim get away with his racism and xenophobia."You know, I didn't like Dana, the comments the President made at the verybeginning of his -- of his campaign about Mexicans being rapists and soforth. But I think Jorge has to admit, the President has apparently healedthe wound with the Latino community. Look at the vote that turned out inFlorida and in Texas, including along the Mexican border, Dana.PERINO: Yes. What would you rather have, nice coverage on Univision oractual votes from more Latino voters? I'll take the votes. I think that'sprobably not too hard to figure out. I also think that the media is goingto be quite sad if President Trump is not ever on the front page of thenewspaper.I noted today that there are two new books that were announced today thatwill be written about President Trump's final year in office. They aregoing to be written by members of the media. And I'm all for people writingbooks, but I think it's pretty obvious that he has been great for material,for their business, except that their treatment of Trump I think has doneterrible harm to the institution of journalism.RIVERA: I think you're right. Tom Friedman, Greg, is a great example. Youknow, here he is brown-nosing Joe Biden. I used to love Tom Friedman. Ithought he is the most eloquent centrist there is. And then look what hedid with Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He becamehis cheerleader, even in the face of the death of Jamal Khashoggi and someof the other things that Saudis have done with their, you know, theirmadrasas, funding madrasas all around the globe, funding Sunni Arabterrorism around the globe. You know, they do have a grotesque doublestandard it seems to make, Greg.GUTFELD: It's why I only watch Univision. Look, this love affair with Biden-- this love affair with Biden is starting way too soon. The media issuffering from premature infatuation. It's going to run out. Look, this isall about -- this is all about Joe being a nice guy as if that's somehow asign of competence.But I don't want a nice guy as a lawyer. I don't want a nice guy Doctor. Idon't want a nice guy agent. I don't want a nice guy president. Trump wasAmerica's agent defending us in the world court. And the media's complaintwas that the world court found him so unseemly. That is the point, youidiots. You don't want the world court to fall in love with your lawyer oryour agent. You want the world court to be scared of your agent, to bescared of your lawyer.You know, he wasn't there to kick -- kiss ass, he was there to kick ass.And that is why -- oh, I'm so glad we have a nice person. You are sopathetic, so pathetic.RIVERA: Jesse, in that --GUTFELD: Univision.RIVERA: -- saying that Joe Biden is hard to hate, does that mean that they-- that Donald Trump was easy to hate?WATTERS: Yes. Friedman just admitted that the media hated Donald Trump. Imean, they're not supposed to say that or feel that. They're supposed tocall balls and strikes. That's like a surgeon saying, oh, phew, thank God,that guy just died on the operating table. I hated him. I can't wait tooperate on the next guy. That guy is awesome.And then you have the other so-called journalists happy that Joe Bidendodged the question. And that's your only job is to get answers andcommunicate that to the public. I mean, that's like a guy who asks a girl,do you love me? And the girl says, I can't say anything about that andbeing happy that at least she didn't lie to me. No. Greg just hit on it.And Dana said what was an interesting point earlier. The media didn't hateDonald Trump because he lied. They hated Donald Trump because he told thetruth. The media is not equipped to deal with brutal honesty. They'reequipped to create these narratives in the dark through whispers andanonymous sources and create their own narrative.Donald Trump's narrative was too powerful. And that narrative was Americafirst, and the press is the enemy of the people because they lie andsuppress the real news. Now they love covering Joe Biden because Joe Bidenis not transparent, and he doesn't tell them what he's doing because hedoesn't even know what he's doing. As long as he's nice to them. That's allthey care about.RIVERA: And yet, Dagen, he will -- Dagen, he'll live in a cocoon, won't he?He'll live in a cocoon, Joe Biden. He'll be impervious to those of us inthe press.MCDOWELL: Yes, because he's too fragile to go out -- go outside. We've seenthat. I think the media actually is dreading the Joe Biden presidencybecause one, they're actually going to have to work. And I think deep down,they're lazy. And two, they can't be their miserable selves.For four years, they got to sit back and just be sour on the inside andsour on the outside, and they didn't have to do any policy analysiswhatsoever. So, I'm excited to watch their utter exhaustion and having towell, be friendly and nice and say nice things even if it's about JoeBiden.RIVERA: Yes. Coming up next, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo indulges insome serious ethnic stereotyping for himself and Dr. Fauci. The actors he'snow comparing them to after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCDOWELL: While business owners are pleading with their elected officialsfor relief, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo cracking jokes with Dr. AnthonyFauci about starring in an ad on the vaccine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Put us together, we're like the modern-day DeNiro and Pacino. You can be whichever you want. You can be the De Niro orPacino. Fauci and Cuomo. I'll give you a -- who do you want to be, De Niroor Pacino? Which one do you want to be?ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: I love them both. I love them both. I don't want to insult one orthe other. I don't want to hurt the feelings of the other.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Greg, take it.GUTFELD: Well, you know, in a weird way, he is like the Godfather. He gavea few 1,000 people in restaurants and offer they couldn't refuse. But youknow, it's just weird -- it's this cozy --RIVERA: That's nasty.GUTFELD: It is nasty. Because it's nasty because it's true. But it's justcozy, moronic, backslapping that makes you want to puke through youreyeballs. And again, it's something you're going to miss about Trumpbecause Trump could never do this because you -- no one ever felt like theycould pal around with Trump, right?It was this -- none of this backslapping stuff, you know, and it's --instead, we're going to get more of this, you know. I'll stop.MCDOWELL: Well, Geraldo, to Greg's point, see De Niro kill people in make-believe, on film, but Andy Cuomo actually kills people in real life andthat's a fact.RIVERA: I don't -- I don't want to go there right now. I just want to saythat I want to be Andy Garcia. He's in godfather three. Cuban born, soyou'll get the Latino thing in there. And other, quickly, Governor MarioCuomo, Andrew's father --GUTFELD: Univision.RIVERA: -- really detested ethnic stereotyping. He hated the Godfatherreferences at least insofar as he made note to me, Governor Mario Cuomo,Andrew's father.MCDOWELL: Well, Dana, what do you make of this yacking it up? Becauseagain, you know, De Niro and Pacino are kind of two bloated husbands andwell, I don't know if Andy Cuomo wants to take his cue from that.PERINO: I mean, who would have thought that getting an Emmy would have goneto his head? But that was kind of surprising, of course. I also think thatit might be more like they're like Pacino and De Niro in heat, OK. Now, Igot this from a friend. It's pretty good. It's like De Niro plays a crookwho gets a bunch of people killed because he had a bad plan. And Pacino isa short Italian guy trying to stop people from dying.GUTFELD: Very good.MCDOWELL: That is very good, Dana. Jesse?PERINO: Thank you.WATTERS: Well, I never got the memo that ethnic humor was funny again, soI'm going to go hit the streets.

Andhe's like, I've never seen anything like this.But what happens is if we can get to it, the tiger shark -- they get theturtle away from the tiger shark and they pull the turtle out of the waterand they take it to another area and release it. So, the turtle at leastseemed to survive.PERINO: Well, then, what if there's --GUTFELD: How did he know it was eating him? How did he know it was eatinghim?MCDOWELL: Well, they could have been --GUTFELD: It could have been some weird, kinky thing.MCDOWELL: Yes. Of course, it is.GUTFELD: We don't know.
