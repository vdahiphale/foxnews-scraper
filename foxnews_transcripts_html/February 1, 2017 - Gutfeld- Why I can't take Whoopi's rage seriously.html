              <h1>Gutfeld: Why I can't take Whoopi's rage seriously</h1>
              <h2>'The View' co-host compares Trump to the Taliban</h2>
              <pre> 
Yesterday on "The View," otherwise known as Hell's DMV, Whoopi Goldberg asked how much different are the values of Trump administration from the Taliban? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

WHOOPI GOLDBERG, "THE VIEW": We have a leader who has repeatedly demeaned women, wants to defund organizations that benefit women, calling on the media to shut up, specifically wants to give preferential treatment based on religion. Are these values really much different than the Taliban's? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you're saying to the media, "Shut up," that's what they do. Maybe they didn't start out chopping people's heads off. Maybe they started out differently. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's tricky, because we're saying to people, "Here are our American values." And then we're saying at the same token, stuff that sounds exactly like the stuff we're fighting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Wow. Talk about groundbreaking, to actually hear a celebrity say something mean about the Taliban. How dare they compare them to Trump? The Taliban should sue. Guess they ran out of Hitler analogies. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So as they bash the president, I'm reminded how entertainers rarely express any rage over any strand of misogynist Islamism. If they did, we might take their rage toward Trump seriously.
A reminder: The Taliban throw acid in girls' faces for going to school. Yes, I guess that's like defunding Planned Parenthood. Radical Islam is all for killing gays and I guess that's the same as making some rude jokes? Note: Trump's past rudeness is a product of a rude culture, one fed and fattened by a coarse entertainment industry, Whoopi. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Anyway, the immigration pause is meant to separate homicidal maniacs from innocent Muslims. Equating the butchers with those bent on stopping them is pure mindless relativism, i.e. "The View's" bread and butter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But perhaps the greatest result from Trump's executive order: Liberal website Vox suggests canceling the Oscars. Canceling the Oscars as a protest. If Trump's executive order succeeds in killing three hours of sanctimonious bed-wetting grandstanding then let's call it right now. Clear out space on Mount Rushmore, because Donald Trump may be the greatest president we've ever had.  </pre>
