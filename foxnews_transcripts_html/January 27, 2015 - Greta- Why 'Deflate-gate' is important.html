'Off the Record,' 1/27/15: The NFL might suffer another black eye to its tarnished image, depending on how it handles the New England Patriots alleged cheating scandal #DeflateGate

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

So, let's go "Off the Record." Now, I was gone last week. So I missed the breaking news of "Deflate-gate." By the time I got back, there was criticism that it was a non-story. Now, if you think that, you and I have to agree to disagree. I think it's an important story.
I don't know about you, but I like to look up to professional athletes. It takes a lot to accomplish what they do, years of hard work. And now, well, I don't like what I'm seeing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I blame mostly the NFL. They are dropping the ball. It sure looks like they tried to sweep domestic violence under the rug. You remember the Ray Rice elevator video and how the NFL handled that one. And what about the head injuries? The NFL has known about that for years, and they just looked the other way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There's more. But "Deflate-gate," well, that's the most recent. And I don't know if the Patriots cheated or not, but what kind of message is the NFL sending the American people by slow-walking the investigation and waiting until after the Super Bowl? The NFL doesn't dare rock the boat on their big money day, right? That's lousy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They could get to the bottom of this "Deflate-gate" fast. And while I'm at it, what's with the NFL being tax-exempt? That's absurd. Every time they don't have to pay, you have to pay. And if the NFL can afford the NFL commissioner for $44 million last year -- and they did -- don't tell me NFL can't pay taxes. That has Al Sharpton written all over it. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
