So after every terror attack, a producer will email me and ask me to do a monologue on why we must fight evil. But after so many attacks, I could write it in my sleep. So, instead let's ponder the barriers to combating terror. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Consider Islamaphobia: An accusation meant to smear those who dare to mention the cause of terror. Media and academia uses it as a way of not judging evil. It's an offshoot of something called relativism which deems us in capable of judging evil because America is just as bad -- we have a bad past, even though we aren't bad now. The goal: To remove our moral authority to act.
So, when there is an attack, you see the timid masses say: If only we were less bigoted, this wouldn't happen. And then the young people tweet: #peace, love conquers. But it doesn't. It's as if the hyper-tolerant are pleading to the terrorists: I'm not the one you want, it's those guys. But the theme will always kill you too. Relativism and its cowardly false tolerance create dead ducks. It says fold instead of fight. Don't listen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We must reclaim our moral authority. And we need to instruct others to do the same. Enough vigils, we need vigilance and a willingness to act. That requires training of both body and mind. What prevented terror on that train in Paris in 2015? It was three men trained in body and mind. You become a hard target and others might follow. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Last, let's once and for all dump this false war between freedom and security. Security preserves freedom, which is why as I speak right now, well-trained law enforcement surround this building. Why should I have that luxury and not you?  </pre>
