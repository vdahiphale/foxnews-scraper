'Off the Record,' 5/12/14: Students who attempted to hold satanic black mass - and insult Catholics - at Harvard in the name of the First Amendment would never burn the Koran

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a second. In just moments, near Harvard University, some very mean-spirited students will be exercising their First Amendment right by insulting Catholics, not just at Harvard but around the globe. They're about to start a satanic mass, which they know is deeply offensive to Catholics. Their justification? To put the spotlight on the First Amendment.
What do I think? Frankly, I think they are awful. Plus, they are cowards. They know when you offend the Catholics this way, the Catholics will pray for them. That's pretty safe. The cowards would never dare put the spotlight on the First Amendment, if that's what they want to do, by publicly burning the Koran. They wouldn't get prayers, but something else in return. A big something else. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I'm certainly not suggesting to burn the Koran. Get that straight. I'm just making a point with that example. But I am calling out this group. They're a bunch of frauds, cowards. And they're not real First Amendment advocates. The First Amendment also includes the freedom of religion. People who advocate for the First Amendment and want to celebrate it would not use just one clause of the amendment to stifle or intimidate another part of that same amendment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just because you have a First Amendment right to do something, remember, that doesn't mean you should. In some instances, it even means you might be mean and rotten, and this might be and this is one of those. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
