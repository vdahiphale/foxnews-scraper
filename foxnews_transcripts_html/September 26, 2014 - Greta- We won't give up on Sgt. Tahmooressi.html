Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I have a personal message for those of you who have emailed me: No, of course, I have not forgotten Sergeant Tahmooressi. We work on that story every single day. You may not see a segment about him right here on "On The Record" every single night. But that in no way means we have dropped the ball and move on.
In fact, just last night, we showed you the story of two retired marines completing a 300-mile March to the White House in support of Sergeant Tahmooressi. Now, these veterans want President Obama to know they are serious about leaving no man behind, including our marine held in Mexico. They are not forgetting Sergeant Tahmooressi, and neither are we, here on "On The Record." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sergeant Tahmooressi's story is always, always, always on our radar screen. We here at "On The Record" don't give up. In fact, this might strike some of you as bizarre, I still work several times a week trying to get more information on Natalee Holloway. She vanished in 2005. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, since so many of you care, really care, about Sergeant Tahmooressi, I will give you the inside scoop about what we are doing next week. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs is holding a hearing on Sergeant Tahmooressi's case, and we're going to take you inside that hearing and tell you what our lawmakers are doing to help bring our Marine held in Mexico home. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight  </pre>
