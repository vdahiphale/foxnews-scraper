'Off the Record', 3/3/14: Snow make-up days are more disruptive than helpful to students, teachers and parents

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. And first, I know no one over the age of 17 is going to agree with me on this one. But here it is.
I am 100 percent opposed to school snow make-up days. And I know you just spit out what you were drinking when you heard me say that, but I think snow make-up days are disruptive to students, teachers, and parents. And when those surprise snow make-up days are taken from those lock anticipated spring breaks, it's very disappointing to students. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I never traveled to anywhere on spring break when I was a kid. But I sure loved spring break, every single promised day of it. I knew in August, on day one of the school year, when spring break was - it was marked on my calendar. I looked forward to it. It was a deal. The school told me what days I was supposed to in school and what days I got off. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, right now, schools are closed up and down the Eastern Seaboard due to snow. And don't get me wrong. I know the value of education. But a day off here or there is not going to mean the difference between a kid hitting the skids or getting a job or graduating from college. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And under the theory of card laid is a card played. If a school itself cancels school, that is their decision. That's their problem. A deal is a deal. They promised spring break.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. So, go to your computers and send me all those blistering emails about how wrong I am on this one or how I could possibly suggest it. Or go to GretaWire.com and tell me if you agree with me or not.  </pre>
