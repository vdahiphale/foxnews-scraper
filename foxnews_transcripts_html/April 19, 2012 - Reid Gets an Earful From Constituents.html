Wise Move?
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is catching some flack from Nevada Muslim supporters, who aren't happy with how he has handled his opposition to the proposed mosque near Ground Zero. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that even though the director of the Islamic Society of Nevada does not support the Ground Zero mosque either, he says Reid's opposition was based on "politics." Aslam Abdullah says, "He hasn't just lost support, he has lost respect. I was surprised and amused at his political immaturity. We'll know in November how the move will affect Reid's re-election bid." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Another Las Vegas imam said, "I'm concerned that someone with so much influence wasn't more careful in his remarks." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Hard Time
The man serving life in prison for conspiracy in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people will have to get by on regular prison food. A Colorado judge has dismissed Terry Nichols' lawsuit that claimed the prison violates his constitutional rights by depriving him of a diet rich in whole grains, fiber and raw fruits and vegetables. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The judge disagreed, saying Nichols had not proved his diet qualified as cruel and unusual punishment or that it violated his Christian beliefs.
Business as Usual 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Those of us here in the nation's capitol are used to presidential motorcade traffic headaches, but for some Los Angeles residents, President Obama's stopover for a fundraiser Monday was anything but rush hour as usual. In some cases commuters endured an extra hour of drive time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Los Angeles Times wrote, "No matter their politics, Los Angeles residents found themselves united. 'It was a beautiful thing,' said Brentwood resident Myles Berkowitz, commiserating with his neighbors on Montana Avenue, 'Young, old, black, white: Everyone was P.O.'d."  </pre>
