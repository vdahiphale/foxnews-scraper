DANA PERINO, FOX HOST:  Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino - along with Katie 
Pavlich, Jesse Waters, Juan Williams and Brian Kilmeade. It's 5 o'clock in 
New York City, and this is THE FIVE. 

The Democratic party careening towards a major split as post-election 
bickering and finger pointing continues. Moderates are lashing out against 
the so-call "Squad," and the party's embrace of Socialism. 

Long-time Democratic Strategist James Carville, not happy with where things 
are headed. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAMES CARVILLE, (D) STRATEGIST:  Some of these woke people need to take a 
nap, all right? I mean, we've got - we have some good candidates out there, 
we lost some close races. Vice President Biden had a message that resonated 
more across this country than some of the things that we're hearing from 
some of the more extreme elements of the Democratic party, and I don't 
think that was helpful. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO:  But members of the Squad - they're not backing down. Rashida Tlaib 
hitting back at centrist Democrats saying that she can't be silent and 
adding, "and if we truly want to unify our country, we have to really 
respect every single voice." And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Democrats 
should have an unapologetic agenda and says they should not be so quick to 
work with Republicans - so much for unity, Jesse. 

JESSE WATERS, FOX HOST:  So much for unity. And today, I did a deep dive in 
to the Democratic party, and -- 

PERINO:  Oh, how did that go? 

WATERS:  -- I actually know more about the Democratic party than Juan does 
now, after my research - and here is what I found. So racially the 
breakdown is basically the Democrats have pretty much all the Blacks - 
about two-thirds of the Hispanics and a little less than 50 percent of the 
whites. But they're struggling geographically and it's because of ideology. 

They can't compete outside the coasts and the cities because of Socialism. 
They have to run really moderate candidates to compete in red areas, and 
sometimes they win, but then in a cycle or two they're out, and that causes 
a lot of recriminations and finger pointing, which you're seeing right now. 

And it's also this - this is important, they have alienated the Democrats 
through this ideology and identity politics, the most important voting 
block in the country which is the middleclass, people making between 
$50,000 and $100,000 a year without a college degree. 

The last two elections Hillary and Joe Biden have lost the middleclass. 
Biden did better this time because he did better with the rich, but what 
you're seeing is the economic populism is making (inaudible) not just in 
this group, but with Blacks and Hispanics too. Trump won an additional 5 
percent of Black Democrats, and an additional 7 percent of Hispanic 
Democrats. 

And at this point, if you're a Democratic party official, you'd ought to 
spank these Socialists back to the coasts. Because of this ideology you're 
losing geographically, you're losing in income levels, and you're losing a 
very critical racial demographic. 

So what usually happens now, the last two incoming Democratic 
administrations - first two years they lurch far left, and then a red wave 
happens. Happened in '94 with Bill, it happened in 2010 with Barack - so my 
prediction, if the Democratic party leadership doesn't send these 
Socialists packing, Biden lurches left and you're going to see another red 
wave. 

KATIE PAVLICH, FOX HOST:  And some of these Democrats - like the 
Conservative - or, moderate Democrats like Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, he 
knows that in 2022 if there's a Biden administration in 2022 like, his race 
that that's a prime target for Republicans to be able to try to go in and 
try to take that one back. 

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX HOST:  Sure, I mean this is what we know. I can't 
compete with Jesse in a deep dive in to Democratic party politics - so, 
pardon me, dear audience. Let me just try to keep up -- 

WATERS:  OK. 

WILLIAMS:  -- but I do know that it was moderates who gave the House to 
Democrats in 2018, and I do know this - let's not miss the big picture and 
what's going on right now. Democrats won the White House, Democrats 
retained a majority in the House by a narrow margin, but they are in the 
majority. Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House, and I think will be. 

And given the outcome of a very critical Senate runoff in two Senate races 
in Georgia in January, Democrats at this moment have a chance to control 
the U.S. Senate. So to me, that's the big picture - in order words, let's 
not focus -- 

WATERS:  Slim chance. 

WILLIAMS:  -- on the treason - there's no chance -- 

WATERS:  Slim chance. 

WILLIAMS:  -- I don't think there's a chance, I think there's a reality 
here. And so all these reports of losing this, and losing that - I think 
the reports of the Democrat's demise grossly exaggerated at this moment, 
and I think the reality is that Pelosi and the Democrats, the Democrats are 
a big tent party. 

We have more elements, more different types of people, different parties 
represented within the party than the Republicans. But remember Republicans 
had to deal with the Tea Party and the Freedom caucus and lots of very 
raucous decent and manage it. 

PERINO:  Yes.

WILLIAMS:  Democrats can do the same.

PERINO:  So Katie, I have a theory that I think Nancy Pelosi just may end 
up in the Biden administration. That she would take an appointment.

WATERS:  What, no way.

PERINO:  And I -- this is going to be something that I'm going to pay very 
close attention to.

WATERS:  You must know something. 

PERINO:  I don't know --

PAVLICH:  What do you think she'll be doing, Dana.

PERINO:  I -- I will reveal that is I develop my theory a little bit 
further. I want to go back -- you know James Carville, I could listen to 
him all day. I love his way with words and I think that he is trying to 
give the Democrats really good advice. You're from Arizona. I mean you saw 
what's happening. 

I'm from Colorado; I saw what happened over years there and everything 
(ph). It does -- I think that they would be wise to take his advice but do 
you think they will?

PAVLICH:  Well, you saw Kyrsten Sinema, of course, who ran as a quote, 
moderate Democrat and she won in that state two years ago. You had that 
happen again in the most recent Senate race. But I think when you look at 
what Juan was just saying about who had to deal with the Tea Party and 
Republicans; you know who else had to deal with the Tea Party, Barack 
Obama.

And it was interesting to watch this week when Joe Biden was giving a 
speech about healthcare and I remember him talking -- he was talking about 
Obamacare and how he's going to revise Obamacare, they're going to improve 
on it with the backdrop of this socialist Medicare for All.

Well, in 2010, if you'll remember; President Obama said they get 
shellacking as a result of that. They lost more power in the House, 
Democrats did since Eisenhower. And also to Jesse's point about competing 
on -- just on the coast. 

Republicans are competing on the coast now. You had Michelle Steel flip a 
Democratic seat in California. That's only happened twice in the past two 
decades. And I think that the Democratic Party is starting to realize that 
people in these deep blue districts have the benefit and the luxury of 
being able to be very, very far left because they are always going to get 
re-elected.

But it's -- you know Joe Biden is also going to have to deal with not just 
the reckoning and Democratic Party but potentially losing the House as a 
result of being pushed to the left in 2022. 

PERINO:  And actually that -- she brings up a really interesting point 
because, Brian, in California when they -- when voters had a chance to vote 
on several initiatives, all the initiatives went the conservative way. So 
there might be some sort of movement afoot. 

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX HOST:  I think there is. And I think Kevin McCarthy is 
going to split the Democrats wide open in the house. I cannot believe 
they're up to 203 seats already, about a dozen out there. It's an 
incredible night.

Juan, I can see why you're happy that Joe Biden is president but Donald 
Trump remade the Republican Party and the Republicans had a monster night. 
And it was really to do, believe it or not Donald Trump everyone except 
himself because he changed into a working class party. 

He changed it into a multi-ethnic party. He changed it into a party that's 
going to go to bat for every single group without pandering. He didn't say 
my goodness; let's not talk about immigration because that'll tick off 
Hispanics.

No, these are my policies. The Cubans, I don't think we should have 
relations with them. He didn't do that to get the Cuban vote. Venezuela, 
why are there (ph) communist in South America. He didn't do that to get the 
Venezuelan exiles.

And when it came to cracking down immigration, just cared about Americans. 
They knew he wasn't anti-Hispanic. That's when we got the grand -- that's 
why he got the Rio Grande valley and that's why other people are listening 
to him and he got 13 percent of the African American vote, which is 
pathetic in the big picture but it's almost double what Mitt Romney got.

And Mitt Romney didn't make any of the direct statements that let's say 
President Trump has made. And lastly, I can't believe that guys like Jim 
Clyburn, guys like Joe Manchin didn't have the guts to say defund the 
police is a problem. Didn't have the guts to say that burning down cities 
because you're angry about racial unrest is a good way to handle things.

And the New Green Deal is not practical and will destroy the country. And 
we should be prideful of the fact that we have our energy autonomy. Why did 
they wait till after the election to say how bad this was. Why didn't they 
say it before?

PERINO:  Well, maybe Jesse can tell us because he did a deep dive.

WATERS:  They know -- they know, they held it. They knew. 

KILMEADE:  Just to keep it together but now it's fractured.

WATERS:  They had to keep it together.

KILMEADE:  Not enough spackle to keep that group together. 

WATERS:  Got to keep the spackle up (ph).

PERINO:  Spackle is a great word -- great word. All right, coming up next, 
all eyes on Georgia now. The control of the Senate hinges on two run ups in 
January and a new report says Democrats are calling on people to actually 
move to the Peach state to vote in those elections.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WILLIAMS:  The political fight coming to Georgia just got even more 
intense. That's because Republicans are on the verge of keeping control of 
the senate. It was announced today that they won a key Senate race in 
Alaska. So now control of that chamber officially comes down to two run-off 
races in the peach state in January. 

Both parties laser focused on winning those contests. This is all happening 
as this new report causes some controversy. According to "The Wall Street 
Journal" Democratic activists encouraging people to temporarily move to 
Georgia to vote in that -- or those election. Tom Friedman, the columnist 
with "The New York Times" is also backing the idea.

(BEGIN VIDEO CALL)

TOM FRIEDMAN, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST:  I hope everybody moves to Georgia 
in the next month or two, registers to vote, and votes for these two 
democratic senators running against incidentally two Georgia senators, both 
of whom were investigated for what, for getting a briefing on the 
coronavirus and then selling stocks before the public was aware of that 
information. Both of them were investigated for that. 

(END VIDEO CALL)

WILLIAMS:  So Jesse, I'm glad you resurfaced from your deep dive, glad 
you're back. So, I just wanted to start here. Can we -- there's going to be 
a recount in Georgia. 

WATERS:  An audit, I believe. 

WILLIAMS:  I think it's a recount, I believe. But first, can we all agree 
that recounts, they're fine, but they don't move votes by the tens of 
thousands. So Joe Biden is winning, right? 

WATERS:  Well traditionally, you're right about that with the recounts, but 
I believe I heard this wasn't more of a recount, it's more of an audit. 
They're not just going to reprocess every single ballet, they're going to 
do a little -- like a forensic analysis of all the ballots to see what 
really went down there, and that's fine, we'll see what happens. 

But just the amount of scorched earth oppo drops that I've seen on these 
two democratic senators in the last 48 hours, my god. I mean these people 
sound like -- one guy backed Reverend Wright, another guy is for defunding 
the police, one guy loves communist Cuba. I just found this out right now.

KILMEADE:  You said Wright by the way, Warner (ph).

WATERS:  Yes, I mean, and Rubio's flying in to Georgia, all of these 
republican senators are on the ground there. Looks like the republicans, 
they know this is do-or-die. The stakes are high. The back is up against 
the wall. I think life as we know it hangs in the balance. 

If the democrats take both of these seats and they control the senate, bye-
bye America. We loved you, we had a nice run, but it's all over. 

WILLIAMS:  You're quoting Chuck Schumer.

WATERS:  We're talking Green New Deal, we're talking tax hikes. We're not 
even probably going to have a national anthem. 

WILLIAMS:  Oh no, did you hear that, Katie? 

PAVLICH:  I mean, I--

WATERS:  I'm quitting, but the stakes are very high.

WILLIAMS:  So Dana, the question for you is since Biden won in Georgia, 
even Jesse says that is likely now, don't democrats have a good chance in 
this run-off? 

PAVLICH:  I think they have a chance. I don't know if it's good. Now 
republicans almost always win these run-offs, and especially in a state 
like Georgia. 

I do think the idea that you have to invade Georgia with your voters in 
order to win is kind of pitiful and Congressman Ro Khanna was on the daily 
briefing today and he said he thinks that's not a good idea, not something 
that should be encouraged.

But I'll give you a little interesting figure. So Joe Biden is up by around 
14,000 votes. David Purdue, the republican incumbent is down -- well, he's 
-- he needs 14,000 more votes to avoid this run-off. So is it possible that 
there's enough democrats? 

Yes, in a presidential election. In a run-off? I just don't know if it's 
right to say that the democrats typically don't vote in run-offs because 
they don't care enough. 

I think everybody is super highly engaged this time around and I talked to 
a few people today that work in republican senate races, and they went from 
anywhere from cautiously optimistic that everything is going to work out 
fine to extremely nervous. 

WILLIAMS:  Right. So Brian, Dana was picking up on this. It's potentially a 
low-turnout election in Georgia for these two senate seats. Can Barack 
Obama and Joe Biden help the democrats and can a losing President Trump 
help the republicans? 

KILMEADE:  Very interesting. I think probably fascinating because I don't 
know what Barack Obama's impact was in the last few days when he went there 
over there. And I know Stacy Abrams has raised $10 million and she might be 
more of an impact. 

The other thing is I think democrat -- a lot of Georgians are very prideful 
of the fact that they're pro-republican and they like their old identity, 
which they lost if the recount goes the same way. 

The other thing I heard is Jon Ossoff, in terms of negative campaigning, 
he's a trust fund socialist and Warnock happens to love Cuba and Jeremiah 
Wright, so those two things aren't positive. On the other side, Purdue and 
Kelly Loeffler, who Doug Collins says I back her now, so that gives him his 
24 percent, so I think they're both favorites. 

But I will look at this, the second amendment. Both are very pro-second 
amendment. Georgia is a very pro-second amendment state, and that's where 
the rubber hits the roads with these four candidates. And Purdue and 
Loeffler together are combining forces, almost like a ticket. I think that 
can be pretty strong. 

The fact that Rubio showed up in 48 hours I think is important. And Mitch 
McConnell, when he's focused, I don't know if you know this but he tends to 
get his way. I think he's going to pour a lot into that.

WILLIAMS:  All right, so Katie, I come to you just on the hard nose money 
angle here because how much money pours in? Here I am, I'm picking up on my 
friend Dana Perino's point that the democrats spent a lot of money in South 
Carolina, Kentucky, a lot of these races, didn't get much back for it. So 
how much money do democrats put into the races in Georgia given what just 
happened in the last season? 

PAVLICH:  Well, we're already seeing a lot of grass roots money on the left 
pouring in, and I am sure that they'll be able to convince the big donors 
that, yes, you spent $100 million in South Carolina, you lost, but this is 
for the balance of power and we really need you in this moment to try and 
push us over the edge. 

KILMEADE:  And Kentucky. 

PAVLICH:  And Kentucky, and these are the reasons why we need some of your 
money. But in terms of who can win this thing, it's a -- it could go either 
way. You cannot underestimate democrats here.

PERINO:  I agree. 

PAVLICH:  The machine that democrats have built in Georgia. They're 
obviously ahead in the vote count right now. They can -- Republicans cannot 
bank on Georgia being this traditional Red State, they've really got to 
work for it. 

And I think given the high turnout of the election in general, they may 
have a problem on their hands. However, if the senate races go as 
republicans have seen the house races go and the sentiment against the 
socialism and the far left policy positions of both of the democratic 
candidates in Georgia, republicans will be in good shape. But, it's going 
to be a fight. 

KILMEADE:  They only need one, they only need one. Republicans only need 
one.

PERINO:  I want to mention one thing on the money, so Jon Ossoff is one of 
-- is the candidate going against Purdue. In 2017, they had every celebrity 
went down there, Oprah, Samuel L. Jackson, Jane Fonda, Alyssa Milano and 
George Takei, and $50 million was spent on that race, it was a house race. 

And he got the nickname the human cash incinerator. So I don't know if 
you're a democrat if you want to like put a bunch of money in there if 
you're a big donor, but their grass roots donors will probably show up. 

KILMEADE:  Even with George Takei, she -- he lost? 

WILLIAMS:  Yes, well what about the idea that both of these republicans 
have said that they don't like the secretary of state, the republican.

KILMEADE:  He came around, he's doing a recount.

WILLIAMS:  Oh yes. I think there's a little republican rift in there. 

PAVLICH:  Can I just say something real quickly about democrats threatening 
to move to Georgia even though they don't live there? 

The reason why Georgia has lax laws when it comes to being able to register 
to vote when you move to the state is to allow for more people to vote. 
It's not for people from out of the state to come and vote in a place that 
they don't live. That's pretty -- just because it's legal doesn't mean it's 
ethical. You shouldn't be doing that. 

WILLIAMS:  I think she's not a scuba diver. She doesn't go deep like you. 

PAVLICH:  What, what does that mean Juan?

WILLIAMS:  The media being accused of a double standard in how it covers 
President Trump and President-Elect Joe Biden. See it next right here on 
THE FIVE.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WATTERS:  Liberal media biased on full display. The press shaming 
Republicans over election challenges while giving Joe Biden the softball 
treatment. Take a look at these attacks on the GOP. 

(BEGIN VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Republican senators who are still silent about 
Biden's win, they're enablers too. And here is the list, we're going to 
leave this up for a second because it is rather long. 

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think those people in his administration that not 
only drafted some of those policies but were complicit, I don't think that 
they should be forgotten and I don't think that we should look the other 
way. I do think that people need to be held accountable for their actions. 

(END VIDEO)

WATTERS:  Now compare that with these softball questions for Joe Biden. 

(BEGIN VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Will you move ahead if the president continues to 
refuse to concede?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you expect to be able to work with Republicans 
when so many have thus far refused to even acknowledge your victory?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMLAE:  What do you say to the Americans that are anxious 
over the fact that President Trump has yet to concede and what that might 
mean for the country?

(END VIDEO)

WATTERS:  Well, those are some tough questions, Brain. I don't know -- I 
don't know if you can even answer those hard hitting questions.

KILMEADE:  Right. Couple of things. At least we didn't get what enchants 
you most about the job your about to get. That's the only one missing. I 
actually don't mind those questions though. I just wish more of those 
questions were asked to the president to give him a second to reflect and 
maybe find out something about him rather than what do the Russians know.

Why do you -- why do you and Melania, you're not staying in the same house. 
And what's happening. Why is -- why is Baron so tall. All those questions, 
he never had an easy question in four years but he's getting it. 

Here's the other thing, who cares. If someone on "The View" doesn't like 
you and is going to target you, I don't think she's hiring anyway. The 
other thing is you put up a list of people who haven't endorsed the 
president and you expect this is just like some mystery thing on "Murder 
She Wrote."

That doesn't matter. We know they haven't endorsed yet. They're still 
counting ballots. Everyone is cancelling so many people you can't even keep 
up with. We got to get a thicker skin, stop targeting people, that's your 
problem. But overall, I like the Dana Perino method of I don't care. I 
don't check my voicemail. I don't check my text messages.

I'm not on social media. It's hard to know who's mad at me when I don't 
care. I got -- I'm tapping in the Perino magic. 

WATTERS:  Maybe that's why Dana doesn't call me back. She doesn't text. 
Dana, what do you think about the language Brian was talking about putting 
people on list. I don't like the word he's an enabler or they're complicit 
and they need to be held accountable. What does that remind you of?

PERINO:  Well, you know there's -- there's -- in history you could go back 
and find examples of that. Like I'm not for cancelling anybody, except for 
maybe like two people I can think of off the top of my top of my head.

KILMEADE:  (Inaudible).

PERINO:  (Inaudible) would be one, no.

(CROSSTALK)

KILMEADE:  Yes, I'm here. That's why we have you.

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO:  No, I just -- I think that this whole idea of cancel culture 
actually really did hurt the Democrats. And it's not just because of in the 
individuals. It's that whole feeling of this is not how we were raised. 
This is not like if you believe in a higher power, that's not how you're 
taught to treat other people.

And just because somebody decided to go work on let's say at the National 
Park Service under a Trump administration they deserved to be cancelled. 
That doesn't make any sense to me.

WATTERS:  Cancel the part service. Katie, I can imagine that if Joe is down 
and he was filing legal challenges the media would be getting his back and 
making sure that every vote was counted before the certification.

PAVLICH:  Yes, I don't think we'd be declaring anything that we are now. 
But I think that they would also be backing his decision and saying that 
the President shouldn't be celebrating yet. I mean, we know that the media 
is biased, that there's a double standard. I think, though, if things turn 
out the way that they've been called to turn out, that the press is going 
to miss President Trump. 

You already have reporters saying that they are not getting call readouts 
with foreign leaders that Joe Biden is supposedly making. You have 
reminders that during the Obama administration, they were spying on 
reporters, the Justice Department went after more sources under the 
Espionage Act than ever before. 

I think they're going to miss the access and the transparency, and the 
President coming out multiple times a day and talking to reporters, giving 
them the sound bites they need, giving them the thoughts, giving them 
everything they need to be successful in their jobs. I think we'll still be 
missing him. 

WATTERS: Yes. Juan, I mean, the President made a lot of media people stars, 
the way they had these really robust exchanges on TV, you know, the books 
did have a list -- 

KILMEADE: The President didn't -- the President didn't have a list of 
people to call on. 

WATTERS: Right. I mean, we used to just sit here and watch these just 
brawls between the press and the president, and people make big names for 
themselves. Now, they're just whining that they're not even getting any 
access. Do you think Katie is right and the press may miss President Trump 
just a little bit? 

PAVLICH: Just a little. 

WILLIAMS: I think Mr. Deep Dive might miss this president a little bit, 
right? You witnessed it. 

PERINO: I think they'll do. I think they'll do. 

WILLIAMS: But I don't think -- look, I think that the reality is first that 
I don't like lists. Just let me say that. I think that the whole notion of 
you know, people being held accountable is legitimate, but enemies list, 
targeting people, I think that's the opposite of what we need in a free 
society in terms of open debate and tolerance. I don't like it. 

I don't also don't like, though, when you see people who refused to say, 
oh, there was an election, there's no evidence of fraud, and I acknowledge 
a fair result. And, therefore, I acknowledge President-Elect Joe Biden. And 
too many Republicans right now in Republican leadership in Washington are 
refusing to do it. 

I don't know if they think this is going to generate excitement in the base 
for the Georgia race. I don't know what they're doing. But it's not in 
keeping with our democratic norms. It's not in keeping with giving the 
incoming administration the opportunity to have a peaceful, successful 
transition. 

And today, I read in the paper something very interesting about what 
happened after that 2000 race where you had that month-long count in 
Florida, that the people on the 9/11 Commission said that failure to have a 
speedy, efficient transition opened the door to some of the damage that we 
as a nation suffered in 9/11. 

I think that's truly damaging, Jesse. And I think people should be held 
accountable and said, stop it. We had a real election. We have a winner. 
Let's get going. 

PAVLICH: So Juan, I have -- can I ask Juan a question?

WILLIAMS: Sure. 

PAVLICH: If the President did come out and congratulate Joe Biden, but also 
said, but I want lawsuits to move forward to do an analysis and audit of 
these elections, considering they change the rules in the middle of the 
game. We have a new election system and a number of these important states 
with all these mailing ballots. We have studies that show that they're 
prone to fraud. 

Would you be OK with that? Would you be okay with looking at what went on 
to make sure that things are on the up and up? 

WILLIAMS: Sure. You can at things -- but Katie, you can look at things, but 
again, you don't say that I am refusing to concede, I'm acting like I'm 
some authoritarian leader, I'm the king. That -- and you know, that's just 
childish. 

(CROSSTALK)

WATTERS: Maybe what we'll do is they'll just send FBI agents to the Biden 
transition team, frame them for crime they didn't commit like what just 
happened last time. 

KILMEADE: That's how you get to transfer to the (INAUDIBLE).

WATTERS: Coming up, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing some very 
harsh new COVID restrictions and a top Biden advisor pushing a very 
controversial idea where some Americans may have to wait to get a vaccine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KILMEADE: All right. The country is seeing a spike in the Coronavirus cases 
and hospitalizations. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responding by bringing 
back strict measures. No, finally, bars and restaurants and gyms in the 
state are now being forced to close at 10:00 and indoor gatherings of 
private residents will be limited to 10 people. All get a turnstile and 
then turn in the final count. 

We did get some good news on a potential COVID-19 vaccine this week. But 
some Americans may have to wait until the rest of the world gets it first. 
That is if a Biden advisor called Zeke Emanuel gets his way. He urged 
official to follow the fair priority model which calls to distribute a 
vaccine globally before it's available to all Americans. 

Katie, is that okay with you? Let's make sure the Russians have all they 
need before we hand it out to Montana and New Mexico? 

PAVLICH: Well, the Russians apparently have their own vaccine. 

KILMEADE: All right, it's going well. Biden and Putin won't take it. 

PAVLICH: Yes, they can have their own. No, I don't think that's OK. I think 
the United States needs to get back on its feet. Our U.S. company has 
developed the vaccine. The President has put in place a plan for 
distribution through the Pentagon and the military. And they're going to 
get it to the most vulnerable populations first, so the rest of the economy 
can get on track. 

And the idea that we would be obligated to somehow share it with the rest 
of the world, and does this include China? I don't know. But I want to talk 
about the restrictions as well, the new restrictions, the threats of 
another lockdown. You know, if you remember back in May and June when they 
started -- you know, there are questions about how long the lockdown was 
going to go, 15 days to 30 days, people were willing to do it for a little 
while. 

Lockdowns didn't necessarily stop because politicians thought that it was 
fine to do it. They stopped because people started fighting back. You had 
that woman in Texas who opened her salon, went to jail over it. You have a 
number of people saying I can't feed my family if you continue to lockdown 
measures. And also, if it's based on science, we saw -- and I said this 
yesterday, Governor Cuomo admitted that 63 percent of new cases in New York 
earlier this year came from people who were locked down. 

And so, you know, you have to balance out the consequences of another 
lockdown with the consequences we've seen of people not being able to 
provide for their families. I mean, it's just -- there are real serious 
consequences to people who can't make a living.

KILMEADE: Lightning round. Jesse, lockdowns don't work. And if he's going 
to go back to what he did, he steamrolled the entire city and says he won. 
The whole city went to its knees. It's going to take decades to recover. He 
wants more of that formula or he wants to just put this in as paperback.

WATTERS: Yes. He wrote a book about all this the last couple months and now 
cases are rising. What kind of an idiot does something like that? And 
everybody here I see is wearing a mask in New York City. So, why are cases 
rising? I don't understand it. 

I do know this. Joe Biden wants to give the vaccine to the Chinese before 
the United States? That is insane. That is literally insane. Here's some 
more insanity. The Biden COVID advisor says this. U.S. lockdowns of four to 
six weeks could control the pandemic and revive the economy. They want more 
lockdowns, month-long lockdowns, and they say don't worry, we'll just send 
everybody checks so they can get by. 

KILMEADE: Dana, lockdowns don't work, and we were going back to it. Sweden 
didn't lock down. They have the same situation as Germany who did. Europe 
is supposed to doing it the right way and they're flat on their back. 

PERINO: Well, the other thing is I don't understand -- so restaurants have 
to close at 10:00 p.m. But does that mean that the Coronavirus doesn't 
spread at 9:00? 

KILMEADE: Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that at 11:00 the virus 
goes crazy. 

PERINO: Got it. Got it. I also think that, you know, American taxpayers are 
on the hook for a lot of the funding of not only the production of this 
vaccine, but the distribution of it. I do think that after that we should 
help others when we can, but we should make sure that people in this 
country get it first. 

KILMEADE: Juan, do you think a lockdown for the next two or three months is 
the way? Merkel says lockdown for Thanksgiving, and you'll have a 
Christmas. Is that the formula for success? 

WATTERS: Wait, do they have Thanksgiving in Germany?

PERINO: Merkel said that about our Thanksgiving? 

(CROSSTALK)

KILMEADE: Go ahead. 

WILLIAMS: You know, your snorkeling compared to my deep dive friend. Look, 
I just want to say, I think you've missed frame this whole segment. I got 
to tell you something. To me, Pfizer, an American company is already 
working with a German company. So, it's already an international effort. 

And you as long as you have airplanes flying around, the virus is an 
international global concern. And what you heard from Zeke Emanuel is not 
saying, Americans don't get the vaccine in sufficient doses to take care of 
our problem. He's saying once we get the vaccine in sufficient numbers to 
lower our infection rate below one percent, then we should make an effort 
to go look for other people. 

That's a whole lot of different -- it's not -- it's not like saying, oh, 
they're ignoring us good Americans. They're ignoring people in Montana. 
That's just not fair.

WATTERS: America first, Juan. 

WILLIAMS: Fine, fine, everybody, OK, but I mean that's to say, oh, that's 
what he said. That's not what Zeke Emanuel was saying. 

(CROSSTALK)

KILMEADE: It's priority model. He says, once you get a herd immunity, then 
we're going to give it to other people. It's America first.

WILLIAMS: Look, the point -- and the second point -- the second point to 
Katie's argument is this. To really get the economy back in shape, we need 
to take steps. The economy can't recover if we still are fighting the 
virus. 

WATTERS: Well, you don't shut the economy down so the economy recovers. 

WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. 

PAVLICH: You know what? Maybe these politicians should actually take their 
own advice first instead of running around in crowds when it's convenient 
for them while they keep other people lockdown. 

WILLIAMS: You're making a political argument, but I'm saying health-wise 
scientists are saying here's the prescription. Take it. 

KILMEADE: It doesn't work. We locked down; it didn't work.

WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. That's not true. 

KILMEADE: We need to go back to work. We can't lockdown again. The American 
people are going to revolt. Meanwhile, ahead, off the charts hypocrisy from 
the leftover. They're pushing to defund the police. Wait until you hear 
this story from Minneapolis next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PAVLICH: Major hypocrisy from liberals who push to defund the police. The 
Portland City Commissioner who called for police budget cuts actually 
called 911 after a dispute with a Lyft driver. Take a listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JO ANN HARDESTY, CITY COMMISSIONER, PORTLAND, OREGON: I had a Lyft driver 
that decided he would just drop me off at a filling station and he wants me 
to get out and I'm not getting out of the car, in the dark, at a filling 
station, not happening. All because I ask him to put the window up. 

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PAVLICH: It sounds like she wants an escort by the police to be safe, Dana.

PERINO: Yes. So, right, it is hypocritical to defund the police but then 
call the police for something like that. I do think that defund the police, 
one, politically hurt the Democrats. But I also think it's actually having 
real practical impacts where you have police forces that are finding that 
they are short of people. They're cutting back on patrols like in the LAPD. 
And you're also seeing, like, for example, homicides going up. 

So there are real consequences to this kind of stuff, even the suggestion 
of the policy. And the idea that you can attack police -- and it's think 
about if you're a mom, and you have children that think that they might 
want to go into the police force. Are you excited about that? Probably not. 

PAVLICH: We're seeing mass retirements. Well, Minneapolis, a place where 
defund the police was a big thing over the summer, they have now increased 
police patrols after voting to defund the police. And take a look at these 
crime numbers in Minneapolis. It's insane. Arson, compared to last year, is 
up by 76 percent, homicides 87 percent. Jesse, assaults 24 percent, and 
robberies 37 percent.

So, not only do they defend the police, now they've defended more police 
and are trying to bring an outside police to deal with this problem. 

WATTERS: Katie, that crime is mostly peaceful. 

PAVLICH: Mostly peaceful?

WATTERS: Mostly peaceful homicide, mostly peaceful robbery. I just -- who 
are you guys going to blame? Trump is not around anymore, Juan. When 
there's violence in the cities, when there's more Coronavirus cases, who 
are you can blame? He's not there anymore. 

I can't wait to hear who you try to blame because when he's not there, I 
don't know. These things will continue to happen. You're going to see a 
rise in Coronavirus cases. You're going to see a rise in crime. And the 
Democrats don't have any solutions. They want to defend, and they want to 
shut down. So, it's just going to be interesting to see what happens in a 
lot of these big cities. 

PAVLICH: Yes. You know, Juan, these numbers are not just crime statistics, 
they are representative victims of crime. And so. isn't the Minneapolis 
city council somewhat responsible for this crime considering they voted to 
defund the police? 

WILLIAMS: I think, you know, what's missing in this conversation, Katie? 

PAVLICH: What?

WILLIAMS: The name George Floyd and the cop who actually put his knee on a 
man's neck for nine minutes and killed him. And imagine then the reaction. 

PAVLICH: Does this justify that?

WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying, you look at that reaction, and there's a 
certain reality that people are calling for police reform, less police 
brutality, less militaristic use of equipment against the community, more 
of an alternative in terms of dealing with people like that man in 
Philadelphia who was mentally ill and wielding a knife. He was a danger, 
but again, you got to shoot him to dead? I mean, wow. So, to me -- 

PAVLICH: So, I think that maybe -- so police have to get killed first or 
severely injured before they can fight back?

WILLIAMS: But I just think -- I just think what you guys do is, you throw 
around this term, defend the police. You know, it reminds me of a bad 
slogan like build a wall.

PAVLICH: Democrats started the defund the police cry. Democrats started the 
defund police. 

WILLIAMS: How about this? Build the wall, have the Mexicans pay for 
building the wall? That's a bad slogan. 

WATTERS: But they did defund it. It's not a slogan. 

WILLIAMS: No, it's not defund. 

WATTERS: Yes, they did. 

WILLIAMS: No. What they to say we have different ways to deal with 
policing. 

KILMEADE: Can you just give me one second? One second. You know what I'm 
doing? I'm reimagining police, which is the most ridiculous statement I've 
ever heard. 

WILLIAMS: Why is that ridiculous?

KILMEADE: Because reimagining police while you live in a lawless city is 
crazy. 

WILLIAMS: What lawless city?

KILMEADE: How about New York City?

WILLIAMS: New York as lawless now?

KILMEADE: Absolutely. 

WILLIAMS: I see. Not in my experience. 

KILMEADE: 2,400 people have turned in their badge. It's up 25 percent from 
the year before. This city is out of control. Murders and shootings are 
through the roof. The Minneapolis in, particular, they are now getting -- 
asking for $500,000 to get 40 more cops in to try to get some control. That 
doesn't help George Floyd's memory, it doesn't help George Floyd's family, 
it doesn't help anyone.

It vilifies all police officers, not the one that's in prison. And that is 
the biggest mistake. And as James Clyburn said, it is -- sloganeering is 
one of the worst thing that could happen. And he says that the South 
Carolina seat was lost because of the phrase "defund the police."

And Kamala Harris backed it when the LAPD did it, and everybody was in 
support of it when they counted a billion dollars -- when they cut $1 
billion off the NYPD too. Nobody stopped it. They cheered for it. And they 
can't walk it back now. 

PAVLICH: Indeed. "ONE MORE THING" up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: It's time now for "ONE MORE THING." Jesse? 

WATTERS: So, Fox News has been dominating the TV industry, the radio 
business, the internet, and now we're into the book business. Check this 
out. This is the first official Fox News book from Pete Hegseth called 
Modern Warriors, real stories from real heroes just in time for Veterans 
Day. It's a collection of inspiring stories by highly decorated SEALs and 
Marines and Army Rangers. 

So, think about this. This could be a collector's edition, the very first 
ever Fox News book. So, go over to FoxNews.com. Shop and check it out. 

KILMEADE: It's like a Babe Ruth Rookie Card. 

WATTERS: Basically. 

KILMEADE: It's going to be. It's based on a series.

PERINO: I'm glad you're going next, Katie, because we've cut you off the 
last day. 

PAVLICH: That's OK. All right, Morgan County Deputy Sheriff in Missouri, 
Clint Thomas, had an emotional reunion with his son on Monday after 
returning from a deployment in Afghanistan. There he is walking up to the 
car to his son after pulling it over.

WATTERS: Just a wave? 

PAVLICH: His son jumps out of the window. And the two have a big hug. So, 
welcome home, Sheriff Thomas and happy Veterans Day to all. 

PERINO: Oh, that's so cute. 

WATTERS: Happy Veterans Day. 

PERINO: Brian.

KILMEADE: I got to give credit to Tony Orlando. You know this song Tie a 
Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree. It really just became adopted for 
soldiers coming back from war, from deployment. And now, of course, on 
Veterans Day, combined with John Catsimatidis of Red Apple Media, and Toys 
for Tots, and the Marines, and they're handing out 100,000 yellow ribbons 
on Veterans Day to symbolize those who have served and are serving. 

And I think it's just a great cause that they got behind. And Tony Orlando 
is a great American patriot. He says, "Listen, I used to be in the clubs 
all the time. I can't perform anywhere. I can't wait to help out the 
troops." So, when John Catsimatidis called him, who might be the next mayor 
of New York City, he came down and helped out.

PERINO: Is he running for mayor?

KILMEADE: He's thinking about running for mayor.

PERINO: Please run for mayor, sir. 

KILMEADE: He's a self-paid superstars. 

PERINO: Wow. All right, Juan. 

WILLIAMS: All right, so America, join THE FIVE in wishing Happy Birthday to 
Katherine Loughrey. Take a look at this grand party thrown for this 100-
year-old in Gilbert, Arizona. As you can see, she had a tiara on as she 
watches cars, bikes, the police, the fire department all rolled down the 
street. 

She -- her daughter described it like this. Her daughter is Janet Hartle. 
She said, mom lived through the Great Depression, two world wars, and she 
raised six kids. She's a strong woman. And due to the virus, obviously, 
there was concern she wouldn't have a big celebration. But as you can see, 
she got a surprise parade. She even got a pat from the fire department and 
the police department. She's now an honorary officer. So, happy birthday, 
Mrs. Loughrey. 

PERINO: Terrific story. I love that. That's a birthday to remember. All 
right, so there's a California man, he was very frustrated with the 
lockdowns and he couldn't get to Disneyland this summer. And he decided to 
bring a little Disney to his own backyard. 

That's right, Sean LaRochelle is studying architecture, and his brother 
built -- he and his brother built a personalized version of his favorite 
Disneyland roller coaster called the Matterhorn right there in their 
backyard. They started working on this in March, finished it over the 
summer. And he says that he always wanted to build a ride, and that Disney 
rides have always been special to him because of their themes. So, Sean 
tried to include every detail that he could from the actual right including 
the famous Yeti. 

KILMEADE: Wow, no harm either. 

PAVLICH: Matterhorn is my favorite ride. 

WATTERS: A homemade roller coaster?

KILMEADE: That's amazing. 

PERINO: Yes. You got to get on it, Jesse. You want to get on it?

WATTERS: No. A do it yourself rollercoaster? I'm out. 

PERINO: Maybe if you were building it, Jesse. 

KILMEADE: Yes, there's no law. I noticed. 

PERINO: I feel like we have our do it -- do it yourself rollercoaster on 
THE FIVE every day, all sorts of emotions. Hands up indeed.

All right, that's it for us. "SPECIAL REPORT" is up next.
