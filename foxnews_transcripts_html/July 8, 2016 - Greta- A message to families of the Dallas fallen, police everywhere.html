Let's all go "Off the Record." I don't have any words to console the families of the men in Louisiana, Minnesota, or the police officers in Dallas, because words are inadequate. We are our mourning, grieving. And I wish I could do or say something to help these families, but the best I can do is, honor them.
So, I am going to use my big platform here "On The Record" to make sure we all see and remember the heroics of the Dallas police department. Look at this video. These police are running towards danger, not away. Running to help, not to hide. Running to protect and save others, not themselves. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here is what the Dallas Police Chief David Brown had to say about these heroes: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN: Please join me in applauding these brave men and women who do this job under great scrutiny, under great vulnerability, who literally risk their lives to protect our democracy. We don't feel much support most days. Let's not make today, most days.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
To Chief Brown and all law enforcement officers from coast-to-coast, who put their lives on the line every day to protect us, I want you to know, we hear you, we appreciate you, we thank you, and yes, we support you.
And that is my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
