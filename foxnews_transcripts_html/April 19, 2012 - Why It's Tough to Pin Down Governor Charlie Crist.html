Florida Governor Charlie Crist appears to be quickly tacking left since leaving the Republican Party to run for Senate as an independent. National Journal reports Crist has removed from his campaign website pro-life language and references to other social issues. Republican opponent Marco Rubio noticed the changes and forwarded an older web page to reporters.
The original page touts the sanctity of life, adoption centers and traditional marriage. Now a search on Crist's website offers no results on any of those topics. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, his campaign hired a well-known media consulting firm that predominantly works with Democrats. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
People in Glass Houses... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A fundraising appeal by former President Bill Clinton is drawing some attention. The New York Post reports Mr. Clinton's letter on behalf of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee includes a flyer that reads, "DSCC funds go towards efforts to unseat far-right Republican senators like admitted sinner David Vitter," referring to the Louisiana lawmaker who admitted using a prostitution service.
Back in 1998, Vitter called on President Clinton to step down after the Monica Lewinsky affair came to light. One blog headline read, "Bill Clinton Casts the First Stone." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Greene Around the Gills
South Carolina Democrats are scratching their heads after an unknown and unemployed military veteran managed to win the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. Alvin Greene, who raised no funds, doesn't have a campaign website and just happens to be facing a pending felony charge of showing obscene photos to a college student. He beat a former four-term state lawmaker and would face incumbent Republican Jim DeMint in November. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
State Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler couldn't really explain the win, saying voters may have just voted alphabetically for Greene because, "as far as I know, he never showed up at anything."; 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And late Wednesday, Fowler said she asked Greene to withdraw from the race because of that pending charge. Greene says he will not because, "The people have spoken. We need to be pro-South Carolina, not anti-Greene."  </pre>
