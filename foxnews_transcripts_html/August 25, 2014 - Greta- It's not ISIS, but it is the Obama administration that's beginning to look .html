'Off the Record,' 8/25/14: Instead of admitting he was wrong about his first characterization of ISIS and admitting they are a real threat, Pres. Obama and his administration are playing a ridiculous spin game

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. In January, President Obama called ISIS "JV." Well, that was a real JV comment. It was naive.
When President Obama made that JV comment, ISIS had already fought the Iraqi military and captured Fallujah. That was January 3rd and anything but JV. They were fierce and well-armed militants. The president should have known better. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A little history might help. In 2004, Fallujah was a huge two-part battle for us. 146 of our troops died. Winning at Fallujah in January, even against Iraq forces and not ISIS, Mr. President, it's not JV. That's a big deal. They're a big deal. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I tell you, though, what is J.V., sending a team into Syria to rescue our journalists only to find out he's not there. That's our CIA, with very J.V. intelligence gathering. It doesn't stop there. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey said this about ISIS just last week: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

GEN. MARTIN DEMPSEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: I tell you, though This is an organization that has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated. To your question, can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization which resides in Syria, the answer is no. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

But then oddly, yesterday, on a plane, General Dempsey now suddenly dialing back, saying ISIS is just a regional threat and he would not recommend airstrikes in Syria, at least not yet. In other words, no problem with the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So why the change of heart? From an "apocalyptic end-of-days" statement, to not a direct threat, that's a switch. And that switching and the getting it wrong is JV. It isn't ISIS that's JV. It's beginning to look like the Obama administration is JV. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
