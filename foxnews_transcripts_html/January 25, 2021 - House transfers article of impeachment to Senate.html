BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Juan. Well done, Jesse. Goodevening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, in just under an hour, the article of impeachment againstformer President Trump will officially be handed over to the U.S. Senate.In a few minutes, I'll speak live to Senator Tom Cotton about how the trialcould play out there.President Biden meantime focusing on the coronavirus, saying anyone whowants a vaccine in the U.S. should be able to get one sometime this spring.The President is adjusting his goal on how many people should be gettingthe shots during his first 100 days.The president spoke to reporters this afternoon, including our own WhiteHouse Correspondent Peter Doocy who's live on the North Lawn with thelatest. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. This was the first opportunity we've had to ask President Bidenquestions in a formal setting. And even though Fox wasn't called oninitially by a staffer standing off stage with a list of reporters, rightafter the President spoke about a goal of a million vaccines a day. I gothis attention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wait, I know he always asked metough questions. They always has a niche too, but I like him anyway, so goahead (INAUDIBLE) ask the question.DOOCY: Thank you, Mr. President. So, you just have a -- you think withinthree weeks or so, we'll be at the point where there are a million vaccinesper day? But it seems like --BIDEN: No, I think we'll get there before that. I said, I hope -- Imisspoke. I hope we'll be able to increase as we go along 'til we get tothe million five a day. That's my ex -- my hope.DOOCY (voice over): Republicans had already been pointing out a millionshots a day is a low bar.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): That's not a big, new goal. It's exactly whatthey inherited from the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed.DOOCY: So, President Biden is raising his goal for the first 100 days.BIDEN: I think with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbor andthe creek not rising as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to getthat to 150 -- 1.5 million a day.DOOCY: COVID-19 related travel restrictions Trump tried to lift on flyersfrom the E.U., Brazil and the U.K. are back. And the president also signedexecutive orders for the feds to buy American.BIDEN: We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs.DOOCY: And to reverse the military's ban on transgender servicemembers.BIDEN: What I'm doing is enabling all qualified American to serve theircountry in uniform. And essentially, restoring the situation that used tobe before, wheretransgender personnel -- if qualified in every other waycan serve their government in the United States military.DOOCY: The commander-in-chief is OK letting Congress lead the way onimpeachment.If the whole point of impeaching somebody is basically to get rid of themand Trump has already gone, would President Biden support maybe the Senatecensuring him just so that lawmakers can move on with the people'sbusiness?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is -- was in theSenate for 36 years as you all know, he is no longer in the Senate. And hewill leave it up to members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans todetermine how they will hold the former president accountable.DOOCY: And the White House remains confident partisan tensions in Congressmay give way to unity.BIDEN: We're going to argue like hell. I'm confident, believe me, I knowthat, I've been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can getthings done for the American people.DOOCY: But with agenda item number one, the new president is asking forpatience.Now that you're president, and you're saying there's nothing we can do tochange the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months. Whathappened to two months ago when you were talking declaratively about I amgoing to shut down the virus?BIDEN: Well, I'm going to shut down the virus but not -- I never said I'ddo it in two months. I said it took a long time to get here. It's going totake a long time to beat it.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): And because of confusion this White House is blaming onthe Trump administration, nobody here has been able to tell us yet how muchvaccine inventory there is.But the president says he thinks that anybody who wants a COVID-19 vaccineshould be able to get it by the spring, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thank you.We are less than an hour away from the expected transmission of the loanarticle of impeachment against former President Trump from the House to theSenate as you look live there. This begins the historic first trial of apresident no longer in office.Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things standtonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The initial two weeks scheduled for the article of impeachmentaccusing former President Trump of incitement of insurrection is underway.While the trial will not start until February 9th, Tuesday senators will besworn in as jurors. 17 GOP defections are needed to join with Democrats inorder to convict.Some Senate Republicans are already arguing the trial is unconstitutionalsince President Trump has left office.SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): This is going to be really bad for the country.It's also just going to stir it up even more and make it even harder to getthings done moving forward.EMANUEL: On the upcoming impeachment trial, Senator Marco Rubio has calledit stupid. How do you respond, sir?SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD): It's our responsibility to conduct a fair trial. Ithink all of us are going to be potential jurors, recognize the seriousnessof our responsibilities. We also know the seriousness of what happened onJanuary the sixth.EMANUEL: Chief Justice John Roberts will not preside instead it will beSenate president pro tempore Patrick Leahy who's pledging to administer thetrial with fairness.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without objections ordered.EMANUEL: But having a Democrat senator in charge likely adds to theargument from Republicans that this is not a legitimate process and couldkeep down GOP defections. The new Senate Majority Leader insists this trialis necessary.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It makes no sense whatsoever that a president orany official could commit a heinous crime against our country and thendefeat Congress's impeachment powers by simply resigning.EMANUEL: Among the concerns the threat of another attack on the Capitolduring the trial. Up to 7,000 National Guardsmen are expected to stay inWashington through mid March due to potential threats despite no violenceon Inauguration Day.Nearly 200 who are here to protect the peaceful transfer of power have nowtested positive for COVID.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): We are expecting action later this hour to see theHouse impeachment managers walk that article of impeachment over to theSenate chamber. They will present, exhibit and read it aloud starting thiswhole process, Bret.BAIER: And we'll follow it. Thanks, Mike.EMANUEL: You bet.BAIER: Twitter is unveiling what it calls a new community driven approachto misleading information on its platform. The so-called "Birdwatch" allowsusers to add notes to tweets they believe are false. Twitter says it's anattempt to add context for other users. The pilot program was launchedtoday.Allies of a jailed Russian opposition figure are calling for new protestsnext weekend following sometimes violent encounters with authoritiesSaturday in more than 100 cities in Russia. Russian officials detained morethan 3,700 demonstrators seeking freedom for Alexei Navalny.State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has the latest tonight on how theBiden administration is reacting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Moscow, protestersthis weekend confront police in riot gear demanding the Russian governmentrelease Alexei Navalny, an activist and antagonist of President VladimirPutin. And only days into a new administration, the U.S. is condemning theRussian government.BIDEN: We are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny,whether it's the SolarWinds or whether it's reports of bounties on theheads of Americans in Afghanistan.EDSON: The White House says it's requested an intelligence review of thatbehavior. And is also calling on the Russian government to release Navalnyand the thousands arrested for peacefully protesting for his release.Though the Biden administration also quickly agreed to extend the finalnuclear arms treaty between the two countries, citing its limits onweapons.MICHAEL MCPAUL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: Remember, Ronald Reaganused to say trust but verify. I say, don't trust, only verify. And the NewSTART Treaty allows us to do this. I think it should -- I think it's theright decision by the new Biden team to extend it.EDSON: The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committeecriticized the five year extension of New START as too long. And as aresult, "We should expect the Russians to continue to expand and improvetheir tactical nuclear weapons and exotic delivery systems.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (on camera): The Russian government is forecasting a continued poorrelationship with the United States. The Deputy Foreign Minister SergeiRyabkov tells a Russian outlet that officials there don't expect anythinggood for the new administration, accusing American counterparts of buildingtheir careers, slinging mud at Russia, Bret.BAIER: Rich, thank you. Let's talk about Russia and impeachment, othertopics tonight with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, thanks for beinghere.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR) (on camera): Thanks for having me on, Bret.BAIER: I want to start with that last piece about Russia. You put out astatement on Thursday saying President Biden is giving a gift to VladimirPutin by unconditionally extending the New START Treaty. After four yearsof unfounded hysterical attacks on President Trump and chest thumping aboutRussia, it appears that President Biden and the Democrats have immediatelyreverted to their old weak dovish ways.He is calling on Russia to release Navalny, among other things, you'resaying this is not good enough as far as Russia policy.COTTON: Well, Bret, words are nice, and Russia should release Mr. Navalny.But the number one priority for Vladimir Putin was a unconditionalextension of the New START Treaty because that treaty favors Russia.It does not cover the vast arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons that Russiahas, or some of its novel delivery systems like undersea delivery systemsor nuclear-powered cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. That'swhy Vladimir Putin wanted it extended without condition.It's also a bilateral treaty at a time when China's growing nuclear armsthreatened to overmatch the United States when combined with Russia andtheir nuclear arms. I don't understand why Joe Biden would have givenVladimir Putin exactly what he wanted on his first full day in officewithout demanding significant concessions in return.BAIER: So, you're saying he's soft on Russia?COTTON: Well, again, the Democrats have a long history going back to theCold War in the Soviet incarnation of Russia of being very dovish when itcomes to dealing with Moscow.Now, for four years, they beat their chests like Jack Ryan and other coldwarriors, as if they were the only ones who would stand up to VladimirPutin. When in fact, the Trump administration had a much tougher line onRussia than previous administrations of both parties.Now, Joe Biden comes into office and the very first thing he does is granta unconditional extension of a one sided arms treaty. It's verydisappointing, and it will endanger our national security in the long run.BAIER: Senator, let's talk about impeachment. The Article of Impeachmentwill be walked over to your side of the Capitol tonight, and then it startsFebruary 8th. Your thoughts about where things stand and what should behappening?COTTON: Well, Bret, you're right that House managers will present thearticle impeachment tonight, senators will be sworn in tomorrow and thenwe'll take a brief pause for a couple of weeks where the president's legalteam can prepare his defense, something they were denied in the House, achance for a fair hearing and due process.I don't think this trial though is within the Senate's constitutionalauthority. The impeachment power is designed to convict and removeofficeholders from office. The Constitution explicitly says it applies tothe president, the vice president and civil officers.Now, Donald Trump is none of those. He is a private citizen. And I thinkmost Americans are going to think by the middle of February is very strangethat the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove fromoffice a man who left office almost a month ago. There are many otherpressing priorities on which we could be focused.BAIER: How many Republicans do you think at the end of this will vote toconvict?COTTON: Bret, I can't speak for my fellow Republicans. But I can say thatmore and more have told me as they've studied the matter, they've comearound to my view of things as I announced the day the House impeached thepresident, is that this is beyond the constitutional authority of theSenate to conduct a trial, to convict him removed from office, a man wholeft office last week.BAIER: You know, the man who left office did tweet about you and suggesteda number of people would get primaried coming up if they didn't stand withthe president in this impeachment mess.He tweeted out on January 4th before the incidents on January 6th,mentioning you in particular. What do you think about the political powerof now former President Trump?COTTON: Well, Bret, I declined to try to overturn the results of thepresidential election when Congress met to count electoral votes on January6th, for the same reason I don't think Congress should proceed with thisimpeachment trial. I am standing up to the Constitution, fidelity to theConstitution has to be our lodestar at all times.And just like it's beyond Congress's power to resort -- reverse the resultsof the electoral college, it's beyond their power to proceed with animpeachment proceeding after the impeach official has left office.I don't think so much about the politics of this question as faithfulnessto the Constitution.BAIER: Yes, but I'm asking you a political question as far as the power of-- the political power of Donald Trump and possibly even Trump supportersand how much that factors into your party going forward?COTTON: Well, the president is still very popular with Republicans acrossthe country. And he has said he wants to stay engaged in politics as theformer president.I would say, though, that if you try to do the right thing, and especiallyif you try to uphold the Constitution, the chips will usually fall in theright way when it comes to the politics.BAIER: But January 6th, you've spoken out about that and what happened. Didyou believe the president -- President Trump incited that mob?COTTON: Bret, the president called forth a crowd on January 6th, and formany weeks, he had been saying that there is some chance to reverse theresults of the election and extend him a second term, that simply wasn'tgoing to happen.Now, the main people who are responsible for the mob that attacked theCapitol were the violent members of that mob who are facing significantjail time now and arrest are ongoing. Those are the main people who areresponsible for the violence that we had at the Capitol.BAIER: Senator, I just have a few seconds left but I do want to try to giveyou an opportunity to straighten something out.Were you straightforward with voters about your military service? You're adecorated veteran, but there is a story -- a couple of stories popping upabout you saying that you were an Army Ranger.COTTON: Yes, thanks, Bret. I graduated from the Ranger School, I wear theRanger Tab, and combat with the 101st Airborne in Iraq. This is not aboutmy military record; this is about my politics.Ranger regiment legends like General Scottie Miller (PH) or General CraigNixon had used the term to describe both alumni of the Ranger Regiment andgraduates of the Ranger School, as to the secretary of the Army, as it mostto my buddies in the Army. As did most of the liberal media until aconservative veteran was using the term in that way.But if some people disagree, that's fine. I respect their views, but what'smost important, I respect the service of all Rangers, and indeed, allsoldiers who volunteered to serve our country.BAIER: Well, thank you for your service, and I want to give you a chance toclear that up. Senator, thanks for the time.COTTON: Thank you, Bret.BAIER: Still ahead, why teachers in one major school district are defyingplans to re-open schools.

Correspondent DanSpringer shows us tonight from Seattle. It continues a month-long patternof unrest in the North West.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Police inTacoma, Washington tonight are bracing for more violence in the wake of ashocking incident over the weekend.Responding to a crowded street racers, a police officer was surrounded withpeople pounding on his patrol car.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!

Peoplejust approach the car, started yelling.SPRINGER: In a statement, Tacoma police said the officer feared for hissafety, "The officer had his lights and sirens activated. While trying toextricate himself from an unsafe position, the officer drove forward."Last night, dozens of anarchists responded.

Federalofficers fired tear gas and flashbangs. And in Seattle, last week'sInauguration Day riot prompted the police chief to change course.ADRIAN DIAZ, INTERIM POLICE CHIEF, SEATTLE POLICE: We will make arrests, wewill seek to prosecute those cases, and making sure that they're heldaccountable.SPRINGER: But the city's attorney's office says there is no new policy onrioters. And while the mayor and city council members have not condemnedthe violence, the White House press secretary made it clear President Bidendoes.PSAKI: Smashing windows is not protesting and neither is looting. Andactions like these are totally unacceptable, and anyone who committed acrime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPRINGER (on camera): One person remains hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries from the incident in Tacoma. The officer involved ison paid leave while his use of force is investigated.So far at least, the streets in the Pacific Northwest are just as volatileas President Biden in the White House press.

Some conservatives question the timing, noting they come afterDonald Trump left office.In California, Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom lifted the state's stay athome order, allowing activities like outdoor dining to resume, noting areturn to a tiered framework that indicates what can open based on caserates.GOV.

Bret?BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Molly Line in Boston. Molly, thanks.Up next, the panel on the first 100 days of the new administration, thepresident's agenda, and the former president's impeachment trial.First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. The prime minister in the Netherlandscondemns riots across the country this weekend in which demonstratorsattacked police in response to a nighttime curfew to slow the spread of thecoronavirus. Hundreds of people were detained. The Dutch prime ministercalls the protests criminal violence.Chinese rescuers found the bodies of nine workers killed in explosions at agoldmine. That raises the death toll to 10, 11 others were rescued a dayearlier after being trapped underground for two weeks. One person is stillmissing there.And the European Union is calling for a broad political talks in Venezuelato set up new elections. The E.U. says it stands ready to slap sanctions onmore senior Venezuelan officials in the country if they undermine democracyor take part in human rights violations.Just some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Breaking tonight just a few minutes ago, the U.S. Senate has votedto confirm Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary. She now becomes the firstwoman to hold that position as Treasury Secretary. The vote moments ago, 84to 15. Also getting word that Tony Blinken has made it out of committee,and that vote for secretary of state will happen soon.Let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr. former Tennessee Congressman andCEO of Empowerment Inclusion Capital, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at"The Federalist," and Byron York, chief political correspondent for the"Washington Examiner." Take a listen to this about impeachment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITT ROMNEY, (R-UT):  The president's conduct with regards to thecall, the secretary of state Raffensberger in Georgia, as well as theincitation towards the insurrection that led to the attack on the Capitolcalls for a trial.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R-FL):  I think the trial is stupid. I think it'scounterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country, and it'slike taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire.SEN. BEN CARDIN, (D-MD):  I think all of us who are going to be potentialjurors recognize the seriousness of our responsibilities. We also know theseriousness of whatever happens on January the 6th.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Again, that article of impeachment will be walked over, Mollie, injust a few minutes this evening. What about this and how it playspolitically once this trial begins?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  It makes sense why theDemocrats want to do this impeachment and trial. They're trying to separateRepublican elected officials for Republican voters. And this is a way thatthey think will work to cleave the party.It looks like it's not actually working. In the House, you had very fewRepublicans fall for this stunt led by Nancy Pelosi and members of themedia, and in the Senate you definitely have people who are consumed withdislike for the former president. But it has so many problems going intothis. We have where the chief justice is not going to bother sitting forthe trial. Of course, if it were a legitimate trial, he would have to sitfor it because the Constitution requires that an impeachment trial beoverseen by the chief justice if it's of the president. But it's not of thepresident. It's of a private citizen.And so you are having more and more members of the Senate say that theyjust don't even see the constitutional basis for this. But it will besomething that the media and Democrats will definitely be pushing in thedays to come.BAIER:  Harold, obviously, you saw the senators over the weekend, some ofthem defending this process and the need for the trial. But in the bigpicture getting the Biden agenda through obviously is where theadministration's focus is, does that hurt that effort?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  Thanks for having meon, and good evening. I think that if these were prosecutors in a regularcourtroom, the prima facie case here is pretty indisputable and a lot ofthe facts are overwhelming. But this is a political exercise, as yourightly point out. And the question becomes, can you get 17 Republicans togo along with you?I think the larger question, and I don't necessarily disagree with some ofthe political analysis Mollie's statement contained about the division thismay create. I don't know if Democrats are driving that. I think Mitt Romneymight be one of the big drivers as well. But I think the larger questionfor the country, if you listen to the words of Mitch McConnell who went tothe Senate floor, his words will be memorialized forever. He said thepresident of the United States fed a group of people, he called them a mob,a bunch of lies, and incited them to riot.I think the question becomes, do we follow Kevin McCarthy's words early onwho said perhaps a censure is necessary or appropriate, or do we not punishthe president at all, or do we go all the way to an impeachment? I don'tthink the Senate will go all the way to an impeachment, or a conviction,rather, but I do think the question remains for all of us as Americans --should a president who is on his way out of office, or her office, we'llsay, one day, should they be allowed to get away with something like this?My answer is an American is no. It will be curious to see how the House andthe Senate handle this over the next several days.BAIER:  I guess what I'm asking, Byron, on the politics, is there abacklash to even moving forward with this?BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Whatwe're seeing right now is the same old Trump divisions politically that wesaw all through the Trump years. We haven't had a lot of good polling onthis. A new Monmouth poll did come out today, and it shows Republicans andDemocrats with just a mirror image split. Only 11 percent of Republicanswant Trump to be convicted, and 85 percent want him to be acquitted. Andwith Democrats, only 11 percent want him to be not convicted, and 87percent want him to be convicted. And independent are split down themiddle. This is exactly the kind of division that we saw when Trump waspresident.And Senator Cotton said earlier that more and more Republicans were comingaround to his point of view, which is there's a huge procedural problemwith this impeachment in trying a former president. They just can't dothat. And I think you will see more Republicans embrace that. But also onthe substance of it, they will be more likely to say the people who aremost responsible for the Capitol riot where the rioters themselves, theones who broke in, who ransacked the capital, and they now are beingprosecuted.BAIER:  More arrests happening every week. Panel, standby, if you would. Upnext, easing up on some of the coronavirus restrictions around the country. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION:  I wouldsay one of the biggest problems right now is I can't tell you how muchvaccine we have, and if I can't tell it to you, then I can't tell it to thegovernors, and I can't tell it to the state health officials. If they don'tknow how much vaccine they're getting, not just this week but next week andthe week after, they can't plan.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope we'll be able toincrease as we go along until with get to the 1.5 million a day. That's myhope. I'm going to shut down the virus, but I never said I would do it intwo months. I said it took a long time to get here. It's going to take along time to beat it. I feel confident that by summer we're going to wellon our way to heading toward herd immunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  President Biden on fighting the coronavirus as well as the head ofCDC. Back with the panel. Mollie, obviously the president as a candidatespoke out about how the rollout was horrific, but now as president isobviously taking in charge of this and getting criticism.HEMINGWAY:  A little bit of criticism. He has said that much of his planwould be like President Trump's plan, but he is trying to spin it assomething very different. I do think it's interesting to look at thepolitical rollout in the states as well and particularly California whereGovernor Gavin Newsom had completely shut down the economy, really wentafter children in their schools, shutting down businesses. And this waspart of a thing that a lot of Democratic governors had done. And now he isfacing a recall, more than a million people have signed a petition torecall him. And all of a sudden he sounds like maybe he will be singing adifferent tune.This is just -- if you just take a step back here, we have a new president.Yes, some people are lifting restrictions, but it's just incredible that weare still at this level of lockdown even when the science doesn't supportthis level of lockdown.BAIER:  And the travel ban is going to be instituted for other countries aswell. Take a listen to the questions about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When President Trump was imposingtravel restrictions in March, specifically on China, then candidate Bidencalled it xenophobic and fearmongering. So now President Biden is puttingtravel restrictions on people coming in from other countries. What word dowe use to describe that?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He also, though, has supported,and himself even before, or we did, I should say, even before he wasinaugurated. Steps, travel restrictions in order to keep the Americanpeople safe, to ensure that we are getting the pandemic under control.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  President Biden saying Peter Doocy asks the tough questions, so heis going to continue to do that. Harold, what about this kind of one thingwas called one thing, and now it's something different?FORD:  Facts change, and circumstances change, which means your reactionsto them change. I'm always surprised when politicians say they've had thesame position for 40 years and expect to be applauded for that. Factsshould make you think differently. If the president is wrong aboutsomething, you just admit it. I think this president knows, PresidentBiden, whom I supported, if he does not get his arms around vaccinedistribution, there is no doubt inherited a mess with regard to vaccinedistribution.Disease and dysfunction defeated President Trump. What President Biden hasto understand, and I think he does fully, you have to get this distributionright and you have to get the economy reopened. Gavin Newsom is facingchallenges in California because people believe he shouldn't have gone outto a restaurant, and some other things that gathered around them. I thinkhe's right to be smart about the science and to follow it.But Democrats need to understand one thing -- but for disease, and but fordysfunction of this last president, Joe Biden would not have been elected.I'm a Democrat and I can say that. We have to get these two things right.It's only been five days, though. He's been in office for less than --let's give him a chance. I think he is on the right path, and if he is not,voters will say so in a few years.BAIER:  Bryon?YORK:  I think the president is trying to actually keep up with what'sgoing on with this disease right now. I say this with a lot of caution, butthe number of cases nationally has gone down fairly dramatically, down 33percent in the last 14 days. And the number of deaths is a laggingindicator of that, but it has begun to turn down five percent.And I think what you're seeing here is Joe Biden trying to adjust from hiscampaign rhetoric to governing rhetoric, saying today that may be a milliona day vaccinations won't work. It should be 1.5 million, that would be abetter number.BAIER:  OK, panel, when we come back, the impeachment article againstformer President Trump makes the walk from the House to the Senate, or atleast we think it will. Keep it here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR):  I don't think this trial, though, is within theSenate's constitutional authority. The impeachment power is designed toconvict and remove officeholders from office. The Constitution explicitlysays it applies to the president, the vice president, and civil officers.Donald Trump is none of those. He is a private citizen, and I think mostAmericans are going to think by the middle of February it's very strangethat the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove fromoffice a man who left office almost a month ago. There are many otherpressing priorities on which we could be focused.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Senator Tom Cotton on this show as you look live there in theCapitol. The article of impeachment will make its way over. Houseimpeachment managers literally taking the paperwork from one side of theCapitol to the other.Joining us now, Chad Pergram up on Capitol Hill. Chad, paint the picturefor us now.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER:  What we will see are nine Houseimpeachment managers led by Jamie Raskin, the Democratic congressman fromsuburban, Maryland. He is the lead impeachment manager or prosecutor thistime, escorting this sole Article of Impeachment across the capital fromthe House side moving across Statuary Hall, the old House chamber, throughthe Capitol Rotunda, past the office of the Senate Minority Leader MitchMcConnell, and then to the Senate floor.They will be led by Cheryl Johnson, who is the clerk of the House. She willhold the Article of Impeachment in two blue folders. The will be escortedby Timothy Blodgett. He is the acting House Sergeant at Arms. He replacesPaul Irving, who was relieved of his duties after the melee at the Capitolback on January 6th.This is the second time that we've had this happen in 53 weeks. This hasonly happened 21 times in American history where the House ofRepresentatives has impeached someone. Once they get to the House chamber,Jennifer Hemingway, who is the acting Sergeant at Arms in the Senate, shewill tell all senators that they have to remain silent, quote, "on pain ofimprisonment," that's the actual language that is used, and they will thenread the Article of Impeachment to the Senate.Something else that's different, Patrick Leahy, the President Pro Tem ofthe Senate, the most senior member of the majority party, he will be theperson overseeing this trial. John Roberts, the chief justice of the UnitedStates, will not preside here. And this is what Patrick Leahy said earliertoday, quote, "The President Pro Tem has historically presided overimpeachment trials of non-presidents." The next thing we will see istomorrow they will swear in the senators as jurors. And then they takeabout two weeks for both sides to get their legal briefs together. Andstarting on February 9th, that's when the Senate trial begins in earnest.Bret?BAIER:  Chad, you talked to a lot of people up there. Does anybody thinkthat they could get 17 Republicans to vote to convict?PERGRAM:  Certainly not right now, and this is something that LindseyGraham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said just a few minutesago, quote, he says I guess it depends on what state you're in and whatphase your political career is in. There might be a handful on Republicanson the Senate side who might vote to convict the president of the UnitedStates, and they will take their lead, some will, from Mitch McConnell, theSenate minority leader.Again, the other thing that you have to watch here for is if they were toconvict, Chuck Schumer, the new majority leader, says they would take asecond vote to permanently bar President Trump from ever taking office.That's a separate resolution. Keep in mind, they don't have to do that.They did not do that in 1989 with an impeachment trial for Alcee Hastingswho was a federal judge. And that's why Alcee Hastings has been CongressmanAlcee Hastings since 1993.BAIER:  And is there a feeling, Chad, that Mitch McConnell's stance onthis, and we should look at this, we are under two minutes now for thewalkover, that Mitch McConnell's stance is somehow as a result of losingcontrol of the Senate?PERGRAM:  It's a combination of things. There's no love loss between MitchMcConnell and President Trump. Mitch McConnell seems to blame the presidentas to why they lost control of the Senate. He is now the minority leader.There's a reason why it's 50-50 right now. Plus Mitch McConnell is aninstitutionalist. He was very bothered, and that might be a light termhere, about what happened on January 6th where you had this attack on theU.S. Capitol.BAIER:  That's right. Chad, as always, thank you. We'll again see that walkmomentarily.Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for thisSPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid, as they get ready to move.FOX NEWS PRIMETIME hosted by Maria Bartiromo starts right now.
