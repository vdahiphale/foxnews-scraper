Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Bromance
Delaware's Senate race jumped into the national spotlight after Tuesday's upset primary. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made it cle ar to The Hill that he is a big fan of Democratic nominee Chris Coons: "I'm going to be very honest with you -- Chris Coons -- everybody knows him in the Democratic Caucus. He's my pet. He's my favorite candidate." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, anyone seeking information about Republican nominee Christine O'Donnell has to look somewhere other than her official website. There is no information about O'Donnell or her positions on issues on her home page. There's only a button for supporters to donate to her campaign. A saved version of that page from Tuesday night included tabs with info about the candidate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And veteran Congressman Mike Castle has not yet communicated with O'Donnell since his loss to her, but he has been doing a lot of other communicating since Tuesday night. The Washington Post reports dozens of his colleagues have contacted the Republican and he has had conversations with both President Obama and Vice President Biden. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Catfight?
It looks like someone may be trying to stir up a catfight between Michelle Obama and her French counterpart, Carla Bruni. A book about Bruni set for Friday release claims when Mrs. Obama was asked by Bruni about her role as first lady, she responded: "It's hell. I can't stand it." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But Mrs. Obama's press secretary denies the first lady ever said it. So does the French embassy, which maintains the book was unauthorized.
Worth a Thousand Words 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Middle East peace talks held in Washington earlier this month are making headlines again thanks to a controversial photo of the leaders in attendance walking in the White House with President Obama. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the original image, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was to the left of and slightly behind the other leaders. But an Egyptian paper apparently altered the photo to give Mubarak a more prominent position.
The paper has since removed the doctored photo from its website but has not commented.  </pre>
