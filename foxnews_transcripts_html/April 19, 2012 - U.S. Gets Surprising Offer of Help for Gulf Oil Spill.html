Iran's Revolutionary Guard says it is a shame and disgrace for America and Britain that oil is still flowing into the Gulf two months after the spill began. And it wants to help.
A top Iranian general says if the U.S. asks for assistance in ending the environmental disaster, he will consider the request, "Despite the recent [United Nations] sanctions, the Guard will embark on its humane mission and take its exclusive and indigenous ability to the Gulf of Mexico."

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {

Jeb Bush wants President Obama to stop blaming his  brother, George W., for many of the country's problems. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The younger Bush tells The New York Times, "It's kind of like a kid coming to school saying, 'The dog ate my homework.' It's childish. This is what children do until they mature. They don't accept responsibility."
The former governor of Florida also thinks Obama is too focused on how he is portrayed in the media. Bush says, "Good God, man -- read a book! Go watch ESPN!" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

The National Institutes of Health devoted $670,000 each of the last three years to the study. The study explains Central Asia has experienced one of the fastest growing HIV-AIDS epidemics because of a sharp rise in injection drug use along drug-trafficking routes.  </pre>
