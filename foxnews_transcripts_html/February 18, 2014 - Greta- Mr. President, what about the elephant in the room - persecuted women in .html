'Off the Record', 2/18/14: I want our American POW back home, but what is the Obama administration doing for the women of Afghanistan we promised not to abandon to the vicious Taliban?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. The Obama administration is reportedly negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban to release a captured American soldier. It's tough to think of negotiating with the Taliban. They are evil, but I'm all for getting our POW home and as soon as possible.
But while we are on the topic of the Taliban, let's talk about the elephant in the room. The United States has repeatedly promised the women of Afghanistan that we will not abandon them to the Taliban and, we're doing that we're leaving. And the Taliban is moving right back in. No doubt about it, we are abandoning the women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I was in the room in Kabul, Afghanistan for one of those US promises, Secretary Clinton promising a full room of women of Afghani women that we will never desert them - and that's just not so. We are. I'm not suggesting this is an easy issue; it's not. Nor am I suggesting we stay in Afghanistan forever. But the United States is breaking its promise to Afghani women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I asked leader Nancy Pelosi about it and she said, in essence, not to worry, that we would not leave the women at the mercy of the "extreme" Taliban. Extreme Taliban? There is no such thing as "extreme" and "not extreme" Taliban. The Taliban is the Taliban. They are vicious to women, from denying them education to killing them and only because they are women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, what are we going to do? No one is talking about it. Mr. President, what about this elephant in the room?
