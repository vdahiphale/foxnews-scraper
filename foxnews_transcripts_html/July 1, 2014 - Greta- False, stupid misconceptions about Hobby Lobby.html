'Off the Record,' 7/1/14: Don't believe everything you read online about the Hobby Lobby case

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I don't know, but when I read some stuff online, I just want to pull my hair out. Some things are so stupid, so sloppy, and sometimes deliberately skewed to advance some selfish political agenda.
Today's example? Hobby Lobby. Many saying that Hobby Lobby is opposed to contraception for their employees. That's not only false, it's stupid. Sometimes I wonder if people actually take dumb pills because even a dimwit doing a tad bit of research would know Hobby Lobby does pay for some, but not all, contraception. It pays for the pill, the diaphragm, the patch, the ring, and other forms of contraception. What Hobby Lobby doesn't pay for are IUDs and the so-called "Morning After" or "Week After" pill, because those types violate their religious beliefs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Getting it wrong about Hobby Lobby accidentally is unfair. Getting it wrong deliberately for an agenda is a smear and is disgraceful. Whether one agrees with Hobby Lobby on its religious beliefs or not, at least get the facts right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, while some are demonizing Hobby Lobby for exercising their religious right, did you know that Hobby Lobby pays its full-time employees two times the minimum wage? Two times the minimum wage. Even the Hobby Lobby haters have to admit they can't be all that bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
