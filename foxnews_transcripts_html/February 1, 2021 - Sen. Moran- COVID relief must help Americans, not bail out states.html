GERRY BAKER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  You're looking live at the White House,where, in just one hour from now. 10 Republican senators will be meetingwith President Joe Biden on COVID relief, this as Democrats are stillaiming to push a bill through without GOP support.The meeting is seen as a key test for Biden's pledge for national unity.Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas will be in that meeting. And he'shere with us in a moment, but first to another storm.Here we see pictures of New York City and Boston, as a massive winter stormis wreaking havoc across the East Coast, with blizzard-like conditions.States of emergency have now been declared in parts of New York and NewJersey.Welcome, everyone. I'm Gerry Baker. I'm in for Neil Cavuto, and this isYOUR WORLD.We have got FOX News team coverage right now with Aishah Hasnie in thethick of it in New York City out there in the snow, meteorologist AdamKlotz on whether or not we have seen the worst of it.And so we begin with Aishah.AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Gerry. Good afternoon to you.The snow is relentless. That would be the word I would use to describe it.Here in Times Square, take a look around. I will show you what I'm talkingabout. The snow on the ground doesn't really look like it's been touched,right? It's been plowed at least two or three times today right in front ofus, and the snow just right back on top of it again, sometimes two to threeinches an hour.It's really incredible to see the plows and the shoveling cannot keep up.The city is bracing for 18 to 24 inches of snow, this, as you said, thecity and much of the state now under a state of emergency. We have got inperson classes that were canceled today. They're canceled for tomorrow aswell.Outdoor dining has been canceled. And those COVID-19 vaccine appointmentsat 20 different city-run sites, they have been canceled for today andtomorrow. The PATH train, which connects New Jersey to Manhattan, is nowsuspended. And those aboveground subway lines, they have been shut down.So, basically, the message tonight is, if you're not home yet, you may haveto find somewhere to hunker down here in the city.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  Bottom line is, this is a serious situation.It's nothing to be trifled with. Yes, we have had snowstorms before. Yes,we have been through it before. But this is a dangerous, life-threateningsituation.And, again, expect major closures, so you're not surprised.(END VIDEO CLIP)HASNIE:  Air travel is a big mess, too. Take a look, flights at L.A.Guardia all suspended; 83 percent of flights at JFK have been canceled, andthose last remaining flights at Newark expected to be canceled as well.Gerry, the last time New York City saw this much snow dumped on us was backin 2016. Folks out here, though, trying to enjoy it. We have seen somesnowball fights, but, otherwise, you got to stay at home to stay off theroads -- Gerry.BAKER:  Thanks, Aishah, just what New York City needs after lockdowns andCOVID and problems with getting the vaccines out. Thanks very much, Aishah.Well, the first winter storm bring blizzard-like conditions to theNortheast, as folks are trying to dig out. So, how long is this one goingto last, and where is it headed next?FOX News meteorologist Adam Klotz keeping track of it all from the FOXWeather Center -- Adam.ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hey, Gerry, you know what? We're onlyabout halfway through this storm system as it continues to drop some ofthat very heavy snow, across portions of New England. Here's what we'recurrently looking at on our satellite and radar, still large area herewhere you have winter storm watches and warnings, including D.C., up toPhiladelphia, New York and Boston, all major metropolitan areas where thissystem is far from over.Currently, we're looking at fairly widespread light snow to heavy snow.Those darker purple bands within that, that is where that snow gets reallyheavy, winds also going to be an issue.Now, consistently, throughout the day, we have seen winds getting up toaround 30 mile-an-hour gusts right on the shore. But there are some windsout at sea, 50 miles an hour. As this system gets a little bit closer toshore, we could see these winds intensify. And that's going to causedrifting and blowing and just more problems with this snow system.As far as where it's headed next, this is taking you into later thisevening. And you see that snow continuing to fall across portions of NewEngland, stretching down to New York and perhaps still Philadelphia at thispoint.By early tomorrow morning, you're beginning to see this lighten up just alittle bit. And by the time we get later in the day, this system does beginto clear off. Still some lingering snow showers, but the real brunt of thisis going to be happening today into really through the overnight hours.Now, so far, on the top end, we have seen areas getting up to close to 20inches of snow, but this is, again, not over yet. This is additionalsnowfall, so not totals, but additional. You get some of those darkergrays, those blues, that's getting up to another 12 to 18 inches of snow ontop of what we have already seen.So, how much is it going to be when it's all said and done? I think fairlywidespread, Gerry, 18 to 24 inches inland. Here in New York City, we'regoing to be 14 to 20 inches. We're already getting close to that. There'sstill plenty of more snow on the way. And, of course, we will be herewatching it -- back out to you.BAKER:  Thanks, Adam.Stay home. Another reason, I suppose, in this winter to stay home. Thanksvery much for that.Well, now to another storm, this one a fiscal one brewing on Capitol Hill.President Biden is set to meet with 10 Republicans shortly. They areproposing a $680 billion COVID relief package. Now, that's much smallerthan the $1.9 trillion that the president wants, this as Democrats say theyare prepared to go it alone with their plan.We're going to be speaking to one of those senators who's attending thatmeeting in a moment, Senator Moran of Kansas.But first a Kristin Fisher at the White House with the very latest --Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, President Joe Biden isreally wrestling with going big or going bipartisan, as he attempts to passthis monster $1.9 trillion stimulus package.Now, the White House says it is not necessarily an either/or. But the planthat these 10 moderate Republican senators put forward is less than a thirdof what President Biden is asking for. These Republicans want $160 billionfor vaccines and testing, which is on par with what the president wants,but the two sides split on stimulus checks. Republicans are asking for$1,000. The president wants $1,400.They also split on the amount of enhanced unemployment insurance. And thenthere's perhaps the biggest sticking point, funding for state and localgovernments. And these Republicans have set aside zero funding for it.So, these two sides are still very far apart. But the fact that thismeeting is even happening is very significant, because President Biden hasnow invited Republican lawmakers to the White House before Democrats.Listen to how the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, described thismeeting earlier today, which is now, this meeting, just about an hour away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  It's an exchange of ideas and anopportunity to do that.What this meeting is not is a forum for the president to make or accept anoffer.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER:  And she also said that the president's top concerns remain speed,getting this through Congress quickly, getting the help to the Americanpeople as fast as possible, and that this package is too small, not toobig.So, like I said, still a ways to go for these two sides to be able to cometogether and truly reach some sort of bipartisan compromise -- Gerry.BAKER:  Thanks, Kristin.Well, Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran will be among those lawmakersmeeting with the president shortly. He joins me now.Senator, thank you for being here.SEN. JERRY MORAN (R-KS):  Gerry, my pleasure. Thank you.BAKER:  So, Senator, your proposal with your Republican colleagues is, aswe just heard from Kristin there, a third -- really just about a third ofthe proposal that the president and the one that the Democrats support.What are you going to be telling the president this afternoon in an effortto maybe persuade him to come closer to your number?MORAN:  Well, I'm going to do everything I can to encourage the presidentto do something that is much more targeted and much less expensive than the$1.9 trillion package that the White House has proposed.We have been able to do that in a bipartisan way. I'm a pretty darnconservative Republican. And to spend this amount of money, I want to makesure it's going toward the relief of Americans who are suffering as aconsequence of COVID-19.And there's lots of things in this bill that are beyond that scope. And sowe have -- we have been successful the last four phases of Republicans andDemocrats working together to find common ground. Not everyone gets whatthey want.The president talks about a speedy opportunity to provide relief forAmericans. And I think we want that. And this is the fastest way to get itaccomplished. Reconciliation or other procedural means not only destroysthe bipartisanship that the president has promised. It reduces the timeframe -- it increases the time frame in which -- that we're able toaccomplish what the American people need.My view is, Mr. President, let's focus on vaccines. I think it's the mostimportant thing. More shots in more arms is the best thing that can happenfor our country's well-being, both from a health perspective and from aneconomic point of view.But I also want to make sure we get kids back in a classroom, that smallbusinesses get some assistance, and Americans who need the most help gethelp from this package. And we can do that in this -- in this efforttogether.BAKER:  Senator, the biggest difference, I think, between your proposal andthe president's is aid for states. In particular, the Democrats are verykeen on hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for states.You don't really -- you have very, very small amount for that and arelatively small amount for education that you mentioned, too. Is there a -- is there any room for movement there? Would you be prepared to go alittle further towards what the Democrats want, or are you really dead setagainst that kind of assistance?MORAN:  Well, what I would say is that I do not want Kansans or otherAmericans to pay for the mistakes, the fiscal irresponsibility of otherstates over a long period of time unrelated to COVID.And so I'm willing to be helpful to local units of government inparticular, states to some degree, but I think we can do that by focusingthe assistance, whatever assistance that might be, on the actual functionsof government that have been harmed by COVID-19, not just something thatbroadly helps states and local units of government, but something thathelps their taxpayers get through the challenges, the expenses ofresponding to the health care needs and the economic circumstances ofKansans.BAKER:  The president's come out of the blocks since Inauguration Day witha pretty aggressive progressive agenda, signing a bunch of executiveorders, presidential declarations on immigration, energy, on theenvironment, on some of these other things, too.It doesn't sound like this administration is in much of a mood tocompromise right now, despite his plea for unity. What will you say to himabout that?MORAN:  Well, I would indicate to the president that if we can't findcommon ground on this issue, COVID-19 response, it really sets the stagefor the inability to find common ground on many other things.COVID-19 has brought Congress and presidents together on four phases ofrelief. It's been done in a bipartisan way. There is a sense of interest onthe part of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to get something donein this regard. This is the greatest opportunity we have to do that.And while I am opposed to a number of the president's executive orders, I'mcertainly willing to work with him to get a more conservative, targetedresponse to COVID-19, and get it done quickly, to benefit Americans.BAKER:  Senator Moran, good luck there at the White House. We will be backtrying to find out what you found out.Thanks very much for joining us.MORAN:  Thank you very much, Gerry.BAKER:  Thank you.Well, after bidding up the likes of GameStop, day traders are now biddingup silver prices to put the squeeze on the big guys on Wall Street. And,right now, at least, the little guys appear to be winning. So, what doesall this mean for the average investor?And, later, if Chicago teachers start striking, as they have threatened,meet the parent who says she will be suing.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER:  Remember GameStop? Yes, that was so last week, because, at leastfor now, those Reddit-fueled day traders are turning their eyes and theirwallets to driving up silver prices.This is coming with Robinhood still putting some trading limits on certainstocks.So, to FOX Business Network's Lauren Simonetti with the latest.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The saga continues, Gerry.So, some stocks that were part of the Reddit army's short squeeze did closelower today, as Robinhood -- that's the free trading app making a lot ofthis possible -- slapped limits on eight popular names last night. Then,this afternoon, they rolled back some of those restrictions.For instance, it raised the limit on GameStop to 20 shares. Not much relieffor that stock, which closed down 30 percent, or the app. Robinhood hasbecome controversial since it moved to handcuff retail traders.And its CEO answered to that with Tesla CEO, Elon Musk.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA MOTORS:  Did you sell your clients down the river? Ordid you have no choice? And if you had no choice, that's understandable.But then we got to find out why you had no choice. And who are these peoplethat are saying you have no choice?VLADIMIR TENEV, CEO, ROBINHOOD:  I think that's fair. We have to complywith these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI:  And those include paying the clearinghouse $3 billion to backup the trades. So, if Robinhood restricts buying, it can lower the amountof capital it has to post.Look, this might have dented its reputation, but certainly not itspopularity. And, today, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion fromshareholders, giving it firepower to ride out this frenzy. So we will seewhere they tack next -- Gerry.BAKER:  Thanks, Lauren.So, what might Washington do to respond to all of this? Lawmakers on bothsides of the aisle told Neil that they're watching closely.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ROGER MARSHALL (R-KS):  How many people would watch the Super Bowl ifwe changed the rules at halftime? And that's what I feel like a lot ofinvestors feel like it, that everyone deserves equal opportunity to makemoney on Wall Street.We got to be careful here, not overreact. But let's take a dive and see,why did they pull the rug out from under us?SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD):  I just urge people to recognize that you shouldn'tplay games with your with your with your finances, you should get the bestadvice you can.We need transparency. And you need to make informed decisions.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAKER:  Other senators, like Democrat Elizabeth Warren, they have beendemanding an SEC investigation.Well, let's get the read from market watcher Scott Martin and Wall Streetveteran Ted Weisberg.Thanks, gentlemen, for joining me.SCOTT MARTIN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey, Gerry.BAKER:  So, Scott, let me start with you, if I may.What's the story here? There's a lot of criticism of Robinhood, thatthey're in the pocket of Wall Street, that they were on the side of the bigguys against the little guys, and that's why they have limited trading,still have limits on trading.They say, no, no, no, they had to place some additional capital with theclearinghouse. As you heard, senators are weighing in from all sides.What's your sense of the reality here? Is this Wall Street coming togetherto protect itself, or is this -- was this just such a big dislocation thatthey had really had no choice?MARTIN:  It was both.I mean, Wall Street is doing its best to protect itself and its interest,as it always does, Gerry. I think Robinhood, to their fault, was notprepared for this. So, with respect to how much money they have had to putup to the exchanges and, say, some of their prime brokers and some of theclearinghouses, you're right.I mean, that's money that they probably didn't expect to have to put up.But the one thing I will say what's going on now that's interesting, as youmentioned GameStop being so last week, and now this week being silver, isthat there are different players involved in this game, to use a word now,than there were last week, in the sense of maybe it started with the retailinvestor and Reddit message boards.Now I'm starting to see quite a few more institutions and money managersnow getting involved in this game, if you will. So, it's changed its colorover the last few days.BAKER:  Yes, Ted, is this -- so, we saw -- as Todd (sic) just said, we haveseen them now into -- the vigilantes have moved on from GameStop and thoseequities, those maybe underpriced, they would argue, equities ontocommodity markets today, with silver, pushing up silver prices.Is this, do you think now, a new financial reality, reality that financialmarkets have to deal with, this band of a significant number of individualinvestors who can come together and can really, really move -- move assetprices in this way?TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES CORPORATION:  Well, yes, Gerry,this is a huge topic, and that doesn't reduce itself to a few sound bites,unfortunately.BAKER:  Gives us a sound bite. I'm sorry.(LAUGHTER)WEISBERG:  But that's OK.But, first of all, it -- Wall Street is always risky. And we get these kindof markets. Usually, they get frothy, a lot of folks say, at the end of bigbull moves. This is not unusual. I have been in the business 50-plus years.I have seen this kind of action over and over again.But what's different this time is that the government, the SEC andCongress, changed the ground rules about 15 or 16 years ago. They took awaythe tick rule. We went to decimals and then to pennies. A lot -- andfragmented markets.A lot of things have changed over 15 years. The -- these seeds were plantedquite a long time ago. And now we're seeing the end results. I -- it'sinteresting to see senators or congressmen saying, well, we have to look atthis.They created this monster when they changed the entire market structure.And I get it's a case of unintended consequences of, maybe 15 or 10 yearsago, they didn't think they would see this. But what we're seeing is justinvestor interest, which is personified.I don't think, quite frankly, there's anything wrong with it. This is themarket structure. People take a chance. Obviously, it's risky. It's a bigboys game, and you need to put on your big boy pants, but it's just --these are the markets.BAKER:  Well, Ted, as you rightly said, this doesn't lend itself to a shortsound bite. But you gave us a very good summation there.We have to cut it off there and have a longer conversation sometime.Ted and Scott, thanks for -- Ted and Todd (sic), thanks very much forjoining us.We're looking live here now at Dorchester, Nebraska. That's just one ofmany towns losing jobs after President Biden's decision to lose theKeystone pipeline.So, is it time that this green push was placed on ice? Lawrence Jones isnext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER:  You're looking live at a snowy and icy Chicago, where there couldbe a teachers strike coming soon. We will have a parent who's ready to takethem to court.And Lawrence Jones is sounding a warning on the White House push to gogreen.We're back in 60 seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JIM JUSTICE (R-WV):  If you want civilization to advance today, weneed clean energy. And I'm all for it.But we just have to have a strategy, rather than a knee-jerk. And that'swhat we have going on right now. And it's -- it's going to backfire. It'sreally going to hurt us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAKER:  There's West Virginia Republican Governor Jim Justice telling Neilthis weekend that the Biden climate agenda is going to hurt his state.We're already seeing what it's doing to jobs, with the cancellation of theKeystone XL pipeline.FOX News; Alicia Acuna is in Dorchester, Nebraska, with a closer look atthat -- Alicia.ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Gerry.We want to show you something here, because it really exemplifies howthings came to a screeching halt. This is something that is just up theblock here from where we're standing. It's a field filled with pipesintended for the Keystone XL. Now they're just laying there.The impact on businesses in this village of 600 was immediate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LISA VEPROVSKY, OWNER, EAST SIDE BAR AND GRILL:  We had pipeline crews hereduring the COVID. It did help us because we serve meals to them, a lot oftakeout. Got to meet a lot of nice people.(END VIDEO CLIP)ACUNA:  Down the road, in Crete, Nebraska, folks are also frustrated,especially when the Biden administration suggested pipeline workers getjobs in solar.Truck driver Chris Olson fears his diesel costs will go up, but doubtsanyone in Washington cares.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS OLSON, TRUCK DRIVER:  It's flyover country. That's what they call us.We don't -- it's like we don't even exist. That's pretty much the -- whatthey think of us out here.(END VIDEO CLIP)ACUNA:  Work was under way on the Keystone XL set to run from Albertathrough Montana and the Midwest, bringing economic boost to towns along theway.But, Gerry, there are folks who are relieved by this shutdown. There werefarmers, ranchers, Native American tribes that had fought this for quitesome time -- Gerry.BAKER:  Thanks, Alicia.Well, Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso is among those slammingPresident Biden's climate orders, saying that they will take a sledgehammerto Western state economies.So, let's bring in FOX News analyst Lawrence Jones.Lawrence, thanks for joining us.LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS ANALYST:  Hey there, Gerry.BAKER:  So, you heard last week President Biden and certainly John Kerry,the climate czar, saying, well, no need to worry about all these jobs,they're going to get rid of these jobs, but all these people who work infossil fuels and coal mines and the oil industry and natural gas, they canall get great jobs in making solar panels.It sounds a little bit optimistic, to be -- to put it mildly.JONES:  I mean, some people will say optimistic. Others will say naive.I mean, are they going to go down there and help them find a job? I'm justa guy from Texas, right? And we depend on oil and gas. This was a campaignpromise. And I know throughout the past election, we spent a lot talkingabout personality.This should have been the center of the campaign, almost, because there'spolicies, and you can feel all day, but there's real-world consequences forthose actions. We're not just talking about jobs. We're talking aboutenergy prices going up.The fact is that cheap energy affects Americans as well. So, you got thejob proponent of this. And then, also, you have the fact that it's going tocause the poor to have to pay more for their energy. And this is not justthe first step from the Biden -- in 30 for 30 plan, there's a moratorium onfederal gas and oil leases.That means we're going to be importing a lot of that energy from othercountries. Now, they don't have the same environmental standards that wehave. So you would say, is this defeating the purpose, not only from afiscal standpoint, a real world standpoint, but also, if you really areagainst the way the climate is going, why would you start importing fromother countries that have worse standards?BAKER:  Right. And that is exactly as you say. I mean, the U.S. has becomeenergy self-sufficient for the first time in a long time in the last decadeor so.And no one thinks -- I think not even the optimists or the naive people inthe administration think that we're going to get quickly to energy self-sufficiency from wind and solar. So this does seem to -- as you say, it'salso the fossil fuel, especially natural gas, is so plentiful here, thatit's so cheap, that we are going to push up costs, we are going to makeourselves more dependent on foreign supply.It just seems that, at least for the short -- and I agree. The presidentwon the election. It was part of his agenda. But in the short term, whenthe economy is still adjusting after the COVID crisis, when there is somuch uncertainty in the economy, he just seems to be pressing ahead with aplan that maybe is going to do more damage in the short term than actuallywill benefit in the longer term.JONES:  Gerry, you say after the COVID crisis.I mean, we're still in it.BAKER:  Sure.JONES:  And just from a strategic standpoint, look, I understand that hewon, and I understand this is part of the policy.But just from a strategic standpoint, do you think it's the best time to dothis, when businesses are shut, people are still experiencing thispandemic, right? People are suffering right now. You want to go throughthis right now? This is your first agenda item. These are the executiveorders that you want to go -- this is why -- and I say this for everypresident -- going through Congress should be a priority, because these arethe people that represent the people.And because he's decided to go around that process, I don't think herealizes the impact that it's going to have on American citizens. But Ithink, when election comes around again -- we're already in election time,even though he's just been elected -- he will feel it.BAKER:  Yes, it doesn't exactly seem like a way to bring the countrytogether in the way that he promised to do in his inaugural address.Lawrence Jones, thanks very much, indeed, for joining us.JONES:  Thanks, Gerry.BAKER:  Well, to Chicago now, where teachers are on the verge of striking.Meet the parent who's on the verge of suing.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA CENTER FORINFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH:  We still want to get two doses in everyone.But I think, right now, in advance of this surge, we need to get as manyone doses in as many people over 65 as we possibly can to reduce theserious illness and deaths that are going to occur over the weeks ahead.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAKER:  That's a top epidemiologist who was an adviser to the Bidentransition team.He's urging people to get at least one shot now, as variants threaten tosend COVID cases spiking.The CDC director said today, not so fast. It's planning to stick with thetwo-shot regime that was approved for Pfizer and Moderna.So, what's the right plan of action here?Johns Hopkins University physician and FOX News contributor Dr. MartyMakary joins me now.Doctor, thanks so much, indeed, for joining me.DR. MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be with you.BAKER:  So, this is something that's seems to make sense. There is a highlevel of protection from one shot that we know. It's been done, by the way,I know, in the U.K. For example, my father had his shot and is waiting fora second one for some time.There does seem to be a high level of protection. So, this seems to becommonsense, right? Why would the CDC -- why is the official guidance stillto hold to -- to go with to make sure everybody gets two shots before thewider population can get the vaccine?MAKARY:  Well, I think we're seeing different opinions within the Bidenteam. We're seeing the old guard medical establishment -- that'srepresented by the CDC, the career staff, the people who issued therecommendations, the FDA career staff -- when they approved it, theyapproved it with this very strict recommendation that it needs to be givenus two doses.But I agree, Gerry, it is a terrible idea to be holding back vaccines rightnow in order to reserve a second dose. It's a terrible policy; 38 percentof the vaccines are sitting around at the state level right now. And thestates are arguing they're in part reserving some for the second dose; 80to 90 percent efficacy with the first dose.If we look at the data, the medical establishment has been oddly dismissiveof this data and from other vaccines. The longer you wait, the longer thegap between the first and second doses, in general, with HPV and othervaccines, you get stronger immunity.And that's why the U.K. is saying, try to wait out until closer to 12 weeksuntil you get your second dose.BAKER:  So, would this require, though -- I think the vaccine, the originalvaccines, when they received the approval, or emergency approval from theFDA, they did -- it was under the understanding that it will be a two-shotregime.If this were to change, if there were, as you say, after this debate withinthe administration, would that require a second round of approval by theFDA? And, if so, could it be done very quickly?MAKARY:  It should not require that, no.And I think what we need to do is, we need to recognize that we're in awartime situation. We have got to leave some of these old peacetimeframeworks. We have got to recognize we don't need to be paternal. We canshare the data and let people make their own decisions.If you look closely at the data, no one has ever died from missing ordelaying their second dose. That immune protection in the short-term isprobably 91 percent in that Pfizer study. The data didn't come out untilafter the authorization.And once we look at it, it's clear the first dose is very effective. Aslong as we're supply-constrained, we will save more lives by maximizing thefirst dose and then making around on the second dose.BAKER:  And, as you say, very quickly, if you -- Doctor, the numbers atclear. You could presumably double the number of people who can get atleast one dose of this very quickly if you made this move, right?MAKARY:  Exactly.We need to let go with this paternal mentality that patients come to us andwe scold them, and you have to do this and have to -- let's present thedata and let's like, let, let people make their own decision.BAKER:  Doctor, thanks very much, indeed, for joining me.MAKARY:  Thank you, Gerry.BAKER:  Well, to Chicago now, where teachers are threatening to go onstrike.Meet the parent who's already lawyering up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER:  Is the standoff between Chicago Public Schools and the teachersunion about to reach a breaking point?FOX News correspondent Mike Tobin on whether or not a strike could benearing -- Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Gerry, one thing I can tell youis that tens of thousands of parents in Chicago who so badly want theirsons and daughters in the classroom are just going to have to wait a whilelonger.Until when? Unfortunately, that is not clear. But in person instruction forkindergarten through eighth grade students was expected to resume today.But the schools sat empty all day, as the city and teachers union have notreached an agreement on safety protocols.In fact, Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot said city representatives sat on aZoom call, and the teachers union just stood them up yesterday. So,notifications were sent out to parents that, after almost a year, therewill still be no class today.The Chicago school crisis came up at the White House press briefing, JenPsaki dodged the issue, saying the president respects Mayor Lightfoot andsupports teachers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI:  He trust the mayor and the unions to work this out. They're bothprioritizing the right things, which is ensuring the health and safety ofthe kids and teachers and working to make sure that children in Chicago aregetting the education they deserve.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN:  Now, parents, some of whom have put their careers on hold, havegrown impatient.One parent told our John Roberts, when parents speak up on the subject,they are subject to cancel culture.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH SACHEN, MOTHER:  There is social media backlash from the public andunion representatives When parents speak out and we're mislabeled, and ourvoices are squashed, and we're bullied, our businesses and places of workare contacted.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN:  Now, the CEO of Chicago Public Schools promised yesterday, ifteachers didn't show up today, there would be cutoff from that technology.It's called Google Suites, the technology that the teachers use for theremote teaching.It's not clear if that happened. In fact, any moves the city or theteachers made today have not been public. Nothing is clear right now --Gerry.BAKER:  Thanks, Mike.Well, one of those Chicago parents who definitely isn't being silenced isAmmie Kessem. She's threatening to sue the teachers union. Ammie's also aRepublican committee member of the city's 41st Ward.And she joins me now with her attorney, Daniel Suhr.Thanks, both, for joining me.By the way, we -- I should say, we did call Mayor Lori Lightfoot and theChicago Teachers Union, but we haven't yet heard back from them.So, Ammie, let me start with you first.Your children -- you have children, obviously, who should be in school. Howlong have they been -- may I just ask, how long have they been out of --have they been out of the classroom?AMMIE KESSEM, MOTHER:  They have been out of the classroom for almost ayear now.BAKER:  And that's -- I mean, how are they managing?I mean, I have got a -- I have got a daughter who's still in high school. Iknow how difficult this is. It's just not giving them the kind of educationthat they need.KESSEM:  Yes.They're having a really hard time with us. I mean, just two weeks ago, wewere -- we had our hopes up. They had their hopes up. We had gotten theirschool supplies. And it's like they're on a roller-coaster ride right now.One day, they're being told, OK, tomorrow, you're going to school, yay.And then it's whipped right out from -- out from underneath them, late atnight, getting an e-mail saying, no, sorry, no school tomorrow. And it'sjust -- it's really hard on them.BAKER:  What do you think you can achieve with this lawsuit? Is thissomething -- you -- I mean, obviously, your aim is to get the teachers backin the classroom. But what happens? I mean, how does this work? How do youget them to go back?KESSEM:  You know, it's sad that it had to come to this, to where we had toget attorneys to step in.And, luckily, we had the Liberty Justice Center that was willing torepresent us pro bono. So, thank goodness that we have them for that.BAKER:  Daniel, if I may ask you, so, what's the basis of the lawsuit? It'sa breach of contract, is it, by the teachers? So, there's an assumedcontract between teachers and parents?How -- what's the legal argument here?DANIEL SUHR, ATTORNEY:  Yes, Gerry, our message to the teachers union todayis very clear. If you go on strike, we will see you in court. Parents arefed up.This is illegal under Illinois law. It's also a violation of the contractthat the teachers union agreed to two years ago. Parents just aren't goingto stand for it.BAKER:  And it's striking. I was looking at the some of the arguments theteachers unions have been using.They have been saying, for example, that they are -- they need to bevaccinated, they need to be one of the -- further up in line for thevaccine because they're essential workers.Yet, of course, essential workers have been working for the last -- for thelast year, and teachers obviously have been working. They have been -- andmany of them are working for them.And, by the way, we should say, we know, of course, many, many teachers,most teachers do want to work. They are working. They work very hard.But it does seem to be something. What is it about -- Daniel, if I may askyou, what is the teachers union argument for saying that it's unsafe to goback in the classroom? The science is very weak. Their legal case doesn'tseem very strong. What's their argument?SUHR:  Yes, Gerry, the teachers union here really doesn't have a leg tostand on.We're not asking them to rush into burning buildings. We're asking them togo to work to teach kids who are wearing masks and who are sociallydistanced.I think what's so frustrating here for parents is, they look across othercommunities in Chicagoland, across Illinois, across the country. They seeit's possible to go back to school safely. Chicago Public Schools should bedoing the same thing.BAKER:  Ammie, finally, if I may ask you, what do the teachers at yourkids' school make of this? I mean, what do they think about being sued byone of their students' parents?KESSEM:  Honestly, I don't know. I don't really have a good relationshipwith them, because I haven't met them in person yet.We're subjected to short minute -- 10-minute Zoom meetings. That's fast.But the bottom line is, I'm an essential worker. I have to be to work.People rely on me every day to patrol the streets, pandemic or no pandemic.I have to be there and do my job. And we're relying on them to do theirs.So they need to get these kids back into the classrooms as soon aspossible.BAKER:  Yes, very good luck to you. We will be following that closely overthe next few days.Thanks very much, Ammie and Daniel.KESSEM:  Thank you.SUHR:  Thank you, Gerry.BAKER:  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to look out for thelittle guy in the whole GameStop, and now we should add silver currency --silver commodity market story.Well, we will be talking to one of those so-called big guys on what hethinks should happen. You might be surprised.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER:  Robinhood has been continuing to ease trading restrictions today,raising its trading limit on GameStop shares.This is all part of the ongoing drama, which, for the last week or so, orlonger than that, actually, has been pitting Wall Street bigwigs againstonline day traders.Well, I want to get the read from one of those bigwigs, if I may call himthat, co-founder of Avenue Capital Group and co-owner of the MilwaukeeBucks, Marc Lasry.Marc, thanks for joining me.MARC LASRY, CO-OWNER, MILWAUKEE BUCKS:  My pleasure. How you doing?BAKER:  Good, thanks.So, what's your take, Marc? It's been -- you have read all the -- you havebeen in the markets for a while and you have seen all this stuff in thelast week about how this is the little guy taking on the big guy on WallStreet, bringing them down, this is the -- all part of the populistrevolution, it's all a big change, and the hedge fund guys are allterrified and fighting back.Give us your take. How do you see what's been going on?LASRY:  I think it's a little simpler.I mean, people have made it much more complicated than it is. And at theend of the day, really, all that happened is, I think a number of WallStreet firms had shorted the stock.If you think about it, what WallStreetBets and sort of Reddit did is say,hey, on GameStop, there's more than 100 percent short interest, which meansthat more than the amount of shares are outstanding, a number of people onWall Street had shorted those.Well, all you need to do is start buying those stock -- that stock, and, asthe price moves up, it forces people to cover their positions, and that's -- and especially when I think Melvin and a couple of funds are leveredanywhere between five to 10 times when they put on this trade.So, the stock, I think, went from sort of $15. Then, a week later, it's$39. And then, like two or three days later, it's $300, and then it wentall the way up to $483. In a situation like that, look, I think it wasfine. I think, if day traders are going to end up buying the stock, there'sno problem with that.They're going to pick -- they're going to pick companies where the shortinterest is over 100 percent. If you have enough people buying, the priceof that stock will move up. I mean, today, the stock was down $100.And the reason for is, the short interest is dropping. So, it's much harderto end up forcing people to buy in. That's really what ended up happening.BAKER:  What about this argument about manipulation, that some people say,look, if you're an institution, if you're a dealer or a trader, you can'tmanipulate, you can't collude to manipulate a price up, but if you're theseday traders, you can come together on a social media site, WallStreetBets,and you can do that?LASRY:  Right.BAKER:  And people are calling for an investigation. You saw ElizabethWarren over the weekend saying the SEC has got to look into this.Is this -- was the -- do you think there was manipulation? Or do you thinkthis was just -- I mean, does it count as manipulation when day traders dothis?LASRY:  I would say to you, if -- let's put it this way.If five people on Wall Street had done that, it would have been aviolation, and you would have been -- you would have had a massiveinvestigation.BAKER:  Right.LASRY:  So, now the tide is on the other side, and the question -- yes, Ithink it was wrong.But, look, I think it's a -- people are going to have to figure that out.But Wall Street professionals are not allowed to do that. So, that's sortof how I look at it.BAKER:  And there's wider calls for regulation here, that the -- there'sbeen question marks about what exactly Robinhood was doing when it limitedtrading, although they say -- and they seem to be very clear about this --that they had to -- they were obviously having some capital and liquidityissues because the volatility was so much and the volume was so much.But people are calling for a full-scale -- a thorough review of regulation,Washington needs to get involved in this.What's your view, as a participant in these markets? There is regulation,as you know. I mean, do the markets -- are the other markets working OK, ordo we need -- do we need more government intervention?LASRY:  Oh, look, I think the market is working fine.Really, what happened with Robinhood is, if somebody bought 100 shares, andif you think about it, 100 shares at $300, that's $30,000, right?What Robinhood was worried about was that -- and they knew that the pricewas going to go down -- that, as sort of the short interest starts goingaway, then, if all of a sudden, the stock price -- like what happenedtoday, it drops 100 points. Well, that means that now that stock is worth$20,000.What happens if that person doesn't pony up the money? Robinhood is the onethat's on the hook.BAKER:  Got to -- I got...LASRY:  So, I think all Robinhood was doing was trying to protectthemselves.BAKER:  Marc, I got to wrap you up there.Good luck to those Milwaukee Bucks. I know -- I know that is your other biginterest.LASRY:  Thank you.BAKER:  Thanks very much, indeed, Marc Lasry, for joining me.Well, that White House meeting between President Biden and 10 Republicansenators on COVID relief is about to get under way.Senator Todd Young is one of them.
