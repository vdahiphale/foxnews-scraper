LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I have a mug, do you want it - can I tellyou what's on the mug?HANNITY: Tell me what's on the mug because I can't see it. I can't see youeither.INGRAHAM: Oh, great. That's not a bad thing. All right. I'm not arguing,I'm just explaining why I'm right. I don't know why; this always ends upnext to me on set. I have no idea.HANNITY: I can see it now on delay, hold on.INGRAHAM: Yes, it's really--HANNITY: I like it.INGRAHAM: Yes. Right. So, this is perfect, but I don't know why, and I justnoticed tonight, why do I always have the same mug. Well maybe it's becauseI do the show the way I do it. This is going to be a total circus.HANNITY: I like my Yeti cup. Have you ever tried a Yeti cup because itkeeps your ice cold forever? And it keeps your coffee hot forever. It'sgreat.INGRAHAM: Yes, it's fascinating. I think the gin that you have on there -in there made the show a lot better tonight.HANNITY: See, it's a clear liquid, I can pour a little.INGRAHAM: Yes, OK.HANNITY: It could be vodka, but it's not.INGRAHAM: I see the alignment there. Hannity, awesome show. And we'll bewatching tomorrow.HANNITY: All right, Laura, have a great show.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLEfrom Washington tonight. Now for the American Left, tomorrow, as Sean wastalking about, is the real Super Bowl. But why are there still so manyoutstanding questions regarding the events of January 6th? We'll lay themout.Also, tonight, will you need a vaccine certificate to get on an airplane? Iwarned you about this last March, believe it or not. A former airline CEOsays this will be a total disaster if Biden pushes it. And how politicspushed a billionaire musician into becoming a fake cowboy? Raymond Arroyobreaks that all down and more is Seen and Unseen. But first, Biden'sinsurrection. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.All right. Let's face it. The Democrats and the media that serve them,they're like addicts looking for their next fix, and their drug of choiceover the past five years has been Donald J. Trump. They just cannot quithim. And this week they'll snort, inhale and smoke Trump 24/7, as they tryto suck you into their downward spiral.If you're conservative and you voted for Trump, they want you demoralizedby the impeachment proceedings and the January 6th riot. And they want foryou to believe that things were never going to get better.If you're a Democrat voter, they want you possessed by Trump hatred andobsessed with punishing anyone who ever supported him. Now why? Because ifyou really keep your eye on what's really happening out there, you're goingto realize that Biden isn't running anything. He's barely awake.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Bible tells us weepingmay endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: And if you don't fall for their shiny objects stick, you're alsogoing to see that his team is populated by snotty, entitled, overeducated,underperforming goof balls. They're slowly but surely dismantling oureconomy, attacking our prosperity, and opening the door to an endlessstream of illegal aliens, drug dealers and gang members.The New York Times and Washington Post shockingly admitted over the weekendthat Biden's presidency is about to get slammed by thousands upon thousandsof families and unaccompanied minors, all illegal immigrants at thesouthern border.Now, if we had a Congress that was focused on protecting American jobs,safety, health care and education, they would immediately tighten asylumlaws. Remember, Trump's common-sense policy required that applicants fromCentral America who want to seek asylum in our country, they had to passthrough Mexico on the way. They had to declare they're not after illegallycrossing our border. But last week, Biden did away with that and that's notthe only thing he's going to effectively dismantle our entire immigrationenforcement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: So, there's some new reporting thatICE is going to get some new guidance to no longer focus on deportingillegal immigrants who have been convicted of DUI, simple assault,solicitation, drug-based crimes. And I'm curious how that is in theinterest of public safety.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Nobody is saying that DUI orassault are acceptable behavior and those arrested for such activity shouldbe tried and sentenced as appropriate by local law enforcement. But we'retalking about the prioritization of who is going to be deported from thecountry.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Yes, they're just inconvenience. Let the local law enforcementdeal with it, keep it welcoming more. Now think about this at a time whenwe're seeing more crime, fewer jobs and millions of kids stuck in Zoom helland not in school, Biden's team focuses on shielding illegals fromdeportation because he doesn't want to put them through too much stress.Yes, they have to tell the truth on government forms, but if they lie, noproblem. The new ruling from USCIS essentially locks in President Biden'swishes to end the deportation of illegals, even if they are caught lyingabout their applications for U.S. taxpayer funded services, a green card orasylum.Now, if that's not enough to make your blood boil, The Washington Post addsthat ICE agents seeking to arrest fugitives outside of jails and prisonswill need prior approval from the agency's director in Washington. Gangtattoos or records showing loose affiliation with gang activity would alsonot meet the narrow criteria.Folks, this is one big bienvenidos MS-13, a billboard flashing might aswell be across Central America and beyond. Biden's open borders zealotshave what they want, big business. They get their slave labor and thesocial justice warriors, the Far-Left squad types, they have their newpopulation that can be molded and formed into Socialist Party faithful.Eventually, they hope to swamp the voting power of all of you Americans outthere who still know the country's traditions, constitution, and history.And heck, you may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegalsarriving since Biden's inauguration, they get to stay free of charge.San Diego arranged housing for hundreds of arriving migrants in a downtownhigh-rise hotel where they're being quarantined before being allowed tojoin family or friends in the interior of the United States. It sounds sopleasant. Can you believe that at a time when our own people are suffering?Now, that takes us back to tomorrow's Barnum and Bailey revival in theSenate. Democrats are arguing that Trump welcomed and incited a violentincursion into the Capitol. When it is, they who are enticing illegals tobust through our borders, exploit our resources and commit crimes, andwe're not talking about a few hundred, we're talking hundreds of thousands,eventually millions if the Democrats have their way.There is an insurrection taking place against America all right. It's beengoing on for years in the deepest depth of the D.C. swamp, and now itsfigurehead resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. This insurrection seeks tooverthrow everything we love about America by defaming it, silencing it,and even prosecuting it. This is an organized mob funded by billionaires.It's supported by celebrities, and it's aided and abetted by propagandisticnews organizations every single step of the way.These insurrectionists have stormed our schools with BLM indoctrinators.They shuttered our classrooms by empowering union heavies. They'veoverwhelmed small businesses with idiotic, stupid lockdowns. They've robbedAmericans of good paying oil and gas jobs with obscene climate changedictates. They've ripped down historical markers from Washington toLincoln. They've terrorized patriotic Americans who are now afraid to justspeak their minds. They burn police precincts, they've taken over entirecity blocks, and not just for a few hours, by the way, but for weeks, andas in Portland, months.So, as they dangle their shimmery impeachment bauble in front of you thisweek, we will methodically and relentlessly expose their real aims andalso, we'll expose those providing aid and comfort.Soon, America will see who the real threat to democracy is, and how thegood guys once again can prevail. And that's THE ANGLE.Joining me now is Ken Cuccinelli, former Acting DHS Deputy Secretary. Ken,this is more than just a difference of opinion on immigration, tweakingthis or that policy. This is endangering American lives tonight.KEN CUCCINELLI, FORMER ACTING DHS DEPUTY SECRETARY: Oh, absolutely, andwithout concern for endangering those lives, I mean, when you see them blowoff DUIs, I wonder if the Mothers Against Drunk Driving were supporting JoeBiden knowing he was going to turn down drunk drivers loose, leave him inthis country who we were deporting.And to Jim Psaki's comment about, well, it's just about priorities. No, no,they are funneling down the number of deportations dramatically by theselimitations. They're trying to basically say, if he didn't provably murderor rape somebody, you don't get deported.Well, that doesn't leave ICE a lot to do and yet we have 11 million, maybetens of millions of illegals here and they're inviting hundreds ofthousands more who are rushing our border, creating, as we said they would,a humanitarian crisis at the border and soon in the border communities.INGRAHAM: This is from ICE's fiscal year 2020 report. They conducted a185,000, 884 removals during FY2020. The vast majority, 92 percent hadcriminal convictions or pending criminal charges.CUCCINELLI: Right.INGRAHAM: Those removed included 4276 known or suspected gang members and31 known or suspected terrorists. Ken, 185,000. Looking at the Bidencriteria now, it seems like most of those people, with the exception ofmaybe the terrorists and even who knows about those, would be able to stayhere.CUCCINELLI: Yes, I strongly suspect that you will see them attempt to cutthat number by more than half. And by the way, Laura, when Biden was vicepresident, they deported over 400,000 people in one year. So, Joe Biden isnot - this is a political shift. We could deport far more if Congress wouldcooperate and the courts wouldn't stand in the way, creating hurdles allover the place as they did during the Trump administration. This is thedirection they want to go.INGRAHAM: Well, people have to understand is because I was down there, andI witnessed this happening firsthand. And at Eagle Pass Station through DelRio. So, people come across the border, they float the Rio Grande, and someparts of the Rio Grande are very shallow and it's still dangerous. It'svery dangerous. They walk them across on a pool float or a raft, thenthey're rescued by the Border Patrol. Then their names are taken. They'reprocessed briefly. And then a lot of those people, while all those peoplenow are just going to be released in society.There's no returning people to Mexico, there's no requirement that youapply for asylum while in your home country. Biden has gutted all of that.So, this is a big welcome sign at the border. Come and you'll be able tostay. That's the insurrection. That is a major insurrection.CUCCINELLI: Right. Well, and that's the message they've sent, and they haveexploded, exploded the daily illegal crossing numbers. You remember theTrump effect four years ago, the lowest drop there in illegal crossings ina long, long time. Now we have the Biden effect, and it is exactly theopposite, it's an explosion of crossings while tying the hands of officersfrom dealing with it.INGRAHAM: Well, the great thing is, they'll all be able to get vaccinatedwhen elderly people I know in California still can't get their vaccines,but at least the illegal immigrants will get vaccine. Yes, fantastic. Ken,thanks so much. Great to see you.And what's the real reason the Democrats and their media pals are hypingimpeachment or a congressman's committee assignments? Because, again, itdistracts you from what their real plans are, the ongoing insurrectionagainst our Constitution and everything we love about this country. They'drather you focus on this impeachment issue, even though that's goingnowhere.Joining us now, I'm delighted they're with us. And this is Victor DavisHanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Dinesh D'Souza, conservativecommentator, filmmaker, host of The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast.Dinesh, how does the regular person out there who's been really demoralizedsince the election, how do they go forward knowing that this is going toturn around, given what's happening before their eyes?DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, I think we have to behonest and recognize that things are likely to get worse before they getbetter, if they get better at all.In other words, we had warned before the election that these people weregoing to do a lot of damage that the American dream to some degree hung inthe balance, that this was a very important election and Americanexceptionalism was on the ballot.Now, we can't turn around now and say, oh, gee, we were exaggerating. Wewere kidding. No. A lot of the bad things that Biden stood for; he is goingto carry out. And that means that we're going to see with dismay thingshappen to our country that we perhaps never thought possible in ourlifetime.But what that also means is that Americans who are on the fence, who may bevoting for Biden can look around and go, wow, is this what I really votedfor? Or do I want to see the dismantling of what makes America unique? Andthose people perhaps will have a second thought vote for the midtermelection two years from now and then for the presidential election in 2024.INGRAHAM: Victor, just going back to the point of illegal immigrantscrossing our border during the COVID pandemic, when most Americans arebeing told not to travel, still, they're being put up in hotels. Americans,most of them haven't been to a hotel for ages and then they're just beingreleased into society. I think that one fact infuriates most people, evenpeople who didn't vote for Trump. I don't think it sits well with them.VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: Yes, and it's self-destructive because the government is destroying the sanctity of their ownedicts, so people say to themselves, I don't think I really need avaccination, or I don't really understand why I can't do this, or I shouldwear this or I should quarantine this. When you're letting literallythousands of people come in with a standard that you don't apply to them,but you do to your own citizens as if citizenship is a disadvantage.And so, while all this is going on, Laura, there's a lot of things thatwe're not talking about. We're $28 trillion in debt. We're going to borrowanother trillion. 2 trillion. Are we going to inflate our way out of it orare we going to have stagflation, are we going to have permanent zerointerest rates? We're really changing the way we do business in government.We never had one party say to the other party, that fringe candidate orthat fringe member can't be in a committee or we've never had a situationwhere we're impeaching somebody out of office and the chief justice won'tbe presiding over - these are radical, radical ideas.And then the reason this is the freest, most secure, and most prosperouscountry is individual creativity and freedom of speech. The reason, theIslamic world stagnated was mullahs were over everybody's shoulders andsaying, don't do that because it impinges on the sanctity of Islam. Or Idon't read research in my field in the 1950's from Eastern Europe or theSoviet Union, because I know it's contaminated with common course saying,direct your research this way. That's what's happening.We're spending billions of dollars and hundreds of billions of people'shours in what, I don't know what we call equity czars, inclusion, anddiversity work.INGRAHAM: It's all a distraction.HANSON: And it's very unproductive. Yes, but it's really harmingindividuals.INGRAHAM: I've got to get in another question to Dinesh here.HANSON: Everybody's paranoid that if they say something--INGRAHAM: They're afraid.HANSON: Their distant past will come out and they're altering theirresearch or their--INGRAHAM: But Dinesh, I think everyone has got to get off their heels andget on the offensive here, in a thoughtful, smart way. They're the realracists. They're the ones giving people benefits based on race or takingthem away based on race. And it has to be called out. We cannot be back onour heels. These people are the biggest frauds ever. They use their privatejets. They fly around the world. Then they lecture everyone else abouttheir green agenda as they're destroying lives, including the oil pipelineworkers. And those are really great Americans who had great jobs. Andagain, I don't think this sits well with people. I don't think this is whatpeople thought they were going to get.HANSON: Well, and also, they - these are people who suddenly claim to beshocked about the violence on January 6th and so on, where they've beenencouraging violence, egging it on, putting up bail money, saying that therioting should continue and will continue. That's Kamala Harris. So, Ithink that Trump has an opportunity here and the opportunity is not to makea narrow constitutional defense and basically say, in effect, thatprocedurally he should win the day, but defend himself on the charge ofincitement by showing all the incitement on the other side.So, the violence of the Left is put on full display for the American peopleto see. In some ways Trump's radioactivity, the fact that he's been so muchthe focus of attention has diverted people from seeing what the Left isdoing. It's important for us to now bring their activity to center stage.INGRAHAM: And Victor, I have to get to this question about Liz Cheney, whois the gift that keeps on giving to the Democrats and the mainstream media.She comes out over the weekend and basically says Donald Trump has no rolein the future of the party, in her own party, in her own state, basicallyvoted to censure her. So, why do we have gatekeepers in the RepublicanParty telling most of the party, sorry, this guy that you like can't haveany role.I'm not saying he's going to have a role or even should have a role. I'mjust saying how did we get to that point? Like one person said, oh, no, youhave no voice.HANSON: I think she's caught up in the frenzy of the moment and she hasn'treflected that the agenda that Trump inaugurated is very popular and that'sthe future of the Republican Party. And on your other point, it's innate tohuman nature. Laura, deterrence. Have you noticed that the conversation haschanged on the impeachment, the last week? Because the House membersfinally said, Maxine Waters said this, get in your face. Joe Biden said hewas going to take the President of the United States and beat him up.Kamala Harris wanted to bail out and all of a sudden, they're defensive andthey're saying this isn't fair. You can't do this.And I hate to say it, but without deterrence, human nature being what itis, people will become aggressive. And when you deter them and say, if yougo there, this is what we're going to do, tit-for-tat, then people behave.And I think that's what the Republicans, unfortunately, they're going tohave to do that. If they play defense and they're passive, they're going tolose all deterrence and they're going to erode in their nothingness.INGRAHAM: Gentlemen, great to see both of you.HANSON: I've got to say, for every committee member--INGRAHAM: Yes, we've got to roll. As the constitutionally challengeimpeachment trial does begin tomorrow, there's still unanswered questionsabout the January 6th riots that sparked this effort. We're going to tellyou what they are in moments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: What happened on January 6th in our nation's capital washorrendous. We all know that. But given that it's the basis for the secondimpeachment farce of the former president, why are there still so manyunanswered questions about that day?For instance, what caused the death of Capitol Police Officer BrianSicknick? What's the status of the investigation into the shooting ofAshley Babbitt? Will it be ruled justifiable, as media reports suggest, andwill we ever learn the name of the officer who actually pulled the trigger?She was unarmed. My next guest has been trying to get answers to thosequestions to no avail so far at least. Joining us now, Byron York,Washington Examiner Chief Political Correspondent, Fox News Contributor,author of Obsession.Byron, I read your column about this, and it was very methodical. Youbasically just laid out the questions. You went to the Capitol Police toget answers and.BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: And no answers, about 10 days ago, I sentthe questions you just recited, plus several more, how many injuries werethere among Capitol Police officers? Did Capitol Police officers confiscateany firearms from rioters? Did either Capitol Police officers or riotersfire any weapons other than the killing of Ashley Babbitt? There are justso many fundamental things that we don't know about this. I sent thesequestions about 10 days ago, have followed up a few times and have notreceived any answers on them.INGRAHAM: Well, the death of Officer Sicknick, which was so tragic andhorrible, obviously his remains were lying in state and the Capitol, it wasextremely moving. But is it - we really don't know how he died, or do wehave any information on that?YORK: Well, you remember, we all seem to hear from somewhere that OfficerSicknick died as a result of being hit in the head with a fireextinguisher. And it was plausible, I mean, so many things were beingthrown. It was just a very violent effort to break into the Capitol. Therewere all sorts of clashes going on, but the days went by and we never heardany follow-up on that.And recently, we've had some reports, there was one in the media and thenthe police chief of Washington, D.C., the Metropolitan Police gave a pressbriefing a couple of days ago and suggested that there really wasn't anyevidence that Officer Sicknick had been hit with a fire extinguisher orthat there was any blunt force trauma, and that the medical examiner wasstill searching for a cause of death, trying to determine a cause of death.One of the questions I asked was, was there an autopsy report for OfficerSicknick and would it be released? And that was not answered either, huh?INGRAHAM: Very interesting. Yes, this is very strange. I mean, it soundslike an incredible man, incredible life. And why don't we know the answersto that? I mean, that's just why are they answering your question?YORK: I don't want to suggest that there's any weird conspiracy or anythinggoing on here, but the Capitol Police seem to be darn secretive about somany of these fundamental facts.INGRAHAM: But why, why are they?YORK: I don't know. As you said, this is a huge part of our politicaldebate today, not just the impeachment trial. And by the way, the HouseImpeachment Managers trial memorandum says specifically that aninsurrectionist killed Officer Cygnet by hitting him in the head with afire extinguisher. It's right in there in the Democratic memo here. So,this is a part of our political conversation and we need to know the facts.INGRAHAM: And Ashley Babbitt dead. I mean, she was shot. And again, wedon't know much more about that. It's all horrendous.YORK: Well, there have been some leaks. There have been some leaks tosuggest that was just - that investigators have decided it was justified.But again, we don't know because the Capitol Police have not told usanything publicly.INGRAHAM: Yes. Byron, thank you so much. It's good to see you. And when itcomes to impeachment, there's this unanswered question. How is theconstitutional affair for the trial to be presided over by a Democratsenator and not the Supreme Court chief justice? We all know that once it'sover, Senator Patrick Leahy is going to take off his robe and then justimmediately go vote to convict former President Trump.Joining me now is Ken Starr, former independent counsel and FOX Newscontributor. Ken, as a former appellate court judge in the D.C. circuityourself, should this be considered odd or a potential conflict, or is thisjust the way it goes in that crazy place on Capitol Hill?KEN STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL:  It's even worse. It is a blatantdue process violation. Fundamental to our law since Magna Carta 800 yearsago is the English speaking world, but certainly the United States ofAmerica, you get a fair trial by having a presiding officer, a judge, whois unbiased. And that's the reason that the Constitution built in thespecific provision for the chief justice of the United States to preside.But of course, the House managed to allow the president of the UnitedStates to leave. They could have brought the articles over and then thetrial begun, and the chief justice would have presided. This is a violationof due process.INGRAHAM:  And Ken, Senator Ed Markey says that, well, impeachment is theonly option.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ED MARKEY, (D-MA):  We don't have a historic constitutional option notto have this trial. We don't have a choice. Otherwise, future presidents,future officeholders will feel as though they can act with impunity.We do not have an opportunity to look away.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:  Ken, what is he missing here? They are so obsessed with Trump. Isaid that in the monologue. They can't quit Trump. They need Trump. He'sthe oxygen for the Democrats. Otherwise, we have to talk about howhorrendous their policies are, Ken.STARR:  They should do it in a constitutionally appropriate way, and theycould have. They are not following the Constitution. And I know there arelots of scholars who say no, no, no. They can do this. We can have eternalimpeachment. Any time you want to impeach someone, go ahead and impeach,because the key is, if they are unworthy of holding office, don't leave itto the voters, don't leave it to the democratic process. And I view that asunconstitutional as well.Looking back to the Supreme Court's decision in the case called Powellversus McCormack, you can't exclude a House member. You can kick the Housemember out for misconduct once the House member has been admitted into --but you can't rob the people of this country from the right to choose theirleaders. And now that's what's happening with someone who is a privatecitizen.I also think for good measure, it is a bill of attainder, they are tryingto put a punishment to a private citizen, and that's wrong as well, on somany points. But let's just begin with this where we started. You've got tohave an unbiased judge, and Pat Leahy, for all his experience is notunbiased, and that's a due process violation.INGRAHAM:  Ken, I might have missed this, but did John Roberts just notanswer their calls? How did that go down? I don't even know how it went --I'm getting my hair done or my nails done, or whatever. What happenedthere?STARR:  We don't know. This is like Byron York, we're not entirely sure. Wehave a CNN report. That's not the way to run the government. There shouldbe a formal letter from the Senate, and then there should be a responsefrom the chief justice of the United States, not I'm busy, but excuse me,but the president of the United States is not being tried and therefore itwould be unconstitutional for me to walk across the lawn, take the gavel.INGRAHAM:  The chief didn't want to pronounce at all. He didn't want topronounce. Ken, great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.And coming up, some bold comments that were less than super, and an echoeduring a presidential interview, did you hear it? Raymond Arroyo, "Seen andUnseen," next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  It's time for our "Seen and Unseen" segment, where we unpack thecultural stories of the day. And for that we turn to FOX News contributor,author of the forthcoming book "The Thief who Stole Heaven," RaymondArroyo. All right, Ray, the Super Bowl is always an indicator of where weare as a nation, or at least where the media would like us to be. So whatdid you see?(LAUGHTER)RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  For anyone who was watching thefawning pregame CBS interview with the president, Laura, it's clear theywant us to know Biden is fine. At times it was like a game of telephonewhere Norah O'Donnell said one thing, and Biden simply repeated it aftershe reminded him of his job description. That interview is tonight's"Marquis Malarkey."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Bunch of malarkey!(MUSIC)NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS EVENING NEWS ANCHOR:  You're president of the UnitedStates, commander-in-chief. Can you do something in terms of going toModerna, going to Pfizer, saying, we need more production?JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, I think, because we'vealready done it.O'DONNELL:  There is a mental health crisis happening.BIDEN:  There really is.O'DONNELL:  Women are dropping out of the workforce. Is this a nationalemergency?BIDEN:  It is a national emergency. It genuinely is a national emergency.O'DONNELL:  Do you think it's time for schools to reopen?BERMAN:  I think it's time for schools to reopen safely.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:  Laura, you are the host of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE, a mother. Wasn'tthat a perceptive interview?INGRAHAM:  That was a perceptive interview.ARROYO:  Would you say it was groundbreaking?INGRAHAM:  I would say it was groundbreaking.(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:  This was the most stilted -- all I have to say is --INGRAHAM:  I don't even have words for it. At that point --ARROYO:  -- the guy who cut this interview deserves his own governmentcheck, Laura. My Lord, he must have been in there all day. It wasunbelievable.But Biden today was back at it without an editor, Laura. He did a virtualtour of an Arizona vaccination site live with a registered nurse. Pleasewatch Kamala Harris in the lower part of your screen as the president getsa little creepy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Are you a freshman at theuniversity?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN:  You look like a freshman.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you. I'm a nurse. I'm an RN. I've been an RNfor about nine years now.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:  That's a nice way of saying please don't smell my hair.(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:  Virtual visits, Laura, are sometimes a bless, unless you're KamalaHarris. She looked like she was sweating there for a second.INGRAHAM:  You can't get handsy virtual, not yet at least, so that was thesaving grace. But I like the best part, Raymond, is heh, heh, heh.(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:  He knew what he was doing. Thank goodness it was virtual.INGRAHAM:  One of the most engaging moments of the Super Bowl was BruceSpringsteen as a pitchman for unity in this, well, cornpone commercial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, SINGER/SONGWRITER:  There is a chapel in Kansas standingon the exact center of the lower 48. We need the middle. We just have toremember the very soil we stand on is common ground.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:  Now we're talking about common ground, Laura. This guy, you wouldnever know he's from New Jersey. This is like Chris Christie or Bon Joviputting hat on and playing Longmire out in the plains of Kansas. This madeno sense, and I don't think anyone is buying this routine.INGRAHAM:  I did like brilliant disguise, that was one of my favoriteSpringsteen's later hits. But this is --ARROYO:  Well, this is a less than brilliant disguise. By the way, thatplace where he was in the middle of the country, Lebanon, Kansas, 82percent of that county voted for Donald Trump. That's the middle of thecountry.Before we go, Laura, my favorite messages during the Super and Puppy Bowlswere from the Bidens. They caught the spirit of fun. They really upliftedAmerica after a year of lockdowns.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Wear a mask, stay sociallydistanced, get tested, get vaccinated when it's your turn.JILL BIDEN, JOE BIDEN'S WIFE:  Please keep wearing your mask, even whenyou're out walking your dog.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:  Even when you're walking the dog.INGRAHAM:  Is she kidding me.ARROYO:  Then when the healthcare workers, Laura, were recognized in thestands in Tampa, not long after that first message was shown, things lookeda little awry. Watch closely.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The 7,500 vaccinated healthcare heroes with us tonight,along with those that crossed the country and throughout the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM:  What went awry? I missed it. What went awry?ARROYO:  He was drinking his beer. The healthcare worker has his mask offand getting a slug of the beer when they announced, there are ourhealthcare workers. Then he quickly puts it back on. That was a laid backcrowd in Tampa.INGRAHAM:  If anyone deserves to have a beer after this year, I'm goingwith the healthcare workers. They have had to put up with a lot ofnonsense.But did they have a vaccination site? I thought Biden was going to visitthat high rise hotel, Raymond, that the illegals are being housed in in SanDiego before they're released into the country. Biden should do a virtualvisit there. That would be fun.ARROYO:  No, apparently he was at the Tara Reid commemorative vaccinationsite considering how things went. We'll leave it there.INGRAHAM:  We'll leave it there. I'm trying to repeat what you said back --oh, God, Raymond, thank you.ARROYO:  Repeat back at you.INGRAHAM:  At you.The Biden administration wants to make your airport experience even moremiserable, well, in the name of safety. We're going to tell you why it'sreally about control next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  First you're breathing into a wet mask for hours on an airline.Now your experience is going to get even more miserable if the Bidenadministration gets its way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you think of requiring a COVID test beforesomeone flies even domestically?PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION:  There is an activeconversation with the CDC right now. What I can tell you is it's going toguided by data, by science, by medicine, and by the input of the people whoare actually going to have to carry this out.But here's the thing. The safer we can make air travel in terms ofperception as well as reality, the more people are going to be ready to getback in the air.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:  Oh, yes. Joining me now is Ben Baldanza, former Spirit AirlinesCEO. Ben, wonderful to see you tonight. So Pete Buttigieg, Secretary ofTransportation, says this move will increase the number of peopletraveling. Is that you how you see it?BEN BALDANZA, FORMER CEO OF SPIRIT AIRLINES:  Well, Laura, it's great to bewith you, but I respectfully have to disagree with the new secretary. Ithink this is going to devastate travel. Already people have a hard timetraveling because in many places they find it difficult as to where to gobecause when they get there they may have to quarantine or things may notbe open. And by making it harder for people to travel, we're going to bediverting resources from testing to go to people who may already bevaccinated or who show no signs. Plus being on-board the airplane hasproven to be a very, very safe environment. Very few, only about 44according to IATA, people have contracted the virus on an airplane, andmost of those were before the industry implemented its mask mandate. Sothey would be talking about using limited testing resources to test peopleto go into an area inside an airplane that's probably less safe thanwalking into a grocery store, or almost any other place would you gooutside your house.INGRAHAM:  Ben, I've flown a lot during the pandemic, and what I find sosad is how people have been just -- they have just been made terrified. Andyet Buttigieg is like, oh, we're all about the science. You just statedirrefutable data on air travel. The same with restaurants, by the way, verylittle spread. Same with schools, very little spread. And yet they keeprepeating this and it's devastating, devastating American business, andkids.BALDANZA:  They have vilified air travel as this place that all theseviruses are spreading when that's just not the case.Also, this is an administration that says they care about jobs, and yetthis is likely to threaten tens of thousands of jobs, many of which areunion jobs, Laura. And let me ask you, I could get in my car now and drivefrom northern Virginia down to Raleigh. I could pick up some people alongthe way I don't know, if I wanted to do that, and I could do that, I wouldprobably have to stop at a public restroom once or twice along the way, andI would never have to be tested. But if I want to fly from here to RaleighI'd have to be tested. Does that make sense?INGRAHAM:  No. By the way, the U.K. "Sunday Times" is reporting "In theEuropean Union, Greece has begun a drive to persuade member states todevelop a joint vaccination certificate allowing holders people to crossborders freely." But the government is basically going to say you have tobe vaccinated. Your thoughts on a vaccination certificate, which I think alot of those folks demand?BALDANZA:  Well, when I ultimately get vaccinated, and according to theWalgreen's site I just went to, it said I'm not going to probably getvaccinated until about April. I'm 59 and pretty healthy, so it should bewell in front of me in the line. But when I get vaccinated, I want proofthat that was done, but I don't know why I would have to show that, again,to go into an environment like the airplane that is been proven by the CDCto be pretty safe. I could see maybe in some places where I would want tobe able to show that, but to travel, which the Constitution allows freedomof travel, to make that happen on domestic air travel, picking out that onetravel type, again, in a car you wouldn't be subject to these same things --INGRAHAM:  Ben, we've got to go, but it's anti-science. Thank you so much.And the same media who cheered Biden and his election celebrations are veryangry after last night. We'll tell you why.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  Unless you're rioting, ripping down statues, or celebratingBiden's win, liberals just don't want you to have any fun.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Throngs of mask-less football fans. As you can see,nobody appears to socially distance, let alone wear a mask or take anyCOVID precautions. It looks like it's 2018.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought, you know, Florida is going to kill all ofus. I really felt that way.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I spoke to the Tampa police and I asked him, what areyou doing about this? Because a lot of people were very concerned.Apparently, the dance floors were full.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAURA: Apparently, the dance floors were full.
