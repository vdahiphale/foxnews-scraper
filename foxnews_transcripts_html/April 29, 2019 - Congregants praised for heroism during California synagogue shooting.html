JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kennedy, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
Dramatic new detail showing how heroic acts prevented the horrific synagogue shooting in California from becoming much worse, 60-year-old Lori Kaye was killed after stepping in front of her rabbi when the gunman started opening fire. The rabbi, who was one of three people injured, describing what happened in chilling detail.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here is a young man standing with a rifle pointing right at me. And I looked at him. He had sunglasses on. I couldn't see his eyes. I couldn't see his soul. I froze. My first concern was, what's with Lori? Where did that noise come from? What's happened to Lori? And as soon as I did that, I took a look, and more shots came running right at me. And I lifted up my hand.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I saw him, chased in to his vehicle. He got in his car. He lifted his rifle, I punched the car. He dropped the rifle. He turned the ignition on. If I saved a life, I'm -- as if I saved a million lives. I'm happy that I did that.

WATTERS: And an armed off-duty border patrol agent inside the synagogue fired at the shooter as Rabbi Goldstein describes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Miraculously, just miraculously, the gun jammed. And in attendance at the synagogue, there was a border patrol off-duty agent, Mr. Jonathan Morales. And many of times I've said, Jonathan, you worked for the border patrol. Please arm yourself when you are here. We never know when we'll need it.

WATTERS: We're also learning just 5 minutes before the gunman stormed in the synagogue, the FBI got a tip about a threatening message he posted on social media, but investigators say it was already too late.
So, Dana, important to highlight this villain in the situation, but more importantly, a lot of heroism to be discussed.

        }
      
WATTERS: Great timing.
PERINO: And I know this area in California, my husband I lived there for a while. And there are amazing people there, and quite a diverse crowd, right? And so you have the off-duty border patrol agent. And it was very interesting to me to listen to the rabbi talking about asking him in the past, if you're going to be here, please bring your weapon because we'll never know when we'll need it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

After the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, this -- the synagogue there in Poway, California, did an active shooter drill. And it does bring up this -- something that we've talked about, whether it's schools or churches, it's this soft target, and what are we going to do? Because, yes, the FBI has 5 minutes notice. We can't really do anything in 5 minutes.
The shooter was not well organized. He didn't -- or well trained. He didn't exactly know what he's doing. He had hate in his heart, and he wanted to commit murder. So he knew that. Thankfully, he didn't know how to use his weapon as well. And also -- then you also have somebody who bravely and courageously fought in Iraq for us and was able to take him down. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I think that we do have to think about a couple of things in addition to -- I know what Greg's thought also in the media, but it is this decision for soft targets, do you take that next step to go ahead and arm yourself because the police aren't always going to be able to get there, and you're not always going to have the benefit of having a former veteran in attendance, or an off-duty border patrol agent who was there in order to take him down.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you relate those two things, somebody that's anti- immigrant in California, the anti-immigrant, hate and refugee is thrown out the country. What happened at the Tree of Life, and then you couple that with the president's language, it's a big problem.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole tenor, the whole spirit of his politics gives these people what they see as a kind of permission.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an epidemic, and we have a president who will not -- not only will not acknowledge that we have an epidemic of white nationalist terror after New Zealand for just a few people. He's providing the mood music for it.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. I didn't see any of that. I wish I hadn't because, basically, that does nothing to help anyone. To your point, there were a lot of heroic stories. And it's great about those heroic stories because they drown out the scum, right? It's like when you hear about this stuff it reduces the desire to commit a crime because instead of hearing about the scum who did it, you hear about the people who share the risk.
We've talked about -- think like 93. If everybody rushes, you share the risk but the shooter loses. I want to just point out a fact here, prior to the New Zealand massacre the killer posted a manifesto in his links to 8chan. A month later this perp posted his open letter and try to live stream on 8chan. So you cannot tell me this is not a copycat. This has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with the desire for infamy and fame. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

There is an equation to copycat crimes. Spectacle multiplied by incentive equals bloodbath. Because violence is on the decline that means the media focuses pretty heavily on -- intensely on what crime is there. So these things -- they might be local, they might not be local, but they become intensified. There's less to cover, so you need to devout more coverage to an act. You multiply that by the incentive, the incentive for the spectacle, and then you get copycat killings.
So what we need is we need to shrink the media footprint. You know I'm a broken record on this, especially since this one was designed with the media in mind because it publishes its manifesto. It's a copycat. They try to outdo each other. You try to outdo the previous guy, but luckily, people shared the risk and went after him. So I do -- I really do think that -- like it's idiotic to sit here and try to make links to -- you know, we could easily link this to the New York Times cartoon, but we won't because we know that's ludicrous, right?

WATTERS: Right, and --
GUTFELD: So let's just leave that aside and focus on the fact that these are copycat crimes aided and abetted by the media spectacle, and if we shrink the spectacle this will decline. These crimes -- I don't know how far from New Zealand to L.A.?

KENNEDY, CO-HOST: I really want to focus on people like Lori Gilbert Kaye, and she was the woman that - 60-year-old woman who threw her body in front of the rabbi, the man who is delivering the word of God to the congregation on the last day of Passover. And that level of sacrifice, that something that happens in the moment. You don't contemplate that.  She didn't have any thought. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
To her, that was a life or death decision, and it was a very easy one for her to make. And that to me is so incredibly profound because, you know, it's impossible to put yourself in that situation, but it's tragic, and it's really beautiful to see that someone would sacrifice themselves in order to protect what she sees as the most sacred thing in that temple.
And, you know, also, Oscar Stewart, he was someone who also re-enlisted in the military after 9/11. He'd been in the navy, and then in 2001, enlisted in the army in order to defend his country. And he end up having the wherewithal to know that if he were within 5 feet of that shooter with a rifle, that he wouldn't be able to get to anyone else. And those are two phenomenal stories.

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I just can't believe we're not talking about white nationalism at this table.
WATTERS: Juan.
WILLIAMS: I mean, it seems to me we have in this country right now an epidemic of white nationals and terror. If this was Al Qaeda or ISIS, we'd be talking about FBI tasked forces. We'd be talking about running bombers over and to wipe out ISIS.

What we've got now according to the FBI, according to the anti-defamation league, it's a tremendous spike, not only in racists activities but anti- Semitic activity, typically directed against houses of worship. The FBI statistics show that 37 percent jump in the last year in anti-Semitic attacks.

And to me, you know, I just say, I don't know who's to blame. I'm not going to point fingers, especially not at President Trump. But I will say this that you have a situation where lots of people who are on 8chan and all these other things identify with Trump, and do think that they have been unleashed by this political environment.
Over the weekend in Washington, in Politics and Pros, a well-known bookstore, you had white nationalist just rush in to try to shut down a guy who's talking about a book. The book is called Dying of Whiteness, politics of racial resentment killing America's heartland. To me, this is just so painful that we are in 2019 in a place like that, and we can talk about, you know, what happened in Pittsburgh. We can talk about New Zealand. All these things are related. And to me, here in the United States --

GUTFELD: You know David Duke supported Omar in a number of tweets, and I don't connect that to her. I don't. I think it's cheap,
WATTERS: I also think it's important to point out that the shooter in New Zealand, and the shooter in Pittsburg, and the shooter here also they hated Donald Trump, all right? So, Juan --

President Trump going after the former VP on twitter saying, quote, the media, fake news, is pushing Sleepy Joe hard.  Funny. I'm only here because of Biden and Obama. They didn't do the job.  And now you have Trump, who is getting it done big time, end quote.
Meanwhile, Biden hitting back during his first campaign rally in Pittsburg just moments ago.

WILLIAMS: This comes amid a new report that may explain why Biden's 2020 run hasn't been endorsed by President Obama. According to a new report, Obama tried to talk Biden out of running in 2016 because he thought Hillary Clinton was more electable.

Kennedy, I don't think there's any doubt about that. I mean, I think that's -- the Democratic establishment coalesced around Hillary pretty early.
KENNEDY: Yeah, it's so easy at this point to play Monday early evening quarterback. And it's so easy to say -- you know, obviously, Hillary Clinton wasn't the most electable candidate, but she had -- already had a nearly successful run. I understand that.
It also goes to show that Biden is a much more loyal person than President Obama. And we see that now because President Obama won't even endorse, you know, his supposed good friend, his loyal VP who served him proudly for eight years. So I think it's an interesting dynamic there.
And it also goes to show, and we've seen this time and time again, President Obama really good at getting himself elected, terrible at getting other people elected.
WILLIAMS: Jesse, I think lots of people on the Democratic side view the establishment that coalesced around Hillary in '16 as thinking it's good to have an open primary. This time, let the blows fall where they may, and we'll get the best candidate.
WATTERS: When Biden really needs the Obama endorsement, he can make that phone call. Right now, it's a little too early for that to happen. But if you think about it, when Barack Obama was thinking about who's going to win my third term? Who's going to cement my legacy in there?  He didn't think about Joe who'd been with him for eight long years. And that's pretty significant.
I just saw that rally. That rally was weak. There was not a lot of people there. The people behind him looked bored. He looked like he was trying to counteract the Sleepy Joe narrative that have been forming. He was stumbling all over his lines, couldn't read the prompter well. He was stepping on things. He just did not look polished. He looked extremely rusty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And a lot of the people back in hair and makeup said they thought that he had fillers in and Botox, you know. I didn't say that, but a lot of people in hair and makeup said it. And they know. They look at faces all day long. I will say this, though, about Joe. He cannot get a crowd. Are people going to drive miles and miles to listen to Joe Biden? No. Are people going to get Joe Biden tattoos on their backs like they did with Donald Trump and Barack Obama? No.
He doesn't get ratings. He doesn't sell books. He doesn't get clicks.  This guy is a candidate by default, and I think you're going to see that develop more and more.
WILLIAMS: So you don't think he gets the nomination?
WATTERS: I'm not saying that, but I don't see the excitement there.  There's no movement. There's no doctrine. There's no -- there's nothing there.
WILLIAMS: Well, Dana, do you think -- you see, I happen to disagree based on sources. I have to say that, in fact, Biden and Obama get along pretty good. But do you think it makes a difference?
PERINO: Well, I also think it could hurt him, OK? So they're a lot of people in the Democratic Party who think that Obama was not progressive enough, and they're mad at him for that. Biden is going to have to excite the base if he can on his own. I also think we have to remember that in 2015 when the decisions were being made of who's going to run, Joe Biden had just lost his son. We all know that was a very public grieving, and we shared in that grief with him.
And I think -- it could be, and the history books might show us in the future if President Obama ever talks about it what he was thinking in terms of trying, perhaps, saw his friend, now might not be the time because you're not in a place where you can be able to carry a campaign off.

I also think that for Obama that he has only one chance to be either a kingmaker or a peacemaker, and why would he do that now? They have a long way to go in this primary. We could actually see a contested convention because of the way the new rules are. And so he could be the person that comes in and says this is my person, or he could say, OK, between the two of you, we're going to work this out. And he only has one chance to do that. He shouldn't do it now.
WILLIAMS: All right. Greg, do you have a favorite among these Democrats?
GUTFELD: Oh, jeez. No.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: When I was looking at the rally, there was a key moment there if you have this V.O., while he was talking with this young fella --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: OK, that's how I felt. Look at that. I'm going to tell you something, I don't think this is Joe Biden's fault. I think that President Trump has ruined rallies and politicians for everyone. Even when you hear a politician talk in that political singsong, oh, talking like this, and then talking like this. It sounds so fake because Trump is just talking like a guy in a cab talking to you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And whether you like him or not, you can't listen to politicians anymore because he's destroyed that whole idea. Alyssa Milano gave the worst advice. She said all the Democratic candidates should play nice with each other. No criticisms, OK. You know what that's like? That's like a friend telling you before you travel to some kind of tropical jungle, don't get the inoculations. You won't need them. Because if you aren't inoculated to the criticism now, and before you face Trump in the jungle, you're just going to get eaten alive by every bug that you'd never recognize. He will crush you.
KENNEDY: Well, it also creates a much more cruel environment because all of these campaigns are so passive-aggressive. They'll be singsong and sweet to each other, but then just put horrific things out.
PERINO: It's going to be great.
WATTERS: You're saying Alyssa Milano is not a shrewd political advisor?
GUTFELD: She's the voice of the party. I actually do like -- I like Tulsi. That's the only one I kinda --

WATTERS: She's unpredictable.
WILLIAMS: I think that's why you're interested in Donald Trump.\
GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.
WILLIAMS: But I might say --
GUTFELD: I can't predict anything.
WILLIAMS: The recent poll ad says like -- more than 50 percent of Americans say can't vote for Trump next time. We'll see how that works out.

WATTERS: Polls.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx, she could be facing serious legal difficulties. Meanwhile, Lori Laughlin, huh, she too has big plans to try to get out of trouble in her college admission scam. Both of these stories bubbling on "The Five" next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: This is a Fox News alert. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has submitted his resignation. His departure was delayed due to the release of the Mueller report. He stuck around for that. But his last day at the Department of Justice will be May 11th. Mark your calendars.
OK, big developments into stories we've been following. First, Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx could soon be forced to explain her controversial recusal in the Jussie Smollett case. She's reportedly been subpoenaed to appear on court this Friday. It's in response to a legal petition filed by a retired judge who's pushing for a special prosecutor to investigate why Foxx's office drop charges against Smollett.
OK. Greg, isn't it interesting that the only person that might be -- not get in trouble over the Jussie Smollett case is Jussie Smollett?
GUTFELD: One great thing about this story is he's able to tick off all sides. I don't know anybody that like -- from the left, right, center, everybody is pissed off because -- this is true cultural appropriation. He stole victim status from people who actually had it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I was thinking of a new classification. You've hear of stolen valor, that's when a creep lies about military service. There should be a charge of stolen victimhood when you steal from the victim's true experiences.
WATTERS: Liz Warren.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WATTERS: Guilty.
GUTFELD: Yeah. But this is much worse.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: To paraphrase Chris Rock, he said that if he had Smollett's fame, and talent, and looks, he would be running Hollywood. So that's why it's such a crime because Smollett didn't need to do this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WATTERS: I think Chris Rock is much better looking than Jussie Smollett, by the way. And I say that with the strict record of heterosexuality.
GUTFELD: I love the fact you should back that up.
(LAUGHTER) PERINO: I'm going to agree with you. --
WATTERS: OK.  PERINO: Anything on Kim Foxx, double X?
WATTERS: Yes, double X. I think, right now, we've seen in recent history, prosecutors, federal investigators, lawyers abusing the law, abusing the system, and then when you call them out on it, they act like holier than now. If you've seen McCabe, or Strzok, or Mueller, or Wiseman, these people have been abusing their authority, I believe, and then all of a sudden, when they get called out, they act like they've done nothing wrong.
Look what happened with Ted Stevens. These guys that went after Ted Stevens in Alaska were called reckless --
PERINO: Yeah. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: -- and they -- and the whole case turned upside down. Wiseman went after Enron. The Supreme Court just shot him down. Totally unethical what he did. I just hope now lawyers -- not a big fan of lawyers for a number of reasons. I just hope these lawyers are held accountable the way they hold other people accountable.
PERINO: And she left a trail, right? There's a text messages.
KENNEDY: She did. I kind of question her ability to do her job, and I think that's why she's being so defensive. And I think that's where the holier-than-thou thing comes from because, you know, the default position for people who are in really deep yogurt tends to be sanctimony, and that's what she's doing here. And it does a great disservice to her Department and the Chicago PD, because the whole thing is such a huge distraction.
And you're absolutely right, there's no accountability for Jussie Smollett, so because people feel that there's some sort of injustice and in the grand scheme of things we'll probably forget this in terms of people who were actually aggrieved by this.
But you do want something to happen and that's why you still have to wait for the federal case, because the FBI is still very much looking into the mail fraud which if you ask your friend Lori Loughlin. She will tell that - (CROSSTALK) gray bar hotel.
PERINO: The other thing is that Kim Foxx, I think, wanted to help make this go away, but she was so ham-handed in the way she did it, Juan, that it's actually just exacerbated. And now you have the brothers - the Osundario brothers suing Smollett attorneys for defamation. You have this investigation - possibly a prosecute - a special prosecutor, it's not going away.
WILLIAMS: Well, it's certainly not going away around here. But I will say this--
PERINO: We're only reporting, it because there was a development, because she going to have to--
WILLIAMS: No, I don't think it's much of a development, but I think that lots of people, especially Trump supporters think, oh, this is evidence of a phony charge that was originally tried to aim at Trump supporters--
GUTFELD: Which it was.
WATTERS: --the manual of Trump supporters.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I think, how about the Police Chief. By the way, I don't understand why you continue to go after Robert Mueller, given that the Mueller report. I don't--
WATTERS: Well, I mean, General Flynn, look at him, I mean, he'd be bankrupt, what he'd you do?
WILLIAMS: I can tell you. But tell me finish up. I don't understand this retired judge getting in the act. I don't know how that happens. But I do think this I'm happy that we would all come to know exactly what she did and why she did in terms of the Kim Foxx, because I think it would be transparency and I think in our legal process that'd be great.
But I don't like the idea that someone goes through the legal process is not charged and yet people keep piling on. I think at some point, you think, Wow, that's not America.
PERINO: Well, we got one other topic and that is the college admission scandal. Lawyers for actors Lori Loughlin and 16 other parents formally entering not guilty pleas today in federal court. We're also learning more about the Full House star's legal strategy. So she and her husband reportedly set to claim that they did not know that the scam's ringleader was going to use the $0.5 million they allegedly gave him, because Kennedy that was all supposed to be for charity.
KENNEDY: Come on man. If you want to donate to charity, donate some money to proper tutors to help your kids get good grades and work hard early on in high school, not when they're juniors and seniors. And they're a couple of twin dim bulbs - I know they're not twins, they're - one is a year older than the other.
WILLIAMS: That was a slight you just issue.
KENNEDY: But what a shoddy defense. Like, "Oh, my God, I think, I didn't even know." That is her defense and it seems pretty flimsy, should she spend 11 years in jail, because she was part of a corrupt system - probably not.
But at least Felicity Huffman had the dignity and the decency to say, what I did was really stupid and I am sorry to everybody involved, especially my daughter.
PERINO: And other students who were trying to get in there.
KENNEDY: Yes.
WATTERS: Well, personally I like the playing dumb defense. I've used it all my life. I've used it in school, I've used it with my parents and it works, because I can play it really well, which--
GUTFELD: Which I know too well, Jesse.
WATTERS: --what that says about me. But I think what they're getting at is, if they can say I'm handing over a half a million and there's no evidence to say that they knew precisely what it was going to--
PERINO: But we do have - they're on tape.
WATTERS: --that's maybe all they have.
PERINO: --got the recordings.
GUTFELD: Yes. She should get the chair, midship (ph) of a local college. We needed to deflate the false virtue of elite colleges. This admissions scandal was all about status and influence. And elite college shouldn't have a higher status than say joining the military or being an entrepreneur.
I'd have more respect in looking at a resume and say this guy served a couple of years in in Afghanistan or this guy started his own company over going to some small local college at--
WILLIAMS: The one daughter was the great entrepreneur--
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: That's the ironic thing.
GUTFELD: She could--
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Oh, stop, stop, stop. But anyway I just think what you get here is people who see power and privilege slipping away, especially upper income, the very rich. You want to make sure the kids stay in the very rich category and they're cheating.
So - and by the way the dumb argument, I think they know exactly. They may not know if it's legal or illegal, but if you're giving somebody money to get your kid in the college I think you know that's cheating.
PERINO: Yes, and also--
WATTERS: I think they're saying it was the fixer. He's a facilitator of admission.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no, this wasn't a counselor, this was a fixer.
WATTERS: But I like the impact, illegal--
PERINO: They should have just put $500,000 in the stock market and then like it had a lot more on then.
WATTERS: Boom.
PERINO: OK. A new study says Americans are more stressed out than ever before, but don't worry Greg's got the cure.
GUTFELD: Yes, I do.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: That was not stressful music. All right, Gallup surveyed global emotions and found that Americans are experiencing the most stress, anger and worry in over a decade, and the percentage is significantly higher than other parts of the world. What could be the cause?
Well, if you're in the media business, you will say Trump. In fact, those who disapprove of him, were far more likely to feel bad than those who approve of him. But that nugget speaks to a larger possible culprit. Could it be the media are playing a role too?
We are living in the most prosperous era ever huge declines in poverty crime and also death that's due to war. We cannot worry about triggers in safe spaces, because we've never had it this good.
It could be we're spiritually weak, everybody wants to be strong emotionally, intellectually, economically, but when you keep asking yourself what's the point, even when things are great, you got problems.
But we know good news doesn't sell and the media is in the business to make money, so they convinced us to ignore what we see and focus on what they feel - unfairness, anger, outrage pain. To them catastrophe is king, as we hurtle towards some environmental, social, political Armageddon.
The media makes the jam and social media spreads it. The difference between concrete evidence and contrary psychological spin has never been so vast and it's making us ill. So the next time you're feeling really bad, ask yourself this, is it coming from inside you or from that damn Airport TV? In life, you can't just turn off things that truly make you sick. The good news here you can.
So I have a theory, Dana, we were talking about this over the weekend.
PERINO: It was a delightful e-mail exchange.
GUTFELD: Yes, it was and then I stopped.
PERINO: I think you don't ever reply me back.
GUTFELD: That's wrong. Well, I think that in America we have so much prosperity for so long that we are used to it, so that we are more likely to be stressful over little things. But if you look at places like in Asia, where poverty is dramatically reduced, they - may be perhaps they are more grateful that they've moved out of extreme poverty, but we were already out of it.
PERINO: Like what you worry about - yes. Because I think that human beings are natural worriers.
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: Right. And you have anxiety, because that was survival of the fittest, so there's a evolutionary part. But I also think there's a spiritual part. And there's a reason why I'll just speak to the Bible and I'm sure this is true in other religions as well.
But in Christianity, what does Jesus say over and over again, fear not. There's many, many passages about turning over your worries to God. You don't have to worry about anything. I got you. Like that's OK.
And so if you grow up in that and you can kind of remember it as an adult, you have to relearn the lesson over and over again, which is why you keep going to church and Bible studies and all that.
I do think that there are some personal responsibilities involved here and that it's that the media can exacerbate things, but I'm going to include social media.
GUTFELD: I have to agree.
PERINO: And that we already know that people are looking at their phones going, "Oh, my vacation sucks." "And my dog is not as cute as Jasper" - and I'm kidding. My dog is cute as Jasper. But I do think that there are - that there is something to be said about having some sort of grounding that allows you to turn over your worries, so that you don't have - so it doesn't consume you.
GUTFELD: Jesse, you might be the least stressful person I know. Am I right to say that?
WATTERS: It's true. I think so. I got a puppy and that really helped me out. And Juan just got back from Belize and he's been much more chill. And I just - I agree though this country should be so mellow. Weed is legal pretty much everywhere - I don't understand it.
But I - to the Dana's point, I would agree. I would agree people are not going to church as much. They're not getting married as much as they used to. Everyone's afraid to touch each other now - physical contact, you can't do that anymore.
And then also as you said, the media hysteria over global warming and collusion and a constitutional crisis at every turn, and the social media aspect I think, and no one goes outdoors anymore.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Go outside. Go - walk under a waterfall or something like that. See a rainbow.
GUTFELD: In Manhattan.
WATTERS: Do some yoga - something like that. Have a drink, take a girl out, you'll be fine.
GUTFELD: They're - you know, Kennedy, I still believe that there's a vast difference between what is going on in life and how the media portrays it. And I think that - I think we tend to exaggerate the negative, because the media is so negative. that's my theory and I have proof.
KENNEDY: And that's why you need to unplug from the external world that tells you--
GUTFELD: Yes.
KENNEDY: --that all of your problems are outside and you sound like a damn hippie, who is take a pick--
(CROSSTALK)
KENNEDY: But I have to say, I absolutely agree with you. And so much of this has to do with mindfulness and not being in the moment. And social media, Dana talks about social media. That takes you out of the moment completely.
GUTFELD: Yes.
KENNEDY: And we don't experience things anymore.
GUTFELD: Yes
KENNEDY: It was so nice I was in France with my daughters and they couldn't use their phones, they couldn't use their devices, because I told them it's going to cost a $1,000 a minute.
WATTERS: I got to try that.
KENNEDY: But they - we went out and we did things and we walked places and we eat things.
PERINO: I remember it - don't remember all of it.
KENNEDY: It was so nice to really - and when you forget that the nice thing about mindfulness, is all you have to do is remember to get back into the moment and there you are.
GUTFELD: So, OK. Jesse got a puppy, Juan went to Belize, Kennedy went to France. So we now know what the key to happiness is. Juan?
WILLIAMS: The thing that I noticed from the Gallup numbers was the most the people who are upset are young people. And the young people--
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: --I think, are most tapped into the social media. Everybody commented on when - and Trump to hear (ph) - my sense is that you have a higher proportion of people who disapprove with Trump - true.
But I also think it's that the rate of change and the rate of consuming information is so great. We have more information available at every stage of life now. I see this--
GUTFELD: Too much.
WILLIAMS: --with grandkids - and you know what - now they say grandma kids, 1 to 5, they should not have any social media. It slows down your brain function.
GUTFELD: It does.
WILLIAMS: But I think that people just kind of become addicted to looking at the phone, tapping into the Facebook or whatever. And it's just because so much news - it's kind of sad and depressing anyway and about bad stuff people, get upset and think the world's coming to an end.
GUTFELD: Exactly. I always - it's like the side effects in the drug ads. They're there - but they just - they make everything seem like you're going to get it.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: --I going to get all of these side effects. All right. A new cringe-worthy moment from Hillary Clinton that you don't want to miss, next on "The Five."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KENNEDY: Shaking you all five long. Hillary Clinton trying her ham - thank you - at comedy by impersonating President Trump during a dramatic reading of the Mueller report - here you go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JORDAN KLEPPER, HOST, COMEDY CENTRAL: feel it. Just imagine like you have a history with this.
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: OK. The investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency, and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electoral.
The president slumped back in his chair and said, "Oh my God, this is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm (bleep).
KLEPPER: I'd listen that audiobook.
CLINTON: Yes. OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KENNEDY: Jesse, come on man.
WATTERS: I mean, even Bill Clinton's bored. That was really boring. I think Bill Clinton was having an episode of some sort. I worry about the former President, Dana.
PERINO: I would say not a good look, right? Because last week she had her op-ed in the Washington Post saying, "this is so serious and I don't say this just as the former candidate, but as a former Secretary of State and as an American." And then she like makes fun of it.
KENNEDY: Yes. She does a very unserious thing. But when she getting into the race, that's what I can't wait for.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Race. Look at you Kennedy.
KENNEDY: Yes.
WILLIAMS: No, I think - look, I think that shows on Comedy Central - am I right? That's Jordan Klepper. So, I mean, she's trying to be - she's playing along with someone doing a little funny stuff. And I think the fact that she would play along and expose herself to this kind of critique that why are you reading it - I think that's a good sign. It might have helped her if she was that open to being funny in the 2016 race.
WATTERS: You call that funny.
GUTFELD: You know, I think it's a good point that she's exposing herself here, better her than Bill, because he's been doing it for years. It is funny that they are on this - nobody knew who this show was. It's like that's how load this couple has gone that they're showing up on some guy that nobody knows until our producer says, "I think his name is Jordan."
I bought a guitar over the weekend. I bought an amp. I'm learning to play again. I haven't played in a while. She needs a hobby. If she should get - she should she should get up. GWB should teach her to hobby paint.
PERINO: He doesn't just hobby paint--
GUTFELD: Well, he's getting better.
PERINO: He can paint.
GUTFELD: He can paint, but that's hobby painting, let's face it. But now he's good, she needs a hobby and it should be painting. Get her off this circuit, it's not good.
KENNEDY: No, she needs to go somewhere and rediscover self-awareness because she has absolutely none.
GUTFELD: That is true.
KENNEDY: Oh, Hillary please get in the race, dear. "One More Thing" is up next. Stay right here.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time now for "One More Thing." You're wondering why I'm dressed up with a bolo tie, it's because White Castle--
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
"Jesse's Feeding Frenzy"
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: There it is.
GUTFELD: Vomit.
WATTERS: White Castle has a new promotion. If you go wearing western gear - a hat, a bolo tie, cowboy boots, you can get two free burgers. They're coming out with some Wild Wild West burger themes here. We have barbecue burger, we have impossible burger and we have a brisket burger. All right, so go check that out. Who do you guys - you want to try one of these?
GUTFELD: I definitely do.
PERINO: Which one is the impossible one?
WATTERS: What's the impossible?
GUTFELD: Yes, I want the one with the bacon. Does this got bacon?
PERINO: No that one does over there.
WILLIAMS: No, hey, Greg, Greg. This one is for you.
KENNEDY: This is the barbecue burger.
WILLIAMS: Greg, this says air guitar solo.
GUTFELD: That is me.
WILLIAMS: That's made for Greg.
WATTERS: These are delicious. All right, Juan Williams, take it away.
WILLIAMS: Time flies, wouldn't you say? Well, take a look at this video folks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Yes, it's Big Ben running in the London Marathon. Lucas Bates, 30 year old London her dressed up as Big Ben - the iconic clock high above Westminster Palace. He was one of 40,000 runners and he was inspired by a man who ran in the 2018 Berlin Marathon dressed as Germany's Holstentor gate.
Even though he averaged 9 minutes a mile - that's pretty good over the 26 mile course, he came up 20 minutes slower than the record set in Germany. but look at what happened at the finish line. Ben is just too big. The costume added five feet to Bates' height. He needed help from one of the stewards to get over that finish line. Talk about racing against the clock.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Good one, Juan. All right, Dana.
PERINO: I would like you to meet Army Veteran Andrew LaRocca.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: If you take to check him out, he is amazing. And so in 2010, he was in a motorcycle accident, left him will wheel chair-bound. He had a traumatic brain injury. But then after the accident he tried a few programs through the Wounded Warrior Project and Art Without Boundaries.
And so he took art therapy lessons, and get this, through the program he's made all these breakthroughs, regaining the ability to speak, and he can sing. His father appraise the program saying the painting feeds the brain, because the various movements helps stimulate cerebral functions.
And so for the last few years, he's been working with Craig Todd, that's his instructor. If you want to learn more about that for someone that you know that they could benefit. If you go to woundedwarriorproject.org Independence Program.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Oh, inspirational.
GUTFELD: Not as inspirational as this - maybe not. Let's go here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: "Greg's Cable News." I'm so excited.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: CNN is bringing back Crossfire. I love Crossfire, and you got to check it out. They hired - they got Joe Scarborough and I believe Chris Cuomo and here they are.
This is going to be the premiere episode. You can see Joe it's on the left and Chris is on the right.
WATTERS: Greg, if you ever run into these guys out somewhere, you've got some trouble.
GUTFELD: Look at this, this is going to be - this is going to rate #1. I would worried, if I was Fox right now. But that's at the 8 o'clock hour. Tucker you're in trouble.
PERINO: Just bring back the bow tie.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Chris Cuomo is huge, by the way.
GUTFELD: No, he thinks he is huge.
WATTERS: Oh, god.
KENNEDY: He does like to get after it, though.
WATTERS: Kennedy.
KENNEDY: Well, it was Mrs. Kennedy comes to Washington this weekend. I went to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. But it wasn't a Correspondents Dinner where I ran into the greatest wattage.
Look at this at the UTA Mediaite party that is KJ Apa. He plays Archie on "Riverdale." And if you are my 13 year old daughter, you sent me about 75 OMG texts when I sent this. "What? How did you meet him?" He apparently has like 50 million viewers.
And look at that.
WATTERS: No.
GUTFELD: Who is that?
KENNEDY: Its Joe Biden.
WATTERS: That's not real.
KENNEDY: I was sniffing his hair and shoulders. Not only that, Guy Benson was standing with me. We were on the same Acela as Joe Biden and Guy Benson got this sideways view of us taking a selfie together.
WATTERS: You got a Biden selfie? Unbelievable.
KENNEDY: Biden and Archie.
WATTERS: With (INAUDIBLE) selfie.
All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of "The Five."
