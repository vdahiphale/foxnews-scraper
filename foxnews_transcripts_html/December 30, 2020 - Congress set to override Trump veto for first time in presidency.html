MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Let's talk about COVID-19 relief.SPUNT (voice over): Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the floorjust hours ago announced he will move forward with a COVID relief packagethat includes $2,000 direct payments, but there's a catch, involving thepresident's wish list.McConnell says to get the $2,000 checks, Democrats must also repeal Section230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects big tech companieswho censor speech online.President Trump says companies like Twitter and Facebook unfairly censorRepublican perspectives and have been for years.The majority leader also wants a bipartisan study examining the integrityand security of the 2020 presidential election.MCCONNELL: The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues thatPresident Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid toaddress two of them.SPUNT: Democrats call the election integrity and Section 230 parts of thepackage poison pills and want to straight up or down vote only on the$2,000 direct payments.On Monday, the House passed a measure that would give $2,000 directpayments to the American people.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Pass the House Bill and pass it now.REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): Who is holding up that distribution to theAmerican people? Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans.SPUNT: McConnell says the House Bill isn't likely to make it through theSenate, where the majority of Republicans say increasing payments from $600to $2,000 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Money we don't have. Money that we're borrowingfrom our kid's future. So, I think we need to target that a little bitmore.SPUNT: But some Republicans are in favor of the $2,000 number on thepresident's wish list.Also sitting in the Senate's lap, the opportunity to override thepresident's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act. The annual billto fund the military.The president vetoed the bill over language that would rename militarybases currently named for Confederate war leader.

Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. And now that we're on the ground in Georgia, we're noticing thatpeople can get a lot closer to the candidates than we've gotten used to onthe presidential campaign beat during the pandemic.

I run a business that's exposed, terrorism.DOOCY: That business, a documentary film company called Insight TWI. Ossoffis still managing to pull help from political heavyweights including BarackObama.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can send JonOssoff to the Senate to beat this virus and rebuild our economy, to makesure everybody can afford health care. And to carry the torch John Lewispassed to us.DOOCY: The latest Obama ad only mentions Ossoff, not the other Democratrunning Reverend Raphael Warnock.REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE OF GEORGIA: It's time formoral leadership.DOOCY: Warnock's ex-wife accused him of running over her foot with a car inMarch, but Warnock was never charged. And counselors at a camp he used torun have now been accused of abusing minors.LOEFFLER: We have to make sure that Georgians know exactly who he is in hisown words, because it's dangerous policies, it's dangerous candidates andthen, it's a dangerous past.DOOCY: Any concern that the allegations of wrongdoing against ReverendWarnock could possibly be a drag on the Democratic ticket next week?OSSOFF: None whatsoever.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): A Warnock win and an Ossoff win would give Democratscontrol of the Senate.

I will object on January 6th on their behalf.And with that tweet, President Trump will secure a debate and a vote in theHouse and Senate challenging the election results.Democrats control the House and several Senate Republicans, includingMajority Leader McConnell have already acknowledged President-elect JoeBiden as the winner.So, Hawley's maneuver likely only delays Biden's Electoral Collegecertification.PELOSI: I have no doubt that on next Wednesday, a week from today that JoeBiden will be confirmed by the acceptance of the vote of this ElectoralCollege.EDSON: Vice President Mike Pence will preside over next week'scongressional session counting the electoral votes. Some congressionalRepublicans are pushing a legal effort to give Pence the authority tochoose Trump electors instead of those certified for Biden.

Biden's previously said that is not a factor and his team claimedhe's had a full plate with COVID and national security meetings telling usto expect more cabinet announcements next week.But Biden's longtime allies Senator Chris Coons is making his preferenceknown.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): I am hoping that he will choose my colleague DougJones, but there are a number of very capable and talented folks he isseriously considering. He has assembled an amazing team for his cabinet, ateam that is experienced, that is ready to work together on day one.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (voice over): The transition is brushing off news RepublicanSenator Josh Hawley plans to object to Biden's win when Congress certifiesElectoral College vote on January 6th.But they're taking it far more seriously what they call obstruction frompolitical leadership at the Department of Defense and Office of Managementand Budget saying it will likely delay Biden's first budget release.Moderate Democrats in Congress are asking Biden for classified bipartisanbriefings over the recent Russian cyber-attacks.

We're looking at as I said before, a substantial numberof very specific important requests for information that they are notresponding to.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Make no mistake, this lack of cooperation has real-worldimplications most concerningly as it relates to our national security.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera): Transition also announced Biden will issue a memo oninauguration day stopping any midnight regulations enacted by the Trumpadministration that haven't yet taken effect, Bret.BAIER: Jacqui, thank you.Coming up, Senator Bernie Sanders and President Trump have little incommon, but both have voiced support for the increase in the stimuluschecks to $2,000. We will talk about that with one of them in just a bit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Congress found plenty ofmoney for foreign countries, lobbyists, and special interest while sendingthe bare minimum to the American people who needed.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Do we turn our backs on struggling workingfamilies or do we respond to their pain?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: "BREAKING TONIGHT", the fate of the House approved $2,000 individualrelief payments remains unresolved in the Senate. Let's bring in one of thefirst lawmakers to back the bigger checks the president is also pushing forthat as well, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, welcome back toSPECIAL REPORT.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Thank you very much and Happy New Year to you.BAIER: Happy New Year to you, Sir. You know, you've called President Trumpa racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, a religious bigot, a demagogue, a liar.But now you say he's a visionary when it comes to $2,000 --(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: I didn't say visionary. No, I didn't. Bret, I think PresidentTrump is the most dangerous president in the history of our country, but hehappens to be right on this issue.I think he is correct in saying that we are living in a terrible, terribleeconomic moment for tens of millions of working-class families. We foughtvery hard to get the $600 direct payment. Trump is right in saying that'snot enough. We need to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was a visionary. He'sright on this issue.BAIER: You know, obviously, Speaker Pelosi, Senator Chuck Schumer, thetreasury secretary debated this with Republican leadership for a long time.They cut a deal for the $600 stimulus check. Did they just waste their timeand cut a lousy deal?SANDERS: Well, look, when you look at a deal, you have to look at it withinthe context of the problems that we face. And Bret, as I think mostAmericans know, we are living in a terrible unprecedented moment whenmillions of folks have lost their jobs and their income. Tens of millionsof people are facing eviction. We are looking at a record level of hungerin America in the midst of this terrible pandemic. You've got 90 millionpeople who are uninsured or underinsured and can't afford to go to adoctor. You have people accumulating more and more debt, you haveshoplifting, with families -- people trying to get enough food to theirkids.So, in this particular moment, I think we need bold action, and I thinkproviding a $2,000 check to every working-class adult is the right thing todo.BAIER: And there's a lot of people, Senator, that both Republicans andDemocrats who feel the way you do that this is an extenuating circumstance.But on the flip side, there are some who feel like $600 is going to get thejob done right now. And they feel like $463 billion added to the debt atthis moment is not the right thing after this funding bill. What do you sayto them?SANDERS: Well, I -- look, I fought and helped lead the fight for directpayments and I wanted more, we got 600, and that will help a lot of people.But Bret, I was on the floor of the Senate today reading stories that cameto my office from all over this country. And when we're talking about momstrying to feed their kids, we're talking about people worried about beingthrown out on the street because they are faced with the eviction, we got areally serious problem. 600 bucks as President Trump has said is just notenough, not going to do it.Now, in terms of the debt, that, that is a serious issue. And you're right,we're talking about a whole lot of money. But I always find it amusing thatthis sometimes the very same people who voted for a $1-1/2 trillion taxbreak for the one percent and large corporations, they didn't have a worryabout the deficit at that point. When it comes to hundreds of billions ofdollars in corporate welfare, these large profitable corporations, theydon't worry about the deficit, we just voted working on right now.The largest military budget in the history of this country, $740 billion.The Pentagon can't even do an independent audit. There is enormous amountof waste and duplication in that budget, but no one worries about that.When it comes to working families, to the mom and dad who are struggling toput food on the table for their kids, oh, my God, we're worried about thedeficit. So, deficit is an issue.BAIER: Yes.SANDERS: I agree. But I think this -- at this moment, we've got to do theright thing for working families.BAIER: Senator, to your credit, you said the exact same thing to me inApril when we talked at that town hall and you said that you were concernedabout it, but that you thought there was hypocrisy here. I should justpoint out, that was $22 trillion in debt. It's now 27.SANDERS: Yes.BAIER: Let me play Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talking about,you just mentioned defense, the NDAA.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Our colleague from Vermont is again puttingpolitical stunts before the needs of our men and women in uniform. TheSenate will not let our national security be shoved off course. Certainlynot by senators who have spent years literally years trying to gutAmerica's capabilities while our adversaries continue ramping up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So, are you and your Democratic senators' colleagues dug in onforcing a delay on this override --(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: First of all -- first of all, that vote is going to take place.So, what McConnell said is just not accurate. Of course, it's going to takeplace.BAIER: But why delay it?SANDERS: Because it is the only tool that I have, Bret, in order to force avote. The real issue and what -- I was down on the floor of the Senatetoday demanding is, what is McConnell's problem? In the House, 44Republicans voted to provide $2,000 checks to working-class families.In the Senate, as you know, a number of Republicans, I don't know, it'sfive or six have said they want to vote for this. All that I am asking ofMitch McConnell, give us a vote. He wants to vote against it, that's fine.What is the problem giving us a vote? And if he wants to announce that votenow, he can have his vote on the -- on the defense override in fiveminutes.But it's the only tool --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: OK. So, you're going to do relent and let it come out on Saturday,this vote, the override?SANDERS: Right now, it's the only tool that all that I want -- all that Iwant is -- and I think the American people don't understand what is theproblem with having a vote. If people want to vote it against it, voteagainst it. If you want to vote for it, vote for it. Let's have the vote.BAIER: OK. So, what are the problems you have with the other elements thatMitch McConnell is now wrapping into this $2,000 check which is the Section230 prohibitions? And also looking into election fraud and concerns aboutelection fraud not even necessarily for this election but for elections tocome.SANDERS: Right, right. I don't --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Why is that a problem?SANDERS: I have no -- I don't have a problem. For example, there are awhole -- the way we do elections needs a whole lot of improvement. Thereare parts of this country where people are waiting in line for five or sixhours in order to vote. There is a lot of voter suppression, voterintimidation. I worry about the possibility.Well, I mean, just the whole lot of things that are out there, sure, let'slook at it. But don't attach it to the issue of the moment which is peopleare desperate they need help.He wants to bring that up, let's do it. You want to talk about Section 230?Fine, we can do it. But why do you want to attach it to a bill which isjust so important to working families?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: I get what you're saying, Senator. I really do. I get what you'resaying. But couldn't this be put back in House Speaker Pelosi's lap, andSenator Schumer's lap and say, why did you relent to $600? Why didn't youlisten to Bernie Sanders and say $2,000?I mean they agreed to this deal. It went through, it got compromised. Theypassed it and broke chambers.SANDERS: Right, Right.BAIER: And now you're going back, and the President agrees with you.SANDERS: Well, that's the point. I mean, I think what, you know, my viewhas always been as you well know that the $600 was not adequate, I wantedmore. You make a fair point. But the point also is that you have apresident right now who is telling Republicans in a very strong way, Imight say, in the Senate, do the right thing.Do it -- I think, ASAP was his term. Do it as soon as possible. And if thepresident is saying that, and you got President-elect Biden saying that,you got the House having voted on it, let's do it. Let's do it.BAIER: OK, let me ask you two other things. Did either of the Democraticcandidates down in Georgia ask you to campaign for them in the final daysahead of this runoff?SANDERS: Did they ask me to go to Georgia to campaign? No, they did not.BAIER: Does that tell you anything about them?SANDERS: No.BAIER: Or where that race is?SANDERS: No, I think that race is very, very important. And I would say toour friends in Georgia that it is terribly important that we elect Warnockand Ossoff so that, in fact, if we're unable to move aggressively right nowon those $2,000 checks, we will do it, I believe. I can't speak for JoeBiden. But I think it will be at the very top of the agenda for a Bidenadministration.BAIER: What does it tell you that the Biden transition team hasn't, and thepresident-elect hasn't picked someone for the job you've expressed interestin, the labor secretary?SANDERS: Well, look, what I have -- so, I think the picks, many of thepicks that the president-elect has made are really excellent. And I think,especially in the area of COVID-19 and healthcare, you're going to see aradical change, and God knows we need that.I share the president-elect's concern that the vaccines are not getting outas quickly as they should. What I have said many times, Bret is that Ithink the progressive movement in this country is, you know, 40-45 percentof the Democratic coalition. And I think it is appropriate that theprogressive movement have representation in the Biden Cabinet. That's wasmy point, that is my point, that's what I believe.BAIER: Do you think it's progressive enough as it stands today?SANDERS: It is -- it's pretty good. It's pretty good, but not as strong asI would like it to be.BAIER: Senator Sanders, we always appreciate you coming on. Thanks for thetime.SANDERS: Thank you, Bret. Happy New Year, everybody.BAIER: You too.Up next, new developments on several fronts in the battle against thecoronavirus pandemic.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  The new coronavirus strain from Great Britain has now beenconfirmed in two U.S. states.

Correspondent Anita Vogel isdigging into the details tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)ANITA VOGEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Just when you thought 2020 couldn'tget much worse, a new, more contagious strain of COVID-19 which firstemerged in the U.K. and quickly spread to other countries has now surfacedin Colorado and California. In Colorado, officials have confirmed one caseand suspect another, both assigned by the National Guard to work at a ruralnursing home outside Colorado Springs.JARED POLIS, (D) COLORADO GOVERNOR:  There's nothing that indicates thatthis would cause different or severe symptoms. But if it does transmit morequickly, obviously more people get it, it means more people hospitalized.VOGEL:  And in California, Governor Gavin Newsom making the announcementthe strain had hit the Golden State during a joint virtual conversationWednesday afternoon with Dr. Anthony Fauci.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  I don't think that the Californians should feel that this issomething odd. This is something that's expected.VOGEL:  Perhaps accounting for an explosion of virus cases across thenation, but especially in southern and central California, where capacityin the ICU remains at zero and no relief in sight, with the end of the yearcelebrations just days away.FAUCI:  That's what we are concerned about, that in addition to the surge,we're going to have an increase superimposed upon that surge, which couldmake January even worse than December.VOGEL:  And while the rollout of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have beenhampered by delays, there is hope across the pond as a third vaccine wasnow available.(END VIDEO TAPE)VOGEL (on camera):  And today the U.K. became the first country to giveemergency authorization to a new coronavirus vaccine developed byAstraZeneca and the University of Oxford which touts a cheaper and easierto store method and the hope of vaccinating 1 million people per week.Bret, back to you.BAIER:  Anita, thank you.Republican Representative-elect Luke Letlow of Louisiana has died just daysbefore he was set to be sworn in.

Correspondent Mike Tobin is in Nashville with more.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Video from security camerasshows the impact of the Christmas Day bomb on downtown businesses.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We did get the back wind of it. So all the exteriordoors of our building were blown open.TOBIN:  911 calls reflect the first mysterious reports of hearing gunshots,then fear at the warning blared from the RV, and finally the blast.TOBIN:  There have been three rounds of gunshots inside the building.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There is a recording out there that's saying there'sa limited time to evacuate this area. There's a large bomb inside thisvehicle.TOBIN:  There was a big fiery explosion on top of the building. That's whatI've seen.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my God, my entire building just fell down, andit's collapsing.TOBIN:  An incident report from August 21st, 2019, shows the suspectedbomber Anthony Warner, contrary to police statements, did get the attentionof authorities. A girlfriend of Warner made statements that her boyfriendwas building bombs in the RV trailer at his residence, and that the suspectfrequently talks about military and bomb making. Police attempted severaltimes and could not get the suspect to answer the door.The report says the yard was fenced off. Police saw the RV but could notsee inside it, and the property was wired with cameras and alarms. Policesay the hazardous device unit followed up, but with advice from a lawyer,Warner did not allow police on his property.

We'll discuss it all with thepanel next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, (D-MD) SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  We could get it toPresident Trump's desk today. He could sign it. And Mitch McConnell andSenate Republicans are holding this up and playing political games, andpeople are hurting.SEN. RON JOHNSON, (R-WI) SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  There is a demand toincrease the $600 per person payments up to $2,000 per person, which wouldincrease the average amount of money going to households from about $2,400in the original CARES Act to a family of four would get $8,000, money wedon't have, money that we're borrowing from our kids' future. So I think weneed to target that a little bit more.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That's the debate, and it's ongoing now. The president is forincreasing the stimulus to $2,000. You heard Bernie Sanders early in theprogram saying that.Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at "TheFederalist," Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the AssociatedPress, and Bill McGurn, columnist for "The Wall Street Journal."Bill, you heard Senator Sanders earlier in the show saying why can't MitchMcConnell just do an up or down vote on just that? That's not what he'sdoing.BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right, well, the truth is the wholething is a political game, and there's a reason that the Democrats are soexcited about it. It's all about Georgia. Senator Sanders has also saidGeorgia, progressivism is on the ballot in Georgia, and it is. And that'sthe only reason people are interested in these two provisions, Section 230on the defense bill, and the $2,000.It's designed to split the Republicans, to either force them to break withTrump or to go with Donald Trump, as in Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue,and sort of against earlier votes. I think, my guess is they are going tobe all right. They said they sided with Donald Trump on the $2,000. Theonly thing that matters right now is who wins in Georgia. This is amicrocosm because it shows what's at stake, and that's why everyone isjumping in on it.BAIER:  Julie, a lot of people are saying this is the big issue in Georgia,and of course the control of the Senate is broader than the head-to-headraces in either one of those runoffs. You have Joe Manchin from WestVirginia, a Democrat, who said he would vote against blowing up thefilibuster. He said he would vote against defunding police and otherthings. Is that enough to convince moderates to say that progressivism isnot going to get a foothold with a Chuck Schumer Senate?JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  I think there's thereality of what the Senate would look like even if there is a Democraticmajority, and then there's the messaging around the Senate, and certainlythe messaging is pushing more the idea that if Democrats were to takecontrol, then this would essentially be a field day for progressives.I think the reality is that even if Joe Biden has a Democratic controlledSenate, he has members like, as you mentioned, Joe Manchin, who is not anautomatic rubber-stamp for a Democratic agenda. And Joe Biden himself ismuch more of a moderate than a progressive. So Biden would have to grapplewith the divisions within a Democratic led Senate the same way that MitchMcConnell right now is very much dealing with divisions within his ownparty even though he is the majority leader.BAIER:  Bernie Sanders, Mollie, in the earlier segment, here's a clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT):  I think President Trump is the most dangerouspresident in the history of our country, but he happens to be right on thisissue. I think he is correct in saying that we are living in a terrible,terrible economic moment for tens of millions of working-class families. Wefought very hard to get the $600 direct payment. Trump is right in sayingthat's not enough. We need to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was avisionary. He's right on this issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So is it concerning for President Trump or Trump supporters ifBernie Sanders is agreeing with you?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  Usually something to beworried about, but remember that Senator Sanders and Senator Hawley hadboth pushed for larger direct payments to the Americans who have had theirlives so grievously harmed by government shutdowns.I thought another thing that Senator Sanders said was interesting which isabout people saying that they opposed the increased direct payments becauseof concerns about debt. And it is charming to hear people say this whenthey just passed this bloated bill, when you have states getting bailoutsbecause they are suffering from lack of tax dollars because of how theyshut down the economy, when money is going overseas, when $6.5 trillion hasbeen spent on the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and how the sameSenate is trying to make it so that Donald Trump cannot bring troops home,doing whatever they can to make sure that those wars continue.It would be great if people really cared about how much money is beingspent, but that they only seem to express concern when it comes to directpayments to the Americans who have had their jobs taken away from them, whocan't go to church or go to school or go to jobs that can't be done from adesk like so many elite people can, it's a little bit too much to take. Andit's important that we help people out during this time and that SenateRepublicans do something if they do care about winning these Georgia Senateraces.BAIER:  Yes, speaking of Georgia, Bill you mentioned that as well, listen,this veto override is a key issue down there. Georgia is, I think, thesixth biggest military state as far as defense contractors as well asmilitary presence in the state. It's a big deal down there. And forSenators Loeffler and Perdue, that's a big vote. But right now that's beendelayed by people like Senator Bernie Sanders.MCGURN:  It would be nice for them if it were delayed until after theelection. It is a big vote. I'm of the view that Section 230 really doesneed something of an overall, but it needs a real debate, not to be tackedon at the end of a bill like this and thrown there before a New Year'sdeadline.To me this is Donald Trump's big moment. I'm of the belief that with allthe dissension and all, some Republicans are irritated with him and someRepublicans in Georgia might not vote because they don't like his attackson their -- my opinion is they need Donald Trump to pull out Georgia. If hedoes that, he's going to be hailed -- he will go out on a winning note, ifhe can do it. Whatever else happens on these other votes, if he does that,he will go out on a winning note. If he doesn't, he'll be blamed.And the interesting thing in this race is though it's such a national race,it's the opposite of Tip O'Neill's all politics is local. All politics isnational in these races. Joe Biden is a nonentity. Jon Ossoff had 100,000fewer voters than Joe Biden. So it just shows, it will confirm he has nocoattails, as we saw in November.BAIER:  Julie, very quickly, now Senator Josh Hawley, Republican fromMissouri, is signing on to this effort to challenge the election results.What does that mean big picture, come January 6th?PACE:  Big picture it means nothing in terms of Joe Biden being sworn in,but it is now the third issue we are talking about where Republicans areforced to do something very, very difficult in early January. It's going tobe a tough entry for some of these Republicans who would really ratheravoid dealing with this issue.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much. When we come back, policeofficers show we can always get back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, in Massachusetts Officer Matthew Lima didsomething unexpected after getting reports of shoplifting from a localgrocery store, he decided instead of arresting the two girls, he paid forthe groceries they attempted to steal. He said it was time for a lesson andsome compassion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATTHEW LIMA, SOMERSET, MASSACHUSETTS, POLICE OFFICER:  Right away when Ilooked at those items, I noticed that they were all grocery items, theywere all food items. If I were in that situation, I would be grateful ifsomebody could help me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Help. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it forthe SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid.ENDContent and Programming C

Senate MajorityLeader Mitch McConnell saying today the Senate will stay on the defensebill until it's completed one way or another.He also slammed efforts to approve the $2,000 direct payments, the stimulusby unanimous consent calling out Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sandersin a fiery floor speech today.

MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Let's talk about COVID-19 relief.SPUNT (voice over): Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the floorjust hours ago announced he will move forward with a COVID relief packagethat includes $2,000 direct payments, but there's a catch, involving thepresident's wish list.McConnell says to get the $2,000 checks, Democrats must also repeal Section230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects big tech companieswho censor speech online.President Trump says companies like Twitter and Facebook unfairly censorRepublican perspectives and have been for years.The majority leader also wants a bipartisan study examining the integrityand security of the 2020 presidential election.MCCONNELL: The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues thatPresident Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid toaddress two of them.SPUNT: Democrats call the election integrity and Section 230 parts of thepackage poison pills and want to straight up or down vote only on the$2,000 direct payments.On Monday, the House passed a measure that would give $2,000 directpayments to the American people.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Pass the House Bill and pass it now.REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): Who is holding up that distribution to theAmerican people? Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans.SPUNT: McConnell says the House Bill isn't likely to make it through theSenate, where the majority of Republicans say increasing payments from $600to $2,000 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Money we don't have. Money that we're borrowingfrom our kid's future. So, I think we need to target that a little bitmore.SPUNT: But some Republicans are in favor of the $2,000 number on thepresident's wish list.Also sitting in the Senate's lap, the opportunity to override thepresident's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act. The annual billto fund the military.The president vetoed the bill over language that would rename militarybases currently named for Confederate war leader. McConnell, a Trump allyon any given day plans to override the president's veto, along with themajority of other Republicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): Senator Bernie Sanders wants to stall the NDAA vote andbring up the COVID relief checks without the presidential wish list.Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell snapped back today andsaid the NDAA remains a top priority of the United States Senate, Bret.BAIER: Again, we'll hear from Senator Sanders here on SPECIAL REPORT injust a minute.

And now that we're on the ground in Georgia, we're noticing thatpeople can get a lot closer to the candidates than we've gotten used to onthe presidential campaign beat during the pandemic.

I run a business that's exposed, terrorism.DOOCY: That business, a documentary film company called Insight TWI. Ossoffis still managing to pull help from political heavyweights including BarackObama.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can send JonOssoff to the Senate to beat this virus and rebuild our economy, to makesure everybody can afford health care. And to carry the torch John Lewispassed to us.DOOCY: The latest Obama ad only mentions Ossoff, not the other Democratrunning Reverend Raphael Warnock.REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE OF GEORGIA: It's time formoral leadership.DOOCY: Warnock's ex-wife accused him of running over her foot with a car inMarch, but Warnock was never charged. And counselors at a camp he used torun have now been accused of abusing minors.LOEFFLER: We have to make sure that Georgians know exactly who he is in hisown words, because it's dangerous policies, it's dangerous candidates andthen, it's a dangerous past.DOOCY: Any concern that the allegations of wrongdoing against ReverendWarnock could possibly be a drag on the Democratic ticket next week?OSSOFF: None whatsoever.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): A Warnock win and an Ossoff win would give Democratscontrol of the Senate.

I will object on January 6th on their behalf.And with that tweet, President Trump will secure a debate and a vote in theHouse and Senate challenging the election results.Democrats control the House and several Senate Republicans, includingMajority Leader McConnell have already acknowledged President-elect JoeBiden as the winner.So, Hawley's maneuver likely only delays Biden's Electoral Collegecertification.PELOSI: I have no doubt that on next Wednesday, a week from today that JoeBiden will be confirmed by the acceptance of the vote of this ElectoralCollege.EDSON: Vice President Mike Pence will preside over next week'scongressional session counting the electoral votes. Some congressionalRepublicans are pushing a legal effort to give Pence the authority tochoose Trump electors instead of those certified for Biden.

Biden's previously said that is not a factor and his team claimedhe's had a full plate with COVID and national security meetings telling usto expect more cabinet announcements next week.But Biden's longtime allies Senator Chris Coons is making his preferenceknown.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): I am hoping that he will choose my colleague DougJones, but there are a number of very capable and talented folks he isseriously considering. He has assembled an amazing team for his cabinet, ateam that is experienced, that is ready to work together on day one.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (voice over): The transition is brushing off news RepublicanSenator Josh Hawley plans to object to Biden's win when Congress certifiesElectoral College vote on January 6th.But they're taking it far more seriously what they call obstruction frompolitical leadership at the Department of Defense and Office of Managementand Budget saying it will likely delay Biden's first budget release.Moderate Democrats in Congress are asking Biden for classified bipartisanbriefings over the recent Russian cyber-attacks.

BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Do we turn our backs on struggling workingfamilies or do we respond to their pain?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: "BREAKING TONIGHT", the fate of the House approved $2,000 individualrelief payments remains unresolved in the Senate. Let's bring in one of thefirst lawmakers to back the bigger checks the president is also pushing forthat as well, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, welcome back toSPECIAL REPORT.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Thank you very much and Happy New Year to you.BAIER: Happy New Year to you, Sir. You know, you've called President Trumpa racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, a religious bigot, a demagogue, a liar.But now you say he's a visionary when it comes to $2,000 --(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: I didn't say visionary. No, I didn't. Bret, I think PresidentTrump is the most dangerous president in the history of our country, but hehappens to be right on this issue.I think he is correct in saying that we are living in a terrible, terribleeconomic moment for tens of millions of working-class families. We foughtvery hard to get the $600 direct payment. Trump is right in saying that'snot enough. We need to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was a visionary. He'sright on this issue.BAIER: You know, obviously, Speaker Pelosi, Senator Chuck Schumer, thetreasury secretary debated this with Republican leadership for a long time.They cut a deal for the $600 stimulus check. Did they just waste their timeand cut a lousy deal?SANDERS: Well, look, when you look at a deal, you have to look at it withinthe context of the problems that we face. And Bret, as I think mostAmericans know, we are living in a terrible unprecedented moment whenmillions of folks have lost their jobs and their income. Tens of millionsof people are facing eviction. We are looking at a record level of hungerin America in the midst of this terrible pandemic. You've got 90 millionpeople who are uninsured or underinsured and can't afford to go to adoctor. You have people accumulating more and more debt, you haveshoplifting, with families -- people trying to get enough food to theirkids.So, in this particular moment, I think we need bold action, and I thinkproviding a $2,000 check to every working-class adult is the right thing todo.BAIER: And there's a lot of people, Senator, that both Republicans andDemocrats who feel the way you do that this is an extenuating circumstance.But on the flip side, there are some who feel like $600 is going to get thejob done right now. And they feel like $463 billion added to the debt atthis moment is not the right thing after this funding bill. What do you sayto them?SANDERS: Well, I -- look, I fought and helped lead the fight for directpayments and I wanted more, we got 600, and that will help a lot of people.But Bret, I was on the floor of the Senate today reading stories that cameto my office from all over this country. And when we're talking about momstrying to feed their kids, we're talking about people worried about beingthrown out on the street because they are faced with the eviction, we got areally serious problem. 600 bucks as President Trump has said is just notenough, not going to do it.Now, in terms of the debt, that, that is a serious issue. And you're right,we're talking about a whole lot of money. But I always find it amusing thatthis sometimes the very same people who voted for a $1-1/2 trillion taxbreak for the one percent and large corporations, they didn't have a worryabout the deficit at that point. When it comes to hundreds of billions ofdollars in corporate welfare, these large profitable corporations, theydon't worry about the deficit, we just voted working on right now.The largest military budget in the history of this country, $740 billion.The Pentagon can't even do an independent audit. There is enormous amountof waste and duplication in that budget, but no one worries about that.When it comes to working families, to the mom and dad who are struggling toput food on the table for their kids, oh, my God, we're worried about thedeficit. So, deficit is an issue.BAIER: Yes.SANDERS: I agree. But I think this -- at this moment, we've got to do theright thing for working families.BAIER: Senator, to your credit, you said the exact same thing to me inApril when we talked at that town hall and you said that you were concernedabout it, but that you thought there was hypocrisy here. I should justpoint out, that was $22 trillion in debt. It's now 27.SANDERS: Yes.BAIER: Let me play Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talking about,you just mentioned defense, the NDAA.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Our colleague from Vermont is again puttingpolitical stunts before the needs of our men and women in uniform. TheSenate will not let our national security be shoved off course. Certainlynot by senators who have spent years literally years trying to gutAmerica's capabilities while our adversaries continue ramping up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So, are you and your Democratic senators' colleagues dug in onforcing a delay on this override --(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: First of all -- first of all, that vote is going to take place.So, what McConnell said is just not accurate. Of course, it's going to takeplace.BAIER: But why delay it?SANDERS: Because it is the only tool that I have, Bret, in order to force avote. The real issue and what -- I was down on the floor of the Senatetoday demanding is, what is McConnell's problem? In the House, 44Republicans voted to provide $2,000 checks to working-class families.In the Senate, as you know, a number of Republicans, I don't know, it'sfive or six have said they want to vote for this. All that I am asking ofMitch McConnell, give us a vote. He wants to vote against it, that's fine.What is the problem giving us a vote? And if he wants to announce that votenow, he can have his vote on the -- on the defense override in fiveminutes.But it's the only tool --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: OK. So, you're going to do relent and let it come out on Saturday,this vote, the override?SANDERS: Right now, it's the only tool that all that I want -- all that Iwant is -- and I think the American people don't understand what is theproblem with having a vote. If people want to vote it against it, voteagainst it. If you want to vote for it, vote for it. Let's have the vote.BAIER: OK. So, what are the problems you have with the other elements thatMitch McConnell is now wrapping into this $2,000 check which is the Section230 prohibitions? And also looking into election fraud and concerns aboutelection fraud not even necessarily for this election but for elections tocome.SANDERS: Right, right. I don't --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Why is that a problem?SANDERS: I have no -- I don't have a problem. For example, there are awhole -- the way we do elections needs a whole lot of improvement. Thereare parts of this country where people are waiting in line for five or sixhours in order to vote. There is a lot of voter suppression, voterintimidation. I worry about the possibility.Well, I mean, just the whole lot of things that are out there, sure, let'slook at it. But don't attach it to the issue of the moment which is peopleare desperate they need help.He wants to bring that up, let's do it. You want to talk about Section 230?Fine, we can do it. But why do you want to attach it to a bill which isjust so important to working families?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: I get what you're saying, Senator. I really do. I get what you'resaying. But couldn't this be put back in House Speaker Pelosi's lap, andSenator Schumer's lap and say, why did you relent to $600? Why didn't youlisten to Bernie Sanders and say $2,000?I mean they agreed to this deal. It went through, it got compromised. Theypassed it and broke chambers.SANDERS: Right, Right.BAIER: And now you're going back, and the President agrees with you.SANDERS: Well, that's the point. I mean, I think what, you know, my viewhas always been as you well know that the $600 was not adequate, I wantedmore. You make a fair point. But the point also is that you have apresident right now who is telling Republicans in a very strong way, Imight say, in the Senate, do the right thing.Do it -- I think, ASAP was his term. Do it as soon as possible. And if thepresident is saying that, and you got President-elect Biden saying that,you got the House having voted on it, let's do it. Let's do it.BAIER: OK, let me ask you two other things. Did either of the Democraticcandidates down in Georgia ask you to campaign for them in the final daysahead of this runoff?SANDERS: Did they ask me to go to Georgia to campaign? No, they did not.BAIER: Does that tell you anything about them?SANDERS: No.BAIER: Or where that race is?SANDERS: No, I think that race is very, very important. And I would say toour friends in Georgia that it is terribly important that we elect Warnockand Ossoff so that, in fact, if we're unable to move aggressively right nowon those $2,000 checks, we will do it, I believe. I can't speak for JoeBiden. But I think it will be at the very top of the agenda for a Bidenadministration.BAIER: What does it tell you that the Biden transition team hasn't, and thepresident-elect hasn't picked someone for the job you've expressed interestin, the labor secretary?SANDERS: Well, look, what I have -- so, I think the picks, many of thepicks that the president-elect has made are really excellent. And I think,especially in the area of COVID-19 and healthcare, you're going to see aradical change, and God knows we need that.I share the president-elect's concern that the vaccines are not getting outas quickly as they should. What I have said many times, Bret is that Ithink the progressive movement in this country is, you know, 40-45 percentof the Democratic coalition. And I think it is appropriate that theprogressive movement have representation in the Biden Cabinet. That's wasmy point, that is my point, that's what I believe.BAIER: Do you think it's progressive enough as it stands today?SANDERS: It is -- it's pretty good. It's pretty good, but not as strong asI would like it to be.BAIER: Senator Sanders, we always appreciate you coming on. Thanks for thetime.SANDERS: Thank you, Bret. Happy New Year, everybody.BAIER: You too.Up next, new developments on several fronts in the battle against thecoronavirus pandemic.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  The new coronavirus strain from Great Britain has now beenconfirmed in two U.S. states.

In Colorado, officials have confirmed one caseand suspect another, both assigned by the National Guard to work at a ruralnursing home outside Colorado Springs.JARED POLIS, (D) COLORADO GOVERNOR:  There's nothing that indicates thatthis would cause different or severe symptoms. But if it does transmit morequickly, obviously more people get it, it means more people hospitalized.VOGEL:  And in California, Governor Gavin Newsom making the announcementthe strain had hit the Golden State during a joint virtual conversationWednesday afternoon with Dr. Anthony Fauci.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  I don't think that the Californians should feel that this issomething odd. This is something that's expected.VOGEL:  Perhaps accounting for an explosion of virus cases across thenation, but especially in southern and central California, where capacityin the ICU remains at zero and no relief in sight, with the end of the yearcelebrations just days away.FAUCI:  That's what we are concerned about, that in addition to the surge,we're going to have an increase superimposed upon that surge, which couldmake January even worse than December.VOGEL:  And while the rollout of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have beenhampered by delays, there is hope across the pond as a third vaccine wasnow available.(END VIDEO TAPE)VOGEL (on camera):  And today the U.K. became the first country to giveemergency authorization to a new coronavirus vaccine developed byAstraZeneca and the University of Oxford which touts a cheaper and easierto store method and the hope of vaccinating 1 million people per week.Bret, back to you.BAIER:  Anita, thank you.Republican Representative-elect Luke Letlow of Louisiana has died just daysbefore he was set to be sworn in.

We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:  New details tonight about the background and a possible missedwarning sign concerning the man behind that massive explosion in Nashvilleon Christmas Day. Correspondent Mike Tobin is in Nashville with more.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Video from security camerasshows the impact of the Christmas Day bomb on downtown businesses.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We did get the back wind of it. So all the exteriordoors of our building were blown open.TOBIN:  911 calls reflect the first mysterious reports of hearing gunshots,then fear at the warning blared from the RV, and finally the blast.TOBIN:  There have been three rounds of gunshots inside the building.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There is a recording out there that's saying there'sa limited time to evacuate this area. There's a large bomb inside thisvehicle.TOBIN:  There was a big fiery explosion on top of the building. That's whatI've seen.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my God, my entire building just fell down, andit's collapsing.TOBIN:  An incident report from August 21st, 2019, shows the suspectedbomber Anthony Warner, contrary to police statements, did get the attentionof authorities. A girlfriend of Warner made statements that her boyfriendwas building bombs in the RV trailer at his residence, and that the suspectfrequently talks about military and bomb making. Police attempted severaltimes and could not get the suspect to answer the door.The report says the yard was fenced off. Police saw the RV but could notsee inside it, and the property was wired with cameras and alarms. Policesay the hazardous device unit followed up, but with advice from a lawyer,Warner did not allow police on his property.

Mike, thanks.Los Angeles County prosecutors are pushing back tonight against the newdistrict attorney's directive that would end most sentencing enhancements,including those related to gangs, guns, and repeat offenders. The grouprepresenting hundreds of county prosecutors is seeking a restraining order,claiming what George Gascon is ordering them to do is unethical andillegal.Up next, the races for Georgia's two Senate seats are coming to a head withthe balance of power in the Senate hanging in the balance, as Congressaddresses more stimulus and a veto override. We'll discuss it all with thepanel next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, (D-MD) SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  We could get it toPresident Trump's desk today. He could sign it. And Mitch McConnell andSenate Republicans are holding this up and playing political games, andpeople are hurting.SEN. RON JOHNSON, (R-WI) SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  There is a demand toincrease the $600 per person payments up to $2,000 per person, which wouldincrease the average amount of money going to households from about $2,400in the original CARES Act to a family of four would get $8,000, money wedon't have, money that we're borrowing from our kids' future. So I think weneed to target that a little bit more.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That's the debate, and it's ongoing now. The president is forincreasing the stimulus to $2,000. You heard Bernie Sanders early in theprogram saying that.Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at "TheFederalist," Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the AssociatedPress, and Bill McGurn, columnist for "The Wall Street Journal."Bill, you heard Senator Sanders earlier in the show saying why can't MitchMcConnell just do an up or down vote on just that? That's not what he'sdoing.BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right, well, the truth is the wholething is a political game, and there's a reason that the Democrats are soexcited about it. It's all about Georgia. Senator Sanders has also saidGeorgia, progressivism is on the ballot in Georgia, and it is. And that'sthe only reason people are interested in these two provisions, Section 230on the defense bill, and the $2,000.It's designed to split the Republicans, to either force them to break withTrump or to go with Donald Trump, as in Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue,and sort of against earlier votes. I think, my guess is they are going tobe all right. They said they sided with Donald Trump on the $2,000. Theonly thing that matters right now is who wins in Georgia. This is amicrocosm because it shows what's at stake, and that's why everyone isjumping in on it.BAIER:  Julie, a lot of people are saying this is the big issue in Georgia,and of course the control of the Senate is broader than the head-to-headraces in either one of those runoffs. You have Joe Manchin from WestVirginia, a Democrat, who said he would vote against blowing up thefilibuster. He said he would vote against defunding police and otherthings. Is that enough to convince moderates to say that progressivism isnot going to get a foothold with a Chuck Schumer Senate?JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  I think there's thereality of what the Senate would look like even if there is a Democraticmajority, and then there's the messaging around the Senate, and certainlythe messaging is pushing more the idea that if Democrats were to takecontrol, then this would essentially be a field day for progressives.I think the reality is that even if Joe Biden has a Democratic controlledSenate, he has members like, as you mentioned, Joe Manchin, who is not anautomatic rubber-stamp for a Democratic agenda. And Joe Biden himself ismuch more of a moderate than a progressive. So Biden would have to grapplewith the divisions within a Democratic led Senate the same way that MitchMcConnell right now is very much dealing with divisions within his ownparty even though he is the majority leader.BAIER:  Bernie Sanders, Mollie, in the earlier segment, here's a clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT):  I think President Trump is the most dangerouspresident in the history of our country, but he happens to be right on thisissue. I think he is correct in saying that we are living in a terrible,terrible economic moment for tens of millions of working-class families. Wefought very hard to get the $600 direct payment. Trump is right in sayingthat's not enough. We need to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was avisionary. He's right on this issue.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So is it concerning for President Trump or Trump supporters ifBernie Sanders is agreeing with you?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  Usually something to beworried about, but remember that Senator Sanders and Senator Hawley hadboth pushed for larger direct payments to the Americans who have had theirlives so grievously harmed by government shutdowns.I thought another thing that Senator Sanders said was interesting which isabout people saying that they opposed the increased direct payments becauseof concerns about debt. And it is charming to hear people say this whenthey just passed this bloated bill, when you have states getting bailoutsbecause they are suffering from lack of tax dollars because of how theyshut down the economy, when money is going overseas, when $6.5 trillion hasbeen spent on the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and how the sameSenate is trying to make it so that Donald Trump cannot bring troops home,doing whatever they can to make sure that those wars continue.It would be great if people really cared about how much money is beingspent, but that they only seem to express concern when it comes to directpayments to the Americans who have had their jobs taken away from them, whocan't go to church or go to school or go to jobs that can't be done from adesk like so many elite people can, it's a little bit too much to take. Andit's important that we help people out during this time and that SenateRepublicans do something if they do care about winning these Georgia Senateraces.BAIER:  Yes, speaking of Georgia, Bill you mentioned that as well, listen,this veto override is a key issue down there. Georgia is, I think, thesixth biggest military state as far as defense contractors as well asmilitary presence in the state. It's a big deal down there. And forSenators Loeffler and Perdue, that's a big vote. But right now that's beendelayed by people like Senator Bernie Sanders.MCGURN:  It would be nice for them if it were delayed until after theelection. It is a big vote. I'm of the view that Section 230 really doesneed something of an overall, but it needs a real debate, not to be tackedon at the end of a bill like this and thrown there before a New Year'sdeadline.To me this is Donald Trump's big moment. I'm of the belief that with allthe dissension and all, some Republicans are irritated with him and someRepublicans in Georgia might not vote because they don't like his attackson their -- my opinion is they need Donald Trump to pull out Georgia. If hedoes that, he's going to be hailed -- he will go out on a winning note, ifhe can do it. Whatever else happens on these other votes, if he does that,he will go out on a winning note. If he doesn't, he'll be blamed.And the interesting thing in this race is though it's such a national race,it's the opposite of Tip O'Neill's all politics is local. All politics isnational in these races. Joe Biden is a nonentity. Jon Ossoff had 100,000fewer voters than Joe Biden. So it just shows, it will confirm he has nocoattails, as we saw in November.BAIER:  Julie, very quickly, now Senator Josh Hawley, Republican fromMissouri, is signing on to this effort to challenge the election results.What does that mean big picture, come January 6th?PACE:  Big picture it means nothing in terms of Joe Biden being sworn in,but it is now the third issue we are talking about where Republicans areforced to do something very, very difficult in early January. It's going tobe a tough entry for some of these Republicans who would really ratheravoid dealing with this issue.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much. When we come back, policeofficers show we can always get back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, in Massachusetts Officer Matthew Lima didsomething unexpected after getting reports of shoplifting from a localgrocery store, he decided instead of arresting the two girls, he paid forthe groceries they attempted to steal. He said it was time for a lesson andsome compassion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATTHEW LIMA, SOMERSET, MASSACHUSETTS, POLICE OFFICER:  Right away when Ilooked at those items, I noticed that they were all grocery items, theywere all food items. If I were in that situation, I would be grateful ifsomebody could help me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Help. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it forthe SPECIAL REPORT.
