'Off the Record', 10/31/13: Washington is all about the fight and never about the facts ... but it's time for the truth on the Benghazi terror attacks

Let's just go "Off the Record" for a second. We are finally hearing late tonight that three Benghazi witnesses will meet with lawmakers behind closed doors in a few weeks. But, doesn't it distress you that things went even this far?
Don't you sometimes want to grab two people by the collar and put them in the same room and even tie them to the chair and demand an answer to very simple questions while they are sitting face to face? Well, the Obama administration, from President Obama to Press Secretary Jay Carney, insist they have not blocked any Benghazi witnesses from talking to congressional investigators. But then you hear U.S. senators talk, most notably Senator Lindsey Graham, who say that is completely false, that the administration is blocking the witnesses. One thing is clear. Someone is fudging the facts or even lying big time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They can't both be right. So, stop the drama, the back and forth, the foot-dragging and the fingerpointing. Wouldn't you like to put them in the same room? We deserve the truth, and it would be nice to be spared the political drama. That's the problem with Washington. It's all about the fight, never the facts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
