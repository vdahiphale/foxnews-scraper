KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Marie Harf, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Tyrus. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. 
The break neck pace of the Trump administration intensifies with the new high stakes foreign policy move. China is accusing the White House of launching the largest trade war in history for slapping billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on Chinese goods, this, as our economy continues to boom. U.S. employers adding a solid 213,000 jobs last month. President Trump explains why he's taking action against Beijing.

 DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I respect China, and I respect President Xi, but they've been killing us, $507 billion in trade deficits last year, 507. Who the hell could lose 500? Then you want to do something about it you get attacked. Oh, that's not nice. That's not free trade. The war was lost on trade many years ago.

 TRUMP: A vote for Jon Tester is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the new leader of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters. She is a low I.Q. individual, Maxine Waters. She's somewhere in the mid 60's, I believe. Let's say I'm debating Pocahontas, right? I'm going to get one of those little kits, and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother says she has high cheek bones. That's her only evidence that her mother said she had high cheek bones.

JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: I'll start with the DNA situation. A couple weeks ago we had our little DNA tests and we all got them done. And I believe I was 99.9 percent European, and .1 percent sub-Saharan-African. So that would be like if I went into college and claimed I was a minority in order to get a leg up in the admissions process. It's kind of in a way what Elizabeth Warren is being accused of doing at Harvard as a professor. I don't know if she has any Native American blood, her grandmother says she might have had Indian blood. I'm not sure. There's only one way to prove it. I mean, looking at her she looks about as white as Dana Perino.

GUILFOYLE: I have high cheek bones. 
WATTERS: There's only one way to prove it. But the Pocahontas nickname really has stuck and she has not been able to shake this, same with the low I.Q. Maxine Waters. And we saw this nickname deal in the primaries with, you know, what was it, sweaty Marco or lying Ted. And these.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Do you want to talk about China and the tariffs? 
HARF: Sure, yes, I will talk about China and the tariffs. So, what's interesting is these tariffs, not with just China, but also with Canada, Mexico, and the E.U., have the real potential to hurt real voters across the country whether it's soybean farmers in Indiana who are already starting to feel the consequences of this. So my question for the president is when he starts to hear from these states, from senators in the Republican Party who are up for re-election, or other members of congress, that the tariffs are hurting the voters back at home, will that change the calculation because the president hold -- fear of the cases if he puts these really tough tariffs on these other countries will come and negotiate and make better trade deals, but we haven't seen any evidence they're willing to do. So the president is playing hard ball. We have no new trade deals in place. And meanwhile, there's great economic news, as you mentioned, that has the potential to be undercut in people's paychecks and wallets if the tariffs continue for some time. It's a political question at some point. Not just an economic one for the president.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, the president, Dana, has been, you know, pretty steadfast on his talking points, you know, about the economy, about the tariffs that he feels it was unequal bargaining between the United States and China has been in place pretty much for 40 years where they have had these discrepancies where he feels like we have had sort of a disadvantage that we've been operating on, and so he's trying to correct that. What do you think about the timing and the impact on the economy?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');

        }
      
PERINO: Well, I keep thinking that every morning we'll wake up and find out, oh, everything is solved, and there was a big agreement overnight and everything is fine, looks like that's not going to happen. The other thing is there's a piece in the New York Times today that reiterated the president floating that idea at the G-7, why don't we just take all the tariffs off? And Ed Feulner of the Heritage Foundation said that we'd be for that. And I'm like -- actually, go with that, why don't we try that with our allies. We're going to see most of them next week anyway when he goes to the NATO meeting. I do think it has the potential to hurt people. It takes a long time to build market share especially if you're a farmer, soybean farmer or cattle rancher. It takes a while and it can be undone pretty quickly. That's why I hope that it gets done. 
But one of the reasons that we have a trade deficit is that we are pretty wealthy country and we like to buy cheap things, and China makes a lot of cheap things that we like to buy. And I think that a little bit of this turned on its head. The other thing I would say is the president is about to embark on 11-day foreign trip. He's got a lot of great opportunities, but it's also fraught with a lot of challenges because my role is every time a president goes on a foreign trip, something major happens at home. So, on Monday night he'll announce the Supreme Court pick, and then he will be off and he'll go and he'll let the White House and the senate try to work on that nomination. And he'll be out of the country. I think that's actually a pretty smart strategy. But then always something else happens at home. Nobody knows what it's going to be. 
GUILFOYLE: OK. So we'll see. We're going to look for that and hear about it first on the Daily Briefing.

GUILFOYLE: So nice to have you back again for another day.
TYRUS: Amazing to be here. Look, we have a saying, where I'm from, it's called break bread or play dead, and that's what we're doing with China. We have the high ground. They need us more than we need then. And they've enjoyed a pretty good run of getting the benefit of making a lot of money at our expense. He knows he's got four aces in his hand. China knows he's got four aces in his hand. They're going to -- and on top of that the economy is great and, in fact, Wall Street shook it off and just kept going with the new jobs. So there wasn't a big -- what was it? My dear colleague Richard is like, wait until midnight and those tariffs come in, it's another one of those horror movies that's coming that never actually coming.

TYRUS: Yeah. Midnight it's trouble. We have time. Our economy is good. Our jobs are good. China has a lot of exports, so they need us. So this was a good move. And let's just be patient and see what happens. 
WATTERS: It's not only a trade policy, but it's a national security strategy with China because when we brought them into the WTO they abused the system. They dumped all these cheap goods into the United States. They manipulate their currency. They don't allow foreign investment. They restrict that very forcefully. And they're building up their navy big time. So, all we're saying is, listen, you know, we need to contain China, and we've got to have our allies in order to contain China and protect U.S. workers because, you know, ever since China got into the WTO, the American blue collar men and women that worked a lot of long hours in this country have gotten hammered. The wages have gone down and the jobs have left. So Trump came in to protect those people. And one of the ways to do that is to contain the rise of China. They're a big global threat. There's going to be a big clash of the great powers eventually. And I would disagree with Marie. You said that, you know, our allies and the people that we've been, you know, doing these little tariff wars with haven't really done anything. South Korea caved on autos and steel. 
HARF: We already had a deal with them though. There's no new deal.

HARF: What are the new trade deal, Jesse? 
WATTERS: No, they're renegotiating current deals right now. France has agreed to pay more for the NATO cost. Germany, Angela Merkel said the other day, didn't get picked up that she's willing to drop auto tariffs too. And the E.U and Japan have now come in and encircled China within the WTO along our side. So, I think he is moving the needle on that.

PERINO: Not really. I mean, I think a lot of these numbers get thrown around. And this is like -- with the WTO, the United States wins 89 percent of the cases that it takes to the WTO. Can we get to 100 percent win? Maybe. I mean, China is not innocent here by a long shot, and especially when it comes to intellectual property theft and technology companies, they absolutely should be call on for that. But I think the place to do this would be with our allies with NATO. But, again, even that still is like, you know, giving NATO a bloody nose on the way to a better trade deal? I don't know. I mean, maybe it will all work out. I'm hopeful. 
GUILFOYLE: OK. So, Dana is optimistic with her sunny side up. What do you think?

HARF: Fox News alert, it's a race against the clock to save 12 boys and their soccer coach trap in a flooded cave in Thailand as tragedy strikes. Trace Gallagher is standing by with the latest. Trace?

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Marie, for the past four days the rescue teams in and around those caves in Thailand have had very high hopes for getting those 12 boys and their coach out safely, but now that optimism has diminished a bit following the death of a Thai navy seal. The 38-year-old expert diver was coming out of the cave around 1 o'clock in the morning when he ran out of oxygen and passed out. At the time, he was trying to establish an oxygen line into the chamber where the boys are trapped because the oxygen level in there has dropped from 21 percent to 15 percent. That's significant. They are now using canister to try and fill the cavern with more oxygen, to kind of raise the level. The diver's death highlights what we have been emphasizing for days which is that even for experts getting in and out of the cave is extremely dangerous. And most of these boys don't even know how to swim, let alone utilize dive gear through muddy water and narrow passageways. Earlier on Shepard Smith reporting, I spoke with a former secret service agent and rescue diver about the emotional toll of trying to swim out. Watch.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you're nervous or you're anxious or you don't know what you're doing, or it's dark and the waters are murky and they're raging, I mean, there are a number of factors that just go really negatively in my opinion for a water rescue. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)

 GALLAGHER: It's worth noting that some of the passageways are so narrow that even with the help of expert divers there are portions of the trip out, like a mile, mile and a half, where the boys would have to navigate the channels alone. For now, the rescue teams are waiting. But if the oxygen levels continue to drop inside the cave or the water levels rise because of these monsoon rains that are forecast this weekend, swimming out sooner than later may be the only option. Marie? 
HARF: Thanks, Trace. Well, Kimberly, this is a horrific story. It was initially happy when they were found because we didn't know for many days if they're actually alive. One cave diver has called this rescue the underground equivalent of climbing Mount Everest. We've got a five hour trip to reach them. I mean, what do we make of this and how can people follow this story with anything but extreme sadness right now. 
GUILFOYLE: You know, it's really true. It's just heart wrenching. It's heart breaking when you think about it, when you sit with somebody who is an expert in their field. The Thai navy SEAL, God bless them, who is such a hero trying to go in to increase the oxygen levels in there so these children would be able to survive. And then he lost and gave his own life. That just goes to show you how dangerous and how serious and fraught the situation is. And you have to think that some of the best and brightest minds, you know, not just in this country but in the world are trying to put their heads together to work, cooperatively, and everybody comes together when you think about this to try to save the life of, you know, children who are just really just relying on us and just poor things are so desperate in there to be able to survive.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you see these images, and if you look at some of the graphics that you've seen on the internet, on the web, in terms of the whole layout, the structure of it, you see how complicated it is, in fact, to be able to effectuate a rescue. And I just say to myself this is really a situation where, you know, they need like a miracle. And they need our prayers and they need everybody to really think in a creative, unique way about how they can do this and, you know, keep them alive so that they can get them out.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
HARF: Well, that's a good point, Jesse, because they're now looking at alternatives ways to bring the group out. One option is possibly boring a hole down into the cave, sort of like they did with the Chilean miners, if folks remember that several years ago. One option was for them to stay in the cave, bring in supplies, and they could stay there until the monsoon season ended and then they could get out more safely. But now, as Trace mentioned, there's an oxygen problem. So, people -- there's a 140 cave divers from around the world who are helping, and people are trying to come up with solutions here which is a good thing. There's a loft innovation in the world that maybe can help. 
WATTERS: Yeah, the best and brightest out there. And like Kimberly said it's going to take a miracle. Sometimes miracles do happen, and in a way it's a sad story but it's also very uplifting story because you see how much the world values life. And everybody comes together, all these experts are volunteering their own time and money to go in. Other countries are getting involved, other organizations. Boring a hole seems dangerous because that could collapse it. And then, just feeding them oxygen could only last for so long because the monsoon season, I guess, ends in October. So that's what? Three months from now. 
HARF: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And there's just limited resources. If the analogy of being an underground Mount Everest, just think about it, but there's no guide. It's like these people are going in solo. It's dark. And then you have to train young starving, you know, terrified young boys how to swim and scuba dive on a level that not even experts can handle. I'm just -- I'm praying for them as Kimberly said. 
HARF: So, Dana, there are people from around the world, from Britain, from China, from the U.S. in there trying to help. These are boys aged 11 to 16 and they're 25-year-old coach. 
PERINO: So, I agree in terms of -- the only thing that we can do is pray for them, and to send positive thoughts because the rains are coming and Mother Nature has a way of reminding you we are not all powerful. So, I do think that's why prayers are in order. I have a mixed feeling about following this so closely. I'm glad that we can, and we can know that they're there. But I worry a little bit about the social media part of it, for some reason it gets under my skin. 
HARF: Tyrus, what do you think about that?

        }
      
TYRUS: As a parent it's difficult to imagine. You know, the frustration and the fear that they're going through. And I'm hoping that they're able to communicate with their children. Because swimming, as a guy who scuba dives, swimming for a mile under water in the dark I wouldn't do try it myself. You know, to ask a small child to do that who is air deprived and afraid is just tragic. The whole scene is bad. So I really hope they're able to be with their parents at least communicate with them or something. 
HARF: We will all keep praying for them, keep them and their families in our thoughts here. Meanwhile, the President ripping Democrats again over their continued call to abolish ICE. That's next on The Five. Stay tune.

 PERINO: All right, Jesse, are Democrats on thin ice? 
WATTERS: Whoa. 
PERINO: Thank you. 
WATTERS: Well done. Well done. I will say this about the woman that scaled the statue. She's totally selfish and she cost the city a lot of money. She diverted resources that should be fighting crime in order to bring her down. She ruined July 4th for a bunch of families, 3,000 families had to be turned away, 4,000 families are already at the statue had to be shipped out of there, all because of, what? She disagrees with the immigration policy and she's a kook. She's got a bunch of lawsuit. She's been arrested a bunch of times. Ridiculous person. But, my point is. 
GUILFOYLE: You would have left her up there, too. 
WATTERS: It reminded me of the anthem kneelers. When the anthem kneelers, they knell and they say it's about something and everybody else thinks it's about disrespect and something else. It's not a very good protest. The tactics are wrong. It goes the other way. Remember, occupy Wall Street started off as, you know, we want, you know, solid wages for people, and then they started like fighting cops and blocking traffic? Or black lives matter, yeah, against police brutality, that's a good thing. And then they like protest the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and ruin all, you know, the camaraderie for the families there. It just goes in the opposite direction and it plays into the President Trump's hands. He won on law and order, safety and security, and respect for law enforcement. And I agree, she's a clown.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
PERINO: You like him drawing the distinction between what he wants to run on which is safety and security, and basically saying that the Democrats want you to not be safe? 
TYRUS: Well, I mean, that's 101 -- I mean, that's 101 -- political playbook 101. I mean, Republicans always run on law and order, and Democrats just want to have a party and let everybody in free and give away everyone else's money. That's why Republicans want to keep your money because you earned it. That's why I'm a Republican. But, protests are uncomfortable. This is why I disagree with Jesse a little bit. Any protest is uncomfortable, and there's a reason for it. And being a citizen of the United States you have the right to protest. Her approach, climbing, I probably wouldn't have done it, but it got a lot of attention and people are talking about it. And even despite her weirdness or the fact that she blamed it on Michelle Obama who said take the high ground, so she took the highest ground. I was like, that's not -- what are you doing?
(CROSSTALK)

 WATTERS: Michelle didn't want any of that. 
TYRUS: No. But the point is, like she has a right -- as Americans we have the right to protest, and I would never infringe upon that. And no one was hurt, but I agree with you, as a Republican and a conservative, she cost us a lot of money and hurt the city. And I would prefer your protest be free of charge for me and my taxes is all I'm saying. 
WATTERS: Get a permit. 
TYRUS: Not to melt the ice. But ICE is a tough job. They're following their directives, going after saying we're going to take away ICE I think is unfair to the men and women who work their behinds off. They're following their directives. If you have issues, maybe change policies, maybe change the ways things are done, but don't attack the institution. Those are American citizens who are working hard and following directions. 
PERINO: Yeah. And, Marie, you're an expert in communications and you worked for a Democratic administration. Do you feel like this is all like really off, like some sort of discorded violin, like, whoa, what are you guys doing?

GUILFOYLE: I like that word. 
HARF: Yes, I think that the president knows immigration is a winner with him with his base, and I don't want the Democrats to fall into the trap of running to an extreme. Look, ICE is a problem right now because of the policies the president is having implemented, as Tyrus just said. So, if you want to change the policies you have to change the politician, right? 
PERINO: Right. 
HARF: And so I don't think ICE and the men and women of it should be the target. We also have almost a dozen ICE members signing a letter this week, calling for ICE to be reconstituted to take away from some of the things they've been asked to do under President Trump, which was not their original mandate. They were originally set up after 9/11, in part to help do things like help fight terrorism. 
So look, illegal immigration numbers have been steadily declining for a decade. We do not have a crisis at the border, but we need better immigration policies, and we need border security. 
The problem is the president runs way far to the right. He runs way far to one extreme, and Democrats fall into the trap and often run way far to the other extreme, which I think is bad politics and also bad policy. And there's no one in the middle any more --
PERINO: Interesting.

PERINO: Interesting, Kimberly, because you do look at sort of the independents are saying they're -- they agree immigration should be dealt with, but they just want Washington to do something. Do you think that they will ever get anything done? 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, it's very frustrating to me. But I think this extremism, this rhetoric, "Abolish ICE," I think it's nonsensical. I don't like it. 
I think that we should stand. I agree with your points that we should stand with the men and women that are working hard, trying to do something to help this country in terms of public safety and enforce the laws. I didn't realize that it's so grossly unpopular to actually enforce the laws. They have a law to do.
What's next? Abolish all the police departments? Abolish all the military? I mean, this is just -- makes absolutely no sense. 
WATTERS: No, just the IRS.

(CROSSTALK)
TYRUS: Well, ICE is a slippery slope.
PERINO: That's a big problem. To get attention and to get media attention you have to use, like, the most extreme language. Though they say "abolish ICE," and then all of a sudden it takes on a life of its own, and it drags all the Democrats along with it.

Scientists creating a record-breaking 49 genetically identical copies based on her genes, hoping to crack the genetic code behind her tiny stature. 
GUILFOYLE: Better.
WATTERS: The pint-sized pooch now holds the new world record for most cloned dog according to the Academy of World Records. 
Dana, is this proper? 
PERINO: I'm not for it. 
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: I'm not going to, like -- I don't like it. I think that each creature is created with an individual stamp from God. And I am not for this. I don't think you have to beat every world record. Why do we need 49 of these same dogs?

Kimberly, I think they should name the chihuahua Tiny. 
GUILFOYLE: Not Teeny? 
WATTERS: Not Teeny. Teeny-Tiny. Very teeny and tiny.
GUILFOYLE: Tiny.
WATTERS: Is that a thing? 
GUILFOYLE: Chihuahua.

GUILFOYLE: No, yes, that's cool. 
WATTERS: All right.
TYRUS: Like taken or tooken, you know? 
WATTERS: Not exactly. 
PERINO: Just like that, exactly. 
GUILFOYLE: Wow. OK. Next up, Hooked on Phonics on "The Five." We're going to figure it all out. 
Yes, I think this it is a little creepy. 
WATTERS: Yes. Me, too.
GUILFOYLE: Right?
WATTERS: Even I think it's creepy. 
GUILFOYLE: You might want to clone yourself, Jesse. 
TYRUS: I do.
WATTERS: I know. Forty-nine times, Kimberly. 
TYRUS: I actually do want to clone myself. I would like to raise myself in my own image. I'd correct all the flaws of other people tried raising me. 
WATTERS: What flaws?
TYRUS: I would have a perfect me.
GUILFOYLE: Wow. 
TYRUS: Spend -- spend a weekend with me. Think about it. You could raise yourself. Who would be more proud of you than you? 
WATTERS: Never disappointed. 
PERINO: Jesse has no problem with that, though. 
HARF: What if you hated -- 
TYRUS: Can you imagine a little Jesse running around who was exactly everything.
HARF: What if you hated yourself?
TYRUS: I don't. 
HARF: Well, what if you did? 
TYRUS: Well, then I wouldn't clone myself. 
WATTERS: You would not clone yourself.
TYRUS: But I love me some Tyrus, and I would love a little Tyrus. 
HARF: I have nothing to add to this conversation. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
HARF: I just can't imagine a little Tyrus. 
GUILFOYLE: Or a teeny. 
WATTERS: Teeny-tiny Tyrus. 
TYRUS: He'd start out in a little vase and watch him grow. 
PERINO: FiveFanPhotoshop can work on that. 
GUILFOYLE: He'd have a little hat on backwards like this. 
WATTERS: Next up --
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: -- soap cutting is now all the rage on social media. One Instagramer slices up colorful bars on camera. Why? She claims it creates a physically pleasant feeling for her more than 10,000 followers. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAELYN BRADY, INSTAGRAMMER: My name is Kaelyn Brady and I have a Soapstagram. I basically just cut soap on Instagram. I like softer soap. They're, like, a real nice smooth cut, and they have a smooth sound when they drop.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Oh, it's the sound when it drops. 
GUILFOYLE: I think this is a little weird. I think it's a little fetishy or something. 
PERINO: Jesse, were you hurting for material today? 
WATTERS: I didn't pick this stuff. 
GUILFOYLE: Jesse. 
WATTERS: All right. Anybody have any thoughts on soap? 
HARF: Can I make money doing this? Can you make money doing this? 
PERINO: Honestly, we have 4 percent unemployment rate. I mean, it's amazing how you can make money. Unbelievable. 
GUILFOYLE: I mean, like -- 
WATTERS: In the Trump economy, anything is possible. 
PERINO: Yes. Soap cutting is a thing. 
TYRUS: Playing outside that bad? 
GUILFOYLE: I just think this is a little -- 
TYRUS: Going on a date?
WATTERS: At least they're clean. 
HARF: This is why I'm not on social media.
TYRUS: They're not using the soap for that. They just cut it and then cut some more. 
HARF: Very wasteful. They waste the soap.
PERINO: Exactly. Some people need that soap. 
TYRUS: A teeny bit weird. 
WATTERS: I don't have time, but I'm going to move on. Finally tonight --
GUILFOYLE: You're struggling today, Jess. What's going on?
WATTERS: Tyrus, I think you'll really appreciate this video. Here's a Buffalo, New York, wrestler launching his opponent a dozen feet in the air over the top rope and out of the ring. Play it. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And signaling for it here. Both men go to the corner. And he's pounced to the outside. Pounce sends him over the top to the outside!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That was one of the best moves I've seen in a while. 
TYRUS: Uh, #oops. I hope they're friends, because you owe him dinner. 
WATTERS: Yes, what happens when you injure the guy you're wrestling?
PERINO: Not gentlemanly.
TYRUS: Listen, if you go back in the beginning, first of all, homey's in a little better shape. Because he's blown up. It's a term, he's blown up. But they talked before they went, and the guy was, like, "Are you sure?" And the guy just hit. 
This was a mistake, because otherwise you have to do this every night for the next three nights. 
GUILFOYLE: That doesn't look like a mistake to me. 
WATTERS: Wait, whose mistake was it?
HARF: The guy who got tossed --
TYRUS: The guy who hesitated.
HARF: -- came back into the ring and won. Did you see that?
TYRUS: The skinny guy, the guy with the skunk hair, he hesitates when he gets up, like no. 
WATTERS: Oh, yes!
TYRUS: Then he jumps in the air. 
WATTERS: I saw that.
TYRUS: The other guy is exhausted. These are two young guys trying to find their way. Mistakes happen. That's why they're not on the main stage yet.
WATTERS: I saw that. He hesitates. He goes up.
TYRUS: Wrestling is simulated combat. But your opponent, he puts his body into your hands. And in my career, I'd never hurt anybody in the ring, and that's something I'm very proud of. You're going to do painful things. We know certain things are going to hurt. But that's extra. So --
WATTERS: Have you ever been hurt in the ring by somebody else? 
TYRUS: You know what? I wrestled Heath Slater. He kept jabbing me in a house show and kept popping me in the eye, and I was like, "Brah, I swear." And he'd be like, "Oh, I'm so sorry." Popped me again. I was like, "One more time." And he did it again and I end up chasing him around the ring, because I'm going to hit you. He's like, "Don't hit me." So yes, he stiffed me a lot. Wherever you are, Slater. But -- 
WATTERS: You're scaring Dana. Are you OK?
PERINO: Yes, I'm good. I'm fascinated. I thought it was all fake. 
TYRUS: The only thing that is fake that we know for sure is news. OK. Simulated combat. Yes, maybe predetermined, but it's a whole -- way to get there. 
PERINO: I don't know. I mean, is it not?
TYRUS: Respect the wrestling biz. 
WATTERS: I cannot believe that.
TYRUS: Respect the magic show.
PERINO: I respect it.
TYRUS: But it still hurts. 
PERINO: Please -- please don't hurt me. 
GUILFOYLE: I think -- it looks like he did that on person.
HARF: But the guy who got thrown out.
TYRUS: The guy got thrown out was -- 
HARF: -- came back in and won.
TYRUS: Because he's supposed to. 
HARF: Yes.
TYRUS: But if he was smart, he would have sold it, got counted out and then would go again next week. But -- 
HARF: How I feel every day on this show. 
GUILFOYLE: And then they went and used some soap. 
PERINO: That is fascinating. 
TYRUS: Yes, it's a tough hustle. Don't get it twisted. 
PERINO: I really -- the most I've ever learned.
TYRUS: You've got to be Shakespeare. You've got to be an athlete, and you've got to be able to heal quick. 
WATTERS: Yes. Dana's going over the turnbuckle.
HARF: That's what they say to Jesse every day here. 
WATTERS: All right. Tyrus, be nice to her, because I'm not going to do anything about it. 
GUILFOYLE: Jesse, let's go.
WATTERS: Don't go anywhere. "Fan Mail Friday" up next. 
PERINO: Fan the flames. 
GUILFOYLE: Jesse, let's go.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
TYRUS: Oh, yes, "Fan May Friday" is finally here. Let's get to it. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRAPHIC: Fan Mail Friday
(TYPEWRITER SOUND)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: That's it.
TYRUS: That's it? Wow. Gripping stuff there.
All right. Facebook question from Jack P., Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. 
TYRUS: "What vegetable did you hate as a child and still hate now?"
PERINO: I've got one. 
GUILFOYLE: OK, so here's the thing. Does it technically count as a vegetable? I think so. 
WATTERS: What?
GUILFOYLE: I don't like beets. I don't like onions. 
PERINO: She hates beets.
GUILFOYLE: I really --
PERINO: I know that about you. If you and I were to do, like, a test. 
TYRUS: The question was for her. Maybe I'm new, but the question is -- you can't -- no assist. This is not Watters. You're not going to interrupt everybody. Answer the -- is it onions or beets? 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, I have to pick one?
TYRUS: Yes. It says one, it doesn't say two. 
GUILFOYLE: I'm going to lead with beets. Good answer? Good answer! Good answer.
PERINO: Good answer. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, beets. It's beets. 
TYRUS: Democrat. 
HARF: I'm going to be -- I'm going to mix it up. I actually really hate certain fruits, like I -- 
TYRUS: That was not the question. You always -- this is the problem. You guys always change the subject. 
HARF: I know, I know. Like, I hate mangos and pineapple. I know. I hate all of that. It makes me nauseous. 
GUILFOYLE: Please don't say that. I love mango.
TYRUS: Vegetables are fine. 
GUILFOYLE: They're from my countries. Puerto Rico, we love mango. 
TYRUS: OK. Watters, don't let me down.
WATTERS: Are peppers a vegetable?
TYRUS: They are, right. Yes.
WATTERS: Peppers.
GUILFOYLE: Wow.
WATTERS: We're going with peppers. 
TYRUS: Peppers.
GUILFOYLE: We're going with peppers.
WATTERS: Final answer. 
GUILFOYLE: Survey says. 
WATTERS: I don't like the consistency of peppers. They're slimy.
TYRUS: Tremendous. 
GUILFOYLE: I like them. And I think they look gorgeous in a salad when you slice red, yellow, orange. 
PERINO: I have one. I have one. Eggplant. 
TYRUS: Eggplant?
WATTERS: Only fried.
GUILFOYLE: Really?
PERINO: Not any of it. 
GUILFOYLE: Have you ever had eggplant lasagna? It's delicious.
HARF: Baba ganoush.
GUILFOYLE: Really good. 
PERINO: Hate baba ganoush. 
TYRUS: You can't come back in now. 
HARF: Coming back in. Coming back in.
PERINO: And you?
TYRUS: You know what? I hate squash. I hate it.
PERINO: Yes. It's not the best. 
GUILFOYLE: Really? 
TYRUS: It's just the name, squash. 
WATTERS: Squash.
TYRUS: It's like -- sort of like --
GUILFOYLE: Isn't it supposed to be a sport. 
TYRUS: -- people who don't like mashed potatoes and they eat squash. I'm a mashed potatoes guy. 
GUILFOYLE: I love mashed potatoes. 
TYRUS: Which is phenomenal, but that was not the question. 
All right. Facebook question No. 2 from Danette H. "What is your morning routine to get ready for work?" Hers is going to -- you're going to take up most of the time. Because you're very organized.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes. How much time do you have?
TYRUS: Yes, please. Let me learn some things.
GUILFOYLE: OK, so morning routine to get ready for work. For work or for the day? 
TYRUS: Whatever you want to go with. 
GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, I would say that 100 percent I have to eat a piece of salami every day. That's become a ritual. So I have to eat salami very day. It's not even a joke. I eat --
TYRUS: No, I'm just trying to be an adult.
GUILFOYLE: And it puts me in my happy -- happy space and whatever. And then I use my like Neutrogena face wipes to make sure I don't have any mascara hanging, whatever. Fresh face. And you know, get ready for the day. And then a little itty-bitty gym workout. 
TYRUS: Itty-bitty. Woman who hates wrestling. 
PERINO: No, I didn't say that. I like it.
TYRUS: Too late.
PERINO: I like it.
TYRUS: She said it.
PERINO: No, I didn't.
TYRUS: Morning routine, what is it?
PERINO: I didn't say anything about that. OK, morning routine, 5:30 a.m., wake up. Start reading. Read, read, read, read, read. 
GUILFOYLE: Send e-mails, e-mails, e-mails.
PERINO: Peter brings me my Carnation instant breakfast and my English breakfast tea with honey. Then I go for my workout and then I come here for the shows. 
TYRUS: Huh.
GUILFOYLE: When Peter's done, can you have him stop by, Dana? 
WATTERS: We don't have to get in until five, actually. So I don't wake up at 5:30 a.m. I roll out whenever I feel like it. Bacon, egg and cheese. Hit the gym really hard. You know what I mean.
TYRUS: Yes, I believe you.
WATTERS: A couple hours. 
GUILFOYLE: Shops (ph).
WATTERS: And, you know, shower, throw on a nice tailored suit and head in and prep hard. 
PERINO: Wow. 
GUILFOYLE: And what about the extreme blow drying that you do of your hair? See? True story. 
WATTERS: Fake news. 
GUILFOYLE: No, it's not. You know it's true.
WATTERS: Fake news. I started blow drying my hair, but it's not an extreme situation. 
GUILFOYLE: I'd say it is. 
WATTERS: It looks better now, doesn't it?
GUILFOYLE: A hundred percent. 
WATTERS: Thank you. 
HARF: I don't know how to follow that. I wake up, I have my coffee. My husband makes breakfast. He's actually a very good cook. 
GUILFOYLE: What kind of things does he make? 
HARF: He makes really good scrambled eggs with all kinds of different stuff in them. So gourmet scrambled eggs. 
PERINO: Peter needs to up his game. Carnation instant breakfast for ten years.
TYRUS: Wow.
PERINO: Literally 10 years.
GUILFOYLE: Like -- yes.
HARF: He's a really good cook. And then I go for a run and then I, like Dana, I read everything I can read and then come in to work. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I really like eggs also in the morning, hard-boiled eggs, poached eggs. Eggs over easy. 
PERINO: Sunny side up? 
GUILFOYLE: Sunny side up. Scrambled eggs. 
TYRUS: No one else here punches the snooze alarm? 
WATTERS: Yogurt.
TYRUS: First thing I do is punch the snooze alarm. I usually wake up with a mean look on my face. I'm lazy so I usually go to Coffee Rainy (ph), where I have my three eggs over medium, bacon, and double toasted. 
GUILFOYLE: Every day?
TYRUS: Every other. 
WATTERS: That's what I'm talking about.
TYRUS: Then I'll go hit the gym and throw down some weights, and then that's when I'll check out my phone after I'm done working out. 
WATTERS: Yes, we should work out sometime. 
TYRUS: Yes, we really should. Yes, absolutely. It would be great.
HARF: Can we all come along?
PERINO: Can I please come watch that?
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. 
TYRUS: You have to be this tall. Actually, you could -- you know what? It would be great. We'll just all work out together. 
PERINO: OK, that would be fun. Oh my gosh, that would be actually very fun. 
GUILFOYLE: I got new workout pants with the pockets in them. What?
TYRUS: Shhh, up next, one more -- "One More Thing" is next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: It's time now for "One More Thing." Kimberly. 
OK. I like calling on myself. All right. Newlyweds barely escape this -- have you seen this on FOX. I saw it, but I thought we should watch it again.
Escape as a tree branch falls while recording their wedding video. 
PERINO: What?
GUILFOYLE: Could you imagine? Watch this. Just look closely here. Ah. 
PERINO: Oh, my word!
GUILFOYLE: So there you go. And it was supposed to be all romantic and sweet. I don't know. I hope they're not superstitious, because that might not be a good sign. 
PERINO: That is a good story to tell, though.
GUILFOYLE: Just saying, right? The new bride suffered minor injuries, and she was able to finish the interview like a total champ which is amazing. She later said that "Our love is forever going to be stronger than the tree." 
PERINO: Absolutely. 
GUILFOYLE: Jesse, I hope have a good "One More Thing" today. 
WATTERS: Well, it involves "Watters' World," so the answer is yes. "Watters' World," 8 p.m. We have Ben Shapiro, Herman Cain and Marie's favorite ladies, Diamond and Silk. 
Now, did you guys hear about this video of this teenager? He got his Make America Great Again hat stolen from him and a drink thrown on him. Check this out.
GUILFOYLE: Not nice. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Supporting the president, you ain't (EXPLETIVE DELETED).
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Whoa. 
GUILFOYLE: Freaked out -- not nice. 
WATTERS: The kid's only 16 years old. And he's going to be on "Watters' World" in a world exclusive. See what I did there?
GUILFOYLE: It really is a world exclusive. That's very nice. And that's good. And you get him a hat.
WATTERS: Yes. We'll get him a new hat. 
GUILFOYLE: All right, good. And that guy lost his job, by the way. 
WATTERS: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: Behaving in that way. It was very, very mean. Not nice. 
WATTERS: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: OK. Thanks, Jesse. I helped -- I'm glad I helped with you that. 
WATTERS: Thank you, Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: Dana.
PERINO: Well, in a "One More Thing" first, I have something to promote. Just kidding. I don't usually have anything to promote for the weekend. But tonight I'm going to fill in for Martha MacCallum tonight on "The Story." 
WATTERS: And on Sunday. 
PERINO: And on Sunday, I have "Fox News Sunday." I'm going to fill in for Chris Wallace just this one week. My guest will be Kay Bailey Hutchison. She's the U.S. ambassador to NATO. And you know the president is headed to do the NATO thing. 
Then I've got Lindsey Graham. He's on the Senate Judiciary Committee. So he'll be there when the Supreme Court nomination is underway. 
And then Ilyse Hogue. She's the president of NARAL, which is pro-choice America. So we'll talk to her also about the Supreme Court. 
And then I will go home to see Peter and Jasper. 
GUILFOYLE: Very, very sweet. Tell them I said hello. Send me some pictures this weekend. And we're going to be watching you on Sunday. That's fantastic. And tonight at 7 p.m. on "The Story." Outstanding.
Hello, Tyrus. 
TYRUS: Hi. I'm excited. My "One More Thing," we're going to keep that dog party going. OK?
PERINO: OK.
TYRUS: Bentley is a 12-year-old Maltese. While his owner, Alexi Leach was away at college, her parents took Bentley on a road trip to Florida from Texas. As they traveled across state lines, they documented with photos of Bentley in front of each state sign. And he became a Twitter phenom, and he garnished over 28,000 retweets and over a thousand likes. He's just out there, living the dream. 
PERINO: Guess who's on "The Story" tonight? Bentley.
WATTERS: No way.
PERINO: Yes, I have the family and the dog are coming on "The Story" tonight. 
GUILFOYLE: How cute is that?
TYRUS: Wow. You just --
WATTERS: Four plugs. 
TYRUS: You're really plugging away. 
GUILFOYLE: Dana and I wrote back and forth about this. 
PERINO: Tyrus is on "The Greg Gutfeld Show" on Saturday night. 
PERINO: Tyris is on "The Greg Gutfeld Show." And Greg Gutfeld is on "The Gutfeld Show."
TYRUS: He's there. 
GUILFOYLE: Where in the world is Greggins? Just where is he? No one knows.
Marie. 
HARF: OK, some sad news for my Cleveland Cavaliers. Everyone knows that LeBron is leaving and going to L.A., but they made it official in Cleveland. His banner has been taken down off of the side of this building. It's a Nike banner. It was at the Sherman Williams headquarters building. If you look at the video, it is massive. I mean, this is from when he -- I think it was put up around the time we won the championship. Anyways for Cavs fans, watching this get taken down was very traumatic. 
WATTERS: What does Cleveland have now? 
TYRUS: The Browns.
PERINO: The Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame. 
HARF: The Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame. The Cleveland Indians. Lake Erie. I can go on.
WATTERS: The Indians? Are you allowed to say that?
HARF: Yes. 
WATTERS: The Cleveland Native Americans. Come on. 
HARF: Great Lake Brewing Company. 
Anyway, LeBron is leaving. It's official. This is a sad day for Cleveland. The banner is gone. Now we have to all root for the L.A. Lakers, which is very painful. 
TYRUS: No, we don't. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: -- name, though. Native American --
WATTERS: Who's on the Denver Nuggets?
PERINO: I'm not exactly sure.
WATTERS: OK.
PERINO: But they are a great team. 
GUILFOYLE: Dana -- all right, Dana, we're going to watch you tonight at 7 p.m. And Sunday and, you know -- 
PERINO: And then Monday I'll be back. 
GUILFOYLE: And Monday, absolutely.
PERINO: And Tuesday.
GUILFOYLE: Dana is here every day. 
All right. Well, that's it for us right now but not for Dana. Be sure to tune in Monday, because Sean Hannity joins us here on "The Five" as our special co-host. 
WATTERS: Wow.
GUILFOYLE: Don't miss it.
