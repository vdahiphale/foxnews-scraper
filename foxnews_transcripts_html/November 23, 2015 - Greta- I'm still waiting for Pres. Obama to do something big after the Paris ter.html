Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: I was hoping Obama would do make a grand gesture in France to American solidarity after the Paris terror attacks, especially since he missed an opportunity with the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

Let's all go "Off the Record." Last week, as those horrible events were unfolding in Paris, I was halfway around the world in Cambodia. As I hop-scotched back home, stopping in Saigon, and Tokyo, I kept checking the news, hoping President Obama would do something big, hugely symbolic, telling the world, and especially France, that we stand with you against ISIS.
Because symbolism matters. And as president, he represents all of us. I was embarrassed in January when many world leaders showed up in Paris and marched in solidarity with France after the Charlie Hebdo attack, and President Obama didn't go. He stayed home. He should have gone to Paris, and he should have marched with those leaders. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So after that embarrassing no-show, I figured he had to learn his lesson and this time, he would make a grand gesture, like directing the pilots of Air Force One to take him to Paris to meet with President Hollande. But no, he didn't. And worse, tomorrow it's French President Hollande who is jumping on a plane traveling to Washington to see President Obama. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It should be the other way around. And that's the way the Brits and Germans are doing, British Prime Minister David Cameron went to Paris today to meet with President Hollande, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is going Wednesday to meet with him. Want to feel worse? Guess who was the first foreign head of state to show up at the White House after we got attacked on 9/11? It was the French President. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
