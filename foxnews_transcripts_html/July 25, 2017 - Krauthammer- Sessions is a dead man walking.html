MARTHA MACCALLUM, "THE STORY" HOST: Breaking tonight, the president is about to take the stage at a make America great rally in Youngstown, Ohio. I'm Martha MacCallum. Good evening, everybody, this is "The Story." It is his fourth trip to Youngstown; he's at the Covelli Arena, which is a hockey arena. Holds about 7,000 people; the word is they got about 20,000 people who have requested tickets and it is filling up quickly, as you can tell. 
Kevin Corke is our man in Youngstown this evening. Ed Henry here in the studio with me, with all of the back scoops at the White House tonight. And Charles Krauthammer, standing by with his thoughts on the president's handling of the attorney general. So, all of that coming up moments away as we watch them file in, we have been hearing that they're on time. The president, you know, tends to run a little bit behind time on these things, but the crowd is filing in. Melania, his wife, the first lady is there with him as well. We saw Eric Trump and Lara Trump on the stage moments ago.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
White House Correspondent, Kevin Corke, joins us now. He's there on the scene in Ohio tonight waiting for the president to come out. Hey, Kevin! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we are; great to be with you. They're calling this the rally in the valley. I've been to Youngstown many times on a campaign trail, it never gets old. When you get out here and see what the people in the Midwest really feel and what they're talking about. And as we get into this packed arena once again -- in fact, let me have Bryan, I'll just show you -- show me what's happening around here. You can see the crowd is excited, very loud. And this is an interesting time for the president to be here, Martha. Keep this in mind, I guess, if you can look at it one way, you're saying, look, let's build up the momentum, let's build on the energy in West Virginia.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On the other hand, you might say to yourself, well, he's coming here amidst the turmoil, especially given everything that's happening back home in Washington. But no matter how you shape it, no matter how you look at it, the crowd here is obviously very interested, and excited to see the First Lady and the president come here tonight. He's been here before. They said earlier -- you even heard Lara said, they'll be back here, and they feel like this really is a true test of the American electorate. We'll bring you the coverage as he steps to the podium, but for now, back to you. 
MACCALLUM: Kev, no doubt. The president loves a good rally and Ohio was good to him over the course of the election 2016, something he likes to hearken back to, especially during some difficult time, as Kevin Corke points out back in Washington. It was really an extraordinary day on Capitol Hill as the Senate did it over the threshold to begin the debate now in the process of repealing, and perhaps, replacing, if those bills go together, ObamaCare.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And they did so, following a speech by Senator John McCain, who was back today from his surges of very dramatic and emotional moment. As Senator John McCain walked in, a large scar over his left eye, and he spoke eloquently, as he often does. He took the time to upbraid the Senate for their divisiveness, their lack of serious deliberation. He also embraced the mission of what he sees as the great legislative body, the deliberative body, as it's often referred to. He reminded his fellow Senators that they share equal power with the executive branch. 
All of that as the president continues to put pressure on his attorney general, a former member of that chamber, putting him essentially in a box. 
 He's under pressure in terms of the questions the president has about the deep state and the leaks. He would like to see that pursuit with more vigor from his attorney general. He also has mentioned reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's actions, the secretary of state. These are all things that the president feels are important and he would like to see more focus on them from his attorney general. So, this was the president, just a short time ago, in the rose garden. Watch this.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am disappointed in the attorney general. He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office. And if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, pick somebody else. So, I think that's a bad thing, not for the president, but for the presidency. I think it's unfair to the presidency, and that is the way I feel.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: So, chief national correspondent Ed Henry, live with me in New York tonight to take us through the latest on this fascinating to watch discourse of comments. And we know that president Trump does not say these things lightly. He says them deliberately. He has a strategy. He's trying to provoke an outcome here.

        }
      
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He is. And Sarah Huckabee Sanders, when I talked with her this morning on "Fox & Friends," said this is a president who doesn't send mixed signals. Meaning, he is sending a signal to his attorney general, but conservatives are pushing back. We saw Newt Gingrich kick this off on your show last night when he told you loyalty is a two-way street, and President Trump should appreciate Jeff Sessions carrying his agenda on big issues like illegal immigration. This defense of Sessions got more intriguing today. 
At a time when Steve Bannon is again said to be on the outs at the White House, the conservative news outlet he once ran took sides against the president. Breitbart went after the president by declaring, "Trump's attack on Sessions over Clinton prosecution highlights his own weak stance." Meaning, the president is now slamming Sessions for not going after Bill and Hillary Clinton, even though during the transition, President-elect Trump said he did not want to hurt the couple. 
Another key conservative news site drags report blared, "Sessions in dog; Republicans on brink of civil war." Maybe that's a stretch, but after early morning tweets by the president, it a got interesting. He goaded Sessions by writing: "Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign -- 'quietly working to boost Clinton.' So, where is the investigation attorney general?" He tagged, by the way, our own Sean Hannity, the president.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The president added, "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are e-mails and DNC server) and Intel leakers!" New Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as I mentioned, jacked it up. When I asked her about whether the president wants Sessions to go, she declared the president's frustration and disappointment are not going away, and the president himself did nothing to close the door in a potential finer. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

TRUMP: I want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before. I told you before, I'm very disappointed with the attorney general, but we'll see what happen. Time will tell. Time will tell. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HENRY: Time will tell there, but no waiting on Anthony Scaramucci's efforts to take out people close to Sean Spicer in the White House communications shop. Michael Short, a former RNC official like Spicer, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, resigned today. Meanwhile, some intrigue at the State Department tonight, Martha. We'd heard the speculation, we talked about it last night -- will Rex Tillerson step down or not? There have been stories suggesting, maybe he'll be gone by the end of the year. That he wants to walk away. He's frustrated.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
State Department, last night, told us, no way, this is not true. Well, now we heard over from the State Department, says tonight the secretary has taken a couple of days off, which seems odd, but they're insisting he is working at home in Texas. But this is a busy time, obviously, all around the world. Very rare, Martha, to see the secretary of state just takes a couple days off. They say, he's still doing 20-hour work days, but doing it home from Texas. This is only going to get the speculation swirling a bit.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
MACCALLUM: Yes. You know you look at the people who the president got the most credit for in terms of filling this cabinet. I mean, even people who were detractors of the president said, you know, one of the really great things that he has done is assemble this really terrific team, and Rex Tillerson has gotten a lot of very positive reviews in terms of the way that he's approaching, dealing with other countries. He's clearly trying to drain the swamp at the State Department. It makes him a little unpopular there, and that maybe some of the heat that he's feeling. But he wants it to be more efficient. 
HENRY: And he's clashed with the White House about how much power he really has. I think Tillerson has been frustrated that Jared Kushner has such a big portfolio, that among other things he's in charge or many his piece. That's something, obviously, the secretary of state only wants to have.

MACCALLUM: Ed, thank you very much. Stick around. We're going to watch the president. As we said, the crowd is building in the arena there in Youngstown, Ohio, tonight. And I want to bring in Charles Krauthammer now and get his thoughts, syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor. Charles, good evening to you!

CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening.
MACCALLUM: You know, we thought it couldn't get any worse after the president went after Jeff Sessions, calling him his beleaguered A.G. Today, he outlined quite clearly that he wants him to be tougher on the deep states, wants him to go after Hillary Clinton, which during the transition period, the president said was something he didn't want to do. 
KRAUTHAMMER: Look, I think the bottom line is he wants him to resign.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRAUTHAMMER: On Friday, I said that Sessions was a wounded man walking. 
 Last night on "Special Report," I said he was a dangerously wounded man walking. Tonight, he's a dead man walking. There is no way that a president can humiliate a cabinet member, a strong supporter from the beginning, in the way that Trump has done, just piling it on and expect that this relationship is going to last. He'll either be fired or -- I mean, it could be that he's decided that he's going to dig in his heels and some kind of resistance who'll stay in office no matter what, but this cannot last. 
So, he's going to be gone. And I think it's really -- the danger to Trump is that Sessions represents sort of the policy side, the philosophical side, the conservative side of what Trump represented, and he held a lot of that coalition brought back to Trump. And by getting rid Sessions, he's alienating many conservatives, as you indicated before. There are some who are already complaining. And that could be dangerous for Trump because what sustains him is the power and the loyalty of his base.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: I think the president is about to come out. You know, let me squeeze in one more. There he is. There's the president. Charles, thank you. We are going to watch him as he comes out. I mean, you know, Charles, just keep this open for one second. You know, when you look at President Trump, it appears that he really wants to get rid of this Robert Mueller. And you know, sort of the chain of people that lead to Mueller, and he blames Sessions for stepping aside and provoking that in the first place, and certainly Comey as well. 
KRAUTHAMMER: If that's the grand strategy, this is about as clumsy a way and self-destructive a way of executing that strategy as is imaginable. And I think we will see that play out.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Do you think that Jeff Sessions, as you say, he can either dig in his heels or he can say, you know, uncle, I've had enough of being publicly humiliated on a daily basis, but we know he loves the job. He said I never dreamed that I would be in this position, you know, the kid growing up. This is an emotional thing for him, and you've got a lot of the president's closest confidantes really saying that this could be a big mistake for him.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRAUTHAMMER: It's a terrible mistake. And for Sessions, remember this, it isn't just that he loves the A.G. job; he lost the Senate seat. And at his age, really, his career is over. So, instead of ascending to the dream job that he thought he would get by throwing in his lot with Trump at a point where nobody was with Trump, and this is a disaster for him personally, which is why I think he'll dig in his heels. But in the end and it's not going to take that long -- in the end, you cannot sustain a position in the cabinet when the president is humiliating you daily. That's got to end in and around soon. 
MACCALLUM: Charles, thank you. Here's the First Lady, Melania Trump, introducing her husband. Let's listen in.

Everyone in this arena is united with their love, and we know that. Do we know that? Everyone, united by their love for this country and their loyalty to one another, their loyalty to its people. And we want people to come into our country who can love us and cherish us, and be proud of America, and the American flag. We believe that schools should teach our children to have pride in our history and respect for that great American flag. 
We all believe in the rule of law, and we support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you, thank you for being here. We celebrate our military and believe the American armed forces are the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world. And, by the way, they are getting a lot of greater, fast, a lot greater. You saw our budget; we're ordering billions and billions of dollars of new ships, and new planes, and equipment for our soldiers. We are building it up. There's rarely been a time where we have needed the protection of our incredible military more than right now, right here, and that is what we are going to do. We believe in freedom, self-government, and individual rights. We cherish and defend. Thank you. It looks like it's in very good shape, our second amendment. Congratulations!

TRUMP: You remember when I was in Youngstown, I said, we will either renegotiate NAFTA or will terminate it. So let's see what happens. But we're right now negotiating with the heads of Mexico -- good men, the president, and the prime minister of Canada. Good man. Let's see what happens. But we will no longer be the foolish people. We will no longer be the stupid people that get taken care of so badly by our politicians because they don't know what they're doing. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We will always work with our friends and partners, but we will never again sacrifice Ohio jobs or jobs from any state in our union to enrich other countries, which has been what is happening to this country.

TRUMP: And, by the way, while we're on it, the Iran deal, which may be the single worst deal I have ever seen drawn by anybody. If that deal doesn't conform to what it's supposed to conform to, there is going to be big, big problems for them, that I can tell you. You're going to see that. Believe me. You would have thought when that deal was made by Secretary Kerry -- may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen. You would have thought that Iran would have said, thank you, United States. We can't believe you gave us between a $100 and $150 billion when they were ready to fail. We can't believe you gave us $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that looks like? You would have thought they would have said, thank you, United States. We really love you very much. Instead, they've become emboldened. That won't take place much longer. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: The great president from the state of Ohio, William McKinley, and you know, William McKinley? Does anybody know who the hell he is, huh? You know who he is? William McKinley understood that when America protects our workers and industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. We don't protect our people. We don't protect. Trade comes in. Goods come in. I was with Harley-Davidson, a great company from Wisconsin. Who has a Harley-Davidson? They came to the White House, and they said to me, yeah, it's tough going outside of the United States. We're doing great in the United States. But when we sell a motorcycle to certain countries, we have as much as a 100 percent tax to pay. And I said, tell me, when they sell back to us, meaning reciprocal, so when they sell back to us, what tax do we charge them? The answer is zero.
(CROWD BOOING)
TRUMP: Those days are going to be over very soon. 
(APPLAUSE) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
TRUMP: Unfortunately, like everything else, there're so many restrictions on doing what's right for our country. There's so much red tape. But don't worry, we're getting through it. The red tape -- you'd think if we could just do it. Wouldn't you think you could say, hey, you charge us a 100 percent, we're going to charge you 100 percent, then you'll either get the money or you'll vote drop it, right? We can't do that. We've got to go back to congress. Who, other than health care, today, has made some very bad deals, OK. So we're going to start enriching our country, we're going to start bringing back our jobs, and we will be fools no longer, folks. We'll be fools no longer. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Every single president on Mount Rushmore -- now, here's what I do. I'd ask whether or not you think I will someday be on Mount Rushmore, but -- no. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: But here's the problem. If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, he believes he should be on Mount Rushmore. So I won't say it, OK? I won't. But every president -- they'll say it anyway, you watch tomorrow. Trump thinks he should be on Mount Rushmore, isn't that terrible? What a group. What a dishonest group of people, I'll tell you. And you know the funny thing is that you would think they'd want to see our country be great again. You would really think so. But they don't. Someday they'll explain it to me why. Every president on Mount Rushmore believed in protecting American industry. We have to protect our industry. And now we're going to start. We are reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation again. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots -- I don't know if you like New England, but they have a hell of a team. That's OK. But he came to the oval office and he brought a sheet with him that just came out. Manufacturing enthusiasm in the United States is at an all-time high. Isn't that great? To me that sounds great.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Because we're going to bring back our jobs, bring back our wealth, and we are going to bring back our dreams. And we are going to bring back, once again, our sovereignty as a nation. 
(APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING USA)
TRUMP: Since I took office, we have cut illegal immigration on our southern border by record numbers, 78 percent. 
(APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING BUILD THAT WALL)
TRUMP: Record, record numbers. And in fact, the ICE folks -- I'll tell you what, and the border patrol police, they are phenomenal people. They're working with General Kelly. And just so you understand, we've already started fixing much of the good ball that's already there. We've already started fixing it. But, we are breaking records. And it was actually told to me the other day by somebody in Mexico that's very high up, said it's incredible, because their southern border is getting very little traffic. Nobody is coming anymore because they know they can't get through our southern border, so they don't even come. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Never again will America's surrender the security of our people, the safety of our communities, or the sovereignty of our nations. We are cracking down hard on the foreign criminal gangs that have brought illegal drugs, violence, horrible bloodshed, to peaceful neighborhoods all across our country. We are throwing MS-13 the hell out of here so fast. 
(APPLAUSE)
Tump: you know we're actually -- hard to believe that we're talking about our great country. We are actually liberating towns and cities. We are liberating people who are screaming from their windows, thank you, thank you, to the border patrol and to General Kelly's great people that come in and grab these thugs and throw them the hell out. We're liberating our towns and we are liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that? 
(CROWD CHANTING THROW THEM OUT)
TRUMP: Earlier this year, immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid on transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the bloodthirsty criminal gangs and, well, I will just tell you this, we're not doing it in a politically correct fashion. We're doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guys. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: I asked one of our great generals, how tough are our people? How tough are they? He said, sir, you don't want to know about it. Then I saw one guy come out, a customs officer, he's a monster. And I said, so, general, you think I could take that guy in a fight? He says, Mr. President, sir, I don't even want to think about it. And I said, you're right, actually. We have tough people. Our people are tougher than their people. Our people are tougher and stronger and meaner and smarter than the gangs. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: One by one, we're finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals, and killers, and we're sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in, believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and pray on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful innocent young people, will find no safe haven anywhere in our country. And you've seen the stories about some of these animals. They don't want to use guns because it's too fast and it's not painful enough. So they'll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others, and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. And these are the animals that we've been protecting for so long. Well, they're not being protected any longer, folks. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And that is why the administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: American cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, for people that look up to the law, for people that respect the law, not for criminals and gang members that we want the hell out of our country. Sanctuary cities legislation has passed the house, along with Kate's law, named for Kate Steinle, who was brutally killed by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant. We are asking the senate to vote on sanctuary cities and Kate's law legislation. We've got to get it passed. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: The Trump administration has the backs of our ICE officers, our border patrol agents, and, yes, our great police officers, and we have their back 100 percent. We're going to also protect them like they protect us. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: This month in Chicago, there have been more than two homicide victims per day. What the hell is going on in Chicago? Better tell that mayor to get tough, because it's not working what they're doing. We are going to get criminals off our streets, and we are going to make America safe again. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We also strongly believe that our borders must always be closed to terrorism and extremism. We don't want radical Islamic terrorists in our country. 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We've seen the total devastation in Europe, and we've seen the murderous attacks from New York to Boston to San Bernardino, exactly one year ago, next month, I came right here to Youngstown to deliver a major address on how my administration would protect our country from terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, who love our people, and who always will love our people. We don't want people coming into our country who have bad intentions even before they start.
