SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to "Hannity."
We begin tonight with Fox News alert. Breaking just moments ago, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins has released eight closed-door hearing transcripts from his committee's investigations into the FBI and Obama's DOJ. We now, here it comes, this is what I've been telling you, cascading down the avalanche. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have scores of new transcripts from Loretta Lynch. Either she or Comey are lying. Andrew McCabe, James Rybicki, and many other high-ranking officials. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Based on these newly released documents, we can now confirm one major piece of information. Former attorney general under Barack Obama, that's right, Lynch, threw James Comey right under the boss and told Congress she never asked the embattled FBI director to refer to the Clinton criminal investigation as "a matter." Comey said just the opposite. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One of them is lying. Who lied to Congress? Who committed the crime under oath? It would be a serious violation. Oh, yes, it was important on the Trump site.
Now, let's see the mainstream hate-Trump media mob do their job on this side, where Comey through this information, each line of every transcript, we will have full analysis. Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, Matt Gaetz and so much more. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also breaking tonight, the president, he just wrapped up a raucous rally in Pennsylvania, drawing away bigger crowd than any of his Democratic challengers, including sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe. Now, coming up, we're going to show you all the highlights from tonight's speech.
But, first, we have more than breaking news out of the deep state. We're going to go slow tonight. We'll make sure we get it all in. I want to set the stage. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tonight is just the beginning of what is coming every day, week, month ahead, and there's a town of it, an avalanche of new information, new documents. They will all reveal a shocking level of corruption, bias, lawlessness at the highest levels of the deep state. It's all about to be revealed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At this hour, your federal government is in possession of transcripts from 2016 featuring secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and one-time Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. According to those who have seen these transcripts, its contents are chock-full of clear irrefutable, incontrovertible, exculpatory evidence proving Trump-Russia collusion was always a hoax from the get-go.
Now, this includes former Congressman Trey Gowdy who is now calling these documents, quote, "game changing." Let's take a look.

TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: If the bureau is going to send an informant, and the informant is going to be wired. If the bureau's monitoring telephone calls, there's going to be a transcript of that. And some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether those transcripts exist but they haven't been made public and I think one in particular is going -- it has the potential to actually persuade people. Very little on the structure probe I'm afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or who love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that I think has the potential to be a game-changer if it's ever made public.

HANNITY: This material must be made available. Oh, where is Jerry Nadler?  Where is, oh, mister -- oh, Adam Schiff, the biggest liar in Congress, the cowardly Schiff, because if Comey, Strzok, other high level officials, the highest level, not rank-and-file. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We always make a distinction. I have an FBI pin and a CIA pin on tonight.  The 99 percent that protect us every day. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But those in the FBI and the CIA at the upper echelon, the intel community, they are withholding exculpatory evidence, let me tell you, this is bigger than we ever thought. It means the level of premeditated fraud, conspiracy against the FISA court. That means there was a real attempt to steal a presidential election with Russian lies paid for by Hillary and an effort to unseat when they lost a duly elected president of you, the people. Much worse than we ever knew.
Now, keep in mind, Papadopoulos, he was just one of several Trump campaign members who in fact were being surveilled by Comey's FBI. And this transcript is just one of several pockets -- we've told you there's five -- of information that will soon be revealed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We are also expecting the declassified FISA application against Carter Page. That should reveal how Comey and others totally, completely relied on the phony Clinton bought and paid for Russian disinformation dossier that was passed off as verified material and we now know they were warned repeatedly that it was not.
This weekend, former Congressman Gowdy had this to say about the deep states love affair with Christopher Steele's unverifiable, why? Because he doesn't stand by it -- dirty dossier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Take a look. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');

GOWDY: We can call it a dossier. It sounds official. It's really something the "National Enquirer" would blush if they printed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, we know it was used four times by the United States government. What we are trying to figure out is whether or not it was you to fifth in the intelligence assessment. And you got Brennan, Clapper, and Comey, all three who know full well whether or not it was used in the intelligence assessment, but they are giving you different -- they're giving you different versions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HANNITY: Now, soon, if justice is served, we will all have access to the very same material that Trey Gowdy reviewed as a sitting member of Congress. And tonight, good news, according to the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, of North Carolina. He is talking about document releases that are just around the corner, as we've been telling you.
Let's take a look.

REP. MARK MEADOW, R-N.C.: I think the delays are over. I think the president is serious. I have spoken to him recently and I think declassification is right around the corner, and hopefully, the American people will be able to judge it themselves.

HANNITY: Now, while we look forward to the release of the FISA applications, the Papadopoulos transcript. One former FBI agent with the help of Judicial Watch is now requesting a trove of documents related to Andrew McCabe, Operation Midyear Exam. That's the one against Hillary. Of course, for the server and the intent was to destroy the subpoenaed emails, 33,000 of them.
And as you know, McCabe was Comey second in command of the FBI until he was fired. And now, there is a criminal referral for, quote, "repeated lying."  And according to a brand-new report out from Sara Carter this evening, a retired FBI agent issued a FOIA request for emails related to McCabe's wife and the Clintons. Remember the case? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Joe McCabe had deep ties to Clinton. Watch the 2015 state Senate campaign at the behest of the Virginia governor, Clinton hack Terry McAuliffe. And McCabe's campaign even accepted, get this, nearly half a million dollars from McAuliffe's political action committee and another 292,000 from a second Democratic PAC. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, let me just put this in perspective. That is an obscene, unprecedented amount of money for a little state Senate campaign. And, frankly, an obscene amount of money for any such race.
Now, clearly, this does represent yet another conflict of interest at the highest levels of the FBI which clearly had their favorite candidate in 2016 and we all know it was not Donald Trump. That's why there was an exoneration before an investigation. That's why it's irrefutable, incontrovertible evidence. You broke the law, violated the Espionage Act and had the intent of destroying the evidence when she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, Bleached Bit the hard drive, had an aide bust up the devices and yanked out the SIM cards.
But the chosen one, Hillary Clinton, she was given that free pass after she did all of this. Yes, there was classified, top-secret material. Then, of course, the obstruction, everything that I now told you. A free pass for obvious crimes while the president of the United States is forced to endure a nearly three year witch hunt based entirely on a hoax that they knew of from the get-go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I want to get back to my monologue in just a minute, but first, joining us now with more on McCabe's conflicts of interest, FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You have been working on the story for quite some time. And it is about to be released.
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. So, former supervisory special agent Jeffrey Danik has been fighting for over two years, Sean, with judicial watch to get the text messages of former and fired Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Apparently, it is a treasure trove. It's not only going to answer questions regarding his wife and those issues. But apparently, there's a lot more information contained in these text messages and emails that the FBI does not want release. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the Department of Justice has been fighting Judicial Watch on this in the courts and Judicial Watch filed a motion last week against the DOJ to release the documents. Judicial Watch is expecting the DOJ to turn those documents over. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as you stated earlier, Sean, there is now the official transcripts right here that have been released by Representative Collins. We are scouring through them, just as you are. I think some of the most interesting things that I've discovered relate to Trisha Anderson. Now, she was an FBI national security lawyer, and she was working directly with James Baker as well as Lisa Page.
And in her transcripts in the back and forth with the questioners, she talks about Bruce Ohr and the 302s. She talks about the fact that she basically signed off on the first FISA warrant on Carter Page. And as you stated earlier, Carter Page right now, there are transcripts expected to be released of his conversations as well with Stefan Halper, very similar to George Papadopoulos, who was being probed by Stefan Halper who was a former British professor who was gathering information for the FBI and spying on the Trump campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The most interesting fact I think, and I will leave you with this, Sean, is that Tricia Anderson basically tries to downplay Bruce Ohr's involvement when they question about being the back channel for Christopher Steele after the FBI fired him. And they question her over and over again if the FBI actually had enough evidence, enough evidence to go after a FISA with what they found in the dossier. And Trisha Anderson refuses to answer on multiple occasions.
So, it's going to be very interesting to see what comes out next. It's going to be very interesting to see what the Department of Justice, William Barr, Attorney General William Barr, will have as far as information on, you know, on the investigation and how it coincides with these transcripts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think people have a lot of answering to do.

HANNITY: A lot of spying. He forgot the "Bond" movie blonde bombshell with Papadopoulos. Sam Clovis, Papadopoulos, Carter Page, FISA warrant. A lot -- oh, James Comey says that wasn't spying. And he, of course, signed off on the first FISA application in October 2016, verifying it's true and accurate but told from later know, it's unverified.
CARTER: Yes.
HANNITY: And now, Loretta Lynch contradicting her testimony in your breaking news.

Sara, great job. Thank you.
CARTER: Thank you.
HANNITY: Also breaking tonight, we did learn that the Mueller investigators, they were given permission by the British government to interview the dirty dossier's author, Christopher Steele. Yes, that Christopher Steele, the guy who does not stand behind his own dossier. The Christopher Steele in an interrogatory under the threat of perjury says, I don't know if any of this is true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The same Steele that was fired by the FBI for lying and leaking, the same Steele who was back-channeling we know now information to Mueller's investigators after being fired through Bruce Ohr. And, of course, did you get this to the special counsel? Why would you trust a liar and leaker? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as you know, Mueller concluded the Trump campaign did not collude in any way with the Russian government. Four separate investigations. So, we can now deduce that Steele's so-called intel, he doesn't stand by it. He thinks it's B.S., and it always was. It was James Comey, his high-ranking deputies, that swore that the contents were true and accurate and the word verified appears at the very top of the FISA request application.
That was in to Carter Page to get into all things Trump campaign, all things Trump transition and all things Trump as president. This is why I've been calling it the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in our history. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just to recap: the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, yes, criminal investigation, referral, fired for lying. Lead investigator, Strzok, Page, fired, political bias, or Strzok was. And Lisa Page, resigning. General Counsel Baker resigning, reportedly facing a criminal investigation himself for leaking. Comey's chief of staff, James Rybicki, also leaving.
Twenty-five in total between the State Department and FBI fired, leaving in disgrace or demoted. Bruce Ohr was once the fourth highest ranking member at the DOJ. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's not forget James Comey himself was fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation. That is Comey's legacy -- turmoil, bias, corruption at the highest levels of what is, right there, FBI pin, the single greatest law enforcement agency in the entire world, tainting the 99 percent of people that risked their lives for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if you listen to Mr. Comey, who thinks he's smarter than us, smelly Walmart people, he thinks he's a super patriot, he knew better than the American people. Oh, he could do no wrong whatsoever. Everyone else is bad. Everyone else is evil. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, naturally, Comey all too happy to parrot Democratic talking points about Attorney General Barr, writing on Twitter: the A.G. should stop sliming his own department. If there are bad facts, show us. Or search for them professionally and tell us we found. An AG must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth.  Donald Trump has enough spokespeople.
Jim, I suggest a mirror to self. Take a look. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
According to "The Wall Street Journal," Barr is fighting back and reminding Comey he is fighting for the presidency, which is his rightful duty in the executive branch. And perhaps Comey could use a refresher course on how checks and balances work.
But really, James Comey? Search for them professionally? You are the same James Comey that allowed Loretta Lynch to dictate, according to your testimony, the terms of the investigation into Hillary Clinton when you made no real attempt to verify that phony Clinton often paid for dossier.  As a matter of fact, you knew ahead of time, it was -- you were told by Bruce Ohr ahead of time.
You knew from the State Department ten days earlier and you still did it.  Using that as the basis, unverified Russian dossier paid for by Clinton.  Of course you didn't tell the court Clinton bought and paid for this garbage. A FISA warrant used to spy on the member of the Trump campaign so you could spy on the whole campaign.
Although you don't call signing a FISA application spying, it is by definition spying. Because now you are bugging every single aspect of Carter Page and getting a sneak peek into all things the world Trump. Or when you leak confidential notes on private conversations, you had with the president, to spur a special counsel investigation. Yes, it's that professionally the search for truth and justice at the FBI, Jimbo? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jim Comey knows he's in deep trouble tonight. The problem with Comey's I gave him this morning along time ago before that dopey bulk of his came out. You should get off Twitter, stop writing dumb books, stay away from fake new CNN and you do have the right to remain silent. I keep suggesting you use it because the truth is going to be revealed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And moments ago, during a massive rally in Pennsylvania, the president, he had this to say about the disgusting deep state corruption that took place under Jim Comey's watch, under the Biden-Obama administration. The whole thing was under their watch.
Let's take a look.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This phony witch hunt that we all went through together is a disgrace.
(BOOS) Now they are all blaming each other. Did you see? They are all turning on each other. Isn't that pretty to watch?
It's his fault. No, it's his fault. No, we caught them. They were spying. They were spying on our campaign.
I tell you what. If that ever happened to the other side, this thing would've been over two years ago. And, you know, it would've been treason.  They would've called it treason. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HANNITY: Joining us now, author of the number one bestseller, "The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump", Gregg Jarrett, and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz.
All right, Matt, I want to go to you first. Simple question. It's not that hard. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What exactly do you know is happening and coming out? Meadows, Trey Gowdy, what do we have?
REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: I believe we are days if not weeks always for the most compelling evidence and the biggest political scandal in American history.
HANNITY viewers have known from the beginning that it was the dossier funded by Democrats that really fueled this investigation. But Comey and Brennan and Clapper, they didn't defend the dossier because it was written by a known liar as you pointed out in your monologue. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, instead, they pivoted and said, they had all these legitimate concerns about George Papadopoulos. Here's what we're going to learn. Yes, we had heard from an unverified foreign source that Papadopoulos might've been talking to Russians. So, there was Western intelligence sent to spy on Papadopoulos and there's actually a recording and a transcript of that conversation.
And there, Papadopoulos denies any illegal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. So, they had evidence presumably that was against Papadopoulos and for him. What they will ever be able to defend is that they never presented that evidence to the FISA court.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: So, on top of everything we know, that they were warned. They were warned by Bruce Ohr, August 2016. They were warned by this woman, Ms. Kavalec, at the State Department, 10 days prior to the signing of the first FISA application. Now, we know on this whole new level, you're describing, though they are withholding exculpatory information from the FISA court to spy on an opposition party campaign?
GAETZ: Absolutely. This is what Attorney General Barr means when he talks about them putting their thumb on the scale. The government has no obligation before a secret court with no defense attorney to present all of the exculpatory evidence that they are provided, all of the exculpatory evidence.
Here, they only presented evidence that would cast people associated with the Trump campaign in a bad light without their multiple professions of innocence. Now, Comey and Clapper and Brennan are all going to say, well, Papadopoulos might've known he was being surveilled when he said none of this stuff was actually happening. But there is still no excuse for why they didn't go before court and I'm sure Gregg Jarrett can explain all of the laws and rules that they broke and what -- 
(CROSSTALK) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You know, by the way, I have a friend of mine in the studio and that's what I was talking to.
Go ahead.
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Congressman Gaetz is absolutely correct. There is an extra duty that the FBI, James Comey, and Sally Yates at the DOJ had when they presented their warrant application to spy on somebody. If they have exculpatory evidence, they have to provide that.  Not only that, as you pointed out, all the information has to be verified.
If they discover later on that it's not verified or they were wrong, they have to immediately notify the court that we got it wrong. We must now reconsider. They didn't do any of that. That's a fraud on the court and five other felonies.
HANNITY: It's a deeper -- it's a premeditated --
JARRETT: Sure.
HANNITY: -- fraud. It is lying by omission, not highlighting who paid for it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: It's not verified. They were warned twice, maybe three times.  They withheld exculpatory evidence.
This is the highest level to, one, impact an election and the outcome, also the person they saved from clear indictment. Number two, this is an opportunity that they used it to try and take down a duly elected president.
JARRETT: It is ranked corruption. It is using your law enforcement office to target somebody for political reasons, and lying to a court in the process.
It's abuse of power. It's perjury. It's a false statement. It's obstruction of justice. It's all of those things.
HANNITY: How did so many people pull this off? Let me throw it to Matt.
JARRETT: Well, it's easy to invent a lie. It's even easier to spread a lie if there is nobody there to challenge it and this is an ex parte hearing in front of the FISA court. Nobody on the other side to look out for Carter Page. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HANNITY: And, Matt Gaetz, either Comey lied when he said, oh, she told me to call it a matter, or Loretta Lynch lied. One of them lied under oath.  Which one? Pick one?
GAETZ: You got multiple circumstances where Comey was lying and obviously this is why Comey is attacking our great Attorney General Bill Barr. Bill Barr is asking the right questions. We're going to get down to who committed these crimes and my suspicion --
HANNITY: I've got to run.
GAETZ: -- is that it roots back in the Obama White House.
HANNITY: And remember, he signed -- said it was verified in October, told Trump, oh, it's unverified but salacious, lied there one of those times.
JARRETT: I don't know how you get out of that hole.
HANNITY: As the mini monologue straight ahead, we'll address the radicalism of Mayor Pete, who's so love, and the rest of the 2020 Democrats. Much more, straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Time for our Hannity watch in 2020, yes, extreme radical socialist Democrats. It's now an all-out fight, who can be the most radical.
Just look at, yes, the people that the media loves -- Mayor Pete. Yes, Buttigieg, who finally came clean about his far left radical agenda for our future as Americans, this great republic of ours, especially on the idea of abortion.
Let's take a look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I guess the question is, do you believe in any point in pregnancy, whether it's six weeks or eight weeks or 24 weeks or whenever, that there should be any limit on a woman's right to have an abortion?
PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the dialogue has gotten so caught up on where you draw the line that we've gotten away from the fundamental question of who gets to draw the line. And I trust women to draw the line when it's their -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

(CHEERS)
And the bottom line is, as horrible as that choice is, that woman, that family may seek spiritual guidance. They may seek medical guidance. But that decision is not going to be made any better medically or morally because the government is dictating how the decision should be made.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: OK. If Democrats get their way, think about this -- it doesn't matter. This is not about abortion. This is about infanticide up until the moment of birth, it would be perfectly legal and readily available?
You know, Mayor Pete ramping up his attacks on the president. Remember what the Virginia governor said. First, we'll deliver the baby, make the baby comfortable and then the mother will decide. What? To not take care of the baby that's living and breathing alone?
Now, if we are a country with a heart and a soul, it's not about abortion.  This is about in this case, infanticide. Remember accusing Trump of launching a hostile takeover of the GOP really? Take a look.

        }
      
BUTTIGIEG: I do think there's a special value to a generational change at a moment like this. We are not just living through another election. I believe we are living through one of those transitions between moments in American history. As consequential as the one that brought us the New Deal or the dawn of the Reagan era which I would argue is a 40-year period that is only now come crashing to a halt with a hostile takeover of the Republican Party by the current president.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: So dumb. We have a record low on appointment, lowest jobless claims since 1969, 1.7 million jobs, more available than people on unemployment. Record wage growth, energy independence, the biggest tax cuts in history. The president is taking on the entire Washington swamp, even Republicans in the swamp.
But there he is, Mr. Good Old Mayor Pete, he talks about it like, what, it's a bad thing? Obama gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, the worse recovery since the ‘40s, took on more debt that all 43 presidents before him combined, is that the agenda you want to bring us back to?
And, by the way, Mr. Pete, what record do you have? Because there is a new report that shows you hardly ever the mayor of South Bend. Who is running the city while you're out raising money in L.A. and New York with all your rich friends that want you to be president? Supposedly.
And according to a South Bend community survey last year, your constituents, 65 percent of residents, they're dissatisfied with the maintenance of your city streets, your sidewalks, your infrastructure. And 51 percent of your residence, Mr. Pete, they don't agree that they have an overall feeling of safety in their neighborhoods. You are the mayor.
And the destroy-Trump media mob, they just continue to try and paint Mr. Buttigieg as some sort of unifier. It's clear he's just as radical and elitist as the rest of this extreme field.

Try to even out-liberal Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with tax hike, after-tax hike. Sure. What's going to happen then? Factories won't be built. Manufacturing centers won't be built. Take a look at this stupid proposal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BUTTIGIEG: We also got to be willing to say where the revenues going to come from. And that's why we really do need to entertain ideas like, I would say, a fairer, which means higher, marginal income tax rate on those earning the most; a reasonable wealth tax or something like that to make sure that people are giving back when they become enormously wealthy; perhaps a financial transactions tax that taxes these millisecond differences in computer trades that people become enormously wealthy of--
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: A wealth tax for people that already paid their taxes. In New York, California, that's like $0.65 of every dollar going to government. Then you want to come back, we're going to punish you because you save some money after we took most of it. And of course, when you die, you pay another 40 percent, and if you live in New York, it's 50.
Of course, no Democratic 2020 platform would be complete without bizarre conspiracy theories about Russia-Russia because two-and-a-half years later, they cannot accept the results of election night 2016. Let's listen to Robert Beto Francis O'Rourke fueling even more collusion conspiracies. They can't let it go. They lost. They can't take it. Poor things. Take a look.

JOY REID, POLITICAL ANALYST & HOST, AM JOY, MSNBC: Do you have confidence that the 2016 election was not impacted in terms of not just the use of propaganda on American voters but literally that the electoral systems weren't breached and that Donald Trump was elected fairly?
REP. BETO O'ROURKE, D- PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't have complete confidence in part because of what you just shared about Florida, in part because we know from other secretaries of state in other states in the union that their systems were breached. We don't know if vote tallies were changed, but that alone should be cause for concern.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: All right. Bozo bezo (ph), whatever you think. To be clear, there is no evidence any votes were altered by Russian hacking under Biden and Obama's watch during the 2016 election. It's complete hysteria. It's hysteria, it's fear-mongering, it's a hoax. And they've lied to you for two-and-a-half years.
Democrats and their partners in the media mob perpetuated nothing but lie after lie, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, pushing the hoax, all while totally ignoring real collusion right in front of their eyes. They don't care about collusion. They don't care about obstruction. Only if it's about Trump. Just like they don't care about, oh, the treatment of women, and I believe unless it's Justice Kavanaugh in his teenage years, but certainly not the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.
And these lies, disparagement, this disinformation campaign, they are only designed to further divide the country. Where are the solutions to help the forgotten men and women that got totally screwed under the Biden-Obama policies? They want to distract from the reality this President's agenda is record-breaking. It's working. They are trying to sow doubt into the electorate, pushing radical, economy-killing policies.
The Green New Deal? We're going to get rid of oil and gas in 10 years and the combustion engine, and cows and planes? And everything is free. Late- term abortion, reckless impeachment, talk daily - when do they serve their constituents? This Democratic Party, this radicalism, finds itself in a never-ending fight with simple truth and reality. It's beyond psychosis at this point.
This is a party with no more moderates, no more ideas, nothing they are proposing will make this country better off. It's being run by a new crop of new socialist media, socialists like Ocasio-Cortez who's the real speaker, and again, seems to be ramping up her feud with sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe Biden because over the weekend, she tweeted out support for long shot candidate Jay Inslee's climate plan just days ahead of Biden's plan, climate rollout. What's - just the latest shot at the Democratic front-runner.
And sadly, Ocasio-Cortez's smears of the GOP, they even grow more disturbing. She's gone off the deep end with this, tweeting out a sick vial (ph) message that quote, "GOP, they don't care about babies" - Really? - "at all, especially brown, black, or poor ones. If they did," - this is her logic - "they'd co-sponsor the Green New Deal."
Wow! How about we let the baby be born and how about we give a great comfort and keep it alive? Let's start there. It's not just every two years or four years anymore. This is gutter politics. Republicans are racists, sexists, misogynists, Islamophobic, xenophobic, homophobic, dirty air/water, kill granny and hate kids. Party of late-term abortion in a complete meltdown mode over protecting kids that can live on their own.
And when we come back, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Tammy Bruce are here with more. Later, another liberal city is in a major crisis with, yes, needles. It's a serious issue coming out, this time on a baseball field. Sad and it's sick, needs to be fixed. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
HANNITY: All right. Democrats, as I've said, they've become the party of late-term abortion. Liberal lawmakers, members of the media have become unhinged following a series of states passing restrictive abortion laws. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
REID: The Christian far-right, so confident, they are pushing through laws in multiple states under Republican control that essentially send women back to the dark ages, all in hopes of sending a case to the Republican majority supreme court that would overturn Roe v. Wade, essentially turning all of America into Gilead from the Handmaid's Tale.
O'ROURKE: I've worked with colleagues in Congress to make sure that we pass a law that prevents any future supreme court from overturning Roe versus Wade.
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW, ABC: Maybe we should make it a law that they should be all be required to get a vasectomy. That group in particular.
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: This is nothing short of an all-out assault on women's reproductive freedom, an effort to take away our basic human rights and civil rights.
They do not believe that women should have the right to make the most intimate, personal, life-and-death decisions.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: OK. That's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about viable fetuses that you're talking about aborting even during the birthing process or after the baby is alone and living independently.
Will somebody please tell these so-called journalists, lawmakers? Let's be very clear. And the Alabama suit was designed specifically to take on Roe v. Wade. Let's say Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court. That means abortion would not be abolished in America. The policy on abortion would merely be handed back to individual states. They will all decide on their own.
Meanwhile, the President was campaigning in Pennsylvania tonight. He blasted the Democrats for these radical policies. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, killing your second amendment, and radical socialism.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Here with reaction, Fox News Contributor Tammy Bruce and Rachel Campos-Duffy is with us. All right. Good to see you both.
TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT: Hey there.
HANNITY: I want to be clear about this, Tammy.
BRUCE: Yes.
HANNITY: Most people that I know that say that they are pro-choice, they are people that are talking about the first three months.
BRUCE: Right.
HANNITY: When they hear this - and I don't know, I'll be honest. I do make exceptions personally.
BRUCE: Of course.
HANNITY: Rape, incest--
BRUCE: Yes.
HANNITY: --mother's life. I think there are extenuating circumstances.
BRUCE: Of course.
HANNITY: And I don't agree with some of these laws that are passed.
BRUCE: Right.
HANNITY: Is New York, California, are they ever going to change their abortion laws?
BRUCE: No. And look, I think that it's not just the people you know that you've talked to. Marist came out with a poll after this revelation of infanticide in Virginia where even the super-majority of Democrats were OK with the limitations of Roe, which is the first trimester, that that is the understood dynamic where women can have the time to make the decision that it's something that would be appropriate because mistakes happen, accidents happen, birth-control fails. There is rape, et cetera. And we don't know every case. And that is up to a woman.
And ultimately also, if we want to change the abortion rate in this country, it's about the economics. Women don't think, oh, I can't wait to have an abortion. But it's about - and if it certainly is a surprise, that I can't afford this, I'm in school, I have a job, how am I going to do this, I have no family, if there was an economic framework where - and this is what I want - for every woman, if she is surprised by this, to be able to say, wait a minute, I can do this. That's what women want. And that's what we owe them.
Now, when it comes to Roe versus Wade, that's not going to be overturned. Would it be changed a little bit? Perhaps. I don't know.
HANNITY: By not overturned--
BRUCE: Yes.
HANNITY: --you don't think they'll be successful?
BRUCE: I don't - I don't think--
HANNITY: I know the lower courts will not support--
BRUCE: I don't think it will be, but ultimately - and I think my friend Rachel may disagree, and I know - and you're correct. It would only simply go back to the states. However, I would not - I don't think any of us want to see a woman be a criminal in one state and not another because then suddenly you have trafficking of women, women having to travel to other states to have a procedure done and then to go back. There has to be uniformity. But--
HANNITY: We just agree that viability on one's own--
Bruce: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: (inaudible).
BRUCE: Yes. I think most of us, as we've seen - again, the 80 percent of Americans, including Democrats, respect that limitation. And we want to have this not be an issue.
HANNITY: Rachel, I want to bring you in. Go ahead. Your thoughts.
RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I would just say if there was a courageous Democrat on the Presidential - running for President on the Democrat side, they would be in that space, first trimester and some exceptions, though I'm clearly to the right of that. But what the pro- aborts want is for this discussion to be discussed in the abstract that we're talking about women's rights and the Handmaid's Tale and--
HANNITY: Correct.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --all these emotional issues. And what they don't want to talk is about the procedure. And that's why they're so upset that this argument has moved to late-term abortion, to heartbeats, to viability, because when people actually think about the procedure--
HANNITY: Why are they bringing it up?
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --they become very pro-life.
HANNITY: Why would anybody ever say, first we'll deliver the baby, make the baby comfortable and let the mother decide? I'm like, what?
BRUCE: Yes. It's madness. And this is--
CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's where they're at.
BRUCE: They want to change the conversation. The fact is the hysteria that you hear, no, we're not going to turn into the Handmaid's Tale. This is the 21st century. We have enough power, but we also have the power to become better people and to be able to make better decisions in the 21st century--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You've put your whole career for women's rights, your entire career, and Rachel too.
BRUCE: Yes. I think we - we both of us have.
HANNITY: All right. Rachel, thank you.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: I will tell you that - thank you--
HANNITY: Yes.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: OK. I was going to give you a last thought, but we are running - they're screaming at me.
By the way, the friend of mine that I was talking to is the guy that hired me in 1992 in Atlanta, a dear friend, Sluggo Sydell (ph). And boy, he's - he never paid me at that time, but I - you know, he was nice to me. We've stayed friends ever since.
Up next, liberal cities, they are falling apart. The latest example, syringes on a little league ball field. You've got to be kidding me. Trace Gallagher, full report, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: A disturbing story to share with you tonight. It's out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. A little league field littered with discarded syringes. Fox News Correspondent Trace Gallagher joins us live from our West Coast newsroom with this disturbing story. Wow! That's chilling.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sean, it is. An 11-year-old girl was struck by a dirty hypodermic needle sliding into second base. Now she has to undergo testing for three months to see if she was infected by anything. The problem is so bad for this Albuquerque little league that before games and practices, dozens of coaches and parents walk the six baseball fields and pick up syringes and needles.
Last Wednesday, before a game, they found 18 syringes. The city's growing homeless problem appears to be the issue. Despite the gates being locked, the homeless reportedly break into the fields and take shelter under the stands and inside the dugouts and bathrooms.
New Mexico does have a needle exchange program that serves some 23,000 people, but as of last year, you no longer have to bring back the dirty needles to get the clean ones. The city provides unlimited clean needles to cut down on disease. And even though most people still exchange their dirty needles, there are thousands clearly being discarded wherever.
The City of Albuquerque is putting up more needle disposal boxes to try and help increase this cleanup effort. It's a big problem. Sean.
HANNITY: Scary. Thanks, Trace Gallagher.
Joining us now with reaction, nationally syndicated Salem Radio talk-show host, Larry Elder, and Fox News Contributor, you see her a lot now, Emily Compagno is with us. How are you? Good to see you in studio, and congrats on all your success. Let's--
EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.
HANNITY: Really, we have to have our kids sliding into needles? I'm like - and when we went to San Francisco - you said you grew up there - it's - they're all over the place.
COMPAGNO: It is. It's a plague on the West Coast, and it's not limited to New Mexico. So, for example, the Santa Monica residents persuaded their city council to have multiple hearings, with them saying, look, you have to do something about this. City council refused to put policemen in every park, saying, well, we don't want to live under an armed - or a guard essentially.
San Francisco did a survey. There are 100 syringes per block. And in Seattle, 70,000 people signed an initiative to ban safe injection sites, and it was overturned in the courts, with the public officials saying, well, public health is not for the citizens to overturn, which means who's governing?
HANNITY: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Is it not the citizens?
HANNITY: I've read, Larry, what 60-some-odd thousand homeless people where you live in LA. We went to Pelosi's district. Less than a mile from her house, less than a mile from our office, feces all over the streets. We interviewed the people. We showed the pictures. Needles everywhere. She is a multi - tens of millions of dollars she has. And she can't tell her rich friends, hey, I'll chip in a million, you chip in a million, we'll build the center, we'll get them counseling, a warm meal, a shower for the people that have to live this way. They're only generous with our money, I guess.
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST: Well, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about what she should do with her money because this is not going to be solved by government. This is a moral problem and a spiritual problem. And as far as needles and syringes in public parks are concerned, she's right. This is happening all over the place.
Here in California at a public park in Van Nuys in the valley, a buddy of mine was just there last weekend and saw syringes and needles, and not just in the bathroom, all over the place. It's not only a public safety and a public health problem, it's a liability problem. When and if some kid gets hurt, get stuck, contract some disease, the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for millions and millions of dollars.
HANNITY: It's a safety issue. Well, I mean, there's something so wrong about this. And I'm going to tell you what I predict is next. They're not going to want to build the - raise money and build shelters and offer counseling and meals and a shower. But they're going to say we need to legalize every drug in America. That'll be their next cry--
ELDER: Right.
HANNITY: --to the American people.
COMPAGNO: Right. Because the left moving policy is what's dominating the discussions in these cities, and so it's not being governed by a reasonable approach. In Seattle, for example, that city spends a billion dollars a year on the 12,000-plus homeless population, which means that's $100,000 per homeless recipient, and yet guess how much, for example, the Executive Director of the Low Income Housing Initiative makes. Almost $200,000 per year. So the people who are winning are that kind of the social services homeless structure and the people who are losing are the citizens.
HANNITY: That's a good point.
Larry, last 15 seconds, sir.
ELDER: And Sean, you heard the line, a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged. Well, voters in Denver, a liberal city, just voted that they were not going to make it legal for you to sleep and camp on the ground. Even they've had enough. So the pendulum is swinging back.
HANNITY: All right. Thank you both for being with us. Sad story. We got to stop this.
Coming up, you won't believe, oh, Robert De Niro, he's unhinged, our Villain of the Day, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
HANNITY: All Right. Villain of the Day, once again, Hollywood leftist, liberal, socialist, very angry man, Robert De Niro. Last night, at the American Icon Awards - they're always slapping each other on the back. Well, he made these vulgar comments yet again about the President.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: The individual who currently purports to lead America is not worthy of any tribute--
(APPLAUSE)
DE NIRO: --unless you think of this impeachment and imprisonment as a sort of tribute. And that's how you can make America great again.
(APPLAUSE)
DE NIRO: You didn't think you were completely going to get away without a (inaudible) Trump moment, did you?
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Being just a has-been actor, there's too much time on his hands.
All right. Well, you're pretty angry. All right. That's all the time we have this evening. We'll never be part of the destroy-Trump media mob ever. We're going to be fair and balanced. A lot coming soon.
Laura Ingraham, let not your heart be troubled. How are you?
