For two days in a row, the "The Washington Post" has run front page stories highlighting the new positive news about Obamacare. "Signups have reached 1.1 million" screams one headline; "Having guaranteed healthcare is the light at the end of the tunnel for many" screams another headline. Well, I expect we're going to see more of these types of pieces in the coming weeks and months as Democrats in the White House circle the wagons and attack the GOP on the Affordable Care Act.
This is why the GOP is taking a huge risk by counting on Obamacare as its only issue in 2014. Now, remember, a number of Republicans justified their support of that lame Ryan-Murray budget deal by arguing that it would help them focus on Obamacare in 2014 to kind of clear the deck. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well folks, it's not that simple. It's not that Obamacare will work, of course -- we know it's not going to work. But in the run-up to the midterms, many in the media are going to do everything in their power to make people think it's working. So conservative candidates should be prepared to make other points such as how they've held the line on spending or how they've stopped the Democrats from rolling back Second Amendment rights. How they stopped immigration amnesty from undercutting middle class wages. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Republicans should tout what they've actually accomplished even while in the minority in Congress. Look spending has declined over the past few years -- that's incredible. And not just because of the GOP forced sequester but also because Republicans have blocked the Democrats from spending even more money that we don't have on programs that don't work and are never going to work. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So the GOP's block and tackle didn't work on Obamacare and look where that got us. But the GOP communication teams must point out that Republicans have served a critical role by preventing liberals from doing even more damage to the middle class through more tax hikes and by accumulating more debt and ramming through other Obamacare-like programs that ultimately take power from the people.
And that's "The Memo."  </pre>
