JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to "Justice." I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being us tonight and thanks so much for making "Justice" number one again last weekend. I really appreciate it. and look who is hear? Lara Trump is live in our studio and will join me in a moment. And I'll also be speaking later with Congressman Duncan Hunter, Michelle Malkin, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and more. But first, my opening statement. 
The rise of socialism has never been more clear. Right now in America, there are forces dug in, organized and well funded, doing whatever is necessary to make socialism happen. Today's demonstrations are part of an ongoing step-by-step agenda to change our country at its very core. They demand the abolition of ICE -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the zero-tolerance policy of the Trump administration.

CYNTHIA NIXON, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I think we need to abolish ICE, that seems really clear. They have strayed so far from the interest of the American people and the interest of humanity.

PIRRO: Cynthia, are you stupid? I know as an actress you are used to saying what is on the script and this government thing is new to you, but strayed so far from the interests of the American people? The whole point of ICE is to protect the American people from illegals who would do us harm physically and financially. And listen to this one.

PIRRO: ICE isn't doing what it was created to do? ICE is doing exactly what it was created to do. Are you stupid, too? And the President is using it as his own police force? When ICE was doing its job in 2009 to 2016, was it Obama's police force? And you think ICE is making us less safe? I've got two word for you. Kate Steinle -- a primer. For all you geniuses out there. ICE does not separate children and parents at the border. Border Patrol does that. and if you abolish ICE, who will arrest the drug dealers and the coyotes coming across our border in droves delivering 80% of the narcotics and 90% of the heroin here? and pray tell, who deports the illegal who committed rape when he finishes his jail time? Should we just let bygones be bygones and throw down the welcome mat to the local YMCA, give him his food stamps and call it a day? You don't want them deported. Maybe they ought to come live with you. 
And Kirsten Gillibrand, a United States Senator who has ambition to run for President in 2020 says...

SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We should protect families that need our help and that is not what ICE is doing today and that's why I believe, you should get rid of it, start over, re-imagine it and build something that actually works. 
(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: Why is it that whenever a Democrat doesn't want to follow the law, they say it's broken. The immigration system is broken, ICE is broken. How about I say, the tax system is broken, and we don't then have to pay our taxes and we can go suck another capitalist country dry. That way none of us have to pay taxes. The truth, Americans want the immigration laws enforced, even 60% of the Democrats want that. Those laws protect jobs and the more people who come in especially the poor ones, the more taxes we pay for their education, medication, housing and social services.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And when we don't know who is coming in, we cannot screen for gangs and drug dealing operatives. Not to mention, none of this is fair to those immigrants who played by the rules. The narrative of today's protest is backwards. Those marching object to adults who cross the border being separated from their children. It happened even before Trump was President. No one cared, objected or protested. Trump issues an executive order to end the family separations, and yet they still march.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So what's going on? The overarching message is that illegals, people who do not respect our laws are entitled to everything that we Americans are. That they are being wronged by Americans if we don't share our wealth, our capitalist success and our way of life with them. This, my friends, is socialism. 
Like the women's march, these anti-Trump protesters are extremely well organized, and they are more than political. They are ideological. We are witnessing the evolution of a socialist coup. And if you don't believe what I am saying, take it from their own mouths.

PIRRO: Did you hear it? F your borders, F your walls, we will make your system fall. This week's primary win by a 28-year-old socialist Congressional candidate who took down a well funded long-term New York congressman is about more than one district, and although Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deserves credit for working hard, she won the assistance of the Democratic socialists of America, and don't forget, a little known socialist from Vermont would have been the Democratic candidate for President in 2016, but for the Hillary Clinton corruption of the Democratic National Committee, and make no mistake, folks, socialists are beginning to win elections at the state and national level, defeating even long-term incumbents. 
And expect more hard left Democratic candidates to run. Even Obama's cradle to grave fictional ad called "The Life of Julia" suggests an anti- capitalist socialist framework. And for those of you who need reminding, socialism doesn't work.

The crushing poverty and violence in Venezuela is just the latest example. According to the "Wall Street Journal," people go through garbage bags full of rubbish to take whatever they can and then try to sell the empty bags. Socialism when private property in the distribution of income is subject to state control hasn't worked out very well in Sweden either. National healthcare, far from what they promised, pregnant mothers are turned away from maternity wards because of overcrowding causing women to give birth on the streets.

Socialists have or want what you have. I for one work hard, pay taxes, believe in capitalism and have no plans to move to Venezuela or Sweden. One of my heroes, Margaret Thatcher put it best when she said, "The trouble with socialism is that eventually, you run out of other people's money." And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram #judgejeanine. 
And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and much more is President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. All right, good evening, Laura, welcome to "Justice." Thanks for being in the studio tonight. 
LARA TRUMP, DAUGHTER IN LAW OF DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Absolutely.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: All right, so what do you think of these well organized demonstrations that in spite of the fact that the President issued an executive order saying, "You know, we're going to stop the separation of children from parents." They're still marching.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: Yes, well, I mean, you said it best. Listen, this has been happening for a long time. What we see is that Donald Trump is the law and order President. He wants to enforce the laws that by the way have been there for many, many years, and to see what is happening out there is really scary, and I hope people are paying close attention because what people should understand is that if they are voting for someone who wants to abolish ICE, these people are putting illegal immigrants, drug dealers, gangs, ahead of American citizens. They are saying that they are more important than you, than me, than everyone in this country. It's very, very scary stuff. 
PIRRO: But you know, Lara, I mean, does it worry you when we see that this young woman, and to her credit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she won. She is clearly -- she calls herself a socialist. She believes in the socialist agenda. I mean, we just had Bernie Sanders almost have a Democratic nomination. I mean, there is this organized effort. Do you ever think about it?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: Well, I think about it all the time. It's very scary. In fact, one of the things that I want to make very clear to people is that if this scares you, you have to get out in the midterms and you have to make sure that you are voting for the right candidates. Republicans who are going to support the President, otherwise this is what we are going to see happen. And make no mistake about it, the Democrats are grasping for anything they can. They are desperate right now and if they think this is the way out, I hope that the American people have a resounding effect in November whenever they say we do not want this to become our country. 
PIRRO: You know, I was just reading an article that said that millennials today have like 34% less income than the last generation did. They don't have the homeownership, nowhere near it. And yet if millennials latch on to this concept of we want money, we want free this, free education, free everything, that they could be a powerful voting bloc.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: They could. It's so funny because it sounds so good in theory, why wouldn't we just take other people's money. But you just said it. What happens when you run out of that money? And I think what happens generally is, people have these ideas that socialism could possibly work. First of all, when has it ever worked? It's never worked anywhere. And then they get out and they start getting jobs and they start paying taxes and they realize why it doesn't work.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so, hopefully all of these millennials will benefit from the very low unemployment numbers that we now have under this President, go out, get a job and realize that this doesn't work. 
PIRRO: Okay, I want to switch gears a little bit, okay, you are a new mother, how old is baby Luke. 
TRUMP: Luke is nine months old, and as big as he can be.

PIRRO: I know, I follow you on Instagram. He's adorable. You know, this week we have seen a lot of pushback against women, Republican conservative women by the left. Maxine Waters flipping her lid literally saying go after them. Sarah Sanders being forced out of a restaurant and on and on, Pam Bondi who is going to be on in a little bit. I mean, do you worry about that, Lara?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: You know, I hope that people would have a little more sense than to listen to somebody who sounds as crazy as Maxine Waters. I tend to think that if we can be civil to one another, that's all you can ask for. Let's all be friendly, but yes, I mean, it should worry everyone out there, that you have someone who is an elected official calling for harassment of people that supporting our President, who, don't forget, half the country voted into office. 
It's really scary stuff, and you know, women, men -- everybody should be very concerned with this. And again, that's all the more reason the midterms are so, so important. You've got to get rid of these kind of people.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

PIRRO: Well, when they were protesting the Department Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen outside of her home. I mean, there is nothing more private and frightening than somebody coming to your home. I mean, there's no gate around it. I mean -- and they go right up to them and who was the one who said, go right up to them and make sure that they hear you and Pam Bondi talks about them in her face, literally, she said, screaming at her, men, an inch from her face. It's scary stuff. I've never seen anything like this.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: Yes, well, but what we are seeing, Judge, is that I really do think people are getting desperate when it comes to the Democratic Party because they realize that this President is winning for the United States of America again, and it makes them very, very nervous. Because remember, first of all, they never thought Donald Trump was going to get elected. Now that he's in and he's doing such a great job for this country, what are they running on? What are their talking points? So, instead, they are saying go out and harass people who support the President. It's crazy. 
PIRRO: You know what's amazing to me, when I first heard the statistics, and you know, your father-in-law, I mean, I've been friends with more many, many years. But when I heard there were more jobs than people to fill them. I had to repeat that in my head and say, I can't -- I mean, it's fantastic. It really is. He's a businessman. He came at just the right time.

But finally, let me ask you this. You expect -- I mean, I expect, we all expect that the Supreme Court nomination that he's going to announce his nominee a week from Monday is going to be a bitter fight. But 2018 midterms historically, the President in his first term, his party loses the House. Do you think that that's not going to happen now that all of the records that he's broken, he will continue to break them? 
TRUMP: Well, of course, Donald Trump doesn't play by the normal rules, and the normal rules don't apply to him, so if ever, Judge, there's an opportunity here for the Republicans to not only keep the majority in the House, but gain a few more seats in the Senate, it is 2018 and I really do think that people are very scared about socialism. They are very scared about the chaos that we see happening out there and they are ready to put more Trump supporting Republicans in the House and Senate. We will see.

TRUMP: Thank you. 
PIRRO: Thanks. And Michelle Malkin, Pam Bondi and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk all on deck tonight, but next, we'll get deeper into the immigration issue and the calls to abolish ICE. I'm joined live by Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter. "Justice" rolls on in a moment. 
Welcome back to "Justice" live from New York on this busy night of news. A lot to talk about with my next guest from the Democrats call to abolish ICE to the serious port security concerns right here in the United States. Congressman Duncan Hunter joins me now. All right, good evening, Congressman. Very quickly, I mean, the President signed an executive order. He stopped the separation of children from their parents at the border, and yet, they still march. Does this signal to you that this is about more than just the separation of children from their parents?

DUNCAN HUNTER, US CONGRESSMAN, CALIFORNIA, REPUBLICAN: Totally. This is all about politics. This is not even about the Democrats winning on DACA and getting those votes. This is simply about keeping true. This is what -- I think it's about keeping a slave class of people in this country who will vote Democrat that will never be American citizens. The Democrats don't want to fix this problem, so President Trump had to. Now, if we have e-verify and build the border wall, we'll be in great shape. 
PIRRO: Okay, all right I want to move to a topic that I find very interesting, and that is a company called Gulftainer and I know that you're familiar with it, I know that you've been watching it and tell me about Gulftainer, what it is? Who owns it and what does it have to do with American port security? 
HUNTER: So, Gulftainer is the largest Middle Eastern port management and container company. They are from the Emirates. The owner's brother was Saddam Hussein's former nuclear science adviser that helped build some nice nuclear stuff with the North Koreans and the Russians. So that kind of gives you a general take on its corporate hierarchy.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's owned by a company called Crescent, also with military Islamic ties in the Middle East and Turkish ties and Russian ties. So, in our wisdom in this country, they ask for a massive port facility in Wilmington and the United States says, "Hey, that sounds great." So, while we are doing all these other things on immigration, stopping people and families of people bringing in marijuana and cocaine across the border, we are opening up a giant port facility where the Russians and our enemies could literally put in massive cargo containers full of -- I mean, name the type of bomb you want to name that they could ever -- anything from chemical, biological, electromagnetic pulse, nuclear weapons.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The point is that while we are doing all of this stuff with immigration, at the same time, we just handed over one of the nation's premiere container ports to the United Arab Emirates. 
PIRRO: All right, and so you are talking about the one in Delaware. This Gulftainer deal that they say is -- it involves a Club K System. What is a Club K System?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HUNTER: So, here is what Club K is. It doesn't involve it, but the company Gulftainer is owned by another big conglomerate called Crescent that has ties with a Russia company. Now, we're getting complex, but Trump has already slapped sanctions on the Russian company that makes a cargo container missile system. So it's a cargo container that goes on trains or ships or trucks. It holds four cruise missiles and those can have any kinds of warheads that they want. 
But the point is, Wilmington is about 125 miles away from DC, about 110 miles -- 125 miles from New York City and now we are going to give a foreign country an opening to bring in kind of whatever they want there. So, I'm not saying they are going to use Club K. They are not going to have missile system container boxes coming in, but the option is now there and there is nothing the US can do about it if they want to get by all of our concerns. Because we can set up as many security measures at a port like this as we want to, but if the major owner of that port wants to bypass or get around our security measures, they can do so because they own the port.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Okay, so they own the port. They have these Gulftainers that are capable of holding a cruise missile?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HUNTER: Yes. And this doesn't just go from there, but they also control what gets shipped from foreign countries. So if you look at what President Trump did when it came to the Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm, the mix of our 5G/LTE chips, President Trump stopped that. He said no.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If that's dangerous, if given the Chinese the ability to have the same technology and know the technology companies that own it, that we use in our phones, this by God has got to be massively dangerous. Because you are literally putting lives on the line allowing them bring in nuclear threats right on US soil. 
PIRRO: Well, the amazing part of this is that, you would think that CFIUS would have to approve this and I understand that they didn't. They said there is an exception for this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HUNTER: Yes, from what I understand, they did not look at this as a national security case which allowed CFIUS to kind of go around President Trump and around General Mattis, excuse me, Secretary of Defense Mattis. It if was a national security fix, the President and Mattis would have had to have looked at it. From what I understand, they were able to get around that, so that's a loophole that they exploited and that we're going to try to exploit back and still stop them from doing that. 
PIRRO: Congressman Duncan Hunter. We're going to stay on top of this Gulftainer issuer. Thank you so much. 
HUNTER: Thank you, Judge. 
PIRRO: All right, and Charlie Kirk still ahead, plus, I go one-on-one with Chris Hahn. But next, tamping down the rhetoric, the call for civility and the lowering of the volume on both sides of the aisle. Michelle Malkin and Pam Bondi join me in a moment to talk about it.

The warring parties there agreed to a ceasefire last Wednesday, set to again at 12:00 a.m. Saturday, but each side accusing the other of attacking in the early hours of Saturday morning. The bloody South Sudanese Civil War has raged for five years killing tens of thousands of people.

(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: That's good old Maxine Waters, Congresswoman, a few days ago, ramping up the rhetoric against the Trump administration. Tonight, I have two strong conservative women to respond to this and talk about a call for civility. Joining me now, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and CRTV commentator, Michelle Malkin. Okay, all right, so there you have it, you push back, you go after them. You do whatever you have to do and impeach Trump. So, Pam, I believe it was Sunday night, you had gone to the movies, and you had a rather horrible experience that I'd like maybe -- I'd like you to talk about for a moment or two. 
PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL, FLORIDA: Sure. Friday night, my boyfriend and I were walking in the movies, "The Documentary of Mr. Rogers," of all things, about what? Civility, humility, anti-bullying. Two or three big guys came up to me, they're filming it, said I was ripping babies out of mother's arms. And I disputed them on that. They didn't know what they were talking about. I was very kind to them. Of course, they didn't air that video. They started screaming in my face. Lost control. We bought our tickets, went into the vestibule, and continued to get there... 
PIRRO: And by the way, you're seeing this on the screen, folks. Sorry, Pam. Go ahead.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONDI: Jeanine, that's after the fact. So, that's the fourth incident. So walking in this happens. They go nuts. They are screaming, yelling, blocking me from walking in. That's when my security, they came up, stopped them. I thought they were gone. We went to the snack bar, then they came up again, yelling at the top of my head, every curse, baiting my boyfriend, saying, "Come on, come on, aren't you going to protect her? Aren't you going to do something?" Trying to get him to fight them. They spit on my head. Now, whether it was unintentional, I can't prove because he was yelling so loud, my hair was blowing. The guy inches from my face. It was that -- and then the incident that you saw was two hours later. They were not going to run me out of a theater. 
PIRRO: So, you stayed for the movie. 
BONDI: A few hours after the movie, we stayed for the movie, and then they called in more protesters. So what you heard was tame. That's the part they chose to post on Facebook. I was not going out a back door. I was going out of the front door that I walked in. 
PIRRO: And I am aware of that and I was proud of you for that, but Michelle, you had an experience that was not so friendly.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MICHELLE MALKIN, COMMENTATOR, CRTV: No, I've have had many and many in the heart of DC where all of the self-appointed arbiters of civility rule. And in part, it's why I decided to move my family away from there 10 years ago. Because I would be on the political and rhetorical battlefield every night on TV. Then the next day, on a Saturday at iHop, I'd have people in my face practically spitting the way that they did with Pam while my kids were trying to enjoy their happy face pancakes. This is toxic. This is not healthy. 
And we do have to underscore that the war on conservative women, right of center women, independent thinking, limited government women has been waged and festering for a long, long time. And the escalation with President Trump in office and so many more women able and willing to be outspoken tells you that this is what they fear. You know what the ultimate C word is, gals? Conservative -- it is an offense to the radical left because they believe they can lay claim to our chromosomes and our minds. 
PIRRO: I want to get to where we are going from here. I mean, the threats toward women, and I have my own stories, I mean, I am not going to waste this time, I mean, I am as outspoken as the next, but the threats are growing in ferocity. Opposing points of view are not being tolerated. There is this call to arms, a mob mentality. We are the fascists when they are trying to shut us up. That's what I call a fascist. So what do we do now? Pam, you do file charges. Let me ask you this, you are a former Assistant DA and former prosecutor DA, did you file charges against them for harassment?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONDI: There is a police report being written. That's what they wanted. They wanted to be taken out in handcuffs or they wanted to cause a brawl and have someone else be taken out. And I wasn't going to let that happen. We tried to get video from the theater. They didn't have it. They soon will, I think. They didn't have it, they'll soon put it in, but, no, I didn't. We filed an incident report because I made a restraining order against them because they have been tweeting. But you know what they're doing is, our President is doing such a great job. President Trump is incredible with what he's doing. 
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: But this is about you, Pam. It's about you. They are coming for you. If you and your boyfriend -- I think -- is your boyfriend is tall? 
BONDI: Tall. 
PIRRO: That's what I thought. You have a really tall boyfriend and they are attacking you in front of your boyfriend. What happens? And I know you are the Attorney General. I mean, you have a security detail. I used to, but when you are alone. What if you are getting your nails done? I mean, what you and Michelle- what do you do? 
MALKIN: Well, you arm yourself both literally and figuratively. I have a concealed weapons permit. I have had one for 10 to 15 years back to my days as an editorial writer and columnist at the "Seattle Times," before that at the "Los Angeles Daily News," where I faced my first death threat from the Mexican mafia. 
Conservative women never run from a fight. We are the ones that run towards the fire. And showing fear is the first thing that is necessary, and of course, we are all women in either public office or in the public square, but what conservative women and Trump women know is, anybody is vulnerable to this now. We know that we can risk the principles in our lives for that and we are willing to do it. That's why the left goes after us.

        }
      
BONDI: They cannot quiet the President and so they think they can quite us and they are not. We are going to continue our support for this great President. 
PIRRO: You know what, I respect you. I know you. I know each one of you. I know how you think, but at some point, do we have to tamp it down? 
MALKIN: Well, we are not the ones who have to tamp it down. The climate of hatred from the left and the progressives, their demonization and dehumanization particularly of women. I talked about this, the four stages of female conservative abuse that everyone has faced from Phyllis Schlafly to Michelle Botana (ph) to Sarah Palin, to this generation now of young millennials who are facing this on college campuses. 
We are not the ones -- the onus and the burden is not on us. If they started treating conservative women as women who believe in their principles and care about children and families, then we get a (inaudible)... 
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: So, Pam Bondi, we've got 15 seconds, what do you do? 
BONDI: Sure, well, we continue what we are doing without fear. They are breeding hate and we are not going to let it continue. They tweeted vicious things after they did this to me. And they went after a state senator, a female, and a state representative when she was in a coffee shop with her children. So, we cannot back down. We are not going to run and hide. They are calling us monsters, they are saying, "Don't let them breed. Go after them." Some of the tweets were so threatening, they had to -- Twitter removed them. That's what they are trying to do, and they are not going to win.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
PIRRO: All right, out of time. Michelle Malkin, Pam Bondi. We have to have a longer discussion on this. Thanks so much for being with us. Thank you. 
BONDI: Thank you. 
PIRRO: And last week, we tussled over immigration. You liked it so much I invited Chris Hahn back to "Justice" for round two. I think you're going like it again. Coming up next. 
The battle over civility continues to intensify tonight, and joining me now with his take on it all, former adviser to Chuck Schumer, radio show talk show host, Chris Hahn. All right, Chris, you heard Maxine Waters. "Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to and if you see anybody in a restaurant, department store, gas station. get out, create a crowd, push back, tell them they are not welcome anywhere anymore." What's that about, Chris? 
CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: First of all, I don't agree with any of that. and I know Senator Schumer made a statement from the floor distancing himself from that, too, disavowing that completely. I believe that we have to have civil discourse. I believe that we could disagree without being disagreeable and I think there's a time and a place to protest and when people are out to dinner or going to a movie, as your last guest was, I don't think that's the time and place to protest. Go to their office. Go to their meetings. Write letters, make phone calls, but we've got to be nice about it. 
And I think the President could do a little bit more to lead the civility here, too with some of his tweets being a little over the top. But that doesn't excuse anybody who goes out there and get in people's face physically. 
PIRRO: Okay, let's -- this isn't the President who is being harassed. This is Pam Bondi, Sarah Sanders in a restaurant with her family, Kirstjen Nielsen in a restaurant having dinner. I'm sure she worked an 18-hour day. They go to her home. They are pushing back on everyone. I walk down the street in Manhattan. I honestly, am not worried about a thing, but I get it, too. I mean, why is it that the conservative women are getting it? What are we doing to deserve it? I'm walking down the street. Pam Bondi is going to the movies. Sarah Sanders is having dinner. Kirsten is having dinner in her house. What is this craziness? It's lunacy.

HAHN: Well, look, I think it is bad, but this is not limited to conservatives. 
PIRRO: Well, give me an example of a Democrat -- wait a minute, Chris, time. Give me a Democrat woman who was harassed by conservatives and conservatives who called other people to say don't let them stay anywhere, get in their face. Give me one example. You can't. You can't because it's not happening. 
HAHN: I can give you an example, but there was -- look, there are definitely examples of progressives and Democrats being protested right at their homes. 
PIRRO: Who? 
HAHN: Chuck Schumer had a protest outside of his home a couple of years back. 
PIRRO: Chuck Schumer is a guy. I'm talking about women with their families. Michelle Malkin at iHop having pancakes. Cut it out. You can't make one incident where conservatives have gone after a woman. 
HAHN: First of all, all the women you mentioned are strong women. I might agree with them, you are a strong women -- and by the way, and you included are strong as any man. So, I don't think we should distinguish between men and women.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Do you think I could deck a guy as quickly as he could deck me? Come on. 
HAHN: It depends. I wouldn't want one of your heels to my head. It would hurt. You know, look, you are tough. We know that, Judge, I've been around you long enough to know how tough you are, but that said, nobody should be getting in anybody's physical space. That's not what this is about. We are Americans, we could disagree with each other, without coming to blows, without invading people's personal space. I think that's despicable. I think that kind of stuff needs to stop. 
And as for Sarah Sanders, let me make one more point, as for Sarah Sanders, that restaurant should have served her. And the guy who makes the cake in Colorado should have baked the cake for the gay couple that was getting married. 
PIRRO: No, no. Let me explain the difference, Chris, and I'm so glad you brought that up. Here in lies the rub, and I don't mean to point my finger. But where religion is involved, freedom of religion, religious freedom takes priority. All right, that baker had no problem serving gay. He didn't want to make the wedding cake because that was contrary to his religious beliefs, the wedding. He'd sell them nine million chocolate cakes. 
HAHN: Take the slippery slope. 
PIRRO: It was the wedding cake, but you know what? That's not the point. Chris, should Pam Bondi, should she have filed criminal charges? You and I both know that's harassment? 
HAHN: You know what? I mean, it's a political question for her, right? How is that going to look politically in her state? I don't know the answer to that. I think, if it was me, I would file criminal charges if I were her. But you know, if these people are harassing, I didn't see the tape. I didn't see the video. I don't know exactly what happened, but if they were trying to incite violence, that crosses the line in my opinion for peaceful protest.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well, you're right, Chris, and I have to tell you, I am not going to fight with you anymore because we seem to be agreeing with each other, but one thing we don't agree on though is that is this is all from the left to the right, but everything has to be tamped down because this is getting out of control. 
And at the end of the day, someone -- a lot of people are going to get hurt and people need to just respect each other. You know, I could fight with you verbally. I would never get in your face, in your space, go to your house, throw you out of a restaurant, that's not the way to behave. Chris, thanks for being with us tonight. 
HAHN: No. Thanks for having me, Judge. 
PIRRO: All right, and when Bill Maher and Mike Moore get together, you know it's going to be something. They made my list of outrageous statements this week, and Charlie Kirk joins me next to talk about it. Don't go away. 
What do you get when you combine Bill Maher and Michael Moore? Outrageous comments at the very least. That's what and that's... 
(VIDEO CLIP STARTS) 
MICHAEL MOORE, AMERICAN FILM MAKER: ... week after week, fascism is at the doorstep. We are in...  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BILL MAHER, HOST, REAL TIME: A moving coup. 
MOORE: People are afraid to use the word, but I think that we've got to be very serious about this. 
(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: And that's just one of the most of outrageous things I heard this week. Here to break it all down, founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk. All right, is fascism at the doorstep, Charlie? 
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: He wouldn't know fascism if it hit him in wherever -- you know what? Look, I'll tell you, of course not. I mean, this is a common talking point of the left. It's really interesting. A primary component of implementing fascist policies would be let's say, gun confiscation. You have a President who is trying to protect the Second Amendment and the rights of the citizens. He's trying to protect free speech rights. 
In fact, if you look at what fascism really is, it is a sister of socialism. It just means bigger government. It means more control and the President every single front is trying to protect the freedoms and liberties of the American people. This is a fear mongering tactic by the hard left to put try to actually put forth a talking point and accuse other people of what they are actually doing, which is one of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals. 
PIRRO: Indeed, and also fascism doesn't tolerate independent thought, and it is the left that is trying to stifle the conservatives. All right, now I think we have got a Chelsea Handler tweet. It says, "Trump and Putin are going to meet on July 16 in Finland which means Trump has two weeks to get in shape to fit into his wedding dress." What is that about?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KIRK: She is a comedian, right? I mean that was so funny I forgot to laugh. The left has completely killed comedy in America. I mean, this goes to this pathological hatred of Trump, and I had to summarize it shortly, I would say this, it's not that the left is afraid that Donald Trump will fail, they are terrified that he actually might succeed because he's going to be the most of successful President in our lifetime, if not one of the most of successful Presidents in American history and when that does happens, all these horrible jokes, the Kathy Griffin stunt tactics, the hatred embedded in the Democratic Party will shatter. They will have nothing to stand on because despite all that opposition, despite all the mockery and all false prophecy, you will have a President that will have turned this country from the abyss back to prosperity, and so they are not afraid that he's going to fail, they are afraid he's going to succeed. 
PIRRO: And you know what's amazing to me, Charlie, is I see this stuff play out, I still can't believe it. I can't believe that the left that is supposed to be so protective of women is yelling and I am sure you may have heard this segment with Pam Bondi and Michelle Malkin. 
You know, go after them. Do whatever you have to do. Get a crowd. It's pretty outrageous. But let's talk about the next thing I heard. Jon Stewart last night delivered a message to the President. Let's listen to it. 
(VIDEO CLIP STARTS) 
JON STEWART, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: I just want to say, there is one hallmark to your presidency that I think we're finding the most of difficult is that no matter what you do, it always comes with an extra layer of gleeful cruelty. 
(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: What is he talking about?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KIRK: Yes, I mean, exactly. Let's take -- so gleeful cruelty, so when he gives tax cuts to millions of Americans that's gleeful cruelty. When he abolishes ISES from taking over the Middle East, that's gleeful cruelty or when he takes nuclear weapons away from North Korea, that's gleeful cruelty or when he pardons Alice Johnson from a life sentence. I mean, that's somehow -- look, again, this is back to this pathological hatred of Donald Trump. They don't look at things rationally. They have completely lost their mind, they're almost having a competition. 
It's almost like they are having the outrage Olympics trying to see who can say the most outrageous thing from week to week and they seem to continue to outdo themselves. 
PIRRO: And you know, as we go forward in 2018, I have to tell you something, Charlie, it seems to me as people listen to this stuff, they say to themselves, first of all, he's not that bad, my life seems to be a lot better. It seems safer. I mean, I've got a job. I don't have to have three jobs or whatever it might be. That I think that more and more independents are saying this left is really just -- this is my open talk, this is socialism. 
KIRK: That's exactly right and look, the modern day Democratic Party has moved so far to the left. They are having a competition now who can be the socialist, or the communist or the Marxist, it's scary, and so you articulated it so well. If you look at the last 100 years, socialism has been tried 100 times, and we have 100 million people that have been murdered, civilizations destroyed and countries ruined and this will only further the chance of Donald Trump winning reelection and us succeeding in the midterms, the more radically left the Democrat Party goes, however, it is horrifying to think if they ever get back the reins of power. 
PIRRO: Indeed, Charlie Kirk. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. 
KIRK: Thank you, Judge. 
PIRRO: All right, we'll be right back. Finally tonight, don't forget to friend me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter and on Instagram @judge_jeanine. I'd love to read your comments.
