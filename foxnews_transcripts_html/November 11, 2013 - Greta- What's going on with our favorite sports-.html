'Off the Record', 11/11/13: The ugly, racially-tinged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal is just the latest controversy to cast a dark cloud on some of our favorite national sports

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. What's going on? We have gone from what was our favorite national sport baseball to being poisoned by steroids - horrible! College football, another favorite, and now one of the most famous franchises, Penn State, is now scarred, all those sexual abuse charges known by coaches and simply ignored.
And now the NFL -- are they ruining it for us? The nation has loved football. I love football, but the NFL is beginning to look bad. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in jail on a murder charge and of course, the NFL knew he was in trouble long before the rest of us. A history of violence and run-ins with police, and there are lots of other players with criminal run-ins. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now the NFL is embroiled in an ugly scandal in the Dolphins locker room. It's very painful. Here is Shannon Sharpe talking about Richie Incognito's use of racial slurs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SHANNON SHARPE, CBS FOOTBALL ANALYST AND RETIRED NFL PLAYER: I'm so disappointed. I just hope that someone was misquoted. I hope I'm wrong and they didn't allow Richie Incognito to say this racially charged word in an open locker room and go unchecked. That's unacceptable. I'm embarrassed for -- because if he said that to Jonathan Martin, he didn't only say it. He is talking to you, too, because if you are black, you know what that word means.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm sure you all have a view on this current controversy. and I know some of you non-African-Americans think African-Americans say it to each other, so it must be OK. It's not.
It's not OK. It's mean, it's degrading and you know what? African-Americans should stop saying it, too. And hip-hop artists should stop using it in song lyrics. It's not funny and not clever. It fuels the non-minority idiot ignorant of history into thinking it's OK to say it. It's not. It's wrong, no matter who is saying it and when. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
