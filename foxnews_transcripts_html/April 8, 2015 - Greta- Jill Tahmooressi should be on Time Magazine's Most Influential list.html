Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Time Magazine has its Time 100, the annual list of its most influential people in the world. I got to thinking, who really belongs on that list? Jill Tahmooressi, the mother of a U.S. Marine Andrew Tahmooressi, because she has proven influential.
Think about it, her Marine son was locked up in Mexico in a hopeless situation and by her shear determination, her influence, she got the attention of the entire world. She got Mexico's attention big-time. She got the media. She inspired me to go to the California and Mexico border and reenact that accidental drive into Mexico. She sat outside that prison in the hot sun. She never gave up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
She got more than 100,000 people to sign a petition to the White House in 30 days. And because of her influence, Andrew's plight in that Mexican prison was even brought up multiple times at White House briefings. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while President Obama may have stubbornly not gotten involved, he had to know about it. It was every place. That was her influence. She got the product. She got her son out. So, yes, this mother of a Marine, a nurse from Florida, is influential big-time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So help me get Time Magazine to do the right thing, to include Jill. Here is how. I will make it easy for you. Tweet #Time100 with #JillTahmooressi. Or here is another way. Go to GretaWire.com for details.
But please do this. We all have to do it. Deadline is coming up. Do it right now. She has influence with results. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
