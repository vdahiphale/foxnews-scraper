SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to "Hannity."
All right. Just breaking as we speak tonight -- well, we call him creepy and crazy Uncle Joe Biden for a reason. Well, now he's facing a second accusation of inappropriate touching. Been a rough week for the Democratic Party, and it's only Monday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez embarrassing herself yet again, Senator Elizabeth Warren running out of other people's money, and wannabe columnist and communist, oh, Bernie Sanders, he can't answer a simple question about his own policies. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you just heard the breaking news. Creepy crazy Uncle Joe Biden, he's facing a serious backlash for, you guessed it, being creepy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We begin tonight with our "Hannity Watch" on the radical 2020 extreme Democratic socialists. Well, he hasn't yet formally entered the race but already, "Creepy Uncle Joe" was facing two separate allegations now of inappropriate touching and a lot more. Just a short time ago, a Connecticut woman named Amy Lappos told "The Hartford Courant", quote: He put his hand around my neck, he pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.
Meanwhile, the first accusation came from former Democratic lawmaker Lucy Flores of Nevada, who encounter the vice president backstage at a political event in 2014. She's claiming Crazy Uncle Joe got close to her from behind, sniffing and smelling her hair and planted an unsolicited case on the back of her head, saying, quote: My brain couldn't process what was happening, I was embarrassed, I was shocked, I was confused. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's take a look.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });

        }
      
LUCY FLORES, D-FORMER NEVADA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: Eva Longoria was there. We were all lined up next to the stage. Eva was in front of me, Joe Biden was behind me. I am preparing myself to give these remarks, is the very last days before the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And very unexpectedly and out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair, and then plant a slow case on the top of my head.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. Smelling someone's hair from behind, rubbing noses, kissing a stranger, some on the lips -- who does that? Apparently, Joe Biden. And he does that a lot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, "Creepy Uncle Joe" is a nickname that he's earned through the years.  Look at your screen. Cringe inducing, very awkward touching, grabbing, kissing, here stroking at smelling, and knows rubbing. The woman you just heard from told "Politico," quote: It's so easy to Google creepy Biden.
Everyone is entitled to due process and the perception of innocence, but the problem here for Joe Biden is there are dozens and dozens of pictures and videos of shoving these kinds of encounters.
Biden offered a half-hearted apology, saying he doesn't believe he ever acted inappropriately. That brings us to a very important question, will the Democratic Party hold Biden to the same "believe all women, I believe, zero-tolerance standard" that they have utilized so vigorously against Republicans. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, where are all the Judge Kavanaugh I believers? So far, the radical socialist 2020 Democrats who don't want Biden to win, they are coming out against the former VP, but obviously, that's political expediency and Creepy Uncle Joe's super fans in the mainstream media, they are singing a much different tune. They love them. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If one person an allegation that is five years old, and that cannot negate or change or diminish anyway Joe Biden's very strong record empowering women.
MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: He is extremely affectionate, extremely flirtatious in a completely safe way. But are we allowed to bring up that Lucy Flores is a huge Bernie person and she has, you know, political connections that might be counter of Biden's goals? Hold on, is it OK to bring up this could be politically motivated?

HANNITY: No surprise, sucking up to Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe, that's the same media mob who tried to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life over wild 30-year- old uncorroborated allegations, and some cryptic high school yearbook post.  Don't expect the media to ever properly vet Joe Biden. They didn't do it to 2008 to the chosen one, the one the gave them thrills up their leg, Barack Obama, they're not going to do it any of the 2020 candidates on the extreme Democratic socialist side.
So, it will be up to us on this program because there are so many red flags about Joe Biden, other than this constant need to touch and stroke and kiss and rub noses. Look, I'll let you be the judge of the pictures you see.  I'm personally not a fan of people that get right in your grill. We've all met people like that, they get so close to her face that your nose is almost due touch. Even if you take a step back, they move anymore.

And people had kind of massage other people, go up and rubbing their shoulders, want to kiss others on the lips. You don't even know them. A lot of this creeps me out. You'll decide.

Tonight, we start with Biden's sketchy past on race in America. This will be an issue for him. For a Democratic Party so obsessed with identity politics, this is not a good look for a presidential candidate. Take a look.

BIDEN: Better than anybody else. Now, you don't know my state. My state was a slave state. My state is a border state. My state is the eighth largest black population in the country.
We got the first sort of mainstream person in America who is articulate and bright and clean and nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a story.

All right. That's right. So the person currently pulling highest in the Democratic primary is a man who called the president clean, articulate, and storybook, man. He bragged that his home state was a state. You can't work in a 7-Eleven or Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. That is your Democratic front runner.
And no surprise, considering in 1975, most of the media will never bring this up. A younger Senator Biden fought hard against a practice used to desegregate schools known as busing, in other words, he didn't want integration. Take a look.

But she paid a terrible price. She was abused through the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something.

Don't be fooled, Amtrak Joe tries to frame himself as a sympathetic champion of the people. Look behind the scenes, we have discovered and we will reveal in great, great detail in the days and weeks ahead, shady, swampy behavior.

Naturally, this raised serious ethical questions, and even some scorn from the left.
According to author Peter Schweizer in his brand-new book, "Secret Empires," while Hunter Biden was working at this Ukrainian oil company, a series of very suspicious foreign financial transactions flow to an account used by Hunter Biden, including a multimillion dollar deposit from that company.
Now, keep in mind, this all occurred while his father was vice president, get this, serving as one of the key point persons for the Obama administration's anticorruption message in Ukraine. Well, does any of this unfamiliar? Eerily similar to what we learned about the Clinton Foundation?

There is a lot to unpack here, and we will have full coverage of this story in the days and weeks ahead. Same story with trying to, by the way. It's one more example of hypocrisy from the left. Clinton, Biden, everybody in between, Democrats seem to get a free pass on everything, abuse of power allegations, claims of racism, sexual harassment, while conservatives, Republicans, I believe, demonize, guilt by accusation, with or without evidence. Oh, and by the way, yes, his son while he was doing these deals in China and Ukraine -- oh, we'll go to China tomorrow, guess what, he was on Air Force Two with his father, had a free trip to do these deals. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Look at the commonwealth of Virginia, more example of hypocrisy.  Democratic governor, attorney general, they both admitted to dressing up in blackface, being extremely racist in the '80s. They are facing any consequences? No. What would happen if it was a Republican?
And there's the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, two separate women have made serious allegations, sexual assault and violent rape, yet coming to this day, the "I believers," Democrats in Virginia, they have done nothing to hold Fairfax accountable and deafening silence from people saying "I believe in the Kavanaugh case."

        }
      
So, the party that constantly tells you and us to believe women, all women -- well, they don't seem capable of accusing one of their own, unless they want to beat them in the primary. That's why the lieutenant governor, Fairfax, his first accuser, Vanessa Tyson, was compelled to speak out earlier today. We have the tape.

HANNITY: All right. In the coming months and even tomorrow, we're going to get to see whether the party of identity politics is willing to hold themselves to the same standard they place on everybody else. We are not going to hold our breath.
But that is a radical crop of extreme 2020 Democratic socialists that want to be president and how they will shamelessly deploy the same old tired fear tactics and identity politics always against President Trump. Take for example, Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke, officially kicked off his campaign this weekend in El Paso, frequently implying that walls are immoral. We should just open up the border, tear down the existing walls there.
Robert Francis, he lives in a fantasy world because there is a serious crisis tonight at our southern border yet again. Illegal immigration is experiencing one more time a massive surge, another huge caravan on the way.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
President Trump has cut aid over the weekend to three Central American countries where the caravans are originating. He's threatening to close our southern border with Mexico if Mexico does not do their job and stop the caravan from marching north. We'll have a lot more coming up on the program. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, first, let's turn to another radical 2020 candidate who just predicted millions of people are going to die. Sounds like a death panel. If President Trump gets his way to fix "keep your doctor, keep your plan, pay less", millions lost their doctors, lost their plans, and everybody paid more.
Take a look.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Trump has an idea on health care. His idea is to throw 32 million Americans off of their health insurance they have. Doing away with insurance for kids who are 26 years of age or younger who are on their parents plan, doing away with the protections that the ACA has for pre-existing conditions.
That means if you have cancer, heart disease, you have diabetes, if Trump gets his way, the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. Thousands of people will literally die.

HANNITY: A little problem, FDR died in 1945, two years before presidential term limits were implemented. You would think a person -- remember, she was going to be sworn into office -- someone sworn to uphold and protect the U.S. Constitution would understand the context of the amendments to our U.S. Constitution. Maybe that's a little too much to expect given that the congresswoman compared climate change to World War II, 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina.
Joining us with reaction, we have Karl Rove, FOX News contributor.

All right, let's start -- the only Democrats, you notice they have been silent on the lieutenant governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, Karl.  Really interesting because they want after Kavanaugh with a vengeance. I don't see the "I believers" in that case, but a few of the other 2020 candidates that don't like Biden, now, they are back for their political motives.
What's your reaction to these issues that Biden will face if he decides to jump in?
KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Biden has always been known as a guy who is a hugger, a kisser, a back slapper. I've been the victim of sort of Joe Biden, the goofiness of Joe Biden, unveiling of President George W. Bush's 43 official portrait in the Obama White House, Biden was seated in front of me, turned around and saw me.
And in good nature, I have to say, good naturedly started poking me in the chest with his fingers, saying, you're great, man, you're great and the --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Karl, did he try to kiss you on the lips?
ROVE: No, no, Dana Perino I think was horrified. She was sitting next to me and David Petraeus was on the other side. I think General Petraeus was thinking, should I stop the vice president from thumping Karl Rove in the trust because he kept doing it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
But, look, this is a minor thing. But a couple of lessons, one is, every time a Democrat gets in the race, somebody, generally on the left, is going to do an oppo dump on him. They're doing the dump on him now.
They did a dump on Amy Klobuchar. She was a terrible boss, they said, and fed all the stuff out. Even Robert Francis O'Rourke got hit. Oh, he is too close to the Republicans come he's got a very thin record and policy.
So, it's a sign that the Democrats are going to be going tough and hard and nasty and mean this time around.
Second of all, it shows that Joe was not ready for prime time. Despite the fact that he has been a vice president, that he served in the Senate for a long time, that he ran for couple of times, he doesn't have his team together. So, when this popped on him over the weekend, it took him some time to finally get his sea legs and put out an appropriate response.
And, finally, it raises the question of, is he going to continue to apologize? We saw him do it about Anita Hill last week. I thought she did a good job of playing that out. The question now is, is he going to feel compelled to go out and apologize for anything else that specifically that he did in the past or did he do as sort of a blanket statement of, you know who I am, my attention -- I want to be respectful, if people took it the wrong way, but is he going to keep apologizing or is he going to show some strength?
I think Democrats are going to applaud him more if he shows some strength than if he joins in and sort of the constant apology tour for everything that he's been and everything that he's done for the last 30 years.
HANNITY: But if you look at even Robert Francis, Beto, this week, I mean - - 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROVE: No, no. Don't use that phony nickname. He's Robert Francis O'Rourke, that's how he shows up on the ballot. I'm asking you, please, join me in his crusade.
HANNITY: Can I say Robert Beto Bozo? Is that right?
ROVE: No. No.
HANNITY: I'm a talk show host. Give me a little attitude here.
All right. Give me a little latitude to the -- look, in 2018, Democrats, they hid who they are.
ROVE: Right.
HANNITY: Now they can't go to the left far enough. New Green Deal, no oil gas, no combustion engine, no cows or planes, eventually, and the world is going to end in 12 years. But the problem is -- and everything is free. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How is the country going to absorb that? I would assume -- everything is free, guaranteed a job, vacation, government, healthy food, retirement, everything -- even free college, free child care, wealth tax. How is that going to fly with a 70 percent top marginal rate, 90 percent top corporate rate?
ROVE: Yes. Look, I may be wrong on this, but I think the good common sense of the American people leads them to believe that you can't have everything free, there has to be somebody who pays for it. But the Republicans have got to go out there and each time one of these ideas is brought up, they need to attack it.
Doing three things: one is to say this is bad policy. Two is to say this is not in keeping with our values. And three, to offer some positive alternatives.
The Green New Deal is one of the best examples. One of the things that gets me is that all this stuff is designed to transform our society into something that it isn't. We are going to move from a free enterprise system to a socialist system. We are going to go from a system in which personal freedom and personal responsibility are paramount to one where the government takes care of us.
And most important of all, why are we doing this? We are the only major industrialized country in the world which is growing its economy and reducing the absolute level of greenhouse gas emissions. They peaked in the U.S. at about 6 million tons in 2007, now about 5.5 billion pounds. We are the only ones doing it.
Where is India? Where is China? Where's the developing world?
HANNITY: They're never going to join us.

ROVE: We are the only ones doing it.
HANNITY: I only have 30 seconds. Quick answer.
So the president -- it is already having 70/30 issue minimum. Build the border wall. Oh, we shouldn't take up health care. You guys promised this for seven years, show votes, and you never got it done. Why not fight to follow up on your promise? Meaning, the Republican-held Senate. Trump keeps fighting for his promises.
ROVE: Yes. Look, if we have a health care plan, by God, let's fight for it. Border security, let's fight for it. But everybody's got to do it.  In all fairness, I wish we had had the president's statement office in January 2017 say, I am asking for a supplemental appropriation to build the wall and the necessary places along the southern border. We'd be better fighting it up today with a Democratic House.
HANNITY: I'll tell you -- you are right. That was promised by Paul Ryan.  They didn't override his veto and they did allocate $9 billion from Defense Department.
We'll see what happens. Karl, thank you. I appreciate it.
All right. Coming up, Democrats, they can handle the Mueller results, they're now trying to subpoena the full report. Mark Meadows, Alan Dershowitz are here, and so much more. We'll talk about a real crisis on the southern border. Even Obama's DHS secretary agrees with me -- straight ahead.

HANNITY: Democrats continue their hysterical response to the Mueller report. They are so disappointed that president did not collude with Russia.
The left's blatant hypocrisy is on full display because as they push for the full release of the findings, which the attorney general is promising by mid-April with appropriate reductions to protect innocent people, sources, methods -- well, you got hypocrites like Congressman Adam Schiff, in other words, the cowardly Schiff won't come on this program, loudly opposing the release of the new Nunes memo. Remember that, Congressman?  Because he exposed FISA abuse at the top level of the FBI and DOJ. He was concerned about sources and methods being revealed, which he is not concerned about now.
Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: To presume that this whole gambit of releasing this memo by the Republicans was approved by the speaker, it's a violation of the whole compact between the committee and the intelligence community. Now, that compact provides you share with us your closely held secrets, we'll keep them protected. We protect your sources and methods.
We have crossed a deeply regrettable line in this committee where for the first time in the ten years or so that I've been on the committee, there was able to politicize the declassification process of intelligence and potentially compromise sources and methods.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Oh, then it's important sources and methods but not now.
All right. Tonight's brief "Hannity" history lesson. The current DOJ rules governing the reports released -- by the way, the attorney general has full control, he decides, nobody else. But they were widely backed by the Democrats. Remember, two decades ago after that Starr report was released, and what the Democrats wanted was designed to make the special counsel more accountable to the public.
How ironic, the same people that wanted to limit the release following Starr's findings are now pushing to get the full report, no reductions.
Democratic stunts like this don't step there, as they are now taking steps towards -- get this -- issuing subpoenas for Mueller's report. And by the way, they want to grand jury interviews and material, which would be illegal the last time I checked.
Joining us for the very latest, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, the author of an introductory explainer to "The Mueller Report", Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, is back with us.
All right. Let me start with you, Professor. Last time I checked, releasing -- someone is calling for one of you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Releasing grand jury materials, oh, that would be Professor Dershowitz -- hello, this is Sean Hannity, Professor Dershowitz's line, can I help you?
Before releasing grand jury -- it's illegal, correct? And redactions for sources and methods and maybe people who are innocent in all of this, whose names are mentioned that would be normal. Although, Bart doesn't have to reveal a thing, does he. 
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: No, there's nothing in the regulations that require him to reveal anything. And the best test is the shoe on the other foot test. When we go back to Comey statement, if Comey had said, we're just not going to indict Hillary Clinton on the emails and the Republicans said, wait a minute, we heard you have a report that says she was extremely careless. We want you to release that. The Democrats would have jumped up and down and say, no, prosecutors don't say anything negative about people they haven't indicted. All they're supposed to do is announce no indictment.
Well, suddenly everything is changed and it's the Democrats who want to know why there wasn't charges. They want to know what the split was between those who wanted to charge and not charge an obstruction of justice. The law doesn't authorize that to be released if the attorney general wants to do it. That's within his discretion. But no court should order the attorney general in the executive branch to release grand jury material and other material through the legislative branch certainly without the approval of the court. So, we're seeing rampant hypocrisy and we've seen on both sides.  If the shoe were on the other foot, I think we'd see Republicans calling for the release.
HANNITY: Probably some - I'm not disagreeing.
MEADOWS: The material of the Democrats.
HANNITY: And you know I agree with Trey Gowdy. I don't think they should release any of it, Congressman Meadows. It was definitive on collusion. If collusion not a crime and you know OK, so the attorney general and even Rod Rosenstein agreed in very quick order, not based on any principle that whether or not or argument that you can indict a sitting President on the merits they said, no, this doesn't rise to any level of indictment, but grand jury materials not eliminating executive privilege, sources, methods, innocent people. Frankly, the Democrats said we shouldn't do it. I think maybe they're right in this case. Let's give them what they wanted.  MEADOWS: Well, you know it's amazing what a little bit of good news for President Trump will do to my Democratic colleagues. You have Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff who as you pointed out was saying, no, we can't release anything that's classified, we can't. We can't afford to put our national security in jeopardy. But yet here he says, I don't care what's in their release at all. You've got Jerry Nadler who's switched, and flip flopped and said, now he's going to subpoena this even grand jury material.

Listen, both sides look at this differently. But I can tell you right now, this is all about a narrative, a narrative that the Democrats have had for 22 months that went away that because their lies were not borne out in the Mueller report. And now what they're trying to do is change the narrative and pick and choose little parts, so that they can go after the President once again.  HANNITY: Congressman, there are going to be criminal referrals issued this week by Chairman Nunes. There are going to be the President I, I interviewed last week. There will be the FISA applications released. There will be 302s released. There will be gang of eight material we took. We've identified five buckets of information that will be extraordinarily damning. I know that to be the case based on all of my sources, is that a good idea. Because I think you want to be - you want transparency, I don't think they're going to like that when that comes out.  MEADOWS: Well, they're not going to like that Sean. But I think you've got the professor on tonight. It's all about civil liberties and making sure those civil liberties are protected. And if we cannot count on our government to protect those precious rights to privacy without warrants and warrantless searches, then we've got a real problem. And so, some of those criminal referrals are justified. Certainly, some of the declassification that gets to the bottom of this is justified. At the same time, we do need to protect our national security interest.  HANNITY: 100 percent and sources--
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: And I think the most thing--
HANNITY: Professor, let me ask you though. I want to ask you this. They're going to call back now to re-interview many people. They don't make a lot of money. A good attorney in Washington, I'm imagining is close to $1000 dollars an hour. What for the same questions? How many times must people be harassed like this and why don't they just say, I plead the Fifth, I stand by my prior testimony.  DERSHOWITZ: Well, they shouldn't plead the Fifth, because that for many people implies guilt. Remember that when, the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate did that back in the McCarthy period, the courts finally put an end to it and said enough is enough. You can't just harass people and call people in order to expose them. You have to have a legitimate legislative purpose--
HANNITY: What if they misremember something from testimony a year and a half ago that they decide if it's perjury. Or lying to Congress.
DERSHOWITZ: There is no question. Perjury traps can be fallen into by innocent people. If an innocent person testifies truthfully and somebody else testifies the other way, and if prosecutors choose to believe the other person, you've fallen into a perjury trap, which is why the President was right not to testify to Mueller.
HANNITY: 100 percent.
DERSHOWITZ: And why I think civil libertarians ought to be very concerned about exposing to criticism one-sided report which only saw one side of the story and didn't result in indictments. That's traditionally not done and at least the courts have to be asked to come in and decide what can be shown and what can't that come from grand juries. Let's have the same civil liberty for everybody.
HANNITY: Hey, maybe Democrats might want to give up on the same investigation. They had the FBI investigation. Two congressional investigations, no collusion, no obstruction. Give it up. Maybe solve problems and serve the people that put you there. Just an idea. Thank you, both.
DERSHOWITZ: Hey, I'm in favor of that. Let's disarm.
HANNITY: All right. Congresswoman Maxine Waters says, it was the correct thing for the charges against Jussie Smollett to be dropped. That's next. Also, Obama's former DHS, yes, it's not a manufactured crisis at the southern border and the President now threatening to shut it down as he is now withdrawn aid from three countries over the weekend. I believe the right decision. We'll tell you all about it.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Many people rightly still outraged about the charges being dropped against Jussie Smollett this weekend at the NAACP Awards, Comedian Chris Rock. Let it roll. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN: What the hell was he thinking. From now on, I never - you are Jesse from now on. You don't even get the U no more. That U was respect, you will get no respect from me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Very funny as always. All right, Congresswoman Maxine Waters sees things differently. She said dropping the charges, correct thing to do. Live from Chicago with the very latest on this story and more Matt Finn. Matt, what's going on. 
MATT FINN, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Sean, the outrage over Jussie Smollett boiled over here in Chicago today right in front of Kim Foxx's downtown office. The Chicago police Union protesting against Kim Foxx saying, she has a history of being anti-police, even exonerating known gang members and they're demanding she resigns. A group of Kim Foxx supporters organized a counter protest in the same location today led by Jesse Jackson. Jackson tells Fox News that Chicago's police superintendent is quote very wrong. And Jackson says, Kim Foxx is fixing Chicago's judicial system and setting the innocent free.
Protesters from opposing sides got in each other's faces today. Police had to calm things down at one point and Kim Foxx demonstrators called police racist. President Trump supporters. Here is some of what demonstrators had to say.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The policemen in the city are great people. They sacrifice. They put their life on the line, every single time they make a traffic stop.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are Trump fans.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not about Fox.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You care about Jussie Smollett.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FINN: And Sean, the President has called for a federal review of the Smollett case. And today, the former Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O'Brien wrote an op ed saying, she is personally going to petition the courts here into Chicago to assign a special prosecutor to investigate. Kim Foxx. Sean.
HANNITY: All right, Matt in Chicago tonight. Thank you. Now we turn to another very important story, the crisis on our southern border escalating, even Obama's former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. He never got the memo. That's not a manufactured crisis, admitting there is a real crisis on our southern border. We'll take a look at that. And joining us now with reaction, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Victor Davis Hanson is with us, Former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi is with us.  Pam, when you start with 90 percent of the heroin coming into our country across that border, add fentanyl to it in a two-year period 4000 homicides, 30,000 sexual assaults, 100,000 violent assaults from criminal aliens. The 2 percent on 98. That's a crisis. I met Angel moms and dads many of them. That's a crisis. 
PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: I've seen it firsthand as attorney general, Sean. And as a prosecutor, I don't know how you can say 130 people die in a day from drug overdoses isn't a crisis. And I don't know how the Democrats want gun control for law abiding citizens. Yet guns are flowing over the Mexican border into the hands of gang members. So that makes no sense to me that that's not a crisis.
HANNITY: You know Victor I look at this and I'm like wow have you never looked at the statistics or you care about the fence, you want to build the wall, you want to fund it, you care about Dreamers, you care about DACA. It was all offered on a silver platter, but not if Trump does it. The hatred and rage against Trump stop any progress. 
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: I think when you see things that are absurd and don't make rational sense, you ask what's the purpose. Who profits? Cui Bono is a Roman who said so. Mexico to take one example is not really a neutral anymore. It's more of an adversary or belligerent and so are the Central American governments. They get about $55 billion in annual remittances. That's their largest source of foreign exchange they want that to continue. Some of it's subsidized by the taxpayer through entitlements that free up that cash.
Second, people who are dissidents and don't obtain parity in Mexico, they don't march on Mexico City. They march into the United States. That's a safety route. And more importantly, they form an expatriate lobbying community when they come to the United States and have a very different view of Mexico and their homeland as long as they don't have to live there.  As far as, the Democrats and the progressive mind. It's a win-win-win Sean because it shakes the confidence of the Trump base who voted for Trump to see this secure border. They don't see it. They hope independents see some separations from parent and child was last summer. We may see that when these caravan - when the weather warms, and the caravans increase. And let's be honest and very cynical. They flip purple and red states blue whether it's California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and they feel that the long-term demographic advantages outweigh the short-term idea of sovereignty. 
HANNITY: Let me quickly ask you both about Smollett. I mean we've got two eyewitnesses. We've got the guys that involved in this that say they were involved in it buying all the material supposedly used Pam. You expect federal charges to be brought up here? 
BONDI: I think they very well may be, Sean. And also, Jussie Smollett said the guys that attacked him were white and he didn't know them. These two guys are from Nigeria and they speak with an accent. I mean it's ridiculous what's happening. And as for Maxine Waters, that's the woman who has zero credibility with me who enabled people to come after me, to come after Secretary Nielsen to go after Sarah Sanders. So, she's ridiculous to not support the police commissioner and Rahm Emanuel.
HANNITY: Victor. Your thoughts. 
HANSON: Very quickly. It reminds us that we don't have equality under the law. If Jussie Smollett was poor and black, he'd be in jail. If he was white in middle class, he'd be in jail. Class, race and politics and look at what's the sequence of events this week. Sean, if Mike Pence did what Joe Biden did, he would have no liberal insurance. He would be asked to resign. If these parents had tried to rig their kids into universities were not liberal and wealthy but they were the parents - they were truck drivers and welders from Bakersfield. They wouldn't be treated the same.
And I think people get and Jussie Smollett in particular has jumped the shark. He's taken a very suspect genre of fake crimes. He's taken to the absurd or wealthy in length where nobody would believe it anymore that there is people with MAGA hats and out at 2 in the morning and they have rope and they have - he just added each layer of fantasy upon fantasy to the point where he blew up the whole idea. Now, nobody is going to believe this ever again. And he's responsible for that.
HANNITY: Real victim. That's a good point. All right. Thank you, both. We'll have more on Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe Biden and also Chick-fil-A is not welcome at one New York airport. You won't believe the reason why Tammy Bruce, Sean Spicer. They're next 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: As we get to a lot of breaking news tonight. Joining us now, America First Action Senior Advisor, Sean Spicer and Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce.
TAMMY BRUCE, RADIO SHOW HOST AND PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Hi, guys.
HANNITY: Hi. We'll get to the issue.
BRUCE: All right.
HANNITY: Chick-fil-A, I love Chick-fil-A. That's one issue. Niagara Falls Airport; I never heard of Niagara Falls Airport, but because of the Christian beliefs of Dave Cathy, I want to ask you thought about - all right. The creepy Joe Biden stuff. I will put up more pictures. The kissing, the smelling the hair, the grabbing, the massaging. It's so creepy to me. I love the audience decide, but--
BRUCE: Yes, well the word that it comes to me is pervert. I mean he's a perv. And to be blunt. But let's remember what this is. The left and the Democrats now want it to be zero sum, it's either Harvey Weinstein rape or nothing. What Joe Biden is doing is part of what we've been dealing with for the last 30 years on basic sexual harassment issues in the workplace and in public that this is an invasion of your personal space. And for Ms. Flores what she described was he physically restrained her.
He literally pushed his face into her hair and sniffed her like, I mean as though he's a dog on the street. And then he kissed her--
HANNITY: Look at all these pictures.
BRUCE: It's just horrible.
HANNITY: Look at all that.
BRUCE: Yes. And this is--
HANNITY: Not that one.
BRUCE: It's not. Yes. It's not one situation. But the problem is, we've been watching this unfold for a very, very long time. It's kind of everybody knows as they've said, but this is the kind of thing that we've given people a pass--
HANNITY: Look at that. What is that? Who does that?
BRUCE: Now for the me-too movement also wasn't just about rape. This is about, look, I'm not going to be treated as an object. You don't get to do what you want to do with me because you think I'm attractive. There's got to be an issue of respect. But I always said it in the workplace and with groups that I would counsel is as for men who didn't know what was appropriate anymore, my advice was this If you wouldn't do it to a man, don't do it to a woman. And it gives the very basic standard.  HANNITY: You know Sean I've had this experience. People get up in your girl and you just take a step. They're up in your girl. Or people that they go to kitchen and they're searching for your lips. You are like I don't know you. Don't touch me. Don't grab my shoulders and massage me. Leave me alone. Sorry.  SEAN SPICER, SENIOR ADVISOR, AMERICA FIRST ACTION: Yes. Can we just pivot to Chick-fil-A?
HANNITY: Yes. You can do whatever you want.  BRUCE: Best chicken soup ever.
SPICER: I feel bad for the - you know for all of these - for all the folks in both Niagara Falls, Buffalo area and San Antonio, I feel bad because it's bad for business and it's bad because they don't get the opportunity to have Chick-fil-A. I fly in and out of DCA pretty regularly. We've got a great Chick-fil-A there. There is always a long line, but so it's cutting off just like themselves. It gets rid of the tax revenue that they generate. That place is busy from the moment they open to the moment they close. And it's great food. I think that we've gotten when a guy like Dan Cathy can't support the Salvation Army, that's a problem.
I mean that's what this is really about is that they've now - the left has gotten out of control, so that a business like that can't go out there and support a great organization like the Salvation Army.
HANNITY: I love Chick-fil-A. Do you like Chick-fil-A?
BRUCE: I love it. Best chicken soup in the world. And that is the bottom- line. When for the left supporting the Salvation Army becomes a crime, we've all got a problem.
HANNITY: All right.
SPICER: That's right.
HANNITY: It's great work as always. Good to see you and Sean, good to see you. All right, when we come back, a horrific story. South Carolina college student murdered. She got in a car she thought was her Uber, every parent's worst nightmare.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Horrible story tonight. Nathan D. Rowland is suspected of murdering University of South Carolina student Samantha Josephson. And look at the surveillance video. She is getting into a car after a night out with her friends. She tragically - she thought it was the Uber she ordered. It was not, found dead hours later. Oh, so heart-breaking. Thoughts and prayers to that family.
We are not the hate-Trump media mob. Laura Ingraham, let not be your heart be troubled. How are you?
