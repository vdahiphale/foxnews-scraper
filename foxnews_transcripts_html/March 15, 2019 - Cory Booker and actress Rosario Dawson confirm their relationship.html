HARRIS FAULKNER, HOST: The first veto of the Trump presidency setting up what some people are calling a battle royal between the president and Congress. Democrats already taking steps to make an end run around the president and the latest twist in the fight over border security.
In prime time, I'm Harris Faulkner, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.”

The president exercising his constitutional right. Rejecting a resolution to overturn his national emergency declaration on the southern border. Saying, his duty as commander-in-chief is protecting the safety of the American people.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that have signed into law would put countless Americans in danger, rarely have we had such a national emergency.
Therefore, to defend the safety and security of all Americans, I will be signing and issuing a formal veto of this reckless resolution. That's why I say, America first. If that's OK, America first.

The only emergency Congress voted to revoke was the one to protect our own country.

FAULKNER: A big night in news, we are also learning disturbing new realities about what's being called a conveyor belt straight to the border. It's a lucrative new system used by criminal organizations to ferry illegal immigrants through Mexico and into the United States via express buses.

Smugglers seeking to take advantage of Border Patrol agents struggling to contain the flow of illegal immigrants.
In moments, we'll hear from the vice president to the Border Patrol Council. First, “The Story” begins with Kristin Fisher, live outside the White House tonight. Kristin.
KRISTIN FISHER, CORRESPONDENT: Well, Harris, it's quite fitting that President Trump would save his very first veto for his signature issue. Funding for the border wall that he's been fighting for since the very early days of his campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A few hours ago inside the Oval Office, surrounded by angel parents who've lost a child because of an illegal immigrant, President Trump explained why he would not allow Congress to block his national emergency declaration.

TRUMP: To defend the safety and security of all Americans, I will be signing and issuing a formal veto of this reckless resolution. Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FISHER: Now Congress also has the freedom to try to override it. And before the ink was even dry on that veto, Speaker Pelosi was already announcing a date for that override vote. March 26.
She said in a statement, "The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president's lawless power grab. Yet, the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress, and the will of the American people." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, the new Attorney General William Barr, who was also at the signing ceremony in the Oval Office today defended the president's emergency declaration by saying this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: What you've done from a legal standpoint, it's solidly grounded in law. And from the standpoint of protecting the American people, it's imperative. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });

        }

FISHER: Giving fuel to the Trump administration's assertion that this is not a manufactured crisis. That there is an act of emergency at the border. Today, the Washington Post reported on a new massive smuggling effort that's been speeding migrants to end across the southern border on buses. That's according to U.S. officials. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's on top of the nearly 300 illegal immigrants arrested in a matter of hours after crossing the border in Texas earlier this week, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, now the debate over this emergency declaration heads back to the house where they likely will not have enough votes to override the President's veto. But it could split Republicans as it did earlier this week. And that, Harris, could be a big problem heading into 2020.
FAULKNER: Well, that's true, politically. And then there is an appellate court, and then, potentially, the Supreme Court seeing if it needs to go that far. We will follow this every step of the way. Kristin Fisher, thank you very much.
That sets us up for my first guest, Art Del Cueto, the national vice- president of the Border Patrol Council. Great to see you, tonight. You and I, part of my town hall in Arizona seven months ago. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm first going to ask you what it means for the morale. Because you were battling some things then, all these months later. What did it mean to see the president sign a veto today? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: It was fantastic. I mean, that's what it's all about. But it's still depressing, Harris, because I mean if you're looking at it, these people are going to fight it every step of the way.
And, you know, this is all I can say and I'm tired of saying it. But I'll continue to screaming it at the top of my lungs because the agents that I represent are asking for this. There's serious problems on our southern border. Our holding cells are at over capacity. It's a problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
These people are asking for asylum, they're being released within the United States. It's nonstop. The agents that we've hired is not enough because we've lost more than we -- within what we have hired. There's definitely a problem.
These individuals that are voting against it, these individuals that are saying that there isn't a crisis, you know, I've issued it a long time ago. You have an open invitation, come down here. I'll show you myself, I'll give you a tour. I'll tell you how bad it is. Or put on that green uniform that our men and women are out here wearing every single day and they're being overrun. Put on that green uniform for at least, a shift, come out here and see what's really happening. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FAULKNER: So, I'm looking at some numbers now, are at a group of nearly 300 illegal immigrants comprised mostly family units, unaccompanied minors, apprehended, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in Rio Grande Valley earlier this week. How much more serious as the problem gotten? And do you really believe that this is an emergency? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DEL CUETO: It's definitely an emergency. I just spoke with some of the individuals out there in the Yuma Sector, you know. And they're twice as - - they're holding capacity, they have twice as many as they can hold.
A couple of weeks ago, there was agents from Tucson that were going down to El Paso, and we were going to in buses, loading up some of the individuals that have been turning themselves in El Paso, and we were driving him over to Tucson so we can process him here because they were at over capacity.
And what that does, and this is what people need to understand. What that does is you're moving agents that are supposed to be protecting our borders having to do this transport so what's happening is it's weakening our southern borders. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It is definitely an emergency. I don't understand how -- you know, we've been up here -- we're doing the job. We're out here and we've been trying to explain how difficult it is and what the problems are. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the president of the United States is listening. And I don't understand how we have individuals that are politicians that were voted on by the American public to defend Americans that do not get it. I don't understand that.
FAULKNER: You know, we saw a bipartisan coming together, if you will, as they were trying to keep the government from shutting down again, and Democrats said that they were talking with Republicans and back and forth and they came up with about $1.3 billion, a little bit more than that to build more sections of the wall. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DEL CUETO: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FAULKNER: But that even, even if you have that money, even if you have the money that the president says he's willing to pump in now another $8 billion. Even with all of that, it takes some time. The president talking today again about how quickly they can refurbish and restore some poorest areas.
I want to know what's happening on the ground among Border Patrol agents because I'm seeing some disturbing hiring and retention issues. It is pressure on your people. And there is now a Republican, but could be a bipartisan situation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But now, it's Martha McSally and Dan Crenshaw, Republican representatives in Congress have said, they're writing legislation to address the retention and the hiring in the Border Patrol. Numbers north of 2000 needed. What is happening, Art?
DEL CUETO: What's happening is that -- you know, we took -- we took her head. We took a pretty good pay cut during the Obama administration. That's what happened. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so, what you're seeing is the agency is hiring right around 500 agents a year, but they're losing 800 a year. And it's a big problem. It's a big problem. We need to retain the agents that we have and we definitely need to hire more. I mean, I can't say it enough. It's been non-stop. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
You've seen it. You've -- you know, I know you have been down there and you see what's going on.
FAULKNER: I was with you, I know. Yes, it's a perfect storm.
DEL CUETO: I don't understand how these politicians don't get it, Harris. I mean, I'm sitting here, you're going -- you have individuals that are in the know. I see individuals that are on Fox News all the time that have worked out here, that have -- you know, they have -- you know they put in their time in.

I'm here explaining it to you guys. And I still see all these politicians that say, "There's no emergency." Come down here. Come down here and see. We need more agents. We need to retain our agents. We need better barrier. There's a lot of in things that we need. The president gets it, but we need everyone else to get on board. And it's just -- it's shameful, it's very shameful that these individuals don't care enough about the American public to actually want to do something.
FAULKNER: All right. Art Del Cueto on a night that the president has signed a veto. You're talking strongly about what you need at the Border Patrol. Some of those experts that on the Hill, lawmakers have said they've been listening to like yourself. Thank you for joining me tonight.
Moments ago, the suspect in that horrific New Zealand terror attack, live streamed for the globe to see made his first court appearance. Details from inside that courtroom. And the Congressman Adam Kinzinger, joins me live on set. There he is he's getting ready for THE STORY. Stay with me.

FAULKNER: Moments ago, the suspect in the heinous New Zealand massacre appearing in court after gunning down 49 worshippers at two separate mosques in the city of Christchurch.
He did not enter a plea and reportedly made a white powder symbol -- power symbol, rather in the courtroom. The country's prime minister has announced just a short time ago that work is underway to confirm the identities of the victims slaughtered as their killer live-streamed their deaths on social media. We've also learned New Zealand Police remain on high alert and the people who live in the city are urged to lock themselves down inside their homes as investigators work to rule out additional threats in the wake of the nation's deadliest mass shooting.

TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR: Harris, the suspect identified himself is 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant or as he would write in his 74-page manifesto "a regular white man from a white family." The self-proclaimed white supremacist went on to indicate that his motivation to kill came during a 2017 trip to France that convinced him the country was under invasion by non-whites.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He went on to write that he always thought the stories of invasion were exaggerated but "once I arrived in France, I found the stories not only to be true but profoundly understated." Then to avenge the attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims, the gunmen armed with two assault rifles and a shotgun drove to the Al-Nour mosque in Christchurch and livestreamed the 17 horrifying minutes of the attack beginning outside the mosque where he shot two men. When one of the men appeared to move, he shot him again.
Then he moved into the prayer room where the worshippers were already cowering in separate corners and fired dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman and his shot point-blank. The shooter then reloads several times then slowly methodically walks toward the wounded and repeatedly shoots them again.

And this part of your resume I want to get in there because you have been all over the world in service of this country and its military so we can really go deep with you on some of the issues. I'm going to get to the politics a little bit later. How does somebody fire 236 shots?

REP. ADAM KINZINGER, R-ILL.: I mean, in the time period, somebody that's just motivated to kill a bunch of people. That'll take whatever. If you have a 30-round clip, eight clips and they just obviously are focused on one thing, and that is inflicting as much injury as humanly possible and death.
FAULKNER: You fought in war. It's almost warlike in his behavior.
KINZINGER: Yes. And it's just -- it's just straight up evil and it's somebody that walks in -- and you know, at least didn't in war, a fight is against an enemy right? Here this is a fight against what, against innocent people praying in church. And it just goes to show that there is deep-seated evil in this person. Something made him snap to this level and it's just heartbreaking.
FAULKNER: Well, and he'd been building up with it. I mean, most of us tonight and the news are walking around with this thing called a manifesto, and he calls it birth rates, birth rates, birth rates, it's all about the birth rates to change. And having more people who are not Muslim and more people who are not people of color. White's making more babies. I mean, that's a manifesto. He's desperate for attention obviously. It's 87 pages. He's streaming live. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How do we fight this new kind of war against those who would do evil against us when they can leverage social media, they can show the world, Congressman, what they do?
KINZINGER: It's tough because you don't know what's in somebody's heart until they begin to show something right? You can be thinking anything you want and we have no technology that can tell what you're thinking so if somebody is developing this deep-seated level of hate in these intentions. You don't know that until they get the first step.
FAULKNER: Until they express it. But he had expressed it so is there anything we can do? You know, Facebook put out a statement to Fox News today that you know, they're looking for these sorts of things. Look, I don't want to over blow it. There are algorithms that can push you out based on how you vote and your values and your politics. Can't we find -- isn't there an algorithm that can find this happening simultaneously? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KINZINGER: Maybe. I guess you'll have to ask the technology folks. But that's the issue, is now you have this information which is good in many ways where people can share information and pictures and you also have work can be done for evil. Somebody -- this man obviously wanted attention and he used these 50 people's deaths to try to make himself sickly famous.
And so the question is do you ban live streaming? Well, you can't really do that because somebody else will come in and do it. The problem is there's a rot in society everywhere in the world where people will do anything for fame and celebrity and where they no longer believe that there is a God of this universe and they have nothing to be accountable to. And when you put those very toxic things together, really bad things happen.
FAULKNER: I want to toggle now to the politics, that the President after signing it a veto so that he can get his border wall funding on the southern border what he's describing as an emergency there. We talked about at this hour. But he also made news when he was asked about whether or not he thought white nationalism was on the rise.
And you know, I just want to get your comments on that. He said I don't think so. We played it just moment ago.
KINZINGER: Well, I certainly think from what I'm seeing, it looks like it's increasing. I think hate of all kinds are increasing and it seems like white nationalism as well. The other problem is now white nationalists can -- they're feeling like you know, they can put out information on the internet and find anybody else that has the kind of belief system they do and they can connect.
FAULKNER: I want to step in real quickly on this. Can we put up the former vice president's tweet today Joe Biden whether it is anti-Semitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes.
Look, an important comment. I'm seeing though other -- he hasn't gotten in, but other 2020 presidential hopefuls getting in and talking tonight. Is this turning into a political topic?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KINZINGER: This is what angers me and it's ludicrous is that tweet it's fine. What I worry about though and others have done it is they're connecting this to President Trump. I mean --
FAULKNER: Are they? I didn't say his name there.
KINZINGER: Literally, literally though, but that's the beginning of what they're trying to do. Literally, this morning as we're getting information that this happened, the discussions on some other networks was --
FAULKNER: I watched you on that network.
KINZINGER: Yes. And it was, does Trump bear responsibility? There's one person that bears responsibility, two maybe. One is the guy that shot, the other is the devil, because for whatever reason, this guy decided to kill 50 people.
It wasn't Donald Trump that told him to do it. Nothing about Trump's policies. But in a desperation to try to connect this, some people are making that jump. It's wrong and it absolutely should be stopped. We have to be way more responsible than that.
FAULKNER: He mentions the president in his 87 manifesto along with Dylann Thomas' words from 1951. There's a lot that he calls into play. Don't go gentle into that. Good night. Congressman Kinsinger, great to see you in person.

KINZINGER: You too.
FAULKNER: Thank you so much for being here, important topics to get to. Some predicted the Mueller report would land this week. Instead, the special counsel filed an extension in federal court today. Ken Starr, independent counsel under President Bill Clinton on what the move could mean for the probe of the president, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
FAULKNER: President fired back one day after the House voted 420 to zero to make the findings of the Mueller report public insisting there should not even be a report. Here now is Ken Starr a former independent counsel under President Clinton, a Fox News Contributor and author of Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation. Good to see you tonight.
I want to start with what it looks like when people start to wrap things up. You pass things on to Robert Ray whom I've had on my daytime show. And so I just want to know. If you're doing things like the lead prosecutor Andrew Weissmann going on to other things that was announced this week. but oppositionally you're putting resources in to fund this probe by Mueller until September, another -- so what does it look like? What did those things mean to you?
KEN STARR, FORMER UNITED STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL: Well, it means they're still wrap-up work to be done. Apparently, he is clearly in a phase-down mode. But it takes a while. It takes weeks and perhaps even months to bring everything to a conclusion, get all the sentencing done and so forth. And of course, he owes his confidential report to the Attorney General. So there's work to do.
FAULKNER: So is there any doubt that we're going to get to see that? I mean, did anybody listen to what at the confirmation hearing, what William Barr said our new A.G. He's been an A.G. before so he knows people are going to be listening and writing down his words. And he said look, I have a good relationship with Robert Mueller. Reportedly that caught some people in the White House by surprise. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And he was sincere about how long they'd known each other and that he fully intended to release it according to rules and regulations. So why 420 trying to get to see it if he already said he'd do it?
STARR: Well, it may be because folks are starting to read the regulations and the regulations bind Bill Barr until he says, I'm doing away with these regulations. The regulations as you know, Harris, requires the special counsel to just present a "confidential report" -- that's a key word isn't it, to the Attorney General.
Then under the regulations, and these are regulations that have been in effect for 20 years and they go back to the Clinton years. Those regulations then call upon the attorney general to notify the Congress with an explanation of certain actions that he took.
The regulations under which Bob Mueller was appointed do not contemplate a report to Congress so it's sort of, my goodness, we have, apparently, just not been aware here at the House of Representatives that there really is no genuine reporting requirement. Now we'll see. The attorney general is very able. He's got a lot of discretion.
FAULKNER: All right. I want to get to this really quickly. March 5th John Brennan said Mueller's last indictments could come Friday. Let's -- which - - that was two weeks ago. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER UNITED STATES CIA DIRECTOR: I wouldn't be surprised if, for example, this week on Friday. Not knowing anything about it. But Friday is the day that the grand jury indictments come down and also this Friday is better than next Friday because next Friday is the 15th of March which is the Ides of March. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I don't think Robert Mueller will want to have that dramatic flair of the Ides of March when he is going to be delivering what I think are going to be his indictments, the final indictments as well as the report that he gives the attorney general.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: Ten days ago, former director of the CIA reading some tea leaves that I must have put in my tea pot. How could he get it so wrong?
STARR: Well, it's speculation and he obviously does not have the gift of prophecy. His prophecy did not come true. And I really do think it doesn't serve the country the American people well when people sit around and I try to avoid making these kinds of frankly idol predictions. It maybe gets viewership interested, but it's not a public service.
FAULKNER: Interesting. Ken Starr, thank you for your perspective and expertise on this. Good to see you tonight.
STARR: Good to see you, Harris.

FAULKNER: Here now Steve Hilton, host of The Next Revelation. Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor. And Richard Fowler, Fox News contributor and nationally syndicated radio host. Good to talk with all of you. You know what, Richard, I'm going to start with you. Because you say that Beto is the man to watch, the candidate to watch. Why?
RICHARD FOWLER, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the reason why Beto is the one to watch is he is young, he is vivacious. He is really -- he really did an amazing job in Texas. Not only he might have lost his race but what he was able to do was to really sort of destroy a lot of the Republican -- a lot of locally Republican elected officials in some of the larger cities.

        }
      
In Houston, for example, there isn't a Republican judge left because thanks to Beto all of the Democratic judges won. So, there is something to be said about his willing -- his ability to fund raise, his vitality and his youth to this race.
FAULKNER: That's interesting young and vivacious. I didn't hear experience. I'm just pointing it out, three terms as congressman. One run at Senate and that's been a word that has been talked about today experience and why is he running? Slate.com Steve Hilton was talking about the fact that they were looking for a reason for Beto 2020 better things, to mean something to that publication. What's your idea on Beto?
STEVE HILTON, HOST: I think that actually we shouldn't subscribe to this idea that I see creeping into the conversation which is that Beto is kind of, you know a bit goofy a bit gangly, he's kind of likeable, a bit empty and thin we don't know where he stands. I think it's much worse than that. I think he is actually one of the most dangerous candidates in the race. That's not because of his policy positions.
Frankly, the position he just outlined on healthcare there is one that I agree with I think on other issues, for example, the border wall, his position is completely wrong. He is an open borders kind of guy. He is ridiculous to have signed up to the green new deal so casually.
But the real point is his character. When you look at the way he behaves, the way he campaigns, interviews, the way he just will say anything to please the person in front of him, that shows a fundamental weakness that I think is really dangerous when you're a president. If you put him in the ring with Xi Jinping he will be knocked over. And I think that's why he is one of the more dangerous candidates in this race.
FAULKNER: Let's hear, Chris, before I come to you from the candidate himself. He has been in Iowa crisscrossing that state as we like to say. And here he is on taxes.

FAULKNER: Chris, I should mention that polling shows that before he announced he was at about 11 percent of that pack of Democrats who were running in terms of popularity or approval. Now he is at 6 percent. What happened?
CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, I don't know which poll there is but I know that he's had in a good -- he's at a good launch here. It worked.
FAULKNER: Yes.
STIREWALT: He got a ton of attention. Democrats really like him. Richard is not at all wrong. This is like -- I believe it was the onion today that said that he was basically an Obama cover band and this is the same --
FAULKNER: Wow. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
STIREWALT: This is the same energy, this is the same attitude gauzy, a blank slate on which you can cast your wishes that O'Rourke is running. But importantly he is also running as civility, as discussion, as hearing people out and all of those things are popular with Democrats particularly with younger Democrats who are fed up with the way the dialogue goes.
Now, whether or not he is adequately liberal to meet the demands of party activists I don't know.
FAULKNER: You know, I'm curious when somebody gets into a race like this and you have and we have had our own Fox News polling look at this, too. You have a Biden and a Sanders who are literally between the two of them soaking up 51 percent or so of the vote. What happens to all those other candidates?
Amy Klobuchar, for instance, senator from Minnesota was talking today about being tough. So, she is trying to define herself. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, D-MINN.: One can always do better. And that means you want to be sure that you are listening to people. If, you know, they felt that something was unfair or they felt bad about something, but I still think that you have to demand good product when you are out there on the world stage and dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, yes, you want someone who is tough. You want someone that demands the answers and that's going to get things done. And that's what I've done my whole life.
FAULKNER: You know, Richard, it seems like she is still dealing with the dings that she took on how tough she is on her staff still trying to explain and give examples of how that toughness is important.
FOWLER: I think that's exactly right, Harris. I think this is exactly what she is trying to do there. But there it's something that Chris brought up I think is very interesting that both Amy Klobuchar has Joe Biden has and Beto has is they have this sort of reasonability sort of things to then I think really resonates with the American voter.
So, if we look at the Fox News voter now since from the last election on the midterm elections we saw that single college educated white women voted two for one for their Democratic Party. In order for the Democratic party to win in 2020 they have to keep those same numbers and having somebody who is reasonable is going to work with those voters which I think all three of these candidates were talking about.
Both Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Beto has. Which I think is sort of some good news for the Democratic base as we go into this prime hotly contested primary season.
FAULKNER: So Beto is about to take another stage in Iowa as that happens. We are also talking about the situation of Jeb Bush today, Chris Stirewalt, talking President Trump needs somebody to primary him. What does he mean by that?
STIREWALT: You know, Jeb Bush -- I'm sure he wouldn't like this comparison, but Jeb Bush is starting to seem an awful lot like Hillary Clinton. Well, he's there --
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: What happened?
STIREWALT: He is the less successful but more serious seeming member of his family dynasty. I think that it sounds like sour grapes when you come back around and he says well, Trump ought to be primaried and I guess I would say to Jeb Bush well then either you do it or not.
Larry Hogan is out there. Larry Hogan is testing the waters. And it might even there is an argument to be made, it might be even good for Trump to have a primary challenge to be in the news so that everybody is not talking about the Democrats the whole time. But whatever the case, Jeb Bush is at the very least an imperfect vessel for a message such as that.
FAULKNER: That's -- I see you trying to get to those nice words. Larry Hogan, by the way, one of the three most popular governors and they are all Republican. Those top three in the nation.
Good to see you all. Steve, I will be watching you Sunday night for The Revolution you always bring. The Stire is on fire and Richard Fowler, thank you.
HILTON: Thanks, Harris.
FAULKNER: Up next, the death of Franky Boy marks the first time in suspected crime family boss was killed in New York City since 1985. And tonight, some say his murder could be connected to perhaps the most notorious mafia family of all time, the Gottis.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
FAULKNER: He was the suspected leader of the Gambino crime family and tonight, investigators are looking into whether the Franky Boy Cali who was murdered outside his New York home this week could be tied to another notorious mobster.
For that let's bring back Trace Gallagher hard at work on “The Story” tonight. Trace, this is like a movie.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: It is. Mario Puzo could have written this, right. Francesco Franky Boy Cali was the first New York family crime bust shot in 34 years. And now police are taking a hard look at whether we might be looking at an internal war for control of the Gambino crime family.
Remember John Gotti, the Teflon don was once the Gambino family boss. But in 1992 his right-hand man Sammy the Bull Gravano testified against Gotti and sent him to prison for life. John Gotti died of cancer in prison in 2002. But his 72-year-old brother Gene Gotti just got out of prison in September.
Gene's top associate John Carneglia got out of prison in August and that's important because Carneglia was reputedly the one who fatally shot then Gambino boss Paul Castellano outside of Spark's steak house in Manhattan back in 1985.
And investigators say there are real similarities between the killing this week of Frank Cali in front of his home on Staten Island and the killing 34 years ago of Castellano outside of Sparks restaurant.
Some believe this is good old fashioned American versus civilian power struggle that could lead to all-out war. And experts say crime families are not reemerging because they never went away. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE PETERS, FEDERAL MAFIA PROSECUTOR: It's still the king after which all most other crime groups are modeled in terms of the hierarchy. It's just that post 9/11 the FBI's attention and the nations went to preventing terrorism and dealing with that. So, the mafia was able to sort of go underneath the cover, so to speak and still operate, still be powerful and still grow.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Other experts say it's possible that Gene Gotti might believe he is the natural heir to the throne but the Caecilians are not about to sick back and hand it to them, Harris.
FAULKNER: That was such an important part of “The Story” where have they been for 34 years and why the FBI might be triggered to watch them more closely.
Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.
GALLAGHER: Sure.
FAULKNER: Up next, breaking news on Senator Cory Booker's love life. Yes. We're not digging for this stuff, people. He is bringing it. What the 2020 candidate just said about his own romance with an actress. What? Ladies night. Come on, girls. There they are.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: What would you like to ask me about? I'm sorry. She is a wonderful actor?
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you like to confirm her statement?
BOOKER: I am dating Rosario Dawson and I'm very happy about that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: I love, love. Twenty-twenty Democratic presidential hopeful Cory Booker happily confirming his rumored romance with actress Rosario Dawson today. She also spoke about relationship this week describing her affection for the New Jersey senator this way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROSARIO DAWSON, ACTRESS: I am just grateful to be with someone that I respect and love and admire so much who is so brilliant and kind and caring.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: And it is ladies night on a Friday. Here are Lisa Booth, Rochelle Ritchie. and Susan Li. Good to see you, ladies. So, my question is, in 2019, when the last time we saw a single president was 1885.
LISA BOOTHE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.
FAULKNER: Is it necessary for a guy to roll with a date?
BOOTHE: No. I don't think it's necessary. But I do think it could get a little awkward, Harris, because remember Rosario Dawson has done stump speeches for Bernie Sanders. She has been in the Bernie Sanders camp. I assume now she is team Cory Booker, otherwise it could get really awkward.
FAULKNER: You assume.
BOOTHE: Well, this shouldn't be surprising for anything, or for anyone. Hollywood and the left are already basically dating so they might as well, you know --
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: Wow.
BOOTHE: -- be actually dating in real life. I hope he never becomes president but I wish him success in his love life. Everybody needs love.
ROCHELLE RITCHIE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I was really surprised that she came out on TMZ and announced that they were dating before he did.
FAULKNER: Why?
RITCHIE: Because the reason it's because we have to understand that if she were to become first lady she is going to be under a lot of pressure and scrutiny. Her family is going to expose, as Lisa mentioned, you know, the fact that she -- she was arrested, right, on Capitol Hill.
BOOTHE: On Capitol Hill.
RITCHIE: Those kinds of things are going to come to light. I think he has to be a little cautious of how far he wants to expose their relationship.
SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT: Hey, in this era of the bachelor I feel like everyone loves reality TV.
FAULKNER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It shows -- as my mom said back in the day, if he doesn't put a ring on it, you know, you don't get to go some of the places that he does. So, can she be first lady if she is just the girlfriend.
LI: I think so.
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: I don't know.
LI: I mean, there are have been single --
FAULKNER: I don't know about that. Right. Back in the 19 -- in the 1800s.
LI: People don't have to get married. They want to have kids.
BOOTHE: Maybe first girlfriend though. Not first lady, right?
RITCHIE: First girlfriend. She would be the first person --
FAULKNER: All right. So, but women have been on his mind, always on his -- I won't sing it. This week Cory Booker then doubled down because he had suggested he would like to see a woman on his ticket. He was looking for a woman who put on his ticket and then he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOOKER: I'm looking you in the eye and saying this. There will be a woman on the ticket. I don't know if it's in the vice president's position or the president's position.
(APPLAUSE)
BOOKER:
But if I have my way, there will be a woman on the ticket.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: I can do a little math. So, if she is on top the ticket where is he? Is he already thinking he can't get through the primary season?
BOOTHE: Or, you know, maybe he's thinking V.P. But I just, I feel like this is just kind of -- I don't like this stuff.
FAULKNER: Why?
BOOTHE: It's just identity politics. I mean, Cory Booker is just trying to check off the boxes. Why not just have the person who is the best fit for the vice presidency alongside of you who complements you the most. I just think it's sort of desperate and pandering for it to be, it has to be a woman yadda, yadda, yadda. Like who cares. Just pick the best person.
RITCHIE: This is an area where Lisa and I actually agree on something.
BOOTHE: There you go. It's on Friday.
RITCHIE: I also don't like the idea of pandering. I think that he should pick the V.P. if he were to get the nomination obviously from the DNC. Pick the best person to run on the ticket with you. And I think this happens a lot. And as someone who is an independent but a more moderate Democrat.
It bothers me when I hear some of these candidates pander not only to women but also to pander to black voters. I listen to Tupac. I listen to Snoop Dogg.
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: Well, Kamala Harris was listening to and kind of doing some things before he was actually making music.
RITCHIE: Well, let me clarify that or I have hot sauce in my bag. Remember that from Clinton, I was really offended by that.
FAULKNER: Wow.
LI: I think the Democrats are calling for either a minority candidate or possibly a woman. I mean, just give them what they want. Isn't be giving what they want --
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: So, can I pause for one second with you, though, Susan. I mean, inevitability is what beat the party with Hillary Clinton. You've you got to let somebody come along and build their own following. You can't just do it because you think you've arrived.
LI: Right. Well, tell that to Beto O'Rourke, right? I mean, isn't he the example of it.
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: He's not a woman. We are talking about women.
BOOTHE: Didn't he say I was born to run or --
FAULKNER: He did say that.
RITCHIE: That's right.
FAULKNER: I wonder if Springsteen wants his song back.
RITCHIE: You have to be careful depending on the V.P. that you pick because look at what happened with McCain and Sarah Palin. He lost like more than I think what, a million or two million votes because people just did not like her.
FAULKNER: All right. Well, we don't have a lot of time here. I just want to go around the table lightning round right now. This school scandal is amazing.
BOOTHE: Geez.
FAULKNER: This school scandal is amazing. Felicity Huffman, and Lori Loughlin getting dumped by Hallmark this week. Her daughter says he faked his way through college. Your thoughts?
BOOTHE: It bothers me so much that her daughter Olivia Jade had deals with Sephora and Tresemme when she has literally done nothing in her life at age 19.
FAULKNER: Life and more.
BOOTHE: Talking about all she wanted to do is party in college didn't want to study. She's literally accomplished nothing and she has a million followers on YouTube and Instagram and leveraged those in the deal that bothers me.
FAULKNER: Well, and she says --
(CROSSTALK)
RITCHIE: Her dog has a million followers on YouTube.
FAULKNER: She says her dad faked his way through college.
LI: And so, what, two wrongs make a right? I think USC should just expel her. Let her earn her way into a school. And you know, her parents actually earned their way from no education so why can't she learn that way?
RITCHIE: Look I think what happened is obviously horrific but I also think that when I looked at the statement, she was saying that her father was sort of lying to his parents about what he was doing with his tuition money.
FAULKNER: Wow. OK. Legacy. We'll see how it works out. They're all just alleged and accusations.
BOOTHE: It's true.
FAULKNER: Lisa, Rochelle, and Susan, have a fabulous weekend.
BOOTHE: Thank you, Harris.
RITCHIE: Thank you.
FAULKNER: Thank you for being with me. That's it for “The Story” on this Friday night. I'll see you again Monday, "Outnumbered" at noon Eastern. Have a great weekend.
