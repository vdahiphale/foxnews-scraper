'Off the Record,' 5/30/14: Shinseki did the honorable thing by resigning in the VA scandal. But many - including Pres. Obama, Congress and we in the media - failed our vets

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. In the last few days, I have been outraged at President Obama. In 2008, he campaigned on fixing the V.A. for the vets. Remember this?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
THEN-SEN. BARACK OBAMA: No more homeless veterans, no more begging for disability payments. No more waiting in line for the V.A. We have a solemn obligation. To honor those who have served on our behalf. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Why didn't he? He promised.
Now I have also been outraged at General Shinseki. How could he not know about the problems and fix them? He was the head of the V.A. and that was his job. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How about Congress? They have committees to provide oversight of the V.A. What in the world have they been doing? Nothing?
Pretty rotten, huh? None of the foregoing was doing his job or keeping his promise to the very people, the veterans, who have put their lives on the line for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then today, as I was recycling in my mind, my outrage, I suddenly thought, where was I? I have a huge platform, prime time TV show, a blog, hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. Why didn't I help? I was around in 2008. Have I been asleep at the wheel? Isn't that the purpose of the media, to inform people and to hold our government accountable? I'm not very happy with myself tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment.  </pre>
