Watchdog group suing over Canadian oil political link

In the Pipeline
Environmental and ethics watchdog groups are suing the State Department over documents relating to a proposed oil p ipeline that would link Canada's oil sands to refineries in the U.S. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The groups want copies of any communications between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trans Canada lobbyist Paul Elliott, who was a deputy campaign director for Clinton's failed 2008 presidential run. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The complaint argues it's a potential conflict of interest that Clinton's State Department is heading the multi-agency environmental review of the project. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The State Department is not commenting.
On Notice 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Some Democratic Jewish donors have warned President Obama's re-election campaign that he may be alienating the Jewish community with his handling of Israel.
And this was before today's Middle East speech. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Wall Street Journal talked with supporters who are concerned President Obama has pushed Israeli leaders too hard on settlements and peace negotiations and has not yet visited the country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All of those issues are sure to come up when President Obama addresses the Israeli lobby, AIPAC on Sunday.
Politico reports an e-mail was sent to AIPAC members titled -- quote -- "welcoming guests into our home." It included a request for people to react to every speech in -- quote -- "only the most positive manner," which Politico took to mean don't boo the president.
Apparently AIPAC has sent out similar e-mails for the past three years. Again, before today's speech. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Game On
And finally, cadets at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs are hoping a dodge-ball game will get them into the Guinness book of world records.
More than 36,000 cadets took part Wednesday throwing 1,250 balls. They should learn if Guinness accepts the new world record in a few days. Good Luck!  </pre>
