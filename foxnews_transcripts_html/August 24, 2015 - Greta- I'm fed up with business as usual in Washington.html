'Off the Record,' 8/24/15: We should demand that all US senators and representatives sign an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that before they vote on Pres. Obama's Iran deal, that they attest to have read the entire agreement

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I don't know about you, but I'm so fed up with Capitol Hill and the way they make the proverbial sausage up there. It's time to shake things up, exert the power of the people.
So here is my idea. This is a one-time deal. Because of the magnitude of the decision, Americans should demand that before any senator or member of the House votes for or against President Obama's Iran nuclear deal that each of them sign, under penalty of perjury, an affidavit attesting that he or she has actually read the entire nuclear deal. Not part of it, but all of it - and understands it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This Iran deal is not naming a post office. It's about nuclear weapons. No more just taking orders from party leadership on how to vote - that's just being a cow in a herd. We didn't vote for cows in herds. We voted for representatives to make learned decisions for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Why a signed affidavit? I don't know about you, but when it comes to Capitol Hill, I am so over the honor system for them. We need to hold their feet to the fire. I'm not telling anyone to vote yes or no. That's your business as a constituent to do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I am saying this to members of Congress on something this important, at least do your jobs. Read it before you vote. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
