              <h2>Despite megastardom, Céline Dion and her husband René Angélil were always so gracious and friends of 'On the Record.' Angélil has died after a long cancer battle.</h2>

Let's all go "Off the Record." My heart bleeds tonight for Celine Dion. Her husband of more than 21 years, Rene, died today in their home in Vegas.
I first met Celine and Rene years ago when I went to Vegas to interview her for "On the Record." She was a giant star, the biggest star I had ever met. But she sure doesn't act that way. She is incredibly gracious and so is Rene. Where I come from, you describe them as "normal." That's a huge compliment. Not the least bit pretentious. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
After our interview, Rene showed us around and Celine wowed the audience with her beautiful voice audience like only Celine has. She has been a really good friend to "On the Record," even calling in the first week we launched to the earlier hour at 7:00 p.m. That's who she is. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As much as it was to hear her in concert and call in to our show launch, what I admire most about Celine and Rene in celebrity culture of today they are old-fashioned. They loved each other a lot. So tonight, let me report how I started this "Off the Record" - my heart bleeds for Celine. Her heart is broken. But we can only hope she would say my heart will go on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
