TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. Today is the anniversary of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.Thousands of Americans died. That was the day that we entered the SecondWorld War. It seems like a good time to consider the threats this country faces now,79 years later. At the top of the list of threats, anyone in Washingtonwill tell you and has, is Russia. Russia has penetrated our government.Russia threatens our democracy. Russia works tirelessly to subvert oureconomy and our way of life. Since the day Donald Trump was elected in 2016, they have told us this.They are endlessly complex, serialized collusion hoax dominated our publicconversation for years. Of course, it was a lie and we're all aware of that. Russia never had the power or the money to control our government, andthere's no evidence they even tried. But that doesn't mean and this is thekey that there was no collusion. In fact, there was collusion. Top leaders in American government andbusiness have been compromised by a foreign power that seeks to undermineour country and our democratic system. It turns out that many of the very people who ranted so hysterically aboutRussia were even as they were doing it, even as they were yelling aboutVladimir Putin. In fact, they were doing precisely what they claim todecry. They were working on behalf of a foreign power, our chief globalrival, the government of China. The Russia hoax effectively was a diversion. It hid something that is not ahoax at all, but it is real and threatening to all of us. We're going tospend the foreseeable future reporting on the relationship betweenAmerica's political and financial elites and the communist government ofChina that has made many of them very rich. But we want to start tonight with evidence, with a remarkable video. Thisvideo was recorded a little over a week ago on November 28th. The manyou're about to see speak is a professor from Beijing called Di Dongsheng.The video comes from an appearance that he made on a Chinese televisionshow about Wall Street and international trade. Di Dongsheng works at Renmin University in Beijing. He is also like so manyin academia in China, a servant of his country's government. This video wasdeleted from Chinese social media soon after being uploaded. And there's areason for that, as you'll see. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DI DONGSHENG, PROFESSOR, RENMIN UNIVERSITY (TEXT):  The Trumpadministration is in a trade war with us, so why can't we fix the Trumpadministration? Why between 1992 and 2016 did China and U.S. used to beable to settle all kinds of issues? No matter what kind of crises weencountered be it the Yinhe incident, the bombing of the embassy or thecrashing of the plane. Things were resolved in no time, like (a couple) do with their quarrelsstarting at the bedhead and ending at the bed end. We fixed everything in two months. What is reason? I am going to throw outsomething maybe a little bit explosive here. It's just because we havepeople at the top. At the top of America's core inner circle of power and influence, we haveour old friends. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  There's a lot of garbage floating around on the internet rightnow, a lot of fake things. That video is real and those subtitles areaccurate. We checked today with two different Chinese speakers andconfirmed that. What he just said, what you just read on the screen tells the story. Thisis as close to a smoking gun as we have ever seen. Quote, "We have peopleat the top of America's core inner circle of power and influence."According to the man who just saw that has been true for decades. So who are these people? And how many of them work in our media and in ourgovernment? Well, he didn't say precisely. At one point in the video hedescribed a Chinese agent working as a Vice President at a quote, "a topWall Street financial institution." I can't say more, he explained withoutmaking political trouble. Di Dongsheng did tell his audience that one agent in particular wasespecially useful. He goes on at some length about her. He describes her asan American who's lived abroad for many years, who is now a Chinesecitizen, and this seems to baffle him a little bit. The Chinese government doesn't allow dual citizenship. Why would they? Whywould anyone? Di Dongsheng seems pleased that the U.S. government isfoolish enough to allow it. He explains that this American agent who lives at least part of the year inBeijing, helped the Chinese government with a propaganda operation in theCity of Washington in 2015. And he goes on to describe that in some detail.The Obama administration was easy to manipulate, he suggests. They helped.The Chinese had many friends among the Obama people. The problem came when Donald Trump was elected. After that, he says,everything changed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONGSHEHG (TEXT):  for the past 30 years, 40 years, we have been utilizingthe core power of the United States. As I said before, since the 1970s,Wall Street had a very strong influence on the domestic affairs of theUnited States, so we had a channel to rely on. But the problem is that after 2008, the status of Wall Street has declinedand more importantly, after 2016, Wall Street can't fix Trump. Why? Trumphad a previous soft default issue with Wall Street, so there was a conflictbetween them, but I won't go into the details. So during the U.S.-China trade war, they (Wall Street) tried to help and Iknow that, my friends on the U.S. side told me that they tried to help, butthey couldn't do much. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Since the 1970s, he said, and he's an Economics Professor, youshould know, Wall Street has had enormous influence over the way the UnitedStates government operates over American policy. The Chinese government, he says has enormous influence on Wall Street andthat arrangement worked very well for a long time. Then Donald Trumpunexpectedly was elected in 2016 and Wall Street was infuriated. Wall Street can't fix Trump, he said, but they tried. And this solves themystery. If you're wondering why our political class has stood by and allowed theChinese government to degrade this country and our way of life, why theystood by as the Chinese government has flooded the United States withdeadly opioids that have killed hundreds of thousands of people, or havestood by as the Chinese government ripped off billions in intellectualproperty from our companies. There's your answer. Earlier this year, the Chairman of Harvard's Chemistry Department wasarrested for taking $50,000.00 a month from the Communist Party of China inreturn for sending secrets and referring top scientists to Beijing. Itbarely rated as a scandal, you may not even be aware it happened. Why?Because so many are on the take in effect. Donald Trump was an impediment to this very lucrative arrangement. And forthat reason, Di Dongsheng explains in the video, America's most powerfulelites -- and he calls them that -- got to work on electing a newPresident. Again, read the words at the bottom of your screen as he speaks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONGSHENG (TEXT):  But now, we're seeing Biden was elected, the traditionalelite, the political elite, the establishment. They're very close to WallStreet, so you see that, right? Trump has been saying that Biden's son has some sort of global foundation.Have you noticed that? Who helped him (Biden's son) build the foundation?Got it? There are a lot of deals in all these. Then, so, at such a time, we use anappropriate way to express some goodwill ... (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Donald Trump, he notes because the Chinese do pay close attentionto what we say here, Donald Trump has complained about Hunter Biden and histies to the Chinese government. Those are real, he just confirms. So now you know why you weren't allowed to talk about Hunter Biden'slaptop. Why big business aligned as one, the tech companies and the rest tosuppress that story because they were implicated in it. Back in October, we interviewed a man called Tony Bobulinski. Weinterviewed him because no one else would. Tony Bobulinski was a businesspartner of the Biden's. Here's what he told us about China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER BUSINESS AFFILIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN:  And in adocument that you guys have, and I think it's been provided to, you know,to the world, the Chinese referenced that because of their trust in theBiden family, that Chairman Yi and Director Zhang are excited about movingforward in this. And in that document, they reference loaning $5 million to the BD family. CARLSON:  Right. BOBULINSKI:  The BD family is the Biden family. CARLSON:  What are the implications of this going forward? If Joe Biden iselected President, which could very well happen? How does this constrainhis ability to deal with China? BOBULINSKI:  Are you asking for my personal opinion? CARLSON:  I am. I am asking for your opinion as someone who has worked withthe Chinese. BOBULINSKI:  So I think Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  I think Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised withChina. Looks like he was right about that. And it looks like the Biden'sare far from the only ones who've been compromised. Gordon Chang has been covering this story for an awfully long time. He's aSenior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute. He's the author of "The GreatU.S.-China Tech War." Earlier today, he vetted that video you just saw forus and confirmed it was real. We're happy about that. Gordon Chang joins us tonight. Gordon, thanks so much for coming on. GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE:  Thank you. CARLSON:  To those of us who don't follow this full time as you do and whodon't speak Mandarin, this is a shocking admission of what is happeninghere. Tell us what you make of it. CHANG:  There is incredible arrogance among the Chinese elites. And that'swhat I take away from this video. You know, there are a number of instances that Di talks about and I don'tknow if they're actually true or not. But the point is that this is whatChinese leaders think and because they think that way, they're going topush a President Biden around. They're going to do things which aredangerous, because we're going to have to push back. Under President Trump, the Chinese didn't try this because they were afraidof him. So what I'm concerned about is the state of mind of China, we seethis from Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, all the way down to this DiDongsheng. This is dangerous. CARLSON:  So he is out there less than a month after our presidentialelection saying essentially, we admit it, we are in control, our friends inthe business community in the United States, Wall Street, specifically areon our side, over and against the U.S. government itself, the currentpresidential administration, and we pull the strings. Do you think that'sbragging? To what extent is that true? CHANG:  Well, that part of the video is true. What I was referring to wasthe politics and prose incident, which is very interesting. But in terms ofthe most important points that Di makes, that's absolutely true that Chinadoes have that relationship into what he calls the core circle of America'sreal power. And they used that during the Obama administration and prioradministrations, and they couldn't do it during the Trump administration,that much we know. And I know that they are in anticipation, licking their chops about what'sgoing to happen from January 20th on. CARLSON:  It's just -- it's an amazing, amazing story. Were you surprisedthat he said this on camera in front of a live audience? CHANG:  That actually took me by surprise because what he was making werethose admissions, which really go to the core of the China-U.S.relationship. And I think that what President Trump can do, whether he has 40 days orfour years, is to break some of those connections. He can do it with theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. He can even maybe usethe Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. But we've got to break thoseconnections. Because if we don't do that, we are going into a point where we may not beable to deter China because they are so arrogant, so belligerent that theythink they can buy any American politician including the President of theUnited States, and therefore as I mentioned, they are going to be temptedto do something that cannot be unwound. CARLSON:  It cannot be unwound, nicely put. Gordon Chang, I appreciate yourcoming on tonight. Thank you. CHANG:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  So last week in "The Wall Street Journal," there was a kind ofremarkable op-ed stating as clearly as anyone has ever stated the nature ofthe threat that we face from China. The op-ed was written by someone whowould know, the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. He called the Communist Party of China, quote, "The greatest threat todemocracy and freedom worldwide since World War II." It's an amazing pieceworth your time if you haven't read it. In just a moment, we will haveDirector Ratcliffe on to discuss that. He wrote this, quote, "The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends todominate the United States and the rest of the planet economically,militarily and technologically. I call its approach of economic espionage,'rob, replicate and replace. China robs U.S. companies of theirintellectual property, replicates the technology and then replaces the U.S.firms in the global marketplace." Now, those aren't simply legal disputes, they have actual consequences formillions of American workers on our standard of living and what your kidswill do for a living. Ratcliffe noted that in 2018, a Chinese wind turbinemanufacturer ripped off trade secrets from a Massachusetts basedinfrastructure company called American Semiconductor. As a direct result of that theft, American Semiconductor lost over abillion dollars in value and had to cut 700 jobs. Now, it didn't happenbecause the company American Semiconductor was careless. It happenedbecause they were the victim of theft. That's happening everywhere, including in The Pentagon. According toRatcliffe, quote, "China also steals sensitive U.S. defense technology tofuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive plan to make China the world'sforemost military power. U.S. intelligence shows that China has evenconducted human testing on members of the People's Liberation Army in thehope of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities. Thereare no ethical boundaries to Beijing's pursuit of power." Remarkable. We know where this is leading and Ratcliffe's op-ed spells out,quote, "Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation withthe United States. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must workacross partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly andtake action to address it." John Ratcliffe is the Director of National Intelligence, the man with moreintelligence before him than anyone on the globe apart from the President,we're happy to have him on tonight. Director, thanks so much for coming on. JOHN RATCLIFFE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  Tucker, good to seeyou. CARLSON:  So, you spelled this out so clearly that it made me wonder whythe rest of us, so many in our public life, haven't been saying this forquite some time. You make it sound obvious. RATCLIFFE:  Well, I think you did a good job of encapsulating why Tucker.There are a lot of people who for economic reasons, don't want China to beour greatest threat. There are a lot of people who for political reasons,don't want China to be our greatest threat in America. But the intelligence doesn't lie. China is our greatest threat. And it'snot even close. No other country has the capability of essentially takingaway the American dream and a specific plan to do so and the intelligenceis clear. So, Tucker, I wanted to use the unique vantage point that I have to makesure, you know, as the Director of National Intelligence, my job is to warnthe American people of threats, and there is no greater threat than Chinato America. CARLSON:  The most jarring part of the piece, I thought was yourdescription of the massive ramp up of the Chinese military, and from yourtelling, not necessarily for defensive purposes. What do you think theiraim is? RATCLIFFE:  Well, again, dominate militarily, technologically, andeconomically. On the military front, they've already achieved having thelargest Navy of any country in the world. From a military force standpoint,the People's Republic of China has a military of two million. They want them to be the largest, and they also want them to be thestrongest, which is why they're engaged in what you referenced, which iscalled gene editing, literally trying to alter the DNA experimenting on DNAto make soldiers, sailors and airmen stronger and more powerful. CARLSON:  That's horrifying. Do you think Beijing anticipates some kind ofphysical confrontation with the United States in the next several years? RATCLIFFE:  Well, here's the funny thing, Tucker, China knows at this pointthat the United States is still the world's superpower. They know they'recatching us in all of those respects. They're banking on the fact that we're not going to do anything until theyare superior in all those respects. You know, great generals always say, itis better to fight downhill. Right now, the United States can fight downhill against China. We don'tever want to be in a position where we're looking up at China and all ofthe plans that they have, all of the initiatives: Made in China, thedigital Silk Road, Belt and Road Initiative -- those are all thin veneersand facades for which China is going around the world and essentiallygaining the influence power to become the world's superpower and supplantthe United States in that role. CARLSON:  We heard a lot over the past four years about Russia's ability tobreak into John Podesta's Gmail account. To the extent you can, to theextent it's not classified, give us a sense of Chinese penetration into ournetworks, government networks. RATCLIFFE:  Well, it's significant and growing every day. And Tucker, youmade a great point in your opening about Russia. Listen, they are adangerous adversary. I don't mean to minimize them. But you made the pointcorrectly about economically, Russia can't compete the way China can. The largest economy in the world is the United States. The second largestis China. Russia is not in the top 10. Italy, Brazil and the State of Texashave a larger economy than Russia. So as dangerous as Russia can be, theycannot compete with us the way China is, and China has a very specific planto do that, and one of the ways that China has made their way to the top isthey understand that information is the key to their dominance, so they'regoing to get there any way they possibly can. That's what subsidizing Huawei and ZTE is all about. Those are Chinesecompanies that are run by the Chinese government. They know that they cansteal more information if they run the telecommunications networks overwhich our information travels. That's one of the ways that China has gottenso good in terms of getting into our networks and into our informationsociety. CARLSON:  We've been asleep. Thank you for helping to wake people up. JohnRatcliffe, Director of National Intelligence. RATCLIFFE:  You bet. Great to be with you, Tucker. Thanks. CARLSON:  Next time you hear someone describe Russia or Turkey or Iran asthe greatest threat we face, laugh in their face because they deserve it. So there's this thing that happens in Washington where people go to servein the Congress and they make 200 grand a year or something, but they seemto get rich at the same time. How do they do that? How did Ilhan Omar makeall that money? Maxine Waters? She seems rich. How did that happen? We willinvestigate how that happened. Also new information about who is going to be first in line to get thecoronavirus vaccine and who might be last. Candace Owens responds to thosestories straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  All of a sudden you're hearing Democrats, from the party ofscience -- we are including, by the way, the governor of our biggest statein this category -- demand that we distribute the coronavirus vaccine onthe basis of skin color. That's not science, of course, it's somethingbeneath science, but they're saying it. One professor of something called Global Health Law at Georgetown explainedit this way, quote, "Having a racial preference for a COVID-19 vaccine isnot only ethically permissible, but I think it's an ethical imperative." Okay, there's just one problem with this plan. Many Americans of all skincolors don't actually want the vaccine, regardless of what Democrats inCalifornia or Washington, D.C. tell them they should want. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  The COVID vaccines really can't come soonenough, but they are coming and there's a hurdle convincing Americans thatthey will be safe to take. Many are expressing hesitancy, particularly in some black and Latinocommunities. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To stress in communities of color is not just a smalltown problem, it is nationwide. A study conducted in September exploringthe issue in black and Latino communities found just 14 percent of blackpeople and only 34 percent of Latinos trust a vaccine will be safe. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  The media makes everything about race always, but it's not justthose, quote "communities" that have concerns about the vaccine. Why are wehaving a conversation about race as it relates to a vaccine? What do thetwo have to do with each other? Candace Owens is the author of "Blackout: How Black America can make itsSecond Escape from the Democratic Plantation." She joins us with reactionto the story. Candace, great to see you tonight. I mean, if there were some scientificevidence that this was a race specific disease, like -- I mean, and thereare diseases that are, it would be one thing, but Africa has been basicallyuntouched. So we know that it's not, what the hell is this? CANDACE OWENS, AUTHOR, "BLACKOUT":  That's a very good question. I reallywant to talk about the apprehension, especially among black Americansregarding this vaccine because it's not at all imagined when it comes tojust historical data that we have and Americans watching this right now canlook it up on the C.D.C. website the Tuskegee experiment. I talked about this actually with my grandfather over Thanksgiving, thelast time the government said, we're going to focus a vaccine on blackAmericans. It was for syphilis. They selected about 600 black American men,and it turned out that they were actually giving them a placebo pill ratherthan actually treating them for syphilis because they wanted to seesyphilis to its natural end. This experiment went on for 40 years. It's not a secret anymore. BillClinton apologized for it in 1997 and said that this was the immorality ofthe government. Now, I'm not at all suggesting that this is what the vaccine forcoronavirus is. I'm not at all suggesting that they are seeking toexperiment on black Americans, but I am saying that if you're looking totransform the pain of individuals, and to relieve them of theseapprehensions, maybe take an opposite approach, rather than single outpeople because of their race and say we're going to give it to you first,maybe just look at this from an equal standpoint and say, if we're actuallytrying to help, we should never be racializing medicine that makeseverybody uncomfortable. The government is trying to put a racial identity behind this and it'smaking too many people uncomfortable. If their ultimate goal is to help, weshouldn't be looking at it in that manner. CARLSON:  De-racializing medicine. Exactly. Nicely put. Now, I want to askyou about this, it is a story out of Washington. Some Democrats in Congresshave, it turns out, found a way on not very big salaries to make theirfamilies pretty rich. No one has done this better than Ilhan Omar. She paid her husband'sconsulting company more than two million bucks just this year. That's ontop of the $630,000.00 the firm received in Federal bailout money. In the State of California, Maxine Waters managed to funnel 240 grand fromher campaign to her daughter for quote, "Get Out to Vote services." MaxineWaters already lives in a 6,000 square foot mansion in LA that's worth morethan four million bucks. Kind of weird for someone who spent 40 years in government. I've got to askyou, and by the way, they are far from the only ones in Washington who aredoing this, that's for sure. But how do people who work in the Congress,look the rest of us straight in the face and say, yes, I got rich, but it'sfine. How does that work? OWENS:  And it's especially frustrating when you're looking at Democratsbecause they love playing the poor card, right? They are going to helpimpoverished communities. We have to go and find the rich white men and saythey are stealing money from us, and then nobody questions them and theirfinances. And it's especially egregious coming from somebody who is so openlysocialist like Ilhan Omar and her squad who stood on a platform, especiallyduring the COVID-19 when the government was giving out money to companies.They stood out and they said, look, all of these rich companies are takingthe money they should return the funds. Well, was Ilhan Omar going to -- is her husband going to return the fundsthat he received from the COVID-19 Relief Fund? I mean, this is ridiculousstuff. And nobody ever calls them out. I mean, this should guarantee that she is never elected ever again. Butwhat it really shows you, Tucker, if Democrats are looking to figure outwhy they lost so many House seats in this election is because America isawake to their lives. They're no longer buying it. They understand that the Democrats themselves are corrupt and are greedydespite the fact that they're calling everybody else by those names. CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, Maxine Waters said -- and I think we have theclip here -- just told us that she has no tolerance of any kind forfinancial misdeeds. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION:  Do you believe that money laundering has been a significant partof President Trump's business? REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA):  I know that there are a lot of rumors. We needto learn more about the finances of the President of the United States, andhe is hiding that information from us. We need to delve deeper into thatand find out what is going on and whether or not money laundering has beeninvolved and whether or not their connection with the oligarchs of Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  And that buffoon on CNBC, very seriously -- how seriously, do youtake this? OWENS:  I mean, this is, accuse the other side of what you are doing,right? Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals and they do this over and over andover again. It is ridiculous. Just imagine, in the case of Ilhan Omar as you just brought up earlier, ifDonald J. Trump incorporated for President was paying millions of dollarsin consultancy fees to Donald Trump, Jr. They would lose their minds andyet nobody is calling for them to answer for her paying money to herdaughter, Maxine Waters and Ilhan Omar funneling cash to her husband. This is ridiculous and it's corrupt and someone should be made to answerfor it. CARLSON:  Yes, it's gone on for a long time, too. Candace Owens, great tosee you tonight. Thank you. OWENS:  Thanks. CARLSON:  So it turns out corona law really is the law. Governments in alot of places is threatening to fine you if you don't comply with coronalaw. You're not a politician. You have to follow the rules. But one man in government has decided "no mas." We will speak to him next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well coronavirus lockdowns have been enforced across the country,but they have not been enforced fairly or evenly, and the effects ofcourse, have not been fairly distributed. Some people have gotten muchricher and happier. Under corona law, many others have been destroyed. This week, one comptroller in New York State finally had enough. Hethreatened to quote, "freeze and close the Health Department's bankingaccounts immediately." Why? Watch him explain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEFAN MYCHAJLIW, ERIE COUNTY COMPTROLLER:  I've also established areasonable payment plan for businesses as well. They're hurting and I'mtrying to help them get through this crisis. So on the low end of the scale, if they're hit with a $1,000.00 fine orless, they have 20 years to pay it back. Anyone with a $15,000.00 COVIDrelated fine or more, they have 100 years to pay it back. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So we've got millions of people out of the workforce, millionsmore who are semi-employed and barely hanging on and the county of Erie isthreatening and in some cases actually fining people. Stephen Mychajliw decided enough. He is the comptroller of Erie County. Youjust saw him. He joins us tonight. Stephen, thanks so much for coming on. MYCHAJLIW:  Thank you, greatly appreciate it. CARLSON:  So, yes, am I mischaracterizing this? People are already hurting.You saw these fines and you decided to step in and alleviate, basically thefines. What happened after you did that? MYCHAJLIW:  That's correct. I mean, as county comptroller, I control all ofthe accounts for the county of Erie, and people are fed up. I mean, I'm theson of Polish and Ukrainian immigrants that came to America the right way.They fled a communist regime. And a lot of people on the radical left areturning our country into the same communist regime that my family fled. And I'm hearing from businesses every day. And what happened, Tucker, wasthat there's a gym owner, Robert Dinero, he owns Athletes Unleashed inOrchard Park, New York. He wasn't even open. His gym was closed and he hada private meeting with other business owners talking about how they canfight this back. And then, comes a health inspector barging in with police, and the nextday, they fined him $15,000.00. And so, I'm fed up. I'm angry. And I saidenough. And so we froze the Health Department's ability to make deposits on COVIDfines. And yes, as comptroller, I have the authority to come up with a 100-year payment plan for those businesses that were fined because they arehurting over coronavirus rules. The people on the extreme left are makingup for other people for small businesses who are hurting and they don'tfollow the rules themselves. And so I'm angry, I'm fed up and I put my foot down. CARLSON:  What I love so much about the story is, every day we hear electedofficials say I'm helping people and usually they are just lecturingpeople. You're actually helping people in measurable ways. What was the reactionfrom other parts of government in the State of New York when you did that? MYCHAJLIW:  The radical left attacked me, which is right out of theirplaybook: if you don't stand on the issues, you attack the person andthat's fine. I wear it like a badge of honor. Our local newspaper even wrote an editorial that basically accused me ofkilling people for helping businesses when it comes to their fines. I mean, in New York State, it really makes no sense that everything has toclose at 10 o'clock. And coronavirus is so smart that it won't attack youin a restaurant at 9:59. But look out at 10:01, you'll be stricken with it. I mean, children are least susceptible to it, and yet they're closingschools. And then Governor Cuomo is putting six seniors stricken with COVIDinto nursing homes. And so the radical left is not happy. But I wear it like a badge of honor and I fight for these businesses.They're losing their livelihood, and we're also losing our freedoms in ourcountry. CARLSON:  Amen. And you, almost alone among elected officials, I'mincluding a lot of people who should know better and have done nothing tohelp. You did something to help. I think it is heroic. Stephen Mychajliw, appreciate it. Thank you. MYCHAJLIW:  I mean, we even had to set up a GoFundMe for this gym owner,and if people go to Freedom Before Fear.dom they can donate to help him withhis $15,000.00 fine. I mean, it's outrageous that you can go to a Big Boxstore and you won't catch coronavirus. But you can't go to a church or youcan't go to your barber shop or you can't go to a restaurant. So having that hammer in my office, I'm willing to flex it. I mean, what'sthe point of having the authority if you're not going to use it to helpbusinesses and again, folks like Governor Cuomo put in all theserestrictions, even our local county executive, he is ordering people towear masks, but he was caught at a local golf course without a mask anddrinking beer and eating food. CARLSON:  Of course, they're all hypocrites. God bless you. I appreciateit. Stephen, thanks. MYCHAJLIW:  Thank you. CARLSON:  Well, just in case you still imagine this was a free country, notunder the total control of Mark Zuckerberg and the Google guys. Go aheadand try and share conservative memes on your personal Facebook page and seewhat happens. We're about to speak to a school principal who was fired for that. Waituntil you see what she was fired over. She will tell us after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Until this summer, Amy Sacks was the principal of an elementaryschool in Pennsylvania, then she was fired. She says the School DistrictSuperintendent told her the conservative meme, she uploaded to her privateFacebook page had quote, "Offended a parent who complained to thedistrict." Now in case you're wondering what these memes were, you're seeing one onthe screen right now. Sacks is doing what very few people who've been fired in the last year havedone, she is suing, in this case, the Montgomery County Public Schools. Tonight, Amy Sacks joins us along with her attorney, Francis Malofiy. We'rehappy to have them both. Thanks very much for joining us. So Amy, to you first, we put one of those memes on the screen. Now in thesestories, always kind of the details are what matters. Tell us what thesememes said. Were they extremist material, would you say? AMY SACKS, FIRED PRINCIPAL OVER MEMES:  Oh, absolutely not. They wereliterally, you know, right of center political posts that really showcasedthe absurdity that was going on at the time in the news. CARLSON:  Yes. So basically, you said you were against Joe Biden. You werenot -- you did not prefer to vote for Joe Biden. I mean, that seems to bethe gist of the memes we're putting on the screen here. And that was toofar for the superintendent? SACKS:  Apparently, yes. You know, the one meme specifically had Biden'sname in it, and that was definitely apparently offensive to somebody. CARLSON:  Francis, as a lawyer, tell us, are you allowed to fire someonebecause they're voting for a candidate you don't like? FRANCIS MALOFIY, ATTORNEY:  You know, you're absolutely not allowed to firesomeone and take a political viewpoint in a public school. In schools in the United States, we have a great right, which is the FirstAmendment and that allows us to share opinions, share thought, share speechwithout persecution or prosecution from our government. When you're in a public school in a public school setting, administratorsor directors or superintendents, school boards aren't there to dictatepolitical policy. And in fact, what's unique in this case is that Principal Sacks is fightingfor her job. She is fighting for her family's livelihood and welfare. Butthis is not a war that's happening only in certain counties. It's happening-- it is a war that's happening across this country in public schools. And it is also what is happening in the minds of the children that aretaught in these public schools. As an attorney, I'm proud to champion thiscause and do everything I can to reinstate Principal Sacks to her position,but the issue is that we have a First Amendment, it allows us to expressour thoughts, feelings or emotions without retribution from government. When she did something not in the public school system, but privately, herprivate political Facebook posts were used to basically terminate her fromher position as Principal. CARLSON:  Yes. MALOFIY:  And the shocking thing is, this is not an underperformerprincipal. Principal Sacks heads one of the top elementary schools inPennsylvania. It was a top performing, top 10 elementary school. No issuesof discipline, 20-year veteran, seven-year principal and to think thatSuperintendent Barbara Russell, with the help of attorneys would sit herdown and show her 15 cherry picked posts that basically were center orright of center conservative posts, and then fire her without cause orwithout just notice. It's shocking. And it's shocking because that's happening to us in the sense -- CARLSON:  Well, that's the definition of extremism. I mean that - you justdefined what extremism looks like. Amy Sacks, I'm grateful to you that you didn't go along with this, as somany people have, that you're fighting back and we're certainly rooting foryou. Thank you for coming on tonight. Francis, thank you for representing.Appreciate it. MALOFIY:  Thank you. SACKS:  Thank you. CARLSON:  So you've heard a lot about voter fraud in last month's election.Tonight, specific examples. The top Republican in the State of Georgiafiled a suit saying he has identified enough examples of a different kindof fraud, so-called low tech irregularities and of traditional voter fraudthat it might change the outcome of the race. He joins us to explain whathe has found, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, you've heard a lot of allegations of high tech fraud inlast month's election: people messing with the software, puttingunauthorized thumb drives, et cetera, but maybe not enough about low techfraud, traditional fraud. There's evidence there was quite a bit of that. In Georgia, the State Secretary of State released an affidavit from hischief investigator who looked into election fraud. It rejects the claimthat ballots were retrieved from suitcases on Election Night. But the affidavit does contradict reports on Election Night, the ones thatyou probably read that a burst pipe delayed vote counting. Quote, "Ourinvestigation revealed that the incident initially reported as a water leaklate in the evening on November 3rd was actually a urinal that hadoverflowed early in the morning of November 3rd and did not affect thecounting of votes by Fulton County later in the evening." Okay. But that's the opposite of what we heard, and that's the opposite ofwhat officials said. Local news reports claim that 40,000 absentee ballotscould not be counted on Election Night due to quote, "Water main break." Interesting. Why the discrepancy? We should find out. The Chairman of the State of Georgia's Republican Party has filed a lawsuitsaying that there were thousands of examples of low tech fraud on ElectionNight. David Shafer is the Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. We're happyto have him on. Mr. Shafer, thanks so much for joining us. Can you give usan example of the kind of low tech fraud you believe took place? DAVID SHAFER, CHAIRMAN, GEORGIA REPUBLICAN PARTY:  Well, President Trump isbehind Vice President Biden by 11,770 votes after the last recount, and inorder to -- and filed a suit contesting the election and we've got to showthat the number of irregular votes exceeds the margin, and we've done that,we've shown that people voted without being on the voter registration roll. People voted with having registered after the deadline. People voted morethan once. People moved from the state, registered in another state andthen voted by absentee in our state. And those errors and irregularities on such a scale that it exceeds themargin and cast the outcome of the election in doubt. CARLSON:  So those are kind of traditional ways to throw an election.Right? I mean, there's nothing complicated about what you just described. SHAFER:  Nothing at all. I mean, we've got three major complaints,thousands of ballots, of unlawful ballots were counted, and then re-countedand then re-counted again. The counting took place in violation of Georgia law, which requires that itbe done in public, in the open and we have serious problems with theverification of absentee ballot signatures, which we don't believeoccurred. CARLSON:  Yes, well, in a lot of places we know it didn't. The State ofNevada, for example, and I believe the majority of ballots cast in thiselection, about 60 percent were cast absentee, so that of course matters. David Shafer struck us as a responsible, sober, fact based person makingreal claims of fraud. I appreciate your coming on tonight. I hope ourviewers will look up what you filed and assess it for themselves. Thankyou. SHAFER:  Thank you CARLSON:  We are out of time. I wish we had more time. We'll be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. The show is the sworn enemy oflying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great evening with the ones you love. We have a surprise in storefor you tonight. Sean Hannity will take over at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
