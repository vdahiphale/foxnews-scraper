     Video  Trump thanks CNN's Jim Acosta for his accidental endorsement of a border wall 
After Jim Acosta tweeted video meant to downplay President Trump's claims of a border crisis, Trump thanks Acosta for his 'salesmanship' of the effectiveness of a border barrier.

DANA PERINO, HOST: All right. You've been watching a press conference by the Barron County Sheriff, Chris Fitzgerald, there, taking as many questions as he can on the remarkable story of Jayme Closs escaping her captivity, being found safe and alive. He has got as much information as he can. We will go around the table and talk about this a little bit.
And, again, Greg, it's remarkable that she was found, 88 days. We don't know a lot how she escaped or how she was being held, but they did find what they think could be the shotgun that murdered her parents. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: I sympathize with the Sheriff and that I have nothing to say and it's frustrating when you watch press conferences. But, you know, when they pepper this individual's questions and, you know, what can you say. It's a horrible crime for this young girl. Her ordeal is just beginning, actually, because, you know, she's been through three months of some kind of captive ordeal. And now, she has no parents and her life is forever changed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Indeed. What about -- I think, Jedediah, her wherewithal to be able to escape. And apparently, as the Sheriff said, her captor was out of the house of the time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JEDEDIAH BILA, HOST: Yeah. I mean, it's actually an incredible thing when you think about it. It's great to hear that she's not responding and talking. I can't imagine how traumatizing this must be for a kid and now her new reality, I know she is with her aunt, reunited with her family. Some of the things that stuck out for me, though, I was expecting this to be someone that knew them. And the Sheriff coming out and saying as of right now, no social media connection known, nothing to suggest that there has been contact. There was contact with the suspect and her or her family.
Although he did say that the parents worked, I believe, at the same plant. I'm curious that's going to lead to something that maybe the suspect did know them. The Sheriff clearly saying that Jayme was the target, not necessarily sure if she was being stalked. But something's going to come out here, I think, that we're going to discover about the story, because it's a very strange wind-down, to see. And I'm just glad she's OK. It's actually incredible what she's been through and where she's at right now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: The Sheriff, Juan, said that the suspect will be charged on Monday at 3:30 p.m. Wisconsin Time.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Right. It sounds like one of the key pieces of evidence is the gun, which was used not to just kill those two people, James and Denise Closs, but also to destroy the front door. So it's a part now they can really put together and bases. And secondly, that he had shaved his head, again not only to avoid detection, but to avoid leaving here at the scene. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And on the touching part that Jedediah was saying, not only is she in good shape, but apparently, when she went into the home of these two people, Kristin and Peter Kasinkas, who said that the wife said it was like seeing a ghost. This girl had been missing for three months. Everybody assumed the worst, that she started playing with the puppy. And that, to me, that's a great sign of her mental health and mental stability, and again, evidence, as you were saying, Dana, that this young woman saved herself, she found a way out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });

        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BILA: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: And, you know, they make movies and books about people who find that kind of fortitude and heart in themselves, but for a 13-year-old, it's pretty incredible.
PERINO: Jesse, your thoughts on the last minute that we have here?

JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Unfortunately, they do not have the death penalty in the state of Wisconsin. They eliminated that a very long time ago. So this guy is going to serve life when he is convicted. I am sure he will be convicted once they get the ballistic evidence from the shotgun that was used at the crime. Very premeditated by shaving his head to eliminate any sort of forensic evidence as well.
You know, I just think, right now, everybody is going to flood the zone with producers from 2020 and from Dateline and they're just trying to score an interview with this young girl. And I hope we give her some time to heal before she's ready to come forward. And I know the generosity of this country is going to be there for her, whether it's financial or any type of generosity. Hopefully, she will get over this and she will survive.
PERINO: All right. Thank you for that. Coming up, why President Trump is actually thinking Jim Acosta.

WILLIAMS: Welcome back. The partial shutdown entering its fourth week and now tied for the longest in American history. Thousands of federal workers did not get their paychecks today. President Trump has been grappling with whether or not to declare a national emergency in order to build a wall, now says he will not be doing that for the moment.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty four hours ago, you are saying you were going to declare a national emergency.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said I could do it, but I tell you what, it's the easy way out. But Congress should do this. This is too simple, it's too basic. And Congress should do this. If they can't do it, if at some point they just can't do that, this is a 15-minute meeting, if they can't do it, I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right to do it. It says as clear as you can.

        }
      
I'd rather not do it because this is something that Congress should easily do. This is something that the Democrats should do. And I don't want to give an easy way out of something as simple as this.

REP. KATIE HILL, D-CALIF.: This is like a toddler who is having a tantrum and you can't give in. It really is a tragedy. This is, to me -- I know it's a strong word. But to me, this is political terrorism.
REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WASH.: His ultimate goal is as you said to make America pure in the sense of not having immigrants, not having folks of color here and shutting down every form of legal immigration.

So, Jedediah, this is a big change now. We kind of go up and down and the plot takes a twist, I don't know, like a TV or something. It's like a TV series. But he says now, he's thinking it's not the right thing. It's Congress' responsibility. I have noticed that National Review, Wall Street Journal, conservative outlets, have both said, they think it would set a terrible precedent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
BILA: Yeah. And I said here yesterday I didn't think he was going to do that, even though he is right. He can do it. He is within his authority to do so. The thing here is, they don't disagree on the issue. Chuck Schumer believes in border security. He voted for it. He agrees that fencing works. Donald Trump believes that it works. Barack Obama is out there, has been talking about this humanitarian crisis. This is not about the issue on immigration. This is about Donald Trump. This is about the fact that he made it front and center and these Democrats can't stand him and they are making the political fight. They don't want him to be able to run in 2020 and say that he fulfilled a campaign promise. And they don't want him to be right.
So if anyone is making this political, it's the people on the left. And they need to make a decision. Look, he is within his authority. I think it was good that he brought up this Emergencies Act of 1976 and talked about his authority to do it. It wasn't a threat, but he was saying listen, if you force me, I'm going to do this, this is not a manufactured crisis. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And all these Democrats talking about race, it always makes me laugh when they say that. More than 51 percent of border patrol agents are Hispanic. This is not about what color you are, whether you're white or you're brown. This is not about that. This is about drugs, this is about human trafficking. And anyone who makes this about race is really, really pathetic in my eyes and doesn't have a strong argument. And maybe, the more they're making that point about race, when President Obama and Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi were all fighting for border security, and voting for border security, no, they weren't. They're making it about race because once again, that is a campaign talking point that they need against Donald Trump. It's a lame and it's not going to stick.
WILLIAMS: All right. Jessie, you know, a quick way to ask this question is, how long is this going to go on? Is this going to on until the State of the Union? I think Dana had predicted that a couple of weeks back, but what do you think? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

WATTERS: Well, whatever Dana predicted is probably right.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Probably right. But what do you think is the way out, what's the end game?
WATTERS: I think the end game is some external event is going happen, it's going to shake-up the dynamic. Because right now, there is just too much intransigence on the side of the Democrats, they are not negotiating. Donald Trump is the only one negotiating and they're not.
Let's just think about what happened yesterday, when he was down at the border of McAllen and they have the border patrol agents say that in just one day, they apprehended 135 individuals. In one day. That means they probably missed some. And they were from 41 different countries besides Mexico and Central America. The Chinese, Romanians, Pakistanis. This is not about race, this is about any human being that comes across. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

If you are at a party and all of a sudden you don't recognize that person or that person -- you don't recognize that person, it's your house. Who are these people? And then you say, hey, who are you, where are you from? And they go, you know, I just let myself in the backdoor. It was unlocked. That's just not the way to run a party. It's not a way to run a country. And every American can understand that. You just want a sense of who is in your own house and who is in your own country.

Dana said yesterday, and I just want to double down on that, there are cracks that are beginning to show within the Democratic caucus. I saw another interview with the House Democrat that said sure, I'd be willing to vote for a little border patrol fencing, or fencing for the border patrol, that's fine. It's starting to slip and the mainstream media is doing as much as they possibly can to keep that from happening.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana, one of the things that the president said was Congress should act. And what we have seen today is a rising pressure coming actually -- it's sort of bipartisan, on Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, to force, to vote on something and then give it to the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: I think Mitch McConnell has played this very well. There's a poll yesterday that showed this question, who do you blame for the shutdown, 51 percent the president, 35 percent Democrat, 5 percent Mitch McConnell, which means that he is actually -- he has a higher approval rating than he has taken the blame for this issue. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For me, and he's just sitting back and saying, I will wait, until you guys tell me what he'll sign. And so, I think that Chuck Schumer can't get it done, so he is like please, Mitch McConnell, bail me out. No, thanks, I think that's actually really a dumb thing to do.
The other thing is that the president said something today. The Democrats should have said it, let's do that. He tweeted this morning about h1b visas. This is for your high-tech people, your smarts, like all those brainiacs that you want to have. And he said, I have an idea, why don't we provide you a path to citizenship. Don't go to other places. Come to America, we want you. Why don't they take him up on that deal?

For $5.7 billion, you get border security plus you get some of the things you wanted, dreamers and other things, administration -- administrative law judges. I do want to point this out though, we can still have a little bit of fun. You guys remember yesterday. We showed you this from Jim Acosta, down at the border. Take a walk -- take a look.

JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Here are some of the steel slats that the president's been talking about, right here. As you can see, yes, you can see through these slats to the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border.

But as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger. There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas, area. As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway. There's a gas station, Burger King, and so on. But no sign of the national emergency that the president has been talking about.
TRUMP: Thank you. Good job yesterday. I appreciate your -- salesmanship. I appreciate your salesmanship.
ACOSTA: I didn't see -- I didn't see an invasion at the border.

But look, to the other points before we go. Somebody mentioned political terrorism. Political terrorism is when you believe that what is worse than a humanitarian crisis where children are exploited, women are raped, and federal workers go without paychecks, what is worse than that is compromising with Donald Trump. That's actually political terrorism.
And it's really refreshing to see so many leftists, you know, cry racism about slowing -- slowing -- illegal immigration, not stopping it. And ignoring how the influx of the illegal immigration actually depresses wages and jobs for minorities. Somehow, they overlook that.

That's all I got. This crisis is now a circus, and a circus has two ingredients. Right? Clowns and children. The children are the politicians. The clowns are the media. And they just indulge each other. So it's never-ending. And you're never going to get a solution as long as you let the media and their business model influence this issue.

First it was Senator Elizabeth Warren's bizarre beer-drinking live stream that had many on the Internet scratching their heads.

GUTFELD: Then it's awesome.
WILLIAMS: Is that right?

WATTERS: That's true. Very unpresidential.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Or maybe it's modern-day presidential. Who knows?
WILLIAMS: So this, to me, is where we are in politics today. It's all about social media and appearing authentic and genuine, and "I'm a real guy, like you do. And you know, here I am at the dentist, and I don't like it. And I can talk while I've got the stuff in my mouth," which is amazing to me.
But I think back. I think we were talking a moment ago, Jedediah and I, about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing to some music. I forget what song it was. And then, you know, initially, it was the conservatives mocking her, but then everybody came and said --
GUTFELD: No conservatives mocked her. That is a lie, Juan.

WILLIAMS: OK.
WATTERS: We did a whole monologue on it.
Jedediah, take it away.
JEDEDIAH BILA, HOST: Yes, I think this stuff works, though. I've got to say.
WILLIAMS: That's right. I think it's authentic.
BILA: I think it really works. I think it does make them relatable. I mean, I don't want to see anybody getting their teeth cleaned but a really funny tweet from Ben Jacobs at The Guardian, he said, "God, I hope Beto O'Rourke doesn't need a colonoscopy any time soon."

WATTERS: So now you have the option to show them that you truly care. Frontier Airlines offering passengers the option to tip them. The sky-high gratuity running into some turbulence, though, from their union, who fear the practices will keep wages low and encourage people to treat the cabin crew like in-flight waiters.
I'm against this, Greg.
GUTFELD: Of course you are, you cheap freak. Tipping -- tipping is a transaction that makes the world a better place. You know, if you can encourage somebody to go out of their way to do something better, why not?

You don't tip people for doing their job. You tip them for going out of their way. If they do something special like they give you a free drink, right, or they upgrade you, or they give you a better pillow. You should always -- you reward that.
WATTERS: You can tip to get an upgraded seat? Now I changed my mind. I'm into it.
PERINO: I -- I think the union has a good point about them being treated like waiters. Because they are there for your safety, as they remind you every time you get on.
The other thing is, nobody carries cash.
GUTFELD: That's true.
WATTERS: True.
GUTFELD: So maybe you give them tips as piece --

PERINO: Advice?
GUTFELD: -- like pieces of advice.
WATTERS: You know, you can stop knocking my leg with the drink cart.
All right. Go ahead, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Yes, but I mean, the -- the question to my mind is, aren't you paying for this when you buy the tickets?
WATTERS: Yes, the prices are high.
WILLIAMS: You're paying for a level of service. Now Spirit Airlines, I was on the Spirit the other day, they make you pay for everything. Not only additional baggage but you have to buy peanuts, cokes, coffee.

WATTERS: "I charged them for peanuts, and they bought it."
WILLIAMS: The other part --
GUTFELD: "The guy from 'The Five.'"
WILLIAMS: The other part of this is, hey, you know what? So somebody gets on who doesn't have either money in their pocket or can't afford it and they're going to get treated worse, even though they paid the same for a seat. That doesn't seem right.
BILA: Yes, good point.

I think people will start carrying cash, though, on planes if they know they can tip, because the service will be better. Everybody knows it. Everybody likes to get tipped. And I always tip well, because I used to be a waitress.
PERINO: Yes.
BILA: And that was the only money I ever made, because you get paid, basically, nothing except the tips. So now I just -- I feel sympathy, and I like everybody likes to be tipped. And if you --
WATTERS: What's "tip well"? What, are you, 25 percent?
BILA: I tip above.
WATTERS: Twenty-five?
BILA: I tip very well. I do, because that's the only money I ever made. I was broke, and I was, like, grateful for good tips.

BILA: Yay!
WATTERS: I've got to write a book like Jedediah.
BILA: It's very hard work to be a waiter.
WATTERS: All right. Now for some robot on robot crime. Russian robotics company Promo Boy is claiming that their autonomous robot was struck and killed by a self-driving Tesla as the metal guy was making his way to the consumer electronics show in Vegas.
Some are calling this fake news, saying it's a P.R. stunt. Greg is actually taking a driver's test next week.
BILA: OH, BOY.
WATTERS: So I wonder if he could drive better than a robot?
GUTFELD: I haven't driven a car in ten years.
WATTERS: So that's no.
BILA: Whoa.
GUTFELD: Yes, ten years. I don't even -- I'm not even sure I will understand what's in front of me, because cars have changed so much since the last time I drove. And the cars that I drive are old cars. The last car I drove is from 1957. So I have a car -- I have a car that has no seat belts.
PERINO: And on --
WATTERS: I'm not going to make a booster seat joke. Go ahead.
PERINO: And on Monday, we're going to quiz you so you can get ready for your driving test.
GUTFELD: I'm taking the written exam on Tuesday. I've been reading the entire book. And also, a lot of -- they have, like, rules about in-line skating.
WATTERS: What?
GUTFELD: I know.
WATTERS: Are you sure it's the right book?
GUTFELD: I've got to study that? In-line skating?
WATTERS: All right. Stay tuned for Greg's quiz on "The Five" on Monday.
What do you think?
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, first of all, there's no way Greg could be a better driver than a robot, even if he hasn't been driving. The reason we're having this push towards self-driving cars, No. 1, is safety.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
WILLIAMS: And so it turns out robots are much better than people who drive and they're distracted or drunk or --
GUTFELD: It will eliminate 90 percent of all accidents, self-driving.
WILLIAMS: So I don't -- I'm not particularly comfortable getting in a car that's controlled by a machine. But on the other hand, I read the numbers.
WATTERS: You feel more comfortable in the car with him?
WILLIAMS: Because I know him.
GUTFELD: No airbag on your side, Juan.
BILA: I just can't believe you studied for that. I would get in the car with you. I think you did your homework. I feel like you could be a good driver. Maybe a little road rage, but that never hurt anyone.
WATTERS: All road rage.
GUTFELD: I'm a terrible passenger, I will tell you that.
WATTERS: You are -- you're going to be the king of road rage. But you won't get out of the car.
GUTFELD: I won't get out of the car.
WATTERS: Very tough behind the wheel, though.
GUTFELD: And then I hope we don't both stop at the red light together.
WATTERS: Exactly. Because you're going to run the red light.
All right. Don't go anywhere, Greg has got your Fan Mail Friday questions ready to go.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: That's great music.
GUTFELD: Exactly. That was my life in the '80s, I guess.
"Fan Mail Friday." Stop talking, Greg.
All right. I love this question. This is from -- would you say "Cherry" or "Sherry"?
PERINO: Sherry.
GUTFELD: Sherry? Baby?
GRAPHIC: Cheri K. "A space alien arrives and says 'Take me to your leader.' Where do you go first?"
GUTFELD: "Space alien arrives and says, 'Take me to your leader." Where do you go first? Jesse.
WATTERS: I'd say here he is. You met him.
WILLIAMS: You know what you can say?
WATTERS: What?
WILLIAMS: You could say, "This is 'Watters' World.'"
GUTFELD: "Welcome to my world." And then they kill you. And you say, "I should have said Gutfeld."
WATTERS: That's true.
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: I guess I would say Jeff Bezos.
GUTFELD: There you go.
WILLIAMS: No, I'd say Mrs. Bezos.
GUTFELD: Dana.
PERINO: I think I'm going to have to go with NYPD. Like, find any NYPD officer.
GUTFELD: That's the practical maneuver on your part. You're very practical today, Dana.
PERINO: That's true.
GUTFELD: Another practical -- Jed.
PERINO: Just today?
GUTFELD: Today.
BILA: I would go to my mom. I'm not kidding. My mom is a boss.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BILA: She's always right. She's listening to this now, and she's like, "I told you so." But no, I would go to my mom.
GUTFELD: You know who I'd go to?
BILA: She's right too much.
PERINO: Dilbert?
GUTFELD: No, Lou Dobbs.
WATTERS: Scott Adams?
GUTFELD: Lou Dobbs.
PERINO: Dobbs.
BILA: Lou Dobbs.
PERINO: What about Scott Adams?
GUTFELD: Well, you know --
PERINO: He could persuade them not to hurt you.
GUTFELD: Yes. Scott Adams could persuade the aliens, but Lou Dobbs would put them in their place.
PERINO: That's true.
GUTFELD: "I'm Lou Dobbs."
All right. @FrenchiFirecracker --
GUTFELD: Oh, no.
GUTFELD: "What's the most cringeworthy outfit you've ever worn?" And it can't be the one you're wearing today. Jed.
PERINO: Got one.
BILA: Very funny. I like this dress.
GUTFELD: Is it a magic?
BILA: Dana complimented me before the show.
Cringeworthy outfit, probably a Halloween costume.
GUTFELD: Oh?
BILA: Yes, I dressed up as Madonna one year.
GUTFELD: No, you dressed up as Batman. Do you remember that?
BILA: Batman?
GUTFELD: Or was it --
BILA: I was a cat that year. That was not Batman.
GUTFELD: That's it. You were Catwoman.
BILA: Catwoman.
GUTFELD: That's right.
BILA: But that was a nice costume.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BILA: Believe me, if you thought that was bad, the Madonna one was really bad. Really bad.
GUTFELD: Juan. You've lived through some decades. Let's face it.
WILLIAMS: My friend Jesse gave me a cringeworthy outfit for Christmas, and I wore it. I wore it. I wore the snowflake outfit.
GUTFELD: Yes, that was nice.
WILLIAMS: To mock myself. Yes, I did.
On the other hand, I think -- I saw a picture of myself the other day in overalls when I was a softball player way back, and I had no shirt. And I thought, you know, "Why am I wearing that?" I mean, it looked great, but I'm kind of embarrassed about it.
GUTFELD: Overalls are strange if you're not on a farm. It's unusual, Jesse.
BILA: I like an overall.
WATTERS: I had a few cringeworthy outfits back in the day. I had, you know, the starter jackets.
GUTFELD: Why could -- you could just go back to "Watters' World" with the collar.
WATTERS: No, those were --
GUTFELD: Upturned collar?
WATTERS: I had red Champion high-tops. But I think the most cringeworthy, there's a picture of me with an afro and a kilt from a -- I think it was, like, 1998. I don't think that would fly in this --
GUTFELD: OK.
WATTERS: -- in this year.
GUTFELD: I don't think so.
WATTERS: But yes, that's pretty cringeworthy.
GUTFELD: Yes. Dana.
PERINO: So in third grade, my mom -- my mom, we didn't have, like, all the fancy clothes other kids had, and she gave me these corduroys; but they were, like, the thin corduroys. And they were this ugly, like, puke brown/green color. And it was third grade, and she made me wear them to school. And I'll -- honestly, I can remember like it was yesterday. It was so mortifying. I was really embarrassed.
GUTFELD: I can -- I had a similar -- when I was in first grade, my mother, I was the narrator for the -- what do you call the Christmas play? The nativity -- what do you call it? You know with the manger, all that stuff? I can't remember what the --
PERINO: Jesus.
GUTFELD: Jesus. Yes. I had to do the "And the wise men came and there was no room."
WILLIAMS: I've heard this story.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes. I did.
BILA: Had to read the story.
GUTFELD: Yes. I had to do the narration, because I was the only one in first grade who could read. So my mom made a suit, but it was a suit with shorts. So I was up on the auditorium stage in shorts but wearing a suit.
WATTERS: I wore that on "Outnumbered" a few years ago.
GUTFELD: I think you did.
BILA: He did wear that!
GUTFELD: You know what? It was the same suit.
All right. "One More Thing," next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right. It's time now for "One More Thing."
I had a couple of good Samaritan videos to show you. The first one comes from Milwaukee, where this bus driver, she's driving and she sees there's a toddler that is walking along the highway by itself, and so she stops and goes and gets the little one --
BILA: Ohh!
PERINO: -- and makes sure that the little girl is unharmed, and she was reunited with the family. So obviously, that's a good Samaritan act.
WATTERS: Wow.
PERINO: And then, next act of kindness happened in Lakewood, Colorado, where three teens came to the rescue of a woman whose wheelchair got stuck in a patch of dirt off the side of the road. The boys lifted the chair out and made sure she was OK to keep going on her way. And good Samaritans like that deserve a shout-out and serve as examples for the rest of us.
GUTFELD: Why do they have to be Samaritans? Why can't they be anybody? Gee whiz, Dana.
PERINO: Juan, help me.
WILLIAMS: All right. How about ringing in the new year with a discovery? And yes, I definitely said "ring." Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILL FRYE, FOUND LOST WEDDING RING: It was kind of -- looked like a doughnut hole, but it had a little shine through it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: That was Will Frye. He bought a '72 Oldsmobile from a 93-year- old Ray Schmuecker. When he took the engine apart, he found a wedding ring that had been lost for 45 years.
BILA: Oh, my God.
WILLIAMS: Schmuecker's late wife was angry when he lost the ring. Look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RAY SCHMUECKER, SOLD CAR: I really treasured it, so my wife, she went right back to John (ph) the next day and bought another one.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: So now he has two rings, and his daughter -- by the way, she's suffering from breast cancer, which killed her mom, has taken the discovery of the ring as a sign.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANA CABANA, SCHMUECKER'S DAUGHTER: That everything is going to be OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Aww.
WILLIAMS: Well, good luck to you.
PERINO: Indeed.
OK, we're going to go now to Jesse --
GUTFELD: There you go.
PERINO: -- who has a great "One More Thing."
WATTERS: Don't you like rotary phones, Dana?
PERINO: I used to love one.
WATTERS: I still do. And young people now, they don't know what a rotary phone is.
GUTFELD: Great pitter-patter.
WATTERS: So this guy, Kevin Bumstead, gave a rotary phone and gave his son and his nephew four minutes to dial one number, and they couldn't do it. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KEVIN BUMSTEAD, CHICAGO RESIDENT: You have four minutes to dial that phone number.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So -- oh, no, zero's over there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Restart it.
What's with all the holes, though?
If this is zero, then --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: They couldn't do it. The four minutes elapsed right as they got the hang of it.
But I mean, rotary phones, I like -- I like how it feels against my ear. You know what else is really nice against your ear? The sound of "Watters' World." Eight p.m. Eastern, we have Ron Paul, remember him?
BILA: Nice.
GUTFELD: What a great way to introduce him: "Remember him?"
WATTERS: The Mooch!
GUTFELD: He must be thrilled.
WATTERS: We always remember the Mooch. And Diamond and Silk. And of course, a porn star turned preacher, only on "Watters' World."
GUTFELD: It's rarely the reverse. Although I'd watch the hell out of that.
All right. Tomorrow night, 10 p.m., "The Greg Gutfeld Show." I've got David Angelo. I've got Jimmy Failla, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. Saturday January 12, it's going to be great.
And now of course, you know what it's time for --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Oh, boy.
GUTFELD: Two things I really like. I like animals, and I like taking a bath. And when you put them together, there's nothing better. Like this little guy here. He just had a bath. And he's getting -- what do you think that is, Dana?
PERINO: I don't know. A chinchilla?
GUTFELD: No. Close.
PERINO: Hedgehog?
WATTERS: That's a chipmunk.
PERINO: Hedgehog?
GUTFELD: No, it's not --
BILA: That's not a chipmunk!
WILLIAMS: How about a squirrel?
GUTFELD: No, it's a prairie dog. And then she stops, see, and then he gets very angry. It's a prairie dog. A prairie dog. You can have a pet prairie dog.
Look how much he enjoys and appreciates getting touched. All animals, human and otherwise, enjoy being touched.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Jedediah, can you top that?
BILA: I can. This Sunday -- also quickly, I will be at Barnes and Noble in the Staten Island Mall, 2 p.m. You better come, because I need, you know, fans to show up.
Anyway, you can name a cockroach after your ex- for a dollar ninety-three. This is amazing. I think I'll name one after Kyle.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BILA: It's true. The Hemsley Conservation Center offering wounded lovers the chance to get back at the one that broke your heart. Less than two bucks, man. And you know what? It's called the Bottom of the Barrel Creatures party. You get a certificate, and your ex's name proudly displayed outside the center.
GUTFELD: Can you use Kyle's real name?
BILA: I'm going to call him Kyle. That is his name.
PERINO: Kyle the Cockroach.
BILA: Kyle the Cockroach.
WILLIAMS: Can you smash -- you get to smash them?
BILA: No, I mean, you get to name them. So --
PERINO: Smash them with your shoe. All right, that's it for us. See you next week. "Special Report" is up next.
