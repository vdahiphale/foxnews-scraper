Also breaking tonight, President Trump has toldadvisors he wants to run again in 2024 and may announce that decisionbefore the inauguration maybe even on Inauguration Day.

Operation Warp Speed has been a great modern-daymiracle.The President less pleased with state officials in Georgia as the electionrecount there nears its end. Georgia's Republican Secretary of State BradRaffensperger citing, "Massive amounts of misinformation that is beingspread by dishonest actors."BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, SECRETARY OF STATE, GEORGIA: There are those who areexploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims,half-truths, misinformation. And frankly, they are misleading the presidentas well apparently.ROBERTS: Raffensperger did say his office has opened more than 250investigations of potential voter fraud.But President Trump wants more taking aim at both Raffensperger andGovernor Brian Kemp in a morning tweet saying, why won't Governor BrianKemp, the hapless governor of Georgia use his emergency powers which can beeasily done to overrule his obstinate at Secretary of State and do a matchof signatures on envelopes?

Video transition officials did not permit thepress pool to shoot.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not getting out. Mike, we're not getting out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was crafty.DOOCY: The Biden cabinet is starting to look the way many thought a HillaryClinton cabinet might. Top spots have gone to Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken,and John Kerry.Next, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Office of Management and BudgetDirector Neera Tanden, the longtime Clinton defender who caught theattention of Republican staffers including Senator John Cornyn'scommunications director who wrote, Neera Tanden, who has an endless streamof disparaging comments about the Republican senators whose votes she'llneed, stands zero chance of being confirmed.Last year Tanden wrote, Stacey Abrams just called McConnell Moscow Mitch,love it.

"For the first time in history,these communications roles will be filled entirely by women." Kayleigh McEnany claims that's not historic because she and Alyssa Farah,both women, have the top comms jobs now.Although, critics point out the vice president's press secretary amongother communicators are men. Biden ally James Clyburn is hoping for morediversity with coming Biden Cabinet picks pitching Congresswoman MarciaFudge as Agriculture Secretary and telling The Hill, I want to see wherethe process leads to, what it produces, but so far, it's not good.Clyburn's displeasure, not a secret.

Peter, thanks.Election officials in Iowa have certified their election results today.Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks had just six more votes than DemocratRita Hart in the state's second congressional district following a recount.A short time ago, Republican John Katko won reelection in New York's 24thcongressional district. That puts the current balance of power at 222Democrats to 207 Republicans, six races still uncalled.Lawmakers are coming back to Washington tonight, Congress has just a fewdays to put together legislation to keep the government open and to work ona coronavirus relief package. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergramtells us where things stand tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over):It's a combination of what Congress has to do and what some want to do.Most members want a coronavirus stimulus package, but the same divideremains cost.REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): Well, I think another stimulus bill is necessarybut this one needs to be targeted.GOV. PHIL MURPHY (D-NJ): I don't think history will penalize us forovershooting here.PERGRAM: A bipartisan coalition of senators is now trying to forge astimulus agreement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell still calls fora narrow half-trillion-dollar package.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Will they finally let Congress pass hundredsof billions of dollars of relief on all the subjects where we agree? Orwill they continue to insist that either they get their entire ideologicalwish list, or the American people got nothing at all?PERGRAM: Some Democrats believe House Speaker Nancy Pelosi miscalculated,not moving a trim down coronavirus bill before the election. That will beharder with a small majority next year since Democrats lost seats.Possibilities of a bill this year are slim.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): And the Senate it's Mitch McConnell but the otherobstacle because he does what President Trump says and that's PresidentTrump.PERGRAM: The only thing Congress has to do is fund the government byDecember 11th to avoid a government shutdown, and President Trump hasthreatened to veto the annual defense policy bill. The measure drops namesof bases named after Confederates.President Trump has vetoed eight measures without Congress overriding him.That requires a two-thirds vote by both the House and Senate. But the Houseand Senate approved the initial versions of the defense bill with veto-proof margins.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): House members are being told to stay through next weekand not go home out of concern for spiking coronavirus cases.However, 87-year old Chuck Grassley of Iowa, third in line to thepresidency is back on Capitol Hill after testing positive. He says he neverexperienced any symptoms. But he missed his first Thanksgiving dinner withhis wife, Bret.BAIER: Our best to Senator. Chad, thanks.Let's get an update tonight on the massive effort to bring a coronavirusvaccine to the American people. Dr. Moncef Slaoui is the scientific head ofOperation Warp spread -- Warp Speed. Doctor, thanks for being here tonight.MONCEF SLAOUI, SCIENTIFIC HEAD, OPERATION WARP SPEED: My pleasure. Thanksfor having me.BAIER: Where do things stand tonight? The great news about Moderna today,we've heard the news about Pfizer, just give us an update.SLAOUI: Well, we have two vaccines that have demonstrated outstandingefficacy with one of them 95 percent, the Pfizer vaccine, the other 94.1percent, the Moderna vaccine, they are equivalent. They have excellentefficacy.Very importantly, there is almost perfect efficacy against severe disease.For instance, in the Moderna trial, there were 30 cases of severe diseasein the trial. All 30 were in the placebo recipients, non in the vaccinerecipient. The efficacy is very high also in the elderly, people over theage of 65, and people with co-morbidity.So, I think we are in a good place in terms of these two vaccines. We'realso producing a few millions of doses of vaccine in preparation forapproval. Both vaccines have now been submitted to the FDA for emergencyuse authorization expected around the 11th or so of December for Pfizer andaround the 18th or 19th for the Moderna vaccine. And hopefully, we'll startrolling vaccine doses, that's great news.However, it's very important to know that the number of doses we have islimited compared to the size and the need. We need 600 million doses.Everybody needs to get through shots of the vaccine.It's going to take a while, a few months before we are able to produceenough vaccine to immunize the full population. So, it's going to be veryimportant that we prioritize the first most at-risk people to have thevaccine, and the CDC will be doing that. But also, for all of us tocontinue to take our precautions, put our masks, wash our hands, keep ourdistance.BAIER: There's been a lot of talk about the challenging logistics here, notonly the refrigeration aspect of keeping the vaccine cold, but also thelogistics of getting this much product around the country.Can you talk about that for the American people and what's realistic forthe American people broadly to be getting this vaccine?SLAOUI: Right. So, it is a significant challenge but it's not a challengethat's never done. In the sense that in contrast to the situation with thetest, for instance, where we don't test people against certain diseases allthe time. We vaccinate every year in the United States more than 100million people, between children and the other population receiving, forinstance, the flu vaccine.So, the distribution channels, the inoculation technology, the people whoknow how to immunize, et cetera, are there. We're talking about maybehaving two times more, 2-1/2 times more. It's not, you know,transformational.Therefore, we feel confident and comfortable that by using the channelsthat are normally used, so, for instance, shipping through FedEx and UPS,using the same warehousing facilities used for the flu vaccines.And empowering each state's health agencies to tell us where to ship thevaccines. The number of doses are located to each state will be defined inproportion to the population of the state. I think things we expect to gopretty smoothly.Also, the Department of Defense and in particular, General Perna, my co-leader, and his team are doing an outstanding job preparing, rehearsing.Just today, for instance, Pfizer was shipping vaccines, in fact, just vial,mock vials in dry ice, in the boxes exactly as it will be done to 60different sites across the United States as one of the dry runs, if youwish, to make sure everything is smooth, everything is planned, andhopefully, everything will work well.Having said that --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: If you look -- yes, go ahead.SLAOUI: Having said that. So, just the number of doses, for instance,between now and the end of the month between the two vaccine is going to be35 to 40 million doses, enough to immunize about 20 million people.We will be immunizing the most at-risk people, but unfortunately, the sizeof the at-risk population is much more than 20 or 25 million. So, we'regoing to need to be patient in the months following with that.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Yes, for that's -- I guess my next question is the statistics. Whatpercentage of the American population do you need to reach with thisvaccine to reach herd immunity considering the CDC numbers you've seen whoalready had it? And where you could see this virus kind of meeting its endbecause of the vaccine?SLAOUI: So, herd immunity usually -- with a vaccine with this level ofprotection, 95 percent, requires about between 75-80 percent of people tobe immunized. That's very, very important. That will take several monthsbefore we get there, probably, May or June.The people who have been infected and recovered are probably immune, thestrength of their immunity is unknown to us. At this stage, we know thatthe vaccines are incredibly powerful with 95 percent, at least the twofirst vaccines.So, in my view, I think we're going to need to really make sure that largemajority of the population is immunized before we declare probably in Mayor June that we have things under control.BAIER: Last thing, Doctor. Just talked to people about the scope of thisoperation, you've been at the forefront of it. But I don't think peoplefully understand how significant Operation Warp Speed is as far as amedical achievement at this point.SLAOUI: Well, normally, and I've been doing this for 30 years before thismission. Developing -- discovering, developing, manufacturing, testing inthe clinic, vaccines, and then launching them take anywhere between fouryears and 25 years depending on the complexity.What we have done here is to develop -- enable the development, acceleratethe development of six vaccines in a period of 10 months.This, of course, has been done -- thanks to the companies who are thesponsors and the owners of the vaccines. Thanks to the NIH and otherfederal agencies in HSS, and in the Department of Defense. Thanks to thealignment, the motivation, the enormous enthusiasm that has been behind theoperation.And thanks, frankly, to the administration that has decided to put togetherthis operation, put together the army, and the -- and the industry, and theacademic, and the science behind this mission remarkable performance.I do want to say that while we have two vaccines that have been completingtheir phase three trial, we have four more vaccines in clinical trials. Twoof which are well advanced in phase three trials.I want to call on our American population to continue to volunteer andparticipate in these clinical trials because it's thanks to all theindividuals who are generous with their time and their health andparticipate to these clinical trials. That we are able to assess whetherthe vaccines are safe, whether they are effective.BAIER: Yes.SLAOUI: And we need more vaccines than the two we have because it will helpus have more doses faster.BAIER: Yes. And possibly, one of those future vaccines might just be onevaccine as far as the shot, instead of two. Doctor, we appreciate yourtime. Well, you're always welcome back here and best of luck on yourefforts.SLAOUI: Thank you very much.BAIER: Up next, the calls of death to Israel and death to America ring outin Iran following the killing of the country's top nuclear scientists. Andlater, the pressure is on in Georgia as the push for votes in the Senaterunoff races January 5th is already leading to allegations of voter fraud.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAFFENSPERGER: These third-party groups have a responsibility to notencourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Stocks finished a huge month on a down note. The Dow lost 272 today,but still posted its biggest monthly gain since 1987 and the largestmonthly percentage gain in almost a century.The S&P 500 was off 17 but also had its biggest percentage increase since1928. The NASDAQ finished off seven after seeing its largest percentagehike since 2001.Calls are growing tonight in Iran for retribution following theassassination of the scientist who founded its nuclear program. And most ofthat rage is directed at Israel and the U.S.Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot shows us tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A key figure in Iran's covert nuclear weapons program was buried inTehran. Top Iranian officials present at the funeral, pledged that thedeath of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh would only spur them on.BRIG. GEN. AMIR HATAMI, DEFENSE MINISTER OF IRAN (through translator): Wewill be more determined, and our resolve will become sturdier forcontinuing your path.PALKOT: This is Iran now claims the Iranian scientist was killed on Fridayoutside of Tehran by a satellite operated remote-controlled machine gunmounted on the back of a pickup truck which was then detonated.Earlier, officials said, gunmen committed the assassination.REAR ADM. ALI SHAMKHANI, SECRETARY, SUPREME NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL,IRAN(through translator): What happen, fortunately, the operation was verycomplicated using electronic devices.PALKOT: Despite Israeli denials, Iran continues to blame that country,claiming today, Israeli markings were found on the murder weapon.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has called for definitivepunishment. Iranian President Rouhani said Israel would pay, but maybe notright now.HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): At the right time,the relevant Iranian officials will respond to this crime.PALKOT: An attack by Iran on Israeli tourists in the gulf region or on theIsraeli port city of Haifa, which one Iranian newspaper called for couldexperts say trigger a military response from Israel and or the U.S. Israeliembassies are on alert.K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The Iranians willdo something, my guess, is they won't be able to escalate it in any greatway.PALKOT: The real concern for Tehran could be that any counter-attack couldjeopardize a hope for revival of the Iran nuclear deal. The Trumpadministration pulled out of it. The incoming Biden administration favorsit but might find it hard in the midst of new clashes.(END VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT (on camera): White House adviser and Trump's son-in-law, JaredKushner is headed to Saudi Arabia and Qatar this week, adding to an alreadynervous region. Bret.BAIER: Greg, thank you.We are just learning the Pentagon is disbanding its Defeat-ISIS Task Force.The director of that unit, Christopher Mayer has resigned. Pentagonofficials say they have successfully destroyed the terror group. Thereorganization is part of the Trump administration's desire to declare thewars in Iraq and Afghanistan over.Up next, the president's most recent pick for the U.S. Supreme Court posesan interesting question in the administration's push to exclude illegalimmigrants from the census. We'll explain.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 2 in St. Louis says a local company starts sellingthe first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.The test has not been approved yet by the Food and Drug Administration. Itis aimed at people 60 and older who are having memory problems are beingevaluated for Alzheimer's.Fox 5 in San Diego as the Navy says it will decommission a warship severelydamaged after suspected arson. The USS Bonhomme Richard burned for morethan four days in July fully repairing it to warfighting capabilities wouldcost up to $3 billion and take as long as seven years.And this is a live look at Salt Lake City from Fox 13, one of the bigstories there tonight. A mysterious silver monolith that was illegallyplaced in the Utah desert has disappeared less than 10 days after it wasdiscovered.The Bureau of Land Management says it received credible reports the three-sided stainless steel structure was removed Friday.

Suspect Fernando Lopez is accused of stabbingfive people at a church, killing two and injuring three last week.The U.S. Supreme Court is considering arguments about President Trump'spolicy to exclude illegal immigrants from the Census. It's a huge issuebecause the Census determines congressional representation and fundingdecisions in each state. Correspondent David Spunt has an update tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  There are approximately 11 millionundocumented immigrants in the United States, and the Trump administrationwants to remove all of them from the 2020 Census. In one of his last actsin office, the president hopes to take the modified final count and pass iton to Congress.JEFFREY WALL, ACTING U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL:  The real fight is substantivehow much discretion a president has.SPUNT:  But removing millions of people means removing millions of dollarsfrom states and cities. Texas, California and New Jersey are just some ofthe states expected to lose funding and potentially congressionalrepresentation if the Trump team wins in court. Justices from both wings ofthe court appeared skeptical of the administration's ask, especially undera tight deadline.SAMUEL ALITO, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:  There are only 31 days left in theyear. To exclude the 10.5 million seems to me a monumental task.SONIA SOTOMAYOR, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:  We have to decide as a matter oflaw whether the word "persons" as used in the statute and Constitution wholive here permits the exclusion of illegal aliens.SPUNT:  This case marks the first big test for Justice Amy Coney Barrett asit relates to executive power and how much power the man who appointed herto the bench can harness. This is the first time in history a president hasunilaterally moved to remove millions of undocumented from the Census, andJustice Barrett questioned the administration's move.AMY CONEY BARRETT, FEDERAL APPEALS COURT NOMINEE:  A lot of the historicalevidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your positions.(END VIDEO TAPE)SPUNT:  The president is supposed to receive the final Census numbers byDecember 31st, but that date could slide because of the pandemic. If itslides past January 20th, President Biden could withdraw the case from theSupreme Court and keep the 11 million in the final census count.

And that has let to a new super PAC being formed by some advisers toDonald Trump Jr. They plan on airing ads that feature him to help turn outthe vote.

During that signing, "Hail to the Chief" playedon his phone. Just moments ago, the president tweeting out that, true, thatthe governor of Arizona has abandoned the people of Arizona.Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for "The WashingtonTimes," Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National PublicRadio, and Ben Domenech, publisher of "The Federalist."Charlie, obviously, Trump supporters believe there is a route here, thereis a way, because the president says that. The legal options are narrowing.However, they are following up and still filing these suits in the hopesthat it gets to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, these Republicangovernors are certifying elections.CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, "WASHINGTON TIMES":  Yes. And, of course,that, at the end of the day, what happens is when states certify elections,that becomes something that becomes binding. And that will, I suspect, bethe way this -- the way this finally ends.But, between now and then, the president has every right to challenge everysingle one of these things. We began with people saying that there was nofraud whatsoever. Now it's moved to there may have been illegal votes andfraud, but not enough to change the outcome of the election. Whatever thecase is, the president has the right to and should fight this through everylegal means that he has at his disposal.Obviously, that runs up against some problems in a place where we have therunoffs still in Georgia. But the president needs to make his case that thebiggest threat to his agenda if, in fact, he does end up losing the WhiteHouse, the biggest threat to his agenda is a Democratic-controlled Senate.And I think that he can make that case. And, in the meantime, PresidentTrump is the first guy to come along in a very long time to fight for thesepeople, and they appreciate that every step of the way.BAIER:  Let me go back to Arizona. Part of the plan, it seems, is to holdthese hearings in front of state legislators to hope that they do notofficially get the electors to sit down from those states. Here is a littleclip of a back and forth. It's Colonel Phil Waldron and Rudy Giuliani.Waldron is one of the people testifying about the system that they arelooking into, the Dominion voting systems.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COL. PHIL WALDRON:  Our people looked at spider graphs on the Dominionnetwork on Election Day and showed the increased web traffic, Internettraffic on Election Day for Dominion servers.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  So on Election Day, Dominionwas communicating by Internet?WALDRON:  Correct.GIULIANI:  Contrary to what Mr. Krebs said or thought.WALDRON:  That is, that is correct.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  And you hear Mr. Krebs mentioned there. That was Krebs who wasinterviewed, Chris Krebs, by "60 Minutes." Ben, and their thought here isthat these systems were plugged into the Internet and somehow adjusted onthe vote totals. And we just haven't seen the forensics. This team saysthey have looked into it. We are looking into it as well.BEN DOMENECH, "THE FEDERALIST":  I don't think that anybody has seen theforensic data yet to prove anything along those lines. The bigger issuethat I think has to be addressed here is that so much of these questionsneeded to be looked at earlier in terms of the arguments that the presidentand his supporters are making now, namely that when they are looking backat all the different steps that were taken in key states in terms ofauthenticating signatures and looking at where people were registered,there were a lot of objections that they needed to make months ago giventhe way this was rushed through in terms of mail-in balloting being such abig issue in this cycle.I think that in a certain sense they have removed their ability to provethe kind of fraud that would be significant enough to change anything here,and I think that Governor Ducey understands that that's something that isnot going to be provable in a court of law or in a political sense.BAIER:  And Mara, you get into a case in Georgia where you have aRepublican governor now under attack by a Republican president, and aRepublican secretary of state who is under attack by a fellow Republicans.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes.BAIER:  And he's getting ready to run two runoffs in a state where theSenate balance of power hangs.LIASSON:  Yes. That's the big question -- will this kind of tension betweenthe Republican president and Republican officials, particularly Georgia,depress Republican turnout? The president is saying that the system isrigged, that you can't get a fair result, so why should Republicans turnout?Meanwhile, he is going to go and campaign for these Republicans. You've gothis son starting a super PAC to help them. It's really, really confusing.These are, in most cases, Republican state officials, many Republicanjudges who are saying we're just not seeing the evidence that the Trumplawyers say they have. And, as you heard the president say to MariaBartiromo, his last play is to get it to the Supreme Court. He didn't soundthat confident that they would pick it up. And the question is, would theSupreme Court be willing to overturn the results of an election that is somany lower court judges have said was free and fair?BAIER:  Yes, and, Charlie, Chris Krebs on "60 Minutes" we hope have him onto ask specifics as well, but went through the paper balloting in eachstate and how he just didn't think any of this in the broad sense is at thelevel of a massive fraud.HURT:  Certainly, it is an uphill battle for the president. But, as I saidearlier, I do think it's his right to pursue every legal option that he hasat his disposal, and at the end of the day, as the states certify theseelections, I think those certifications will end up standing.But of course, none of this takes away from the fact that there are real,genuine problems when you have mass mail-in ballots. It is fraught, andobviously this has been going on long before Trump was around. And it's aproblem that does need to be addressed, and Republicans have not done avery effective job before now of addressing those very issues.BAIER:  Ben, very quickly, what we are hearing is that the president wantsto run again in 2024 and may be planning some kind of announcement even onInauguration Day.DOMENECH:  I think a big part of how that plays could relate to what goeson in Georgia in these Senate races, which will indicate whether Trumpwants to pull away from the GOP, he was always someone who took it over, orwhether he wants to be seen as the leader of the party.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much. When we come back,celebrating our veterans.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a big surprise.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy Thanksgiving, daddy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One more time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Look at this. Military Police Commander Patrick Potter has beendeployed overseas since January. Thanksgiving Day he gave his family aspecial homecoming, surprising his three kids at their house in RhodeIsland. That is awesome.And police officers, firefighters, and military veterans in Alabamacelebrating the birthday of Arlen (ph) Patterson (ph) over the weekend. TheWorld War II veteran turned 95.
