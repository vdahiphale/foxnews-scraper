LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington. I am Laura Ingraham. This is "The Ingraham Angle." What a line-up we have for you tonight, including a squirming James Comey on the Fox News hot seat.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Were you cleaning out your sock drawer on Saturday night?

HANNITY: Have a great show. By the way, our new throw out. We'll figure it out tomorrow.
INGRAHAM: Good evening from Washington. I am Laura Ingraham, and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. We have shocking new details about some of the so- called innocent asylum-seekers camped out at our border. As attorneys for these migrants are screaming about the U.S. not letting them in. Plus, our new crime blotter series kicks off tonight with an outrageous example of imported crime -- a first read about it, it sounds like something out of "Scarface." Plus, we will rip the mask out off of the media's free-speech double standard, especially in the White House press corps. Speaking of which, the death of comedy and decency. That is the focus of tonight's "Angle."

MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN: Good evening. Here we are, the White House Correspondents Dinner. Like a porn star says when she's about to have with a Trump, "Let's get this over with." That's what you are getting tonight.

INGRAHAM: At least she had a really good voice. Well, they got much more of it. The president wasn't in attendance. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, and others from the White House were at the dinner. This was supposed to be an evening to celebrate the First Amendment. But of all the comedians the Correspondents Association could have hired, they turned to the obscure Michelle Wolf.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: Trump thinks yarn sales are through the roof. After Trump got elected, women started knitting those (inaudible) hats. When I first saw them, I was like, (inaudible). I guess mine just has lot more yarn on it. Yes. It should have done more research before you got me to do this.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: That's an understatement. The choice of an aspirational comedian like Wolf, with one HBO special, I guess, a few writing gigs to her credit, tells us a lot about the Correspondents Association. To some of those who cover the White House, let's face it, we know it, are brimming with hatred of this president and all that he represents. Let's face it, he embarrassed them with his electoral victory and he continues to prove them wrong day after day, and he ends up revealing them for who they really are. I have to say, guys, when you see the faces of the crowd at the Correspondents Dinner, when they were cutting away from the C-Span coverage, it was -- I was thinking, wait a second, can we just have a full screen and freeze it there? Because we need to see the exact -- we need to see the exact facial expressions on the reporters who are laughing at the particular times which we are about to highlight. When you compare what she was saying to what happened when the president was speaking in Michigan, wow.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: By the way, is this better than that phony Washington White House Correspondents Dinner? Is this more fun? I could be up there tonight smiling like I love when they are hitting you, shot after shot, these people, they hate your guts.

INGRAHAM: Well, for this and other statements like it, the press will forever despise Trump. Unlike other Republican presidents who ran to the nearest corner and did not apologize when the media attacks, Trump returned fire. By choosing Wolf as their avatar, the D.C. media elites have confirmed their bias for anyone who will give them even the slightest benefit of the doubt. Boy, was I glad my kids and I weren't watching.

WOLF: I know people really want me to go after Trump tonight, but I think we should give the president credit when he deserves it. Like, he pulled out of the Paris agreement. And I think he should get credit for that because he said he was going to pull out and then he did at that that is a refreshing quality in a man. People say romance is dead. Mike Pence is what happens when Anderson Cooper isn't gay. Mike Pence is also very anti-choice. He thinks abortion is murder, which, first of all, don't knock until you try it. Then when you do try it, really knock it. You know, you got to get that baby out of there.

INGRAHAM: Tasteless. Aggressively unfunny. It was frankly sad for her. I thought about that a while after. Of course, it was insulting to half the country who believes in protecting innocent lives. Debbie Wasserman Schultz doppelganger, and between dropping f-bombs, attacked Sarah Huckabee Sanders looks, who of course, was seated at the head table with her.

INGRAHAM: Now imagine if this were someone, let's say, a few years back attacking Susan Rice or Valerie Jarrett or Samantha Powers or any adult child of the Democratic president. The fact that no one heckled her, that is the tradition of great comedy, haggling back, and that so if you walked out during Wolf's 20-minute rant, it's frankly astounding. This, after the "Me Too Movement?" Conservatives and even some reasonable liberals, we got to give it to them, were stunned by the audacity of what they saw.

INGRAHAM: AP reporter, Meg Kinnard, captured it best when she wrote on Twitter, "If the WHCD dinner did anything tonight, it made the chasm between journalists and those who don't trust us even wider, and those of us faced in the red states who work hard every day to prove our objectivity will have to deal with it." This revealing episode has shown the American people that hateful intolerance of the press corps and those we trust to cover the news. Kennard is right. It will take a long time to prove their objectivity after this heinous display.

The fact that the Correspondents Association is now talking about reformatting their dinner, rather than just doing what they need to do, which is soul-searching, about bias and the fact that it exists, just demonstrates the problem anew. A filthy comedienne and a tainted dinner are symptoms of our deeper issue, animus against tradition, against conservatism, against this president. That is the thing that taints their coverage of this president and all our news on a daily basis. And that's the "Angle."
Joining me now for reaction are two men who attended the White House Correspondents Association Dinner, from New York is Juan Williams, a cohost of Fox News' "THE FIVE" and with me here in studio, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Matt was here when my prompter went down.

MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: It looked good.

I think they walked out about the same time you did. They were sitting -- you were right near the front, they were sitting kind of on the side. They walked out. They were shocked. This is the first and are they attended.
SCHLAPP: Can you imagine, you are sitting there at this dinner where the president has decided not to go, and you think the press is going to get it right. They are going to look like they have the upper hand, they have grace, instead, they go from the swamp to the gutter and start making jokes about abortion.

That was the first moment when my wife and I, we looked at each other and said, what is this? Why are we here? And then the pummeling of Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Sanders, who are my wife's colleagues, she was like, this is it. I got to get out of here. I'm not the type of person to walk out of anything, but there comes a point when you just have to say, we don't have to put up with this crap.
INGRAHAM: I hate to do this to our viewers, however, we must play this for Juan Williams. This is what Wolf said about Kellyanne and Ivanka. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: We should definitely talk about the women in the Trump administration. There is Kellyanne Conway. Man, she has the perfect last name for what she does, Conway. You guys got to stop putting Kellyanne on your shows. All she does is lie. If you don't give her a platform, she has nowhere to lie. It's like that old saying, if a tree falls in the woods, how do we get Kelly and under that tree? I'm not suggesting she gets hurt, just stuck. There is also of course Ivanka. She's the diaper genie of the administration. On the outside, she looks sweet, but the inside, it still (inaudible).

INGRAHAM: Juan, this is the "Me Too" Movement era, we are all for strong independent women, who speak their minds except if they are conservative. 
 I know you thought this was hilarious. You praised this. You thought it was great. Tell me why that in your worldview is funny.
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, "THE FIVE": I didn't think the stuff with Sarah Huckabee Sanders was funny because Sarah was seated right there, Laura, and I thought it made everyone in the room uncomfortable. Matt can tell you, I think everybody visibly was worried that Sarah might cry or get up and walk out.
It just made for a huge fuehrer at a time when that was unnecessary because it had a sensitive, she was kind of on the hot seat while the camera was on her. But in general, I don't understand that you see this as evidence of liberal media bias.

When the president -- when President Trump says horrible things about a conservative, the attractiveness of Carly Fiorina or Heidi Cruz, I don't see people saying, that is evidence of right-wing bias against women, because he won the nomination even after he said those things.
In fact, when you look at the comments that came from Michelle Wolf, a lot of them were darts right at the media saying, you know what, you guys are profiting from Trump, you guys make money off of Trump, and you should -- 
INGRAHAM: What she was doing, Juan, she was saying, you need to be harder on Trump. So that was more evidence of her bias. Hold on. She was not criticizing the hosts on MSNBC for being slavishly left wing. She was saying they weren't being left-wing enough with her criticism. That is why it was a problem.
WILLIAM: You missed something. She said specifically about CNN. All you guys cover is Trump, Russia, scandal. Does that is the entirety of everything going on in the world.

WILLIAMS: What did Trump do to Heidi Cruz, Carly Fiorina?
INGRAHAM: We are not talking about Trump. We are talking about the press corps, which is supposed to be objective. They invite an entertainer on and they are going to be getting as good as they get. That is fine. There was not the same type of treatment. It was kind of the same type of treatment they gave Obama, which was a few jokes and they were fun, jokes at the entertainers, joking about --

That is the way it goes. I think what the American people saw last night is exactly why they hate the D.C. liberal media elite. That is why they hate them.
INGRAHAM: That is why their approval rating is half of what Trump says.
SCHLAPP: We remember the deplorable moment and what the White House press corps said, because we support Trump, everything about us is deplorable. It's fair game because we support the president.

CHRIS COUMO, CNN ANCHOR: She's joking, he's actually telling the truth.
STELTER: She wasn't talking about Sarah Sanders looks. Michelle Wolf's argument is, I was talking about her, quote, "despicable behavior." Everything is upside down. Frankly, comedy is supposed to be uncomfortable. Maybe it's a good thing people in that room were uncomfortable.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, you know what I thought was uncomfortable is reading some of Michelle Wolf's tweets that she deleted. One of them comparing Serena Williams to looking like a man, looking like Lebron James, I guess, which was wild.

Other things she said about Eric Trump, that he is an abortion, that Trump must be pro-abortion, pro-choice because Eric Trump -- she tweeted that and she deleted thousands of her tweets apparently last June according to the reporting today. These White House Correspondents folks, they don't even know how to vet their own people.
WILLIAMS: Laura, I just want to do a little history. You forget that Don Imus came on, he was a comedian during the Clinton era, with a Democrat, and right in front of Clinton and his wife, started talking about extramarital affairs and making very tawdry jokes. That is a Democrat -- and you say -- 
INGRAHAM: That was 1996.
WILLIAMS: OK, Larry Wilmore, I think his use of the n-word in front of Obama, I found it offensive.
INGRAHAM: That was stupid.
WILLIAMS: That contradicts what you are saying.
INGRAHAM: That's one example.

SCHLAPP: There's a big difference between what happened last night and what happened the previous dinners. The big difference was Sarah Huckabee Sanders is sitting there as a staffer. That was a moment for the press corps to do the right thing, to treat her with respect for coming there and being in a very difficult position.
Instead, they bullied her, they went after her, they tried to mock her. The American people watched, guess what? It was probably a good night for the conservative movement, but I still think it's a disgusting display of the press being biased.
WILLIAMS: I just think people are looking to manufacture anger and indignation, this is an opportunity to feed the grievance industry.
INGRAHAM: Juan, when you make fun of an abortion -- 
WILLIAMS: I didn't like that. I'm just telling you -- 
INGRAHAM: That's it. When you do that, when you're capable of that, you lose it. That is ridiculing people's face.
WILLIAMS: Laura, let me just tell you, she went after Ted Kennedy for Chappaquiddick --

INGRAHAM: It's no secret that most journalists lean left, or that they would find a vulgar and far left dinner speaker so funny. But the White House Correspondents Association extols its commitment to the First Amendment and an independent media.
How independent is the White House press corps that is so overwhelmingly leftist? How can it be independent? How committed to free speech as a group that only invites comedians to their marquee dinner who attacked the right?
Let's examine this hypocrisy with Jeffrey Lord of the American Spectator, Lee Habeeb, host of "Our American Stories," and Ari Fleischer, who is George W. Bush's first press secretary. Great is the all of you tonight.
Let's start with you, Ari. Did you go to the dinner? You probably didn't go. You've been to enough of those things. I don't know if you there or not.
ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I haven't been to one of those -- I'm happy to report.
INGRAHAM: So, what was your reaction when you first started seeing the clips role in?
FLEISCHER: Frankly, Laura, until I saw it on your show, I had no idea how vulgar it was really was. I hate seeing a lot of the excerpts, things that were said about Kellyanne, things that were said about Sarah Huckabee, but I did not know how bad it was. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
A real problem here is the prices killing themselves. They just don't get it. They are an industry in decline and they are in decline because half of America, the conservative half, does not trust them.
Events like this just make it worse and the press still doesn't understand how bad last night was. When you hear Juan Williams defend it, when you hear one of the most reasonable liberals defend it, as you pointed out, Laura, scan the crowd, the laughter, the press doesn't get it.
INGRAHAM: Lee, I want to go to you. You are my old executive producer and radio and partner in crime 17 years ago, back to law school. Lee, it was your idea to play a lot of these sound bites tonight.
You said, a lot of people didn't see this. They have to see just how vulgar and low it was to understand how far we've sunk with the media and the so-called defense of the First Amendment. The double standard here is glaring for anyone who wants to see it, about the treatment of women, the "Me Too Movement," "I am woman, hear me roar," all of that.
LEE HABEEB, HOST, "OUR AMERICAN STORIES": You know, what's funny, Laura, is for the last few weeks we've heard the press excoriated for lack of vetting by the White House. They didn't do a proper job with the Veterans Affairs gentleman who was ultimately dismissed and yet they could not vet this comedian?
Don't they have YouTube? Don't they have Google? Can't they watch this woman's performance on "The Daily Show"? What is fascinating, Laura, what Juan missed is that 95 percent of these jokes were in better Republicans. 
 She did not spread it around. She just targeted mostly women.
Sixty seven minutes straight were vile, repulsive jokes aimed -- and they weren't jokes. They were attacks aimed at women. These weren't just jokes. It was like a public shaming. It was just disgraceful. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
To listen to the audience' laugh, and we wish we could see who was laughing and at what, because these jokes were disgraceful, and the laughs continued. and they continued. On the key here, Laura, there was a winner here. They were two winners.
One was a comedian because my goodness, she's going to get a really big deal with HBO. She'll be following Bill Maher in the next three months. 
 She was playing to her audience, illiberal set of journalists, and Trump, by the way, was a winner to come of the smartest man not in the room. He was playing to his audience, America.
INGRAHAM: Jeffrey Lord, you wrote a piece for "The Spectator" about this. 
 This was supposed to be about the First Amendment and beating back those who would want to intimidate people from speaking out on any issue, yet there was something desperately missing at Saturday night's dinner.
JEFFREY LORD, "THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR": That's right, first I have to tell you, breaking news, the Federal Elections Commission is starting to investigate the White House Correspondents Association for a multimillion dollar contribution to the Trump campaign in 2020. You see these clips that you play, all through the election season, I guarantee.
INGRAHAM: Let's go through 2018, first, Jeffrey.
LORD: Good point. You are absolutely right, Laura. This is the kind of thing -- and you should know that I asked the president of the White House Correspondents Association several days ahead of the dinner whether they would specifically be defending conservatives by name, I included you, Sean Hannity, Kevin Williams, and I got no response.
Total, complete silence. This is the serious thing here. Basically, this boils down to free speech for me, but not for thee, and when push comes to shove, they are not fair for conservatives. That is a real serious problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

You see it not just in television and radio, but you see it on college campuses. Good Lord, when Ben Shapiro needs serious police protection and there is a riot just to give a speech in a college campus, or Ann Coulter has to cancel something, because of a threat of violence, where are these people? There is not a peep to be heard from them and it's disgraceful.
INGRAHAM: Ari, I want to go to you. Whether it is this comedian ridiculing an abortion or talking about knocking the baby out, the first daughter, Ivanka Trump, is described in the most disgusting manner, I think those are gifts to Americans who might be kind of -- oh, it's a midterm election cycle, I'm not going to to get out and vote.
I think the Democrats tend to always take it too far. They go too far to the left and they end up offending people who might not even be all that political, but they find this gross. They find it's gross.
This new millennial poll, looks like 16,000 registered voters 18-34 shows their support for Democrats over Republicans has slipped by about 9 percentage points over the last two years, 46 percent overall.
They increasingly say the Republican Party is a better steward of the economy. I think these Democrats, Ari, ought to be really careful about the suppose it woke moment we might have here.
FLEISCHER: I want to continue on the dinner and the connection to the Democrats is not as direct. It was the press that did this, not the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party loves these dinners because they like to laugh at these jokes. I think the future of this dinner, if it even has a future, it should be Democrats only, Laura.
Republicans don't go, elected officials don't go, staff don't go. 
 Certainly, President Trump won't go. I remember when I did used to go to the dinner and the humor actually was pretty good back then, this was 15 years ago. It wasn't as cutting or nasty.

Even then, it had a red carpet, Hollywood celebrities, preparties, post parties, how much on earth did they pay this comedian for this? At a time when newsrooms are going broke and laying people off, how much did they lay out for all of the entertainment, the lavishness?
This is not what the press is supposed to be about. That is why the prices distancing themselves, especially from the blue-collar workers who elected Donald Trump, people and the Democrats, and the press never saw their story prior to 2016. This is the press' greatest problem. They are so disconnected from their readers and their viewers. It's one of the biggest reasons why trust in the media is dropping and people don't watch or read them in the same numbers they used to. 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Lee Habeeb? 
LEE HABEEB, VP OF CONTENT, SALEM MEDIA GROUP: Laura, 92 percent of the jokes were aimed at Republicans and 92 percent of the journalists are Democrats, and a lot of Americans are starting to see journalists as an arm of the Democrat Party, and that is really the problem. They got to get out in the country and meet the American people more and respect them. 
INGRAHAM: Jeff Lord, last word. 
JEFFREY LORD, "THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR": Last year I was at this dinner and the president was here in Harrisburg, and I was getting texts during the dinner while everybody was mocking the president at the dinner from a reporter covering the rally here and talking to people, and she said he is more popular now than he was when he was running for election. And of course he carried Pennsylvania. This kind of thing shows the real divide here, and it's pretty sad but it's pretty definite, no question. 
INGRAHAM: And Donald Trump said I would rather be with the real people than the Washington people, and I think he nailed it. Guys, fantastic panel. Thanks so much. 
And by the way, the media have one story about what's happening on the border, speaking of bias, and they are sticking to it. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She says that her plan now is to wait and pray to god that she is not rejected at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Never mind the hordes of men seeking asylum. The media want you to believe our immigration laws are an assault on women and children. So they do care about women. We'll reveal the coordinated effort next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: FOX News has learned the DOJ has filed complaints against 11 members of the illegal immigrant caravan for trying to enter the country illegally near San Diego. But they're all law abiding. But hundreds are still trying to enter the country legally by claiming asylum. And their advocates are complaining that the U.S. is moving too slowly to meet their demands. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICOLE RAMOS, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: We can build a base in Iraq in under a week. We can't process 200 refugees? I don't believe it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I don't know what base she is talking about. That is, by the way, one of a small army of American attorneys who are coaching -- oh, sorry, advising hundreds of illegal immigrants mostly from Honduras but others from other countries as well. 
There is a growing concern, though, that the attorneys of course are just helping the asylum seekers game the system. We were on this all last week here on "The Angle." Let's discuss this with former acting director for ICE, John Torres in studio with me, and in San Francisco attorney Joe Alioto Veronese. Good to see both of you. 
John, let's start with you. We have a massive series of problems here. We don't just have the 200 people who are at the border now camped out in these tents. We have an orchestrated invasion of our country, sorry, being coached and being pushed by, frankly, a religious organization, by NGOs, and by lawyers who are giving them scripts for what to say to claim asylum. 
 Your reaction to what you have seen with these videos? 
JOHN TORRES, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: What we are really looking at here is fraud that has been perpetrated for year by a number of different years when they coach people how to pass a credible fear test so that they can ultimately get political asylum here in the United States. 
INGRAHAM: Credible fear, you have to say you are being persecuted for a number of reasons. And what happens is they then are processed into the country, people think, you are outside of the country, how do you get in? 
 You approach the port of entry, you approach a customs official, inspector, and then you plead your case. And then you are processed into the country. 
 And then if you are an unaccompanied minor, because of that case in 1997, you are released into the country. If you are parent of a minor, you are released into the system. Two court decisions out of the court in the ninth circuit. 
So this is a problem with the way Congress has not acted on this, Democrats and Republicans, but mostly Democrats. Joe I want to go to you on this because you live in a sanctuary state. We have a lot of Democrats running for tight Senate races who are moderate Democrats but who vote in favor of sanctuary cities, who vote against Kate's law. I'm thinking of people like Jon Tester and Montana, Claire McCaskill was against I believe Kate's law as well, others. They claim to be tough on law enforcement. But I think most people seeing these pictures are saying to themselves, I'm sorry, God bless them, but 200 people all at once claiming asylum is a bit much. 
JOE ALITO VERONESE, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: As John will attest to this, these numbers are not statistically significant. We have thousands of people that try to get over the border on a daily basis. So having 150 people -- and this is an annual pilgrimage that has been happening -- 
INGRAHAM: Pilgrimage. It sounds better when you call it a pilgrimage. 
VERONESE: Let's call it a caravan. The people are coming. These are the quote-unquote "rapists," drug dealers, the worst of the worst. That's not what this is. But it plays into the Hollywood narrative let's send the troops to the border and -- 
INGRAHAM: Hold on. Hold on, 11 of these guys had already been deported from the United States. Trying to reenter the country is a felony. You are not allowed to reenter the country. They've already been deported out of the country. Now they want the free pass back into the country, claiming asylum. Are you kidding me? This is an embarrassment to our country. This is a travesty for the hardworking people of your state who are putting up with this emergency homelessness in San Francisco and L.A. 
 And the mayor of L.A., Garcetti, announced today they are spending more than double on homelessness next year, $430 million on homelessness. You don't think you have a big enough problem already in your state? 
VERONESE: We have a very big problem with homelessness in the state of California, no question about it. 
INGRAHAM: Let's add 150 more, OK. 
VERONESE: It's a travesty what's happening with immigration. But even the president said today, he was quoting the failed immigration policies on how Congress has just failed us on immigration. And so these people aren't acting outside of the law. They are acting consistent with the law with the exception of the 11 -- 
INGRAHAM: We don't know that. We don't know all their backgrounds. Most of them are fleeing economic conditions. That means millions, tens of millions of people, if not probably a billion people would want to come to the United states. 
John, I want to go to you on what's happening with -- hold on a second -- with the media's role in all of this. We have a sound bite or a series of sound bites from what has happened. We are going to play one main sound bite, and this is, I believe, from CNN. Let's watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm asking her what she's feeling. She is saying she is just waiting for immigration officials to open the door. She's got three children that she is coming with. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here you will see mothers, you will see their babies, infant children, all sleeping here, waiting for asylum. All of the families here say they are trying to escape the violence. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TORRES: The media has been portraying the sympathetic stories for years because -- 
INGRAHAM: Sob stories, immigration sob stories. 
TORRES: Right, exactly. They don't necessarily cover the gritty crime part of it with the same intensity as they do the sob stories. So how many times does somebody come across the country illegally, commit crimes, impact people that live here in the United States, all at taxpayer expense, not to include the impact it has on families of a violent crime? And sometimes it gets covered but not with the same -- 
INGRAHAM: Joe, I will say that when you think about the people who wait, we are focusing on them waiting at the border when they waited for days now, how about the people who wait for years because they do it legally, coming to the United States for valid legal reasons? And I think a lot of those, they call into my radio show, they watch this stuff, and sorry but their sympathy is pretty thin because they did it the right way. And I think they see these photos. The media thinks they're helping the cause. 
 I think it's turning Americans after this, and we wish them well but we can't take in the world. That just the way it is. Go ahead, last word.
VERONESE: But these people are doing it legally. These aren't people who are illegal aliens. They are people who are going through an asylum process that was set up by our failed immigration policies. So if we want to fix it, let's go ahead and fix it instead of addressing some of the other issues, instead of making a big deal about the caravan coming, let's actually fix the immigration policy. 
And if you don't like the way this process is set up, let's change it. I agree, it's not a great process. These people should be seeking asylum from their home countries, not coming through Mexico and sitting at our borders and doing it. But they are unable to do it because of the current policy. 
INGRAHAM: They should seek asylum in Mexico. If they traveled all through Mexico, they could have stayed there. But they didn't want to be in Mexico.
VERONESE: Many have. 
INGRAHAM: A lot of them were deported from Mexico which was a story that the media did not cover. I think they should embed not with the caravan, John. They should embed in two blocks from here where we have a homeless shelter where we have people living under the bridges here who are veterans and people who are down on their luck who are American citizens. CNN doesn't embed with them very often. Guys, fantastic panel. And you made some good points, by the way, Alioto. I am going to give that to you. 
President Trump reportedly had sharp words for German Chancellor Merkel over trade and NATO when she visited last week. Our new ambassador to Germany joins is next with the inside scoop in our exclusive interview. 
And later, our new crime blotter series kicks off with one bad hombre. 
 We're going to take you inside his underground world featuring drugs, guns, fast cars, luxury condo, famous rappers, and even a connection, yes, to 
 China, coming up. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: French President Emmanuel Macron spent three days with President Trump last week, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel got only three hours. Let's get insight into what is really going on and welcome the newly confirmed U.S. ambassador to Germany, I'd never thought I'd say that, Ric, Ric Grenell from Los Angeles. How are you doing? I have a stein of beer to toast you, but I guess I can't do that on national TV. How are you doing? Are you feeling good? 
RICHARD GRENELL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO GERMAN: I'm feeling great. And the most important part is today I am four and a half years cancer free, coming up on five years. I just got that diagnosis today. 
INGRAHAM: I saw that. I saw that tweet. You and I are thrivers, cancerous thrivers. So I was happy to see that. Ric and I have only known each other for 25 years. Full disclosure, we shouldn't say how long, Ric but a long time. 
(LAUGHTER)
GRENELL: I was, like, seven. 
INGRAHAM: You were basically in utero still. So let's talk about a bunch of things. I want to talk about Merkel with Trump, but I have to play something for you because I hadn't heard this soundbite until we were getting ready for our show. This was Menendez, Senator Menendez, before your confirmation vote. Let's watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, (D) NEW JERSEY: Mr. Grenell's derogatory comments about women are simply unacceptable for anyone to make in public let alone a diplomat. And I would go further. Not only do these tweets show bad judgment, they show us who Mr. Grenell really is and how comfortable he is publicly contributing his own brand of toxic political discourse. Will he do such things if he is confirmed and goes to Germany? Will he insult via his Twitter account the female chancellor of Germany? 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: I mean, Ric, I got to say, this was -- with Bob Menendez's past, that was one of the most hilarious moments. That is how desperate -- you send out a snarky tweet five years ago, I don't even know what it was about. How did you react to that? 
GRENELL: I haven't met Senator Menendez. I've never met him. He doesn't know me. I have reached out to him since confirmation to ask for a meeting, I would love to meet him. I'd love to talk to him about Germany. 
 I would love to have him see who I am and see that actually what he said on the floor is wrong. But I'm going to keep on and try to have that meeting. 
 I think once people get to know me, they see -- 
INGRAHAM: You are already a diplomat. Look at you. You are so diplomatic. Obviously at the U.N. as the attache at the U.N. for the United States. But let's talk now about what happened last week with Merkel. For our viewers who aren't all that into the E.U. politics and where she is versus Macron, why did that seem a little bit uncomfortable? 
 I said last week she looked like she had eaten some bad schnitzel, which is not diplomatic all of me to say, but that's why I'm not an ambassador. 
GRENELL: I have to say that watching Chancellor Merkel and President Trump negotiate, they clearly like each other. They clearly know each other. 
 But every American would be incredibly proud to see how Donald Trump negotiates. I've spent years watching presidents and secretaries of state really talk with they're in one-on-one meetings about moral arguments when it comes to foreign policy, what should be done. And we don't have just a pure moral argument from the president. We have multipronged arguments. 
And I have longed for the day to have a president to actually negotiates with all of America's strengths, our economic strengths, our agricultural strengths, our tariffs, all of the issues that we bring to the table need to be brought to the table in order to pressure the relationship for a better jobs record, for more jobs for Americans, for trade that expands. 
 And President Trump is really good at it, and so I think what you saw, any American who would see them negotiate -- 
INGRAHAM: She looked uncomfortable. She looked uncomfortable. It's OK. 
 She looked really uncomfortable to me. She did not look, Macron, they were slapping each other on the back. Maybe she wanted to spend more time with him. I don't know. 
GRENELL: I have to say when they were negotiating together and they were across the table, they were not uncomfortable. They clearly have a great friendship but they have some differences. 
INGRAHAM: OK, that's fine. One thing I find fun is to read the so-called foreign policy experts in Europe about what they think about Trump because they don't understand him, or they are concerned about him. This is 12 German experts, an op-ed about Trump. This is from October, last year. 
 "The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets, is in danger. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order." 
And Ric, I would say about that, yes, he is, and yes, he's right, because America needs to focus on keeping ourselves strong and helping our allies, but the multilateralism sometimes only goes so far. 
GRENELL: I think when you look back and you see candidate Donald Trump in the election, he was very clear about what taxpayers were getting and what they were tired of paying for because they don't always get their return that they expected. You look at agencies, multilateral agencies like the U.N. or NATO, and we have paid a significant amount, and I think it is the right question to say, are we getting enough? Is there enough U.S. 
 leadership? And that is exactly what President Trump brought to the table with Angela Merkel. 
But I do have to say this, Laura. When it was all done, when we were all finished with the press conference, the president took the chancellor up to the residence with the vice president and myself and gave a personal tour of the vice president -- of the residence, the presidential residence at the White House. That was the first time that the chancellor had been up there. It was shocking to hear that she had never been able to see the Lincoln Bedroom, never been able to see the Gettysburg Address. President Trump took her there. 
INGRAHAM: He wants to put on the charm offensive, he's really good at it. 
 We've told him charm works wonders. Tough but charm. Ric Grenell, congratulations. We'll be talking to you from Germany for sure, or in Germany. 
And up next, our crime blotter series begins with a bang. A tale of imported crime and a fast living suspect who is something like out of the film "Scarface" next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Tonight we begin our new crime blotter series, stories you won't see anywhere else on television. And we kick off with a series on a suspected illegal immigrant who can't seem to say no to crime. Victor Yanez agreed to cooperate with prosecutors two years ago after he was allegedly found with counterfeit prescription labels. But that didn't slow him down. Yanez was charged with marijuana possession and speeding last September, and when officers raided his girlfriend's luxury condo two weeks later, they say he was brandishing an AK-47. 
Although Yanez surrendered peacefully, officers say they found more than
 2,200 grams of marijuana, more than 1,000 grams of the club drug molly, and more than 100 counterfeit prescription labels. 
Let's bring in someone who knows all the sordid details, "Miami Herald" 
 reporter David Ovalle. David, great to see you. This is a wild story. I read this this morning, very early. And it does seem like it is something out of "Scarface." Tell me about this lovely gentleman. 
DAVID OVALLE, REPORTER, "THE MIAMI HERALD": It is certainly something out of Miami, 2018. We've had a lot of these cases of suspected drug dealers and convicted drug dealers who are younger folks. These are not the stock and trade cocaine toughs from the cocaine cowboy days of the 1980s, but these are younger people who are tech savvy, who know how to order drugs from China, from the Internet, from the dark web, people who know how to get marijuana from states where it's legal, and also know how to sell prescription strength cough syrup to a lot of the club scene down here. So it is sort of a new breed of drug dealers in Miami. It is not to say that the old cocaine days of the past are gone by any means -- 
INGRAHAM: But they are the cool crowd. They are the cool, what I'm saying they're the cool connected crowd. You've got his rapper friend. He had some trouble with the law back some years ago, not related to this. But he's connected. And the connection to China I think is something that Americans have no idea about, or very little idea about. And the drug trade from China with fentanyl and other drugs is getting worse and worse. 
 I know Miami has seen its share. But talk about how he managed to hook up with the Chinese connection. 
OVALLE: Well, he's not charged any of these Chinese connections in this case yet. But certainly they found some of the molly drugs, which are various chemicals that are made in Chinese labs and basically sent over here through the mail system disguised as different packages. At the "Miami Herald" we did a series a couple of years ago called "Pipeline China" where we chronicled all the different club drugs and the fentanyl coming over from China, it's easy as going on the internet. 
And we ha college students, we had veterans, we had strippers, we had all these people that were involved in bringing these drugs over to Miami, making it one of the largest synthetic drug capitals in the country. And certainly when the police raided his girlfriend's house, that was something that they were investigating. So certainly he is an interesting wrinkle in that old -- 
INGRAHAM: I have a question. We only have a few seconds left, but we keep hearing, marijuana legalization, we won't have a marijuana problem, but it was, what, 105 pounds of marijuana? 
OVALLE: It was 105 pounds of marijuana stuffed in three suitcases. The feds are still investigating it but it is believed to have come from somewhere on the west coast where marijuana is legal. 
INGRAHAM: We're going to keep tracking this. Great reporting from you, and especially we're going to be following this China connection with the drug trade as well. Underreported, but you're doing a great job for the 
 "Miami Herald." We'll be right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Before we go, let's take a look at a few tweets we received during the show. Maria tweets "I'm prochoice but I literally flinched in my seat after listening to that disgusting so called joke. I couldn't believe I was hearing such disgusting garbage. I was thinking about all those women who have been traumatized after having an abortion."
