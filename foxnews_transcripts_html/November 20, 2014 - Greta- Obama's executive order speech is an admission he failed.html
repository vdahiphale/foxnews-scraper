'Off the Record,' 11/20/14: A feckless executive order with the swipe of a pen doesn't solve the illegal immigration problem. Our president and lawmakers would rather fight than work on a bipartisan, real solution

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. As you listen to President Obama, consider this. His speech telling the nation he is going alone, signing an executive order, is an admission he failed. He failed every American.
But he is not alone. So did every politician in the House and the Senate because illegal immigration is not a sporting event for the political amusement. It's a very serious problem with serious consequences. An executive order, that can't fix it. Only a law can. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This executive order is just political drama. It doesn't solve anything. It just injects more uncertainty into an already broken system. Think about it. President Obama signs executive order with a swipe of his pen and the next president comes along two years from now and gets rid of it with a swipe of a pen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, as you can see, an executive order doesn't deliver the certainty that we need for a very serious issue. Tonight is just politics, just a way for President Obama to poke his political opponents in the eye. And if our leaders -- I mean, all our leaders -- really want to solve illegal immigration for this nation, they could. President Obama could not be asking for airtime tonight, or Republicans busy scurrying around strategizing for the response. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, they would all be rolling up their sleeves and doing real work, solving the problem, not this silly stuff. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
