DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five." 
Several big developments on immigration, house lawmakers rejecting a conservative bill introduced by house judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte. As for what's being called the compromise bill drafted by the Republican leadership, the vote on that is being delayed until tomorrow to try to shore up more support. Over at the White House, President Trump is continuing to going after Democrats after ending the controversial practice of separating migrant families.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My administration is also acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the southern border, loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democrats. People are suffering because of the Democrats. So, we've created and they've created and they've let it happen, a massive child smuggling industry. The worse everything looks, they think the better they're going to do with respect to the blue wave, which is turning out frankly to be a red wave if you look at the poll. The Democrats are causing tremendous damage and destruction and lives by not doing something about this. And they know that.

TRUMP: If we took zero tolerance away, you would be overrun. You'd have millions of people pouring through our border. If you took zero tolerance away, everybody would come right now. They'd be getting their little belongings, unfortunately, and they would be heading up. You would be -- you would have a run on this country the likes of which nobody has ever seen.

PERINO: And First Lady Melania Trump making a surprise visit to a detention center housing migrant children along the border in Texas. But her fashion choice appears to be overshadowing a trip. The first lady wearing a jacket bearing the words, I really don't care, do you? A spokesperson responding to media speculation saying it's a jacket. There was no hidden message. Having lived through mission accomplished for many years, I am sympathetic with the White House. Obviously, was not intended to show any sort of message. But back to the important thing at hand. Kimberly, the Republicans said we don't have enough support for either of these bills. We have to stop and try to figure out a way to do that. There's going to be a conference. I think they're meeting right now behind closed doors. This is the third behind closed doors meeting they have had on this week. What do you think will happen and will that vote get enough -- that vote get enough support tomorrow? 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I think, look, obviously, I'm for behind closed doors meeting. Hopefully they're working on it and they're building some, you know, coalition there. Getting some consensus to move. Obviously, they can tell that the American people want some resolution of this. The president would like something to come forward. However, I think it might be a little bit of a struggle because there is some pretty, you know, differing opinions and viewpoints and he also has his base he's thinking about. He has, obviously, this issue which is on a tremendous amount of political attention. You've got midterm elections coming up. You know he campaigned on getting things done and making sure that he was going to make positive changes. He's somebody who is very good at getting deals done. So, you know, I'm optimistic and that he's going to get involved in this and try very hard to push on it. He's got to get the votes. Right now they don't have them, but it doesn't mean that they won't get them. And as for the fashion statement, I mean, it's a jacket. Let's relax. 
PERINO: Jesse, the fact that the conservative bill passed today. The president said he supported both bills. But now that that one has failed, if it's possible if the president said I am for this bill, I will give you cover on this bill, you should vote for it, that it could pass?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: The president can only do so much with the house. I mean, the dirty little secret is the open borders, cheap labors, big business lobby has a lot of power over Republicans. And we're not going to get any help from the Democrats at all. So, there's just no consensus and there's nothing that's ever going to be done on immigration. I don't even think after the midterms it's ever going to get done. And the Democrats when they had a super majority under Barack Obama they did nothing on immigration. The Democrats just want to blame Republicans for the issue and score political point. But I don't think this whole separating families thing is a big winner for the Democrats. I think they've overplayed their hands. They've exposed themselves as complete open borders advocates. The president completely shut the deal down. He's keeping families together. Now they're complaining that they're abusing children. Melania goes down and now they're complaining about the jacket. You're never going to get a win on this issue. I think like a normal issue like gas prices, healthcare, jobs, those are the things that actually affect the lives of everyday Americans. Yes, migrant families will tug at your heart strings and makes you feel sad and you want to find a solution, but it's not going to be a driving issue for regular voters in the midterm elections. 
PERINO: And, Greg, I had Congressman Burgess on the 2 o'clock show today.

        }
      
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PERINO: . a doctor, a conservative guy, he wanted both bills to pass. He decided to vote for them. And he's on something called the immigration reform caucus. And I said, in the caucus do you actually have Democrats that are willing to come to the table on this? And he said no. That he has tried talking to them and that he can't get anywhere. And he does think that they just want to be obstructionist.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Gregg: Yeah, I don't think it's about the kids. It's always going to be about Trump. This is about 2016, and it's about 2018 and 2020. It's about elections. We know that what Trump does will never be enough. It will be seen as even less humane than what was before. So, the liberal opinion is this. If you split up families you're a Nazi, whether the family is pretend or not you're a Nazi. But if you keep them together you're worse than a Nazi. So they actually have no solution. Liberals become paralyzed when faced with having to solve a problem. And the media puts some notion before facts so they just contribute to it. 
So now you're having critics of Trump actually arguing against their own wishes. So, now, OK, we're going to keep the families together, or the pseudo families together, or whatever, you should be happy that they're now detained. Now that's awful. I have to give credit to CNN because I always bash CNN. But I said yesterday that a lot of these problems existed under Obama and they were really, really bad problems, but the media never talks about it. Finally, I think it was senator -- I can't remember the name of the senator -- Baldwin? But, Brook Baldwin asked a very simple question. Can we throw that?

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's a question for Democrats. So many people in this country are certainly outraged by the K-do's, and the thermal blankets, and the facilities housing these kids, you know. They were all there in 2014 under President Obama. And my question to you, Senator Baldwin, is did you speak up against them then?

PERINO: And, actually -- and before, Juan, Chuck Schumer has voted for wall funding before. And a lot of the money that is being talked about right now in the current bill that's under consideration is $25 billion, so not necessary for all new wall. A lot of it is to shore up and to approve parts of the wall that we already have. But he says now that he can't support it. 
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Right. And remember, there was a deal between Democrats and the president. The president was one who backed out of that deal a long time ago. So, I think, to the contrary, what Greg was saying, I think you have a situation where you have evidence here, Republicans have the majority in the house, Republicans have the majority in the senate, and what you have is fights among Republicans that are continuing to paralyze their ability to pass any legislation. I think that's what we're seeing writ large today. Republicans can't get it together and they have people literally fighting on the house floor. Congressman Mark Meadow of the freedom caucus going face-to-face, pointing, moving away, coming back to continue to fight with speaker.

PERINO: He said he was just being passionate. 
WILLIAMS: Yeah, right. So, what you have here is a situation where the president, I think, contrary to what I'm hearing here is, the president likes the idea of saying it's the Democrats' fault. Remember, the president said this is the law. I can't do anything about it. It's up to the congress. Then he turns tail and signs executive order and, guess what, undoes it.

(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Because you know how soft executive orders are because everything Obama did was executive orders, and then Trump just got rid of them. That's why you have congress take care of immigration law. 
WILLIAMS: If you don't let me talk I guess you won't have a show. But I'm just saying you have the president as the one who've said, oh, I can't do anything about it. It's up to them. And he's the one who literally changes course and has to do it. He's back as we've saw last night in Minnesota to try to demonize not only the Democrats but the immigrants again. He said I'm strong. I'm going to enforce these borders. These people will run over the border. What is he talking about? Does anybody say, hey, Mr. President, stop lying?

GUILFOYLE: Right.
PERINO: And this issue is not going away. It fuels a lot of passion and people feel really strongly about it on all sides. What do you think is the strategy to try to actually solve the problem and not deal with the politics of this? Both sides are playing it.

GUILFOYLE: Of course they are, right? That's an honest statement and a reflection of what's going on. But, nevertheless, I do believe that the president does want to do something about this. He likes to see things and say there's a problem here, I'm going to be the guy who's going to fix it. So, would he like congress to be able to act? Yes. So it's long lasting change from a legislative perspective versus an executive order like Jesse points out that can be undone? Yes. He's at a rally. He's not demonizing anybody. I mean, let's not sugar coat the issue. You're not supposed to break the law and come into the country illegally. Nevertheless, we have to deal with this issue and with children coming over in a compassionate way but still enforce the law. This nation, this country has a right to have its laws upheld and have them observed, and there's policies and procedures in place. We welcome immigrants. All of us have background as immigrants, and family members that have come over here, great. God bless, OK? We embrace people. This is a country that is very humanitarian. This is a president who cares deeply about families and about children. He's proved that over and over again. Give him the opportunity to fix it.

If they had another four years of a liberal president, or a Democrat, the scandals of unaccompanied minors would have continued. Just the way it did under Obama. But now they care. Why? Because there's a Republican. And it wouldn't matter if it's Trump. If it was Marco Rubio, if it was Jeb Bush, they'd still be demonizing and it's not the same. Both sides are not politicizing it. It's on the same level. It is so out of proportion on the left's side because they have ignored the suffering of children for so long until now. But they don't care about Chicago. They care about 2,000 kids. We care about 2,000 kids. We care about all the kids. Pro-lifers care about all the kids, Juan, can you shake your head.

So, for the bias-impaired here's news: Trump just reduced the risk of nuclear war. He also got remains of 200 U.S. soldiers back from North Korea just a week after the issue was raised. He's bringing in record-low unemployment, helping women and minorities most. He's addressed trade imbalances as our GDP climbs higher.
So, if he's monster, he might be the worst monster ever -- meaning, not a monster at all. That's why optimism is high: 95 percent of manufacturers have a positive company outlook. It's good news. Even if the elites deny it. And about those elites:

No wonder the De Niro's, the Madonna's, the Depp's, the Fonda's all unravel. Trump is richer than them all, but closer to the street than they are. How can that be? The answer is he makes promises and fights to keep them. And besides, for you deplorables at the rally the outrage celebrity class will always deem you to be the uncool kids. Trump defends you against the jerks.
So, it's not about wealth or apartments. It's about speaking up for people that the media celebrity complex snickers at. And it's why when everything seems to be working out those snickers seem truly from Mars.

Remember, he's like, I can smell a contractor. But it's true. You know, as a real estate developer you deal with the pipe fitters, the masons, the electrical engineers, and he's great at that.

WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I'll tell you what it was. 
GUTFELD: It wasn't insulting to anybody.

But I'm just saying, you ask about how he relates to people. You say, well, oh, these other celebrities they don't have the support of the working man. Let me just tell you something, I'm not sure he has the support of the working man on separating children from parents. I don't think he has the support of the working man -- what he does is he pushes. 
GUTFELD: He brought them together now. 
WILLIAMS: . hot button issues and fear. And he says, you know what, you can hate Hillary Clinton. He had the crowd last night chanting lock her up, right? He can say things like, oh, go home to your mom to this guy. Why don't you get a haircut? I don't know if that's a man or a woman. 
GUTFELD: That's a terrible impression, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: No, no, no. He hates on Clinton. He hates on everybody. And then he says, you know what, maybe those Hispanics, those immigrants, they're terrible, too. And you say. 
GUTFELD: What's that about Hispanics? I missed that. I think he meant MS-13. 
WILLIAMS: His appeal is based on hateful language and he appeals to the worse. 
GUTFELD: So we're all bad people. Kimberly? 
GUILFOYLE: I don't know. I think America is great. I think the president was saying that last night what an incredible country and supporters and trying to do something. He's actually followed through and had tremendous accomplishments like we reiterated numerous times on this show. And I don't know, for myself, in terms of as a Puerto Rican woman and looking at other minorities, are quite pleased. The numbers are going up in terms of -- no. In terms of their favorability about the president, yes. And you see key numbers going down, unemployment. Why wouldn't somebody be happy about that? Lower unemployment for women, for minorities, for Hispanics, for blacks, ISIS gone, we've got record job numbers. 
WATTERS: And Kimberly's apartment is nicer than yours. 
WILLIAMS: I bet it is. I bet it is. How about John -- remember last night, he not only was attacking Pelosi and Clinton. He then goes after John McCain.

And small business and manufacturing confidence is surging. On the heels of this momentum the president is urging voters to back GOP candidates in November or else. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need more Republicans. We've got to get out there in the midterm. We've got to get more Republicans. We've got to get more Republicans. 
A vote for a Democrat for Congress is really a vote for Nancy Pelosi and her radical agenda. 
They want to put on more regulations. They want to take back your tax cuts, which are massive. They want to take them back, and they want to raise the hell out of your taxes, and the whole thing will go boom. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Can't call Greg. He's nervous right now. 
OK, Dana. 
PERINO: Well, it's certainly like even three months ago the Democrats looked to be in a much better position for the midterm elections. That has pretty much been erased. New poll today, I can't remember which poll it was, but it was a legit one showing the congressional ballot now just 6 points, where it was 15 points for Democrats in March. So something is happening there. 
But a couple other things I think that the Republicans should be concerned about. One is that I just watched an ad by M.J. Hegar. She's a Democrat running against a congressman, an incumbent congressman in Texas. It's one of the best ads I have ever seen. And she's a -- it's not a progressive bunch of thing. 
She's a veteran. She took on the Defense Department for women in combat. She's now running against a congressman, that was her congressman that said that they didn't want to meet with her, because she was not a donor. 
So, they're not, like, running on really progressive issues in some of these competitive districts. So the Democrats have been really smart on that. 
The other thing that I think that's interesting is that a new Pew poll that also was today, Republicans trusted on the economy by plus 9 over Democrats. So that's really good. Only plus 1 on trade. I think that's what's happening. 
But what are people talking about today, this past week, and who knows what we'll talk about next week? Immigration. And I was really surprised by this number, that Democrats have a 14-point advantage over Republicans on immigration. And I was really surprised about that. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, that's -- what do you think about that number, Jesse? Because, you know, that's double digits, right? But it's not something that can't be turned around. 
WATTERS: Well, maybe that's depressed conservatives who are upset that the wall hasn't been built fast enough. You could see that, obviously. 
And on another note, the economy, if you have a good committee in a midterm election, it's going to help you. And a lot of the rejections that you've seen, I think it was 2010 with Barack Obama. That was a huge rejection of Obamacare. Or in 2006, when the Democrats swept in under President Bush, that was a rejection of all those scandals, you know, Foley and all that stuff. And a little bit of the Iraq War. 
I don't see an issue right now in the country where the Republicans have overreached or blown it or done something so awful that the rest of the country has to say, "Smack you in the face, and we need the Democrats to come in and take over." 
With the roaring economy and record-breaking consumer confidence. And safety. I mean, ISIS has been defeated. People feel safe. And the Republicans are evaluated very highly on national security. Safety and prosperity, I think, are really going to help Republicans in November. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, all right. Greg, do you want to talk about this or what you thought the block was going to be about? 
GUTFELD: No, but --
GUILFOYLE: I want to be there for you.
GUTFELD: Jesse's point, for 18 months they've been trying to find that one issue, the one issue that -- because when you -- when you decided that Donald Trump was Satan on the very first day he was president, you run the risk of running Satan fatigue. So that's why a lot of this stuff isn't sticking anymore. 
And it's amazing to watch the left, you know, immerse in all this good news. They're like gold panners in 1849 with a little pan. They're trying to find that one nugget of bad news. It's in here somewhere. That shows this country -- 
WATTERS: Prospectors.
GUTFELD: Yes, the prospectors. "I think I've got some bad news here," and they're not. 
And the worst thing is their confirmation bias is running out of confirmation. So all they have is their bias, which is going to lead to this cognitive dissonance, which is now building up to the point where they're calling everybody Nazis and going after Trump's kids. You are witnessing full-grade hysteria. 
GUILFOYLE: All right. Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, it's hard to know where to start, because the conversation has gone off the rails. But let me just say that it was the Republicans who thought that the economy was really going to be their key message for the midterms and have found so far in all this special elections and even gubernatorial elections, Senate elections, it hasn't worked. 
Why? Because like last night in Minnesota. Here he is talking about trade, but, guess what? A place like Duluth, they're going to lose about 1,800 jobs, I should say, because of trade wars with, guess who? Canada, their neighbor to the north. 
You look at the stock market, the stock market's lost all of its gains, I think, on Tuesday. 
GUILFOYLE: Not true. 
WILLIAMS: For the years. So it went backwards. 
You talk about the average tax cut for the person in Minnesota, 80 percent of Minnesotans, $700 tax cut. 
GUTFELD: Crumbs. 
WILLIAMS: So the tax cut has not had the kind of impact. 
GUILFOYLE: OK.
WILLIAMS: And then finally, you have deficits. Deficits that Republicans used to say -- 
GUTFELD: A Democrat cares about deficits, everyone. 
WILLIAMS: Now -- Now, it --
GUTFELD: Here's a nugget. 
WILLIAMS: It doesn't matter. 
GUILFOYLE: OK. What can I say? Two hours.
Jimmy Fallon is still apologizing over a year and a half later for his funny 2016 interview with Donald Trump. What he's saying now, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Remember this "Tonight Show" moment when then- candidate Trump paid a hair-raising visit to Jimmy Fallon?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Go ahead. Give my hair a stroke. 
JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW": Yes! 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Well, apparently the late-night comedian isn't laughing about the backlash from that famous interview. The funny man opening up about his personal pain from the fallout. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FALLON: I did not do it to normalize him or to say I believed in his political beliefs or any of that stuff. 
It was definitely a down time, and it's tough for morale. I made a mistake. I'm sorry if I made anyone mad. And looking back, I would do it differently. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Wow. Well, you know, sometimes in the breaks we hear things. Dana, what do you think? 
WATTERS: Keep it clean, Dana.
PERINO: It's one of the most funny moments in television history. People love politics and entertainment. President Trump was letting himself be vulnerable and have fun and let somebody, like, invade his personal space. 
Jimmy Fallon was really hilarious. And his apology reminds me of Jack Dorsey of Twitter having to apologize because he ate at Chick-Fil-A and said he liked it. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
PERINO: So where is the courage, guys? I mean, you remember Nils Crane? He used to say, "If it wasn't for the starch in your shirt, there'd be nothing holding you up." 
WILLIAMS: Kimberly, part of the problem may be that Stephen Colbert now beats Fallon regularly. And Fallon identifies --
GUTFELD: In ratings. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, that's what I'm talking about. And Fallon identifies this moment as the one in which people just said, "You know, we don't like it." In fact, it looks like people who are strongly anti-Trump are the ones who've had the ratings gains. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, this is pathetic, right? It's super snowflakey. I don't know why. I mean, you know what? Why is he, like, getting -- apologizing about this? I thought that was good TV, funny. He's been telling everybody that's his hair, that it's real. So now people know.
PERINO: He got the scoop. 
GUILFOYLE: I mean, he got the scoop. So, like, why not? It's just -- and the president was good-natured and fun about it. This is -- the world is getting ridiculous or more ridiculous. 
WILLIAMS: Well, wait a second, wait a second. Let's get -- let's go to the --
GUILFOYLE: Or more ridiculous.
WILLIAMS: -- exactly what Jimmy Fallon said. He people think he normalized Trump.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: But he doesn't share President Trump's political beliefs, and he wasn't trying to normalize him. 
WATTERS: Well, I think it's more important to hate Trump than be funny in Hollywood, and that's sad. Because Jimmy, I believe, is probably the most talented late-night guy. 
GUILFOYLE: Right.
WATTERS: I think he is probably the wittiest and the smartest, and I look forward to doing his show one day. 
PERINO: I knew it. I knew it. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.
PERINO: It's book preservation.
WATTERS: But in all seriousness, I mean, there's show business and then there's politics. This is not "Meet the Press." Trump went on there. He knew he wasn't going to get grilled. Fallon knew he was going to have fun, and that's fine. It's OK to do that. 
I could have Hillary on my show, and I could tousel her hair, and I could make jokes. 
GUTFELD: No, you can't.
GUILFOYLE: Please don't. Going to normalize Hillary?
WATTERS: And people would do that. Or I could grill her about Benghazi, and then she'd give me boring canned answers. Sometimes there's a time when you don't listen to the audience. You just do what you feel is right. 
WILLIAMS: So Greg, I remember, I think it was Bill Clinton on Arsenio Hall. And people were saying, "Oh, why are you doing -- why is this playing the sax there?" Or you think about some of the interviews, Anthony Bourdain having beers in Vietnam with Obama. He's "Oh, gosh," you know, or going hunting with the guy the -- 
GUILFOYLE: Bear Grylls. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. So -- and people -- people -- the conservatives went nuts. "Oh, no. This guy is using media." Remember that? 
GUTFELD: Yes, I wasn't part of that. So anyway, it's kind of sad in Hollywood. Politics just isn't personal. It's also a survival mechanism, and that's what he's figuring out. 
But what he -- the phrase that is being overused these days is "normalized." People say that a lot: "You can't normalize 'X' or 'Y'." Normalizing Trump as though he's polio --
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: -- or, you know, he's murder. And it's -- it was cowardly and sad. I really like Jimmy Fallon. But that was probably the lowest point that his life has been in. 
GUILFOYLE: I think so. 
GUTFELD: And he's pretty wild. 
GUILFOYLE: He should have gone back -- he used to have some conservatives talk to him. He was so funny and talented. 
GUTFELD: Oh, my God. How sad. Normal -- oh. 
GUILFOYLE: But now -- look what happens. Now he's --
GUTFELD: Get him a therapy llama. 
GUILFOYLE: Very sad.
WILLIAMS: All right. Is a "latte liberal" just a clever jab, or is there finally evidence to back it up? The answer ahead on "The Five." 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It turns out the phrase "latte liberal" is based in reality. A new study from the University of Pennsylvania finds liberals do, in fact, drink more lattes than conservatives. 
It's apparently all because of the drink's Italian heritage. Researchers say liberals are more open to foreign products and globalization, while conservatives embrace products perceived to be made in America. 
GUILFOYLE: Like the Big Mac. 
WATTERS: Like the Big -- Le Big Mac.
Kimberly, also interesting, they say for fast food, liberals prefer Chipotle and Panera. Conservatives prefer Sonic and Hardee's. What do you make of that? 
GUILFOYLE: Wow, that's kind of funny. Maybe there's some, you know, science to it, so to speak, and like, they take random surveys or whatever. I know that Greg used to eat Chipotle until he became deadly ill due to his lack of intestinal fortitude. 
GUTFELD: I don't think I was the only one who became deathly ill at Chipotle. 
But I agree with this. Conservatives don't take risks. And at my age mixing milk with coffee is, indeed, a risk. 
GUILFOYLE: For everyone around.
GUTFELD: But I should also add coffee should only be taken black. It's not coffee if you put milk or sugar in it. Then that's a kid's drink. 
WATTERS: You are such a manly man. 
GUTFELD: No, it's -- coffee is --
WATTERS: That is the only manly thing do you. 
GUTFELD: It's beautiful. Black -- there's nothing better than black coffee. 
WATTERS: All right. Well, now I feel very effeminate --
GUTFELD: In a tin cup.
WATTERS: -- because I drink it with milk and sugar, Dana. Beer -- 
PERINO: Yes, that's pretty pathetic.
WATTERS: All right.
GUILFOYLE: You're getting a little soft these days. 
WATTERS: I am getting a little soft. I know. Beers, liberals prefer Heineken and Guinness, imports. Conservatives, Budweiser and Miller. 
PERINO: I mean, I'm more of a Coors girl, myself.
WATTERS: The Rocky Mountain.
PERINO: Colorado, yes. And we also have Keystone Light. I don't know if they still make that, but we sure like that. 
WATTERS: That's some cheap beer, Dana. 
And in terms of activities, Juan, liberals do yoga and martial arts, whereas conservatives, archery and woodworking. I do neither of those. But go ahead. 
WILLIAMS: No, I think, you know, great. Drink -- everybody seems to like coffee, period. 
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Both sides. So, what struck me was the commonality, you know, that hey, there's something everybody likes. 
PERINO: We could have a coffee summit. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, I think we should have a coffee -- 
GUTFELD: At Starbucks. 
WILLIAMS: And the other point of it was that someone pointed out that, even with lattes, it's better for the American economy, because it benefits the dairy industry. 
And I didn't realize this. They said coffee beans are grown in several American states. It's not a foreign product. So if you go to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, California, coffee beans. 
PERINO: That's --
WATTERS: Well, I'm still reeling from being called a weakling by drinking coffee with milk and sugar. 
WILLIAMS: That's OK. It's OK.
WATTERS: It's OK. I feel better about it.
GUILFOYLE: You do other stuff.
PERINO: Can somebody Photoshop that, please?
WATTERS: Also, smart phones, liberals prefer the iPhone. Conservatives, Samsung. Now, I just don't know what the deal is with that. 
GUILFOYLE: I'm going to say that's -- 
GUTFELD: I'm beginning to call bologna on this whole thing. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, this is not good.
WATTERS: Is this study -- 
PERINO: I actually think this is true. I mean, I do have an iPhone. But I think that a lot of -- it's almost like conservatives don't like the herd mentality so much. I'm going to get hate mail on that, right? But Apple became such an icon of liberalness. Right? So then they went with the Samsung, and they think it's better. And the wars between people who have iPhones or Samsungs, they're real. 
GUTFELD: I don't -- the reason why I call bologna on this, I don't think politics has anything to do with these choices. It's just something that they do.
PERINO: Just happens?
GUTFELD: Yes. It just happens. I don't think about it. 
WILLIAMS: The other part of it is age. I think if you had a cohort of liberals, you're going to find they're much younger. A cohort of conservatives, they're much older. 
GUTFELD: True. 
WILLIAMS: And you're going to find the conservatives, the older end of that cohort has more disposable income than the younger.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: So --
PERINO: How did that surprise you? 
WATTERS: I always think conservatives have more disposable income, because we're smarter with money. 
"One More Thing" is up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for "One More Thing." I'll go first. 
Last week Iran's World Cup team won their first game since 1998. And this week, Tehran's Provisional Council made a last-minute decision allowing women to attend the screening of the game in Tehran's largest stadium. It's the first time they've been allowed to do that since 1979. 
Iran lost to Spain 0-1, so not a high scoring game. But women still celebrated. Many hope this will lead to permanently reversing their ban. So glad to see them get to go. 
GUTFELD: Did Trump have something to do with that? 
PERINO: I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did.
All right. Juan.
WILLIAMS: So big news from New Zealand. The Kiwi prime minister had a baby today. That's right. Jacinda Ardern had a baby girl. She becomes only the second world leader to give birth while in office. The first, Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto in 1990. And in an interesting twist of fate, today is also Bhutto's birthday.
Ardern is not married. Her partner, a TV news presenter, plans to be a stay-at-home dad. One Kiwi commentator said it was a historic moment, because the birth shows that pregnant women can do their jobs. Ardern is taking a six-week maternity leave. Congratulations to all. 
PERINO: All right. Jesse. 
WATTERS: I would like to wish Steven Watters, my father, a very happy 70th birthday. 
GUILFOYLE: Happy birthday. 
PERINO: Happy birthday, dad. 
WATTERS: There is dear old dad. Look how dapper he was. Now everybody knows where I get it from. That's him playing lacrosse. All-American lacrosse player. It was very cold there in his shadow growing up. 
And there he is with my mom taking a selfie. Probably the first selfie ever, back in the 60's. 
GUTFELD: Funniest thing I've ever heard.
WATTERS: And now he has a huge beard. I've never seen him without a beard. I have no idea what he looks like. And there he is with Ann Watters, "Mom Texts," as we know her. 
So Dad, happy birthday, I love you very much. 
PERINO: Happy birthday.
WATTERS: Congratulations.
WILLIAMS: Happy birthday. 
PERINO: How sweet. 
GUILFOYLE: Happy birthday.
PERINO: Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: -- to you. Yes.
OK, so this is super cute. I love the little nostalgic things, parents and sons. So this is a father and son cop duo, and there's a photo we can show you, so adorable. So this is a 20-year-old photo. And what happened is the 1998 photo shows Officer Andy Golden and his son Michael inside the police cruiser. 
And you fast forward to the photo taken this past Father's Day, shows him seated in the same position but at 6'7". Can you imagine? So the father and son police officers. 
GUTFELD: Don't try that at home. 
GUILFOYLE: Said to make the photo redo was a hard squeeze. 
While they're not partners, his son followed in his footsteps into law enforcement, which is incredible, at the Auburn Police Department. And it's cute, because the original caption said, "When I get bigger, I'm going to be my dad's partner and catch bad guys and burglars."
WATTERS: Nice.
GUILFOYLE: Isn't that cute? 
WATTERS: Very cool. 
PERINO: And at that height, he'll probably have an advantage. 
GUILFOYLE: I think it's adorable. 
PERINO: Greg, do you feel jealous about that height?
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.
GUTFELD: I wish I had a "One More Thing" about a world leader having a baby. Instead, I have gifts from the legendary band, The Misfits, who are big fans of "The Five." 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, wow.
GUTFELD: So everybody gets a Misfits shirt. 
WATTERS: Thank you.
GUTFELD: Even Juan. Juan, I know you love The Misfits. 
WATTERS: I don't even know them. 
WATTERS: Wait, is this --
GUTFELD: They're from New Jersey. They're amazing. Legendary Jerry Only gave them. His mom is a dedicated watcher. 
PERINO: I've never worn anything like this. 
GUTFELD: I can't wait to see Dana in a Misfits T-shirt. 
WATTERS: This will scare people. 
GUTFELD: I have a second "One More Thing."
PERINO: OK.
GUTFELD: Let's go to it. 
GUILFOYLE: Of course do you, diva. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRAPHIC: Greg's Breaking Wind News
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
GUTFELD: "Greg's Breaking Wind News."
GUILFOYLE: What?
GUTFELD: Not breaking news, breaking wind news. This is the greatest video of all time. A giant gust of wind in Commerce, Colorado -- Commerce City, Colorado, sent a porta potty into the sky. Look at that. It's like a time machine. 
PERINO: Was it empty? 
GUTFELD: It's like -- it's like, I don't know. Was it Dr. No? No, Dr. Who. It just flies in the air. 
And anyway, no one was hurt. We always have to say that. No one was hurt.
PERINO: You know, I grew up not far from there, and in the summertime in the afternoons, the winds really does pick up. You have a lot of tornado warnings, things like that. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. It's like Dorothy. It's like "The Wizard of Oz."
WATTERS: Exactly. 
WILLIAMS: Except you're in a port-a-potty.
GUTFELD: It was a cheap version of "Wizard of Oz." A really cheap version. 
PERINO: Wonder where that outhouse landed on. 
Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, that was a great show, everybody. Thank you so much. 
GUTFELD: Everybody, wear their shirts. 
PERINO: Yes. I will wear my shirt in private. 
Set your DVRs and never miss an episode of "The Five." "Special Report" is up next. 
Hey, John. 
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: We are definitely not in Kansas anymore. Thanks, Dana.
WILLIAMS: Clearly.
