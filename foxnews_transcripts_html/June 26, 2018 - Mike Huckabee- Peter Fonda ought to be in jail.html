LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington everybody, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is "The Ingraham Angle." A big day in DC, huge show for you tonight. We're going to talk to Mike Huckabee about the left's new vigilante politics. First it was his daughter, now he's been targeted by the PC police and as well as the majority leader of the US Senate. Also even though the court backs Trumps ban in a new ruling, Democrats are still saying, "Well, it's racist". We're going to debate the fall out. 
And Victor Davis Hanson, that's always fun, here's an inventive way for the left to put its money where its mouth is when they talk of welcoming illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to the country. It's a debate you're not going to want to miss. But first, the New Know Nothings, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.

Now the Democrats like to portray themselves as members of the enlightened class. They're the elites and Conservatives are the vulgarians so Trump, of course, to them is the ultimate know nothing, right. I mean he's a guy who shoots from the hip and the mouth. He hasn't marinated himself sufficiently in the writings of let's say, Aristotle and Plato. And he doesn't understand world history or the complexity of geo-politics. He lacks compassion and is so, so crass.

INGRAHAM: Meanwhile the same left wingers who claim Trump is a low brow ignoramus, are conspiring to make our children something far worse in my mind. Not only do today's Liberals, many of them, hate our American traditions and a lot of our heritage, but they're also the agents of historical and cultural purge, the like of which I don't think we've ever seen in our nation.

Now you know it's gotten bad when just this week, leftist Librarians took it upon themselves to strike Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from a Becher Children's Book Award. The American Library Association first awarded the prize to Wilder herself back in 1954 and they later named it after her. But now the librarians claim that Wilder's work includes stereotypical attitudes not consistent with values regarding the depiction of Native Americans. 
Now I think I'm right here, Little House was after all set in the 1800's of Minnesota. So don't we want to know how people in the past lived, how they thought? And frankly, how they survived? My view is if we hide, or worse, demolish our history, where do our children go to learn the lessons of the past? So I guess Mark Twain, Truman Capote, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee and those other stereotypical writers who will also soon have to be banned as well. So who are the real book banners now? Well I guess there's always those lovely PC graphic novels kids. 
Now this is the same leftist mentality that has led to, of course, the destruction of historical markers and statues all over the country. What amount to marks the city councils have ordered the removal of confederal monuments from public spaces, removing history altogether, rather than allowing the next generation to see it, interpret it and yes, debate it. Now these official acts, I think, have inspired left wing activists to take it upon themselves to topple or deface statues, which for good or for bad of course, are part of our national memory.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And by the way, I'm saying this as a Connecticut Yankee, I got no affinity for the south, but it doesn't stop there. Even this 1925 World War One Cross in Maryland is now considered offensive to militant atheists. They filed a suit to have the memorial removed. And the four circuit court of appeals agreed with them and ordered the peace cross's demolition. So now, who are the intolerant know nothings again? The left I would submit is so blinded, dogmatic in their ideology and their hatred that they refuse to accept even basic facts, sometimes scientific facts. Abortion is but one example. 
Now they continue to deny the obvious truth of human life in the womb. Now far from the article of faith or religious understanding, there is a scientific fact and we have the pictures to prove it. Who could deny that an ultra sound of a 12 week old child, preborn child in the womb, is a living human being, growing and living? But groups like Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party at large, they are determined. Look the other way, they don't even like the fact that people can see this, mothers seeing these images. The visual evidence, the proof life is a threat, threat to the abortion racket, they make hundreds of millions of dollars on this, don't look. 
The left is so anti debate, so anti dialogue that they prefer to intimidate now and demonize their political opponents rather than convince them. Convince them that their argument's the right one, bring people along to your point of view. No, no, no we're not going to do that. Instead they resolve to slander and labelling Conservatives or Trump supporters as, remember Hillary called them the deplorables, Obama said they're people clinging to their guns and their religion.

Now we've told you about those 2016 texts, this all bleeds through the process, all the way down to FBI agents working on the Hillary Clinton probe. One said that Trump supporters, not deplorables, but they're all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS, look it up if you don't know what it means, that think you will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. Another referred to his voters from Ohio as, "Retarded". Nice, no bias there, but sadly now, it's gotten even worse.

Now for months the left has been insisting, of course, that the President's immigration policies, especially his travel ban was unconstitutional. They derided Trump and his administration as racist for attempting to inhibit immigration and travel from certain volatile hotspots, same ones that Obama targeted as hot spots himself. Now again, the left refuses to acknowledge, basic truths, basic facts. It's a national security threat and it's posed by immigration from certain regions in the world. We can't vet these people, no systems in place. Well the court today weighed in. Not only ruling that the President has the statutory to control and regulate immigration, frankly it should have been a 9-0 case, but that the ban doesn't contain any religious or anti-Muslim bias.

Now in the 1850's, America saw the rise of the Know Nothing Party. It was an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic Political movement that sprang from what was ultimately a secret society. And today, we're seeing the rise of another Know Nothing Party made up of secret forces deployed to undermine the will of the people and their representatives. They know nothing of facts, nothing of history and nothing of the damage that they're doing now to the Republic. They're called Democrats and that's the Angle.

Joining me now for reaction is Garland Nixon, a radio talk show host Sean Duffy, a Republican Congressman from Wisconsin. Garland I know you're chomping us to bits, what your reaction?
GARLAND NIXON, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, you know, immediately my first reaction to the vitriol id that it's not good for the country. It is a bad thing to do and the party, the Democratic Party should be focusing on policy. That being said, I think that the President has to take some credit, if that's the right word, for the toxic environment that we're in. I think he has lowered the level of discourse. He started off during his campaign by talking about punching people, beating people, he's called the NFL players SOBS so I think that this is a rare toxic atmosphere in Washington DC but I think the President has to take a lot of responsibility for it. It wasn't here before him and he started out with the vile talking.

REP. SEAN DUFFY, R-WIS.: Listen, I think it's commendable that Garland says he's going to call out the left for this outrageous behavior. Not many Democrats have done that so kudos to you for that. The problem is what they do on the left is say, "Well Donald Trump uses language we don't like". Okay I don't like all Donald Trump's language either, however, he's not shutting down anyone's speech and in the great debate stage of ideas, Liberals can't win.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');

So if you're Milo Annapolis or if you're Ben Shapiro and you go to a college campus, they shut down their speech. If you're in the IRS, you shut down Conservative groups from organizing. If you're Secretary Nielson, you'll go to her house and shut her down there. If you're actually Peter Strzok you'll say, "I'm going to shut down the will of the people in an electorate, I'm going to undo it in the FBI". There's a difference in speech versus taking action to shut down speech. I would say if you at this young lady who yelled FU to the President as he walked into the capitol last week.

INGRAHAM: Yeah a Congressional intern.
DUFFY: She has a right to say that, I don't agree with that, she can't say it, but this is not a speech issue. The left is engaging is something far different, far more vitriolic and I think, if I can just make one last point. They tried this in Wisconsin, remember Act 10 and Scott Walker? 
INGRAHAM: Oh yeah, good point.

DUFFY: Who are these people and Scott Walker ended up getting more votes in the recall than he did in the first elections. 
INGRAHAM: I think what we see though is the targeting of individuals, this is different. I don't even mind if somebody yells, they all yell FU, it's like not cool but people do that, they can lose their temper but it's the targeting of individuals. Putting a wanted poster in your neighbourhood. Telling people to crowd around other people. So you can disagree with Trump, you don't like the travel ban, you don't like the immigration laws, that's fine in debate, I have no problem with that, interesting debate on both sides.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But the targeting Garland, is what I find to be, that's scary because when you get crowds of people around an individual, it doesn't matter if it's in a public place, if they feel another person is sub-human. We saw this in the racist south, people were considered sub-human and they felt lie they could do anything to Black America. And now you get the sense that we're in that really scary place now, that to me is terrifying. 
NIXON: Yeah but I don't feel that there's one side or the other. I mean, for instance-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Where's Donald Trump telling you to crown around someone and target the, he's not saying that. He uses crass language sometimes which I don't like.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NIXON: And I would agree with you, it's not necessarily one person. He's gone after our allies, he's gone after our NFL payers, he's gone after Justin Trudeau and he's gone after-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yeah Justine Trudeau, I didn't know he's gone after him?
NIXON: My point being that I think the President has a lot of responsibility here and that if he wants things to change, he's the leader, where the head goes, the body follows. He needs to tone it down--
INGRAHAM: So you're saying that Donald Trump had zero tolerance at the border which is enforcing the law on the border so we don't just release people back into the country. That there wouldn't be this massive protests and the vitriol and what's being said on these signs and that you're an inch away from someone's face like they were with Pam Bondi, you don't think they'd be doing it? I do. 
NIXON: What I'm saying is I think we've gone to a style of politics in Washington DC that is about people instead of policy so I know it's attacking--

        }
      
NIXON: It's attacking the person, about attacking the leader of the country, attacking the leader of the party, but there's very little policy being done on Capitol Hill period now. 
INGRAHAM: Okay. I want to play something. Now this is Keith Ellison, Deputy DNC Chair, he's a Muslim American. He was on CNN today and he was basically not telling the truth about his ties another hater, Louis Farrakhan. Let's watch.

INGRAHAM: Oh it's true. I give credit to Jake Tapper for that because he actually called him out. 
DUFFY: Forgive this impression against siding with a group, a violent group, Laura I think Angle was awesome in that this is a debate about freedom of speech. Can we actually have a political conversation where we disagree with each other, very difficult issues that we face? We should all be able to have a decent conversation where we all disagree and we should actually vote, whether it's a bill in Congress or an election. We debate, we argue and then we vote, that's what we do bit don't shut down speech.

I mean the college campus front is so outrageous that we can't bring speakers to campus because the left is so unhinged that they know they can't win a debate with a Conservative, Ben Shapiro? This has gone too far. 
INGRAHAM: I also feel like, I've got to say the people that they're targeting are horrible, they're all like these little guys who innocuous, Ben Shapiro's like this, Steven Miller's not this hulking threat. Come on he's like a nerdy guy, sorry Steven, but you're like nerdy guy, Conservative guy. 
NIXON: And I think what's been missed here, I was just looking at the results today with Crowley, even within the Democratic Party there's the same debate. Because the Burney people, which is the click that I fall into, are saying some of the same things about resistance. Saying, "We've got to go away from just saying, Russia, Russia, Russia and I hate Trump and to get to some policies. So this-
INGRAHAM: Burney doesn't believe that. Burney, he's more of an old fashioned liberal. 
NIXON: But believe it or not, some of the things that you guys are saying right are some of the very same things that the Burney people are saying to the resistance, get back to policy. 
INGRAHAM: I tweeted last night or I can't remember I'm such a lawyer. I didn't like it when the President said get your asses out, sorry, and vote. You don't have to say that, I know it's just like a little thing 
NIXON: What you don't have to say, punch people in the face.

DUFFY: Yeah but here's the difference, we called him out and he said that- -
INGRAHAM: Yeah but don't like that word. I don't like that word being used. Sorry, I'm not saying I'm not privileged on that score but you can make your point in a different way. And he's wining on the substance, I'm sorry, he's winning on the economy, I think he's winning on trade. There's push back on the Republican Party, I think he's winning on that, maybe has progress on North Korea, he winning, you don't need to go personal. 
DUFFY: The Harley Davidson workers actually support President Trump on his effort on trade. They came out today. I think--
NIXON: Well they don't a lot of time to support him because they're all at work. 
INGRAHAM: The Democrats support him on trade, I give him credit on that.

DUFFY: Gustav was run there from Congress in Tennessee, death threats are increasing to offices like mine and other members of Congress. This is going too far, we need to take the temperature down and it's leaders on both sides. Democrat leaders, Republicans leaders, take it down, don't support people when they incentivize violence. 
NIXON: Let's not forget all the gun references where Gabi Gifford was shot and all the--
INGRAHAM: Yeah and the left went crazy during time when all the targeting Sarah Palin had on her website. So I think everybody's got to acknowledge, the culture, it drips downwards and it goes into politics and it goes into our kids' minds and all of us. I said this last night, all of us have to do better, including yours truly. I appreciate both of you, it's awesome to have you on. Now it seems like the left is on a mission for it to be impossible to be a Conservative in public, when we come back, we'll show you more.
The left's turned vigilante politics is not slowing. Protestors descended on the apartment of Senior Presidential advisor, Stephen Miller, yesterday chanting immigrants are welcome here. Well who said they weren't welcome in the apartment, I'm sure they are. They cast out wanted posters calling Miller a white nationalist, oh that's original, accusing him of crimes against humanity and promoting Nazi and other extremist ideologies. They're so tedious, they got come up some ne lingo. 
Additionally late night comedians are attacking White House secretary Sarah Sanders, not because of anything she did, but because she was recently asked to leave a Virginia Restaurant because of the President's policies.

JIMMY FALLON, HOST "THE TONIGHT SHOW": Turns out her server asked what she wanted as an appetizer and out of habit she refused to answer. 
STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPEHN COLBERT": What do you mean you treat everybody with respect? You work with Donald Trump, you don't even treat yourself with respect.
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
INGRAHAM: Now the Daily Show with Trevor Noah's comments were too obscene to even give you a bleeped out version tonight, just to give you a flavor on that. So for insight on the left's sharp turn away from civility and politics, let's bring in Fox News Contributor Mike Huckabee, host of Huckabee on Saturday, and Sunday by the way, on TBN and former governor of the great state of Arkinsaw. 
All right Gov, you gave me some good news on my radio show on Monday. You broke it that that Red Hen manager walked across the street with a group of people and followed your daughter's family, because she was already gone, to another restaurant. So they apparently can't eat anywhere, period. But now you see Stephen Miller being targeted with these wanted posters which, again, incites people to do what? When someone is wanted for crimes against humanity, what are you telling other people to do to him? That's my question to you. 
MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well I think, if we go back to Mayberry RFD you'd start hearing Gomer Pile yell, "Citizen's arrest, citizen's arrest". What you're almost asking people to do is intervene as is Stephen Miller has done anything that violated the law, he didn't he's a policy guy. You labelled him well a moment ago, not very complimentary in some ways, but pretty accurately, he's a very nerdy policy guy, brilliant, beyond brilliant. But he is no screaming kind of guy. He is nose to the grindstone sort of fella.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But when this becomes personal and people take it away from the public venues of a town hall or a speech in public at a university campus and they start taking it to people's homes. And they start making it so that a person like Pam Bondi can't go see a Mister Rogers movie, or so that my daughter can't even get to the appetizer because the moment she gets there, the manager tosses her out and tells her to leave. I mean that's the kind of thing we saw at lunch counters in the ‘60s and I thought we were never going to see that again, it's pretty sad. 
INGRAHAM: Hey, has Sarah thought, you know you always think in retrospect, she just left because she didn't want to make a big scene so she just left. Did she ever think maybe, "Maybe I should have stayed" I think of those Starbucks, those African American men at Starbucks, they decided to stay, let the police come. I mean my kind of thing to do is you want to throw me out? You're going to have to call the police to throw me out, this is a public place. Did she think that in retrospect to do that?
HUCKABEE: No I don't think so because my daughter is not the kind of person who was raised to be disruptive, she really wasn't. She doesn't have this attitude that people owe her something. She honestly believes that if the lady doesn't want her there than why should we want to stay? But I do think her attitude was, "I could stay and make a scene, sure I could demand that she serve me", but to what end? How does that serve a growing level of civility? The truth is it doesn't. So when the manager made it clear that she wanted her to exit the restaurant, she did it quietly and she did it politely. 
That's the way southern women do things, they don't disrespect others. Laura, as my mother used to say when we did something that was not very nice, were you raised by wolves? And I look around and I realise there are some people in this country who, yes, seem to have been raised by wolves, rather than mothers and fathers who taught them good manners. 
INGRAHAM: Sarah got, I understand she has a secret detail now with her that was announced today. My question is, is she going to be dining out in Washington any time soon? Is she feeling like she doesn't want to put herself through this or her family through this again?
HUCKABEE: Yeah I can't confirm about the details because I haven't heard it from her. I saw it on Twitter tonight, first I had seen that. If so, two things, I'm glad, I think she needs it in light of Peter Fonda's comments when he said he hopes someone would break into her home and kidnap her children. I'll tell you, Peter Fonda ought to be in jail tonight and I mean that sincerely, the man ought to be in jail for having said that kind of thing. 
But I think Sarah's going to live life the best she can. But you know, one of the things this is giving Laura, is Republicans and Democrats a real message as we move into the election season. And here's the way I see it, quite frankly, for Republicans, every day is the fourth of July, for Democrats every day is Halloween and American will get to decide whose message do they want to follow, the celebration of freedom or throwing eggs at peoples' homes.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yeah it's pathetic, I mean if the shoe on the other foot, there'd be massive protests against this type of behaviour. Governor Twitter video shows protests confronting Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, transport secretary Elaine Chao last night. Now Chao forcefully told protesters to leave her husband alone while they yelled out, "How do you sleep at night?" So my question to you is this standard operating procedures? Look at, you can tell one thing, the baseball hat worn backwards, that's always classy, what do you, three years old? There's no debate, it's public shaming of individual who support Trump or try to have a job working Trump. 
HUCKABEE: Well a couple of observations, one, it may be fashionable to yell at Mitch McConnell. Wouldn't go after Elaine Chao, it's clearly indicative that they don't know her very well, wouldn't mess with her. But Laura isn't it interesting, typically, that all the people that they target are mostly women. I mean for the most part it's Melania, it's Ivanka, it's Sarah, it's Pam Bondi, it's Kirstin Nielson, Elaine Chao? What is it with these people? It's misogyny, it's sexism, it's hatred of women and I think that it all to be pretty clear to America. I hope they see it, I hope they recognise it and I hope they clearly reject it as ridiculous. 
INGRAHAM: The backpack crowd. Yeah grown men wearing backpacks is also suspect, I'm sorry. Thanks Governor, I appreciate it. Now conscious politicians getting harassed by leftists in Tulsa. Morgan Casper found a hateful note on his porch condemning his support of Trump. I love bringing in regular people who have to deal with this in their lives. So the person who left the note kept returning. So Morgan confronted her with a camera, great job, to find out why she was targeting him. Morgan joins us to tell us what the harasser said, give us the whole story, Morgan. Good to see you. 
MORGAN CASPER, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Hello. Good to see you. 
INGRAHAM: You're now considered brave because you support Donald Trump and don't hide it apparently. 
CASPER: Yes.
INGRAHAM: What happened?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CASPER: So I am a very loud Trump supporter in my neighborhood. There were Bernie Sanders posters everywhere and Hillary posters everywhere. So I'm going to put a Trump sign up. Well, it seems like she didn't like that. I got hateful notes left on my porch. 
INGRAHAM: Were they threatening or were just like you're a racist, you're terrible? 
CASPER: There were just like you're racist, you're terrible just because I'm a Trump supporter. 
INGRAHAM: So you wanted to find out who it was. You didn't know who it was.
CASPER: Yes, I couldn't figure out who it was. So I got a camera and caught her on tape. 
INGRAHAM: Now, your wife is Indian, and they said you hated dark-skinned people. I happen to have adopted kids, and one of them is from Guatemala, so when they say that to me, I just laugh. How many people have you brought into your house that needed help? 
CASPER: It's funny how they assume, just because I am a Trump supporter, they assume I am a racist, I don't like women, all that stuff. It just makes no sense to me.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Do you ever try to dig into their minds? It might not take very long, but you try to figure out what is it about what you were taught to either act this way, treat people this way, anonymous notes. It's so wimpy, especially when you see these backpack-wearing adult men with backwards baseball caps. Most of the conservative women probably could beat them in arm wrestling. Just actually do an arm wrestle with them and settle it that way. But what is it? This is your generation. What are you, 30 years old? 
CASPER: I'm 28. 
INGRAHAM: So this is your generation.
CASPER: Yes, it's my generation.
INGRAHAM: What does it make you feel about your generation? 
CASPER: It's disappointing, it really is, because all of my life I have been growing up by adults, so I'm used to seeing how adults live, not how children live. And I feel like I don't even want to go back and see where a lot of this generation grew up from because it would probably make me sick. 
INGRAHAM: It's infantilization of adulthood, too. They are all acting like they are still in their fraternity. The Thursday night seminars in college where they can just vent about how rotten America is.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CASPER: You're right.
INGRAHAM: Thanks for the story, we appreciate it. I love bringing in just regular people. How do they feel being a Trump supporter in public life. They don't. Some people hide it. He didn't. 
The Trump administration won a major victory, actually two major victories , the left is still crying racism. Up next. We will debate it. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: In a five to four vote the Supreme Court today upheld the Trump administration's travel restrictions from certain Muslim majority nations because of national security concerns. Writing for the majority Chief Justice John Roberts said the executive order was within the scope of the authority. In her dissent, which she read from the bench, which is unusual, Justice Sonia Sotomayor claimed the travel ban was discriminatory and appeared to be anti-Muslim. 
Let's debate that with San Francisco attorney Harmeet Dhillon, the RNC committeewoman from California, and Washington immigration attorney Allen Orr. Great to see both of you. All right, Allen, here are the 10 countries with the largest Muslim populations, this is the most recent time it was checked -- Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco. If Donald Trump was targeting Muslim majority countries, why wouldn't he target the largest Muslim majority countries in the world? 
ALLEN ORR, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: I am not sure exactly the rationale of why he wouldn't target those countries, but in essence he did target Muslim countries. 
INGRAHAM: But no, if it's based on religion, you would want to hit the most? 
ORR: A rational person would want -- 
INGRAHAM: But why did Obama have those on the list -- 
ORR: Obama might have had those concerns as well, but he moved past those concerns. The difference between the Obama administration and this administration is the time length of the actual bans. And so celebrating today's travel ban restrictions as a win really isn't the case because what you saw from the court was constant changing. So you are at the third version of the travel ban. It started from a complete class of people, including green card holders and non-immigrant holders, and it moved down to just people who are currently applying for visas. So it's a little bit different in scope and size. And just because you discriminate against one person out of that group doesn't mean you are not discriminating against the whole group as a whole. So I think we should be very careful in saying this wasn't discriminatory. 
INGRAHAM: Well, so, Indonesia, India, Pakistan. Harmeet, you are from India. And so this is an issue you are speaking -- this is an issue that's near and dear to your heart. You've studied this issue. I don't think the travel ban rollout, I think Allen's right, it was not the finest moment for the Trump administration for a variety of reasons. P.R.-wise, communication-wise, the way it was drafted, I would have done it differently, but easy to say with hindsight. But the court here said statements by the president during the campaign were not dispositive. This is a textualist reading of the statute itself that gives the president this broad power on immigration, correct? 
HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: That's right, Laura. You're exactly correct. I think that first travel ban done seven days after the administration was sworn in was rough in a lot of waves and I am really glad that the system has worked down to the system where the Supreme Court said they have a lot of safety checks and allow a lot of people in on a waiver basis. 
And the administration has been able to prove to the court that they've already lifted some countries from the ban. So Chad, for example, has come off the list, Iraq. And so we are really looking at a system where even Jimmy Carter had a country on the list. So did Ronald Reagan. So it's not unprecedented. And what the Supreme Court ruled here was very correct which is that if a statute gives the authority to the president then the motivation isn't really part of what their consideration should be. Absolutely authority under 8UCS-1182.
INGRAHAM: Allen, we were talking about rhetoric earlier and what rhetoric has done to the discourse in this country. And this is what a former Republican, Steve Schmidt, who advised the successful Lamar Alexander for president campaign, that's a low blow. He's a strategist, but this is what he said about the travel ban. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE SCHMIDT: Today was a fantastic fulfillment of Usama bin Laden's vision by Donald J. Trump. What Usama bin Laden hoped to provoke was a war of civilization, a war between the west and one billion Muslims. And so what Donald Trump and this Muslim ban signal to the world is that Muslims are not welcome here. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Jared Kushner just back from the Middle East having unprecedented high-level meetings with majority Muslim countries about how to move forward together, modernize Islam, and perhaps making peace in the Middle East a reality. Do you agree with what he said there? 
ORR: I think the message is already clear whether immigrants are welcome in this country right now or not. So it just heightens that already. But I think one of the things as lawyers as we've having a lawyerly conversation is to talk about the posture of the court. So what today was decided was about injunction, so it actually goes back to a full trial in local court. So the only thing that was won is just the injunction. So we aren't actually finished with everything.
INGRAHAM: What is the likelihood of success of the merits? 
ORR: I say this -- 
DHILLON: That's 90 percent of the battle. Game over once you've won the injunction for the most part. Let's not kid ourselves. 
INGRAHAM: So Harmeet, you can explain that, because if you actually want to stop the travel ban, if you don't stop the travel ban with the injunction, where are you going to go here? 
(CROSSTALK)
DHILLON: Sorry. Any litigator can tell you that once you've won the injunction in the United States Supreme Court the writing is on the wall. The rationales used by the lower courts to knock down this order have been eviscerated by the court, so there is really nowhere for them to go. And I don't think this is an open issue anymore. I think that liberal heads have exploded. It's time to move on. And hopefully these countries will using the protocol in the order be able to remove themselves from the list once they prove themselves to be a place where we can verify who is coming. 
INGRAHAM: Last word to Allen? 
ORR: Yes, I don't think my head has not exploded. And we're still on the fighting ground and the next battlefield will be at the ballot box. 
INGRAHAM: It's not exploding. That's a good argument. 
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: But I think, Harmeet, other heads are exploding. To say it's Usama bin Laden, the fulfillment of his fantasy? This is now, Allen is making a good point, trying to make a legal point. Usama bin Laden, if you are going to Usama bin Laden, OK, you lost me. 
DHILLON: It's hysteria. The Nazis. Everything is hysteria these days. 
INGRAHAM: I guess Nazis have gotten old so now it's Usama bin Laden. OK, love having you both on. Thank you so much. 
And the left has been long on criticism and sometimes short on cures throughout this current immigration crisis. But up next a solution that would test the commitment that some on the left have to their own values. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: All right, one of the "Angle's" favorite political analysts, and that's a high bar, has some innovative suggestions to help solve the current immigration crisis. Victor Davis Hanson has been thinking a lot about how the left can live up to its own rhetoric and beliefs on asylum seekers. The scholar from Stanford's Hoover Institute joins us now to explain. And here to debate him, immigration attorney and author of the book "Save Haven in America" Michael Wildes. Great to you have both. So VDH, give me your suggestion. Lay it on me. 
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, people keep talking about the detention centers, and now there is the suggestion of military camps. But we have over 500 colleges and universities and its summer time, and most of their dorms are only half-utilized. Many of them are sanctuary campuses in sanctuary cities. So it seems to me the university as a progressive bastion of these values of welcoming immigrants, and we could contract the federal government to use idle dorms and then draw on the resources of the campus for legal help from the law schools and medical centers. It's an ideal place. Kids could intern, rather than going to Wall Street or Washington, they could intern. 
INGRAHAM: That's a great idea. 
HANSON: It raises the largest question, really the answer to this question is if you really have an ideological trajectory toward open boards, then you have to live with the other. You have to go to school with them, you have to live next to them. You have to be empathetic, and you can't just view them as cheap or inexpensive labor. And that's part of the whole point. 
When Peter Fonda tweets from Paradise, Montana, one of the least diverse places in the United States about Barron Trump, it would have been so much easier if he had said you know what, my grandkids are going to go to the L.A. city schools where 70 percent Latinos and we're not going to engage in white flight. Mark Zuckerberg could say you know what, no more Sacred Heart or Castilla or private academies. Let's live with the other and let's match our ideology with concrete realities. 
INGRAHAM: Michael, here are some of the endowments of our most prestigious universities, and they all have one version or another of sanctuary policies or centers or immigration attorneys and so forth. Harvard University's endowment is $35.7 billion, Standard $22.4 billion, MIT $13.2 billion, Columbia a paltry $9 billion. That's a lot of money. They give a lot of scholarships out which is nice, and some of them go to illegal immigrants, but why not open up the campus at least in the summer time. What do you think? 
MICHAEL WILDES, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: First, thank you for having me. The transferring of this responsibility to the private sector is just not practical. If the president and the administration had prepared before they literally shut the doors and separated the children from their parents, then it may be part of the solution. 
Look, let's be practical about this. Food, security, liability insurance, all of these issues have to be vetted, and they can't be vetted by schools that have their own interests. We have a very interesting history with foreign nationals and students going to the schools. And it seems that the schools for years profited from all of the tuition. And there was always this interest that they would pony up in Congress and hold their share. But this is, as much as the gentlemen intends it, not a very serious solution to the problem. 
INGRAHAM: Michael, it's the old saying put your money where your mouth is. If you believe in this issue, don't be an individual who skates on the periphery. That's why I really admire people who work with organizations on the ground in helping people in their home countries. I talk about Food for the Poor a lot. They are great organization. They do work in Central America and Haiti on the ground with people, helping them be self- sustainable. Great.
But when you sit in Brentwood or Malibu or Georgetown here in Washington and then you go put a target on a piece of paper on Stephen Miller and paper the neighborhood, I'm not impressed. I'm really not impressed.
WILDES: I am also not impressed when people don't walk the walk. But shifting the responsibility to the private sector for a government function like this is really not practical. 
INGRAHAM: I know, but if you want to send them into the country, what I'm saying, VDH, you can comment on this. If you want to send them into the country they have to go somewhere. 
HANSON: What is symptomatic of this entire issue is that people don't live the consequences of their loud ideology. I'm looking at the window at my farm house and I see mostly illegal immigrants up and down my rural road. My kids went to public schools with them. I see them every day. I am trying to be part of the solution. I don't agree with illegal immigration, but it's a fact and we're dealing with it.
But my problem is the universities at which I work, I hear all of this loud acrimony, and yet when I look carefully at where people live, where they put their kids at school, whom the associate, whom they hire to do their dirty work, it's a reality that doesn't match the abstract ideology, and therefore we create cynicism. That's what created Donald Trump is all these people said globalization and open borders were wonderful, but the ramification in the real world, how it affected real people did not affect them. They were able to navigate because of their power, their influence, their wealth. They were able to navigate around the ramifications of their own ideology and that's where we are today. We have a highly cynical population that does not trust elite bromides for this problem. 
INGRAHAM: Michael? 
WILDES: It seems more of an intellectual pursuit than a practical pursuit. We all want to fix this. I'm a law professor here in New York. Every school is doing what they feel their constituents would support. They cannot open their doors and act in a government function without creating more tax burdens on the local municipalities and the community. I am a former mayor in New Jersey. I can just well imagine the municipalities that are already over-taxed, the police and the fire and so forth. 
INGRAHAM: You're right. Michael, I'm so glad you made that point.
HANSON: Wait, wait, wait. 
INGRAHAM: You are right. 
HANSON: The federal government does that all the time. That's what the federal government does all the time. They contract services out to individual entities. 
INGRAHAM: The Catholic Church gets $90 million a year. 
WILDES: This was not a planned move. 
HANSON: Neither was the border crossing. It was not planned.
WILDES: Just move people to the school campuses because they are vacant. We don't move people like chattel. These are families that are going to be torn from one another, and going to a college campus may not be the most hygienic thing in the world. 
INGRAHAM: Oh, my God, then what are we doing with all the kids -- 
HANSON: It would be the best introduction to America, a pastoral campus and supported.
WILDES: I think gentleman has a lot of time on his hands, and it's a wonderful intellectual pursuit, but from the practicality as a lawyer trying to administering all of the liability and all the exposure and security, the food and the medical attention, it's just not practical. And you are shifting the responsibility to the state and the cities. 
INGRAHAM: Right now, we are out of time. But I think the American people, the working people who have not really, most of them haven't had a raise in 30 years, the median income just starting to go up under Trump, thank goodness. Most of them are like, wait a second, who is looking out for the blue-collar workers before Trump? Now we are supposed to flood the country with more low-skilled workers that are going to come to the country and drive me out of whatever business I'm in. Maybe it was landscaping before or construction. I think people are frustrated, so they don't want to pick up the tab either. 
WILDES: I appreciate the frustration, but these individuals by and large are here for our country's mercy and not for our indignation or our judgment. And they are entitled to a day in court. You can't give that to them in a campus that has a lacrosse team and a library and all of that. They need access to lawyers, good medical attention, and -- 
INGRAHAM: A lot of people want access to lawyers and good medical who are American citizens. 
HANSON: Stanford has some of the best lawyers in the world. 
INGRAHAM: Guys, thank you so much. Congress, by the way, will here from that lead FBI agent who sent those vicious texts to his girlfriend tomorrow. Byron York is here. Also primary results in, we'll tell you what happened. [
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: FOX News alert. Big news on two fronts. The seventh circuit court of appeals with a huge ruling supporting Trump's sanctuary city policies, and a huge upset in New York. Here to discuss both, FOX News contributor Byron York of the "Washington Examiner." Byron, we have Peter Strzok's testimony tomorrow. We've got so much news, end of the show, we've got to get it in. Seventh circuit basically narrowing the nationwide injunction that one district court judge was able to place on Trump's sanctuary city policy. Jeff Sessions went to the seventh circuit and said narrow that scope, and they did narrow it. 
BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Really interesting that it came today because in the big travel ban decision today, Justice Thomas in his own dissent brought up the point -- 
INGRAHAM: His concurring opinion.
YORK: Exactly. He brought up the point we cannot have these single district judges issuing these nationwide injunctions, causing a national emergency on whatever cause they want. 
INGRAHAM: So one liberal leftist judge in California or Hawaii can totally shut down a presidential directive. 
YORK: That is exactly what we saw in the travel ban, it's what you see here, and what we might be seeing is maybe a move in the higher courts to narrow that.
INGRAHAM: Narrow the jurisdiction of these lower courts so it doesn't have so much of an affect. That's interesting news. 
Now, Joseph Crowley in New York loses his primary contest today. He was thinking he was going to challenge Nancy Pelosi, correct? Democrat.
YORK: Number four in the Democratic leadership in the House, widely seen as a challenge tore Nancy Pelosi, had a primary opponent for the first time in years. He's a 10-term representative. And there weren't polls on it, there was nothing on it, and he has lost. People are talking about this like when Eric Cantor lost, just a huge, huge loss.
INGRAHAM: Every time I think of Eric Cantor losing I smile.
YORK: Also, this is another version of the Bernie/Hillary thing, because the woman who beat him tonight wants to abolish, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, wants to abolish ICE, wants Medicare for all, want guaranteed -- 
INGRAHAM: Defiantly moved to the left. She's defiantly leftist, ICE, basically a terrorist organization. She wants to abolish it, as you said. And the list of demands on what the federal government has to spend money on, up, up, up. Free college tuition, I believe that's on the agenda, too. 
YORK: So this is one of these things if we weren't so obsessed talking about Trump every single moment, the divisions inside the Democratic Party would be a huge story. 
INGRAHAM: And this as Ron Klein just wrote that piece I think it was in "The Atlantic" yesterday about how the Democrats cannot give up on white working-class voters.
YORK: That's a big debate, and on the left the answer is yes, we can. And there are a lot of centrist Democrats, who are kind of an endangered species, who really think that is a big mistake. 
INGRAHAM: Strzok, quick thought? 
YORK: Look for questioners not to really talk so much about his bias. It's kind of like we know that. You don't like Trump. They want to find out what happened in this FBI investigation, and the cutting edge of the house investigation of the investigation is, how did this get started? What was going on before the official beginning of the investigation on July 31st, 2016? Does the official story hold up here? And I think they are going to try to find out more about that from him because he knows everything. 
INGRAHAM: Why behind closed doors? 
YORK: They are talking about having a public hearing a little later. But my guess is he volunteered. They didn't have to fight him. Let him talk behind closed doors right now. 
INGRAHAM: Those text messages should just be their own graphic novel. They should all be released, acted out on stage. Byron, thanks so much. We'll be right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Just another night on the "The Ingraham Angle," breaking news throughout the hour up until the final, final whistle. That Joseph Crowley story is huge. The woman who beat him is basically a total socialist, unabashed socialist. That's where the Democrat party is going. 
If you didn't see The Angle tonight, we're going to post it tonight. You've got to watch it. Follow me on Twitter. I will see you radio tomorrow. Love to read your tweets, remember.
And Fox News, the team, "Fox News @ Night," Shannon Bream up next. Shannon?
