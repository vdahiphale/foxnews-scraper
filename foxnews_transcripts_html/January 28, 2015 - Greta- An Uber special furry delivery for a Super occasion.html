Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I may have just about the best job in the whole world. Well, at least for 15 minutes today.
Check out this behind the scenes video. We just shot it. Yes, I'm in that video with those two pickups. Ride sharing service Uber allows want-to-be passengers to hail a car in just minutes. But today, they were delivering puppies on demand. It's for a special occasion, to celebrate the Super Bowl and for a small donation, Uber and the Washington Area Rescue League bring the pups to you for 15 minutes of play time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I love animal rescue organizations but of course, if you follow GretaWire, you already know that one. I'm forever blogging about Petconnectrescue.org. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I just love pets. Pets can be your best friends. They give that you unconditional love no matter what you do. It seems pets always seem the best in us. They are always forgiving. You know what? We humans could take a lesson from them. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
