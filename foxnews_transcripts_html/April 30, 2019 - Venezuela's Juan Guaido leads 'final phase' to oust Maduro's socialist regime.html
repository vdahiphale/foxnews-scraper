DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
Dramatic images coming from the streets of Venezuela. Chaos breaking out after opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising to end the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro. Thousands of protesters clashing with security forces in the capital city of Caracas. We've seen teargas being fired, rocks being thrown, and gunshots ringing out. Listen to this.

PERINO: And a warning about this next video showing a disturbing scene of an armored military vehicle plowing into a crowd of protesters, this new uprising not moving Nicolas Maduro. He says he won't back down. And his government is calling the demonstrations a, quote, terrorist act that is, quote, bound to fail. President Trump is monitoring the situation and saying that the U.S. fully supports the people of Venezuela.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
So, Jesse, at some point this was going to come to a head, but one of the big concerns and Senator Rick Scott talked about it this morning is that you have Russia and China, in particular, Russia, and the Cubans, basically, they're negating our efforts using sanctions to try to push out the regime.
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Yeah. It's a proxy war between America and Russia right now, and strangely the Democrats are siding with Russia, although maybe not so strangely if you think about it. But, I mean, Russia has interfered in Syria, interfered in Ukraine, and now they're interviewing in our own hemisphere, Venezuela, so we have to do something about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if we can just take a step back here and be honest about what Latin America is like, we go from one decade it's our guy, the next decade you have the socialist takeover, and then each side steals from the people, and then we have to get involved. So it's a total mess, but at the same time when you have a socialist back regime that's shooting people, that's cutting out electricity, and cracking down on freedom of assembly and the media, you can't allow that to happen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And right now people like Bernie Sanders, or Omar, or even CNN seem to be going along with Russia propaganda, not condemning the guy in charge right now, and acting like we're doing something bad, while all we're trying to do is maintain democracy and maintain some semblance of order.
So at this point it looks like we have to be tough on Russia. I don't want to get involved militarily, but we've been warning about this for a long time. If you confiscate people's weapons, if you seize their private property, if you raid the natural resources of a country, and then all of a sudden there's no peaceful transfer of power, this is exactly what happens.
PERINO: Greg, one of the things I thought of today is that we've been without a U.N. ambassador for a while because Nikki Haley had resigned, and the new person has not been confirmed yet. But we really -- I feel like the world is missing her voice right now.

GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Or my voice. My voice.
PERINO: There you go.
GUTFELD: They're missing my voice.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: You have the floor. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: That's why I'm here. This -- events like this are grim. You don't know how they're going to turn out. The socialist never goes quietly, right? They don't just say, hey, you know what, things didn't work out. My mistake. Try this free market stuff. That -- the cruel joke of socialism is that if you give them what they want, which is power, then everything goes to hell, which is why the clever socialist wants to be protected from themselves.
The smartest socialist is a capitalist, I.E. like a Bernie Sanders. Be in America where you can be a socialist because the capitalist market -- the capitalist system and the free markets will bail you out. They're the adults, right? And you can be the socialist child that plays around. But once the child gets control of the toys, everything is gone. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the lesson -- and I always try to bring this up, the lesson why this fails is centralized government means that there's one failure, the whole thing falls apart, right? The entire cake gets poisoned. Decentralized government, pre-market prevents that, so if one part fails, 49 others can succeed.
That's why in the United States we have a lot of great cities and a lot of terrible ones, or a few terrible ones, and it's kind of odd how the ones that are really bad are actually closest to the model of socialism.

        }
      
PERINO: I was going to say that socialists in America are protected by the bubble wrap of capitalism.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: You just summarized my point delightfully.
WATTERS: And they want to pop the bubble wrap and annoy everybody.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: I don't think they want to pop it. I think they like being protected. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Juan, I won't ask you to carry on that metaphor, but what do you think about the administration response so far? John Bolton, today, the national security advisor at the White House, was very specific in calling out three officials there in Venezuela who had already said that they would support Guaido, and he's basically calling on saying you've got to step up and do that. That also maybe puts a target on their backs.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Right, and in specific the military, because the military is key here. So what really set things off today was that Guaido was able to stand with some members of the military and say it's time for Maduro to get out. And if it, in fact, was evidence that the military was siding with him, then Maduro said this is a coup, it's unfair, and all the rest. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, so to me what's key here is understanding that we, the United States, support not only democracy but stability. I mean, this is a real threat because it impacts immigration. I mean, people trying to break in and get out of there, get to another country. You have not only Russians but Cubans who are heavily present inside and supporting Maduro, which brings us to the point, Bolton says, our national security advisor, nothing is off the table. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, wait a second. I don't think most Americans think that Venezuela should be the next Afghanistan that we should be sending military troops.
PERINO: Well, nobody said you have to send -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know --
PERINO: -- troops to Venezuela. I think that's another straw man that -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: No, I don't think so, because I just listened to Jesse say, and I think Jesse spoke from the heart that, you know, when you have the Russians there, we got to say, hey, this is our neighborhood. Venezuela has the largest proven reserve of oil in the world, Dana. And if they think they can come in and dominate the economics of that oil supply, that's a threat to us and it's a threat to our hemisphere. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So we have to do something -- the question is do you want to become militarily involved? I think Bernie Sanders is right in saying no.
PERINO: OK. But nobody is saying that you have to send 30,000 troops in order --
WILLIAMS: I don't know.

        }
      
DAGEN MCDOWELL, HOST: Not -- you didn't really see this dramatic reaction because I want to point out, something that Greg was talking about, this is an ideology that has been preached. And to quote Mary Anastasia O'Grady at the Wall Street Journal editorial page who is a student of Latin America, this is -- so it's a country that's been corrupted by the vast oil reserves, number one. But it's also ideological.
It is, as she said, it is -- they -- throughout the entire 20th century for the most part, that the intelligence, you have the intellectuals, the academics, the educators, the politicians have basically swamped the population with socialist pap. That is her phrase. She said that if -- they preach that if you stick it to the rich, that's the path to paradise. It is -- as the government intervened in the economy, particularly through price and exchange controls, it damages living standards. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the danger is that the Venezuelans still voted for more of it because they have began or been taught to hate success, hate entrepreneurs in the name of -- what is the phrase? Social justice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And they were setting up the country to fail, and now you have basically people eating garbage, individual starving to death, and basically a dystopian society.
WILLIAMS: Let me just get off you -- a contrary point of view which is that I don't know that the intellectuals fed them all these fact. I think Maduro is a power-hungry guy who has broken the constitution of Venezuela, he held an illegal election and so you have fewer people turning out. He disbanded the national assembly and put in place his puppets.

(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Since apocalypse Trump no longer works. We're now back to chicken little theater. Of course, this won't stop Beto from using jets, trains, or automobiles. Rationing is for the little people, but not for him. Poor Beto, just a month ago he was the media's BFF, a walking sandwhich board of earnest platitudes propped up by family wealth that masked decades of failures.
To Vanity Fair, he was king. To the rest of us, he reminded us of that dorm roommate high on no doze who lectures everyone about stuff he knows nothing about. A motivational speaker in search of an audience, but the act is running dry. Mayor Pete is smarter, plus he can speak without inflicting collateral damage on bystanders.

Prices are collapsing. This energy industry has created millions of jobs but I'm going to wipe all of that away just for a campaign slogan. Good luck on that.
But this is just a sign of desperation, the world's worst cologne. So Eric Swalwell will clearly cornered the -- corner the Habbo vote, that's gone. Mayor Pete and his husband and his two dogs, very authentic, very charming, the family, and that he doesn't look enough like a Kennedy to get that voting block to care. So he's done.

PERINO: I love charts.

WATTERS: I brought charts. And Dagen actually appropriated my charts. So I'm going to give them to Juan, and you're right. Look at this. America reducing all these co2 emissions. Look at China, and the E.U. and India, they're emitting like crazy. Green New Deal, in order to get that done you have to set aside the landmass of a California just to house all of the windmills and the solar panels --
GUTFELD: Right.
WATTERS: -- OK? How did we get out of the last ice age anyway if there was no fossil fuels? I wonder how the earth heated up then. We can't even predict the weather next weekend. How are we going to predict what it's going to be like in ten years? But, let's just think about how cocky Beto O'Rourke is, all right? Frist --
GUTFELD: Wait, you're calling somebody cocky?
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I have grounds to do that. So, you have a $21 trillion U.S. economy, the fossil fuel industry runs this economy, it's created all of this wealth, revolutionized transportation, communications, industry, lifted people out of poverty. Beto, who's done nothing except lose to Ted Cruz, comes up and says I'm going to take $5 trillion and I'm going to reverse everything in ten years and change it all.
He's no Einstein. He's no Carnegie. Where does he get off thinking he's going to stop human progress, pump the brakes, because the real reason he's doing this, he feels guilty of the success the American economy has had, because he and other liberals have not had enough input in it.

GUTFELD: Juan, how is he going to go on another like soul-searching tour without fossil fuels?
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think -- I think we have enough fossil fuel around. Everybody can go anywhere they want to go. I think the news here is you get 80 plus percent of Democrats saying this is their number --
GUTFELD: True.
WILLIAMS: -- one issue. I think that --
WATTERS: Things must be good if that's the number-one issue.
WILLIAMS: Well, because you have -- I mean, in some places, you say it was health care or education. But now, today, 81 percent saying that this is the number one issue. So, you know, I argue with Jesse, with Dagen, with these guys about climate change and it never changes anything except that it gets me heated.
So, I will say this, let's not argue about it but we can argue about the fact that Democrats think this is very important. It's not just Beto and it's not just AOC. You have a clear majority, a super majority of Democrats who say this is our number one issue, and you have politicians in a representative government saying we are going to speak to your issue, voters. We're going to try to do something about it. Republicans aren't speaking to climate change, which is what opens the door for these kinds of proposals.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: I think, Dana, that Juan is right in the sense that we could -- I'm going to say we because I'm not a Democrat, speak about climate change by talking about nuclear power. The fact that solar and wind are so deluded that you need -- environmentally, terrible for the planet.
PERINO: You can't store it.
GUTFELD: You can't store it.
PERINO: Yeah. I mean, they're working on it.
GUTFELD: It will never happen.
PERINO: They're trying. But the other thing is -- so in the previous polls where people have been asked, do you like the idea of Medicare for all, people say, yeah, I like that. Do you like Medicare for all if that means it's going to cost -- oh, no, I don't like that.
GUTFELD: Yeah.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: So in this poll, I would have like for the Democrats to be asked, OK, so if climate change is your number one issue, if I asked you we're going to solve that by utilizing nuclear power, do you support that? And what would the number be?
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PERINO: Probably because of misinformation and uneducated people about nuclear power, it would probably down around 40 percent, when that is actually the only true way that you get all those other countries to reduce their emissions.
GUTFELD: I mean, nuclear power has come a long way. There's a fewer -- obviously, fewer meltdowns. Gen 4 nuclear reactors hopefully are better. And they feed off their own waste, so that's good.
WATTERS: And I would add that Republicans in order to get in on that opening, they should go for conversation. You know, a Teddy Roosevelt situation, a lot of the western governors are Republican, they're conservationists. They love fishing, they love hunting. Don Jr. is a big outdoorsman. He can sell that in a heartbeat. That would be much more appealing --
GUTFELD: God knows he's stopped a lot of heartbeats.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is the president's advisors have been telling him, Scott, not to get sucked into a one-on-one fight with any Democratic candidate, especially Joe Biden, right? And -- but clearly, he hasn't taken that advice. As you heard, Biden -- he tweeted about Biden five times today. Why is he hitting such a nerve?

GUTFELD: I hope Biden goes with make America moral again. I guess he's now Jerry Falwell.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: His mama.
GUTFELD: Yeah. The problem he doesn't understand is that the way it's pronounce -- the way he's pronouncing it, it sounds like America is immoral. He was trying to talk about Trump, but the way he did it was mutated. The biggest Biden hypers are those who felt their influence footprint shrink since Trump won.
So now the media insiders that were around during Obama are now on the outside looking in and their desperate breath is fogging the window. And so they're just -- those are the ones that are -- and they need this, they actually need Biden more than America needs Biden because it's something that soothe kind of the inner emotional turmoil or rational turmoil of the last three years.
So that's why they're acting this way. But I don't think anybody fears Biden. Except maybe, I don't know --

(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Everyone is Trump's biggest threats. And now it's Biden's turn.
PERINO: Yes. So he had -- also, but haven't been in the race and he was at the top of the polls. And then -- so he gets to the bump, he gets the fund-raising, and you look at -- dig a little deeper in the numbers, like, the actual support is there. I do think it's interesting like he's focused mainly on this first part on the rust belt.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: But if he wants to win there's, tactically, Florida.
WATTERS: Yeah.
PERINO: He got to get down to Florida. He got to go to North Carolina. Probably he got to go to Arizona. That could be tough as well. I did not understand the -- not having a motto. Obviously, that was going to be --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: They've been planning on this for four months. He launched -- this is not an exploratory committee. He has announced he is running for president. And he talks about the essence and the moral and -- it's just wasn't sharp.
WATTERS: No, he blubbered. And take it for me, I can tell when someone does that. Juan, I just want to get some information out there and have you react to it. So the official tabulation for the Pittsburgh rally, the crowd size, was 600. I feel like that was doubled. I think it probably was around 300 which is incredibly weak.
Pennsylvania under Donald Trump, record low unemployment, manufacturing jobs added. Manufacturing jobs were lost under the Obama-Biden administration in Pennsylvania, in fact, all across the country. How do you think the economic debate happens with Joe Biden and Donald Trump?
WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, economic debate is pretty clear. I mean, people don't think that the Trump tax cuts helped them. They think they help the rich. So if you're talking about union people like the union people that Biden opened with, I think they see him as their ally, someone who is going to stand up for the middle class in terms of stagnant wages, help them do a better job of paying in case of medical emergencies, paying for their kids to get to school because they don't have money to put big money into the stock market, in the bonds and all the rest.
But I think that you know going back to something, Dana what she was talking about, the bump he got was significant, he's now 20 points ahead of Bernie Sanders and what this says to me is that so often, the way that we view Democrats, especially when I say we I mean, you know talking from my Republican conservative perspective you say, oh, they're pushing everybody the far, they're a bunch of socialists, they're wacky, they're -- hey, wait a second, looks to me like Democrats are more middle of the road, older and wider than you would guess and they're the ones who say we like Steady Eddie in terms of Biden.
We like someone who's steady and we like someone who we think can beat Donald Trump, that's why numbers, that's why the money. I just think these are good signs for Joe Biden.
GUTFELD: Are you saying they're racist?
WATTERS: I never heard Biden describe the steady but I'll leave that to--
MCDOWELL: So I heard your analysis that you repeated from the hair and make up department.
WATTERS: Yes.
MCDOWELL: About the Botox and fillers and I want to praise any man who pays attention to their parents, who has the guts to say, I need to look fresh and frosty for the camera because you know what, that's the pressure on every woman who has to sit in front of a camera and Jesse, when the time comes and you have a book coming out, you can come to me.
I can give you a full education of Botox, where it should be placed. Don't make it sit in your brow furrows, you can get Restylane versus Juvederm versus a whole host of others.
WATTERS: Ooh Juvederm.
MCDOWELL: I will get - I will - I will open the door to any man who wants to shoot his face full of stuff to look younger.
WATTERS: Okay with that, up next why Bernie Sanders is picking a fight with the Avengers. Later.

MCDOWELL: You'll agree with this so Disney's minimum wage is $15 an hour, that's where they've raised it. They have $150 million that they've dedicated to providing free college education, vocational education to the employees if they want to. Disney has stated this that their 90% of Bob Iger's compensation is performance based. Here is a little warning to Bernie Sanders.
Don't go after things folks like. This is a person's happy place, this movie. This brings them joy and pleasure and you're basically again Bernie Sanders never met a dollar earned by a private citizen or a private company that he didn't want to confiscate because you know what, at the end of the day, a socialist believes they spend your money better than you spend your money.
And I think that this is a huge mistake.
WILLIAMS: So Jesse, I think that he's saying that you know, companies especially when they're doing well, should do well for the people who make the company go and that therefore there should be bigger reward for the workers. Now how do you argue against that?
WATTERS: Easily, I say it's Disney's company and they have shareholders that vote on Bog Iger's salary and they vote on the board and the board decides the compensation and if you're a shareholder of Disney, you can sell, you can buy more shares. Bernie could get in on the action and he can vote at the next shareholder meeting if he wants to but I agree, don't go after Mickey Mouse.
I mean that is like -- that's holy territory for most Americans and Bob Iger is not a villainous, corporate evil CEO. I mean, it's not like he needs to - there's other examples you could use besides that. Why doesn't he go after let's say, who else made $60 million last year?
Beyonce. Why doesn't he go after someone like Beyonce? She made the same amount as Bob Iger. I know he would never do that and say you know what, Beyonce, why don't you pay your people more, why don't you pay your team more. He would never go after her because he likes to pick and choose.
But if you go out to Disney hard and you get shamed and you know slapping another $20 an hour on your employees, what's going to happen? They're going to have to pass those on to the customers. The customers are going to Disneyworld is not in my budget this year.
Then stock price drops, they might have to lay off workers so then Bernie ends up hurting the same people he's trying to help, the middle class.
WILLIAMS: All right so Dana, I think the point from Bernie just to give it another shot because I think Jesse did a good job of saying why he disagrees but in 1978--
WATTERS: Thank you Juan.
WILLIAMS: In 1978 CEO pay was 30 times the average worker's pay. If since 1978, it's gone up 937% so you see a disproportionate amount of the revenue not only going to the shareholders because sometimes the companies do buy backs, they increase the value of the stock but that then the shareholders pump up the CEO's salary while he pumps up their revenue.
PERINO: So that's why Bernie Sanders has a lot of young people that say we're with him. Again, protected in that bubble wrap of capitalism because it doesn't really affect him. Abigail Disney is the granddaughter, I believe of the founder and she's been an activist and she's an agitator saying that Bob Iger's salary is outrageous.
And so I think that Bernie is tucking in but side her so that he can draft off of that but - I guess that the - if he were to lose the primary and if he were to write another book, then he should tell his publisher, I don't need an advance. I think that we should just all - I'm going to write this book and work really hard on it. And I could live another 25 years but I don't want an advance.
I don't want any of the profits come to me. Let's just like all give it out to everybody else. Like that would actually show skin in the game.
WILLIAMS: Greg.
GUTFELD: I agree. I was just thinking he should give -- slice his salary to half and give half to the lowest assistant on his staff. Look, you can think that CEOs get too much money, you can but that still doesn't mean you should trust the government to make that decision, especially a government that includes Bernie Sanders and I'm - I think you I agree with you Juan, that I'm relieved that Joe Biden is now - has a more commanding lead over this childish President.
Because these - this is logic that's not even worthy of a second grader. You know, the left - the hard left only has one game and that is to take because they don't understand how to create. They - as you said in the A block, they dismiss innovation and creativity and so wealth isn't for the making, it's for that taking because they think that this money comes from somewhere that they don't understand.
Then why not take it? And to your point about young people, I want to ask them, young people, now I sound old, why would you trust the government over an individual in deciding anything like this? Like wages?
It's like are you ready to sacrifice that individual power and that freedom so easily, that's kind of - that's kind of cowardly and sad.
PERINO: I think they do trust the government though.
WILLIAMS: Yes, but let me come back quickly because we out of time.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes.
MCDOWELL: I want to just say, but ask all the fabulous people who worked on that damn movie, that spectacular movie, ask them if they want Bernie Sanders deciding how much they should get paid.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
WILLIAMS: Okay. So I was just simply going to say to you that I don't think Bernie is saying the government would interfere and tell Iger how he can work - how much he can be paid. He's simply saying, he thinks that the company, now that it's experiencing this windfall should take care of its workers.
PERINO: But you can say that but then again that's of no consequence, right?
WATTERS: Juan, you're acting like they've some -- I'm sorry -- you're acting like they've experienced a windfall.
WILLIAMS: They have.
WATTERS: Like money's falling out of the sky.
WILLIAMS: They just had a huge hit.
WATTERS: So hard to create value, and create success and create jobs for their employees. This doesn't fall out of the sky.
WILLIAMS: Right but you know how many people make movies and put big money in and it doesn't have--
GUTFELD: That's a good point. No, but Juan said -- now look, 90% of the movies fail, they're like restaurants. This pays for that.
WATTERS: He thinks -- Juan thinks they're lucky at Disney.
WILLIAMS: No, I think--
WATTERS: You think they're lucky and by accident they hit it big.
WILLIAMS: Let me say, talent is luck and a gift from God but I would say this.
WATTERS: Hard work has a lot to do with it too Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right, fine, all right, there's a new alleged Russian spy. A spy, a whale? Yes, a whale. The video that has everybody talking, it's next, right here on THE FIVE.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MCDOWELL: Yes, it's a video everyone is talking about. Check out this seemingly cute, innocent whale, the beluga was discovered by Norwegian fishermen wearing what appears to be a harness with a holster for a GoPro camera. Now there are some major questions about whether or not it could be a Russian spy. Experts say that the animal was likely trained by the Russian Navy to be used for a special ops force.
The Russians are denying it. Animal expert, Greg Gutfeld, go.
GUTFELD: You know, one of my favorite movies growing up Day Of The Dolphin with George C. Scott. It was about using these dolphins to do odd things. I can't remember what anything beyond that. But I do believe it is time to stop referring to whales as whales. It has a fat shaming connotation to it.
I was thinking plus size mammals. What do you think?
PERINO: I think that's fair.
GUTFELD: Yes, no one likes being called a whale. I don't.
PERINO: But it's fun to say you're having a whale of a good time.
GUTFELD: Who says that now? Not a whale.
PERINO: I would say that.
GUTFELD: No, you wouldn't.
MCDOWELL: Dana's bringing it back.
GUTFELD: Yes.
MCDOWELL: Dana, what do you think of this.
PERINO: So I -- one, I feel bad for him that he is swimming around everywhere with this holster.
GUTFELD: He's got a job.
PERINO: Obviously.
GUTFELD: Trump is creating jobs for whales.
PERINO: But there's n GoPro on there so he either got cut loose, maybe there was downsizing in the whale department, I don't know and then--
GUTFELD: He's getting the female whales because he says, Hey I'm in the - I'm a spy, that always works.
PERINO: It's true. He's like the James Bond of the sea.
MCDOWELL: So dolphins were used by both the United States and the Soviet Union to detect submarines, under water mines, spot suspicious objects so these were programs used during the Cold War, Jesse. Also ravens could steal stuff and plant bugs. Dolphins detecting submarines. Also cats. Which do you prefer?
WATTERS: What about puppies?
MCDOWELL: Puppies are just puppies.
WATTERS: OK, good.
GUTFELD: They just take up your time.
WATTERS: Did I just take in a spy into the apartment. Got to check that thing. I think the story's fake news. I think this is some Russian oligarch's pet whale that escaped from his aquarium. It's something like that or this is just more deep state propaganda. Deep sea propaganda perhaps.
I just know, I'm just not buying it.
MCDOWELL: I should say though digs not puppies but like the Belgian Malinois was on the--
WATTERS: The what?
MCDOWELL: The Belgian Malinois is a dog.
WATTERS: How do you say that?
MCDOWELL: Don't make fun of me. Dana knows what I'm talking about.
PERINO: They are secret service dogs.
MCDOWELL: And they were on the choppers that landed in Osama bin Laden's compound and they're used to detect explosive devices and the like and save our people who serve this country.
WATTERS: Okay, well, we better fire up some whale spies to counteract the risque. Let's get on that. Who's the secretary of defense now?
PERINO: Acting.
WATTERS: Acting, excuse me.
WILLIAMS: Well, beats pigeons flying around.
WATTERS: That's true.
GUTFELD: Now the worst drug sniffing dogs.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
WATTERS: Back off guys.
MCDOWELL: You know, they are actually switching to dogs like with round ears, not the pointed ears at the airports because the pointy eared ones scare people. Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, I just think there's a serious element here which is the Russian are good at spying and what we know from our elections and from other instances is that the Russians never stop. I mean, their economy, talk about an economy going to hell, they have a terrible economy but they put money into things like this and they plant bombs and they spy--
WATTERS: Maybe this wasn't a Russian spy at all, maybe it was an FBI agent.
GUTFELD: Do you think -- Do you think maybe that whale knows where Hillary's emails are?
WILLIAMS: By the way this is a--
WATTERS: You're joking, right.
WILLIAMS: This is a baby Beluga whale by the way and when my youngest was a child, his favorite song was by Raffi, baby beluga. So yesterday on the family chain, it was all about hey, this is Raffi's baby beluga, finally showed up.
GUTFELD: Is that where beluga caviar comes from?
WATTERS: I was just about to ask. Dana would know. Dana.
PERINO: I never had caviar.
WATTERS: You're kidding.
PERINO: No, I don't like fish.
GUTFELD: I hate - I hate fish but I had to because I married a Russian. It's disgusting. It's eggs. You're eating eggs, fish eggs.
PERINO: That's terrible.
GUTFELD: It is terrible.
MCDOWELL: You can't brush away the odor.
GUTFELD: No you can't.
MCDOWELL: On that note, One More Thing is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: I bet you wish you were there for that commercial break. Excited now for One More Thing. Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right, so imagine if you're a kid who grows up next to a drive in movie theatre. That led a kid in LA to dream of making movies back in the 1980s and he did it. So here's a tribute to Hollywood director, John Singleton who died yesterday at 51 after suffering a stroke.
Singleton made history as the first black nominee, also the youngest Academy award nominee ever for Best Director. He was recognized for the ground breaking film, ‘Boys in the hood.' His other major films included one of the ‘Fast and Furious' films as well as the romantic story, ‘Poetic Justice.'
And he directed episodes of TV hit shows: ‘Empire,' ‘American Horror Story' and ‘Billions.' I met him once when he tried to buy the rights to one of my books. He was very interesting guy, intent on bringing stories of black America to the big screen. Rest in peace, John Singleton.
MCDOWELL: Indeed, amen.
PERINO: All right, I've got one. Drake Grillo, check him out. He's 4 years old. He's a future all star player for the baseball so he playing with his dad in the backyard, he hits -- he got a hit, he runs the bases, he's doing so well, his dad runs in, tags him outright and but watch how he handles it. Drake is just not having this call. He's four years old and he's got an attitude and he's got a good arm too so. All right Drake. Greg.
GUTFELD: All right, let's do this. Greg's Cable News, another exciting development at CNN everybody. Two days in a row, they just hired a brand new traffic reporter to cover the daily commute this is Stefan Steagalez. He's now - right now he's at the traffic camera in London and he's just letting everybody know the elites that work at CNN of how the traffic is doing in the central part of London.
As I always say it's always good to get a bird's-eye view, Dana. A little local TV news humor for you.
WATTERS: Greg, you know, one day you're going to run into some CNN talent and I don't think you're going to be as brutal as you are on television.
GUTFELD: There's only one talent there and it's Jake. Ouch.
WATTERS: All right, I'm going to leave that alone.
PERINO: All right, Jesse.
WATTERS: Here we go. This guy lit up the track the other day. Check him out. His name's Matthew Boling, a two-year old. Look at them go, middle lane. Smokes the field. Olympic level speed he set for the 100 meter dash, 9.98 seconds. It is basically the fastest time ever run by a high school athlete.
But because there was wind, it's going to be the unofficial records so we're going to probably see this guy in the Olympics, they call him White Lightening, that was my nickname too.
GUTFELD: That's a little racist.
WATTERS: No, it was not my nickname. I was only moderately fast.
GUTFELD: But you're white.
WATTERS: That's true and 0.1% black.
WILLIAMS: I was going to raise that.
PERINO: There's something here.
WATTERS: That's right. On Thursday, you can see some more what is real packages, here they are. Not all of them but some good ones in there.
PERINO: You got to do a lot of work to get that done.
WATTERS: That's true.
PERINO: Dagen.
WATTERS: He's taking it on the chin, this show.
MCDOWELL: This will make you happy. Ladies and gentleman, this is how it's done. Take a look.
(VIDEO OF GIRL SINGING, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU)
WILLIAMS: That's wonderful.
MCDOWELL: I love the gestures too. That is Emelia Claire Pierini with her mom Kate belting out, I think that's the Whitney Houston version of ‘I will always love you' but it's a song written by Dolly Parton.
GUTFELD: About me.
PERINO: Yes, Dolly Parton.
MCDOWELL: About Greg Gutfeld so she's getting it right and cheers to this young lady because I won't even sing Onward Christian soldiers in church, because I can't sing and it's embarrassing and everybody turns around and stares.
WATTERS: That was like us with John Rich.
PERINO: Yes, shut up.
Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of “The Five.” "Special Report" is next.
