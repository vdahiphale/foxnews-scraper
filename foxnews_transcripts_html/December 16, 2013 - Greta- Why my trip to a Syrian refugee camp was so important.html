Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. On Thursday, I flew to Iraq with Reverend Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse and went to a Syrian refugee camp. I did it for two important reasons -- first of all, I want to do a good job for you. I want you to know what's going on in the world. That's my job, and I do a better job for you when I see something firsthand, not just from reading about it on the Internet or off a computer screen.
Second, I go because I care, and I know you care, too. Yes, things aren't perfect here at home, and we do needs lots of help here. But Americans have big hearts, and we try to do as much as we can for everyone. And that does include refugees -- people fleeing for their lives from their governments. They're so desperate, so cold and hungry and in great despair. It's a pretty grim scene. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Reverend Graham and I walked the refugee camp, seeing people -- children, adults -- shivering from this frigid Iraqi winter weather. We met a 90-year-old woman draped in blankets, desperately trying to get warm. There are a few heaters, but thousands and thousands of refugees are there, and winter has set in with a vengeance. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, upon seeing this misery, Reverend Graham told his team to buy 2,000 heaters and get them there immediately. That's big. And he could do that because so many of you have make a big difference in people's lives. And of course, Americans can't help everybody in every place, but we all try to do what we can and that's how I spent my weekend. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You'll see more of this journey to the Iraqi refugee camp in an upcoming special edition of "Fox Files" that's coming soon on TV. And of course I've already posted photographs on GretaWire, so go see them.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
