DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST (on camera):  Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino,along with Dagen McDowell, Richard Fowler, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld.It's 5:00 in New York City. This is The Five. Growing outrage over newCOVID restrictions as millions of Americans start gearing up forThanksgiving, and protesters even taking to the streets in California tofind a curfew there.Los Angeles County announcing it will suspend in-person dining, and then inNevada, the governor is issuing a statewide pause for at least three weekswith a stronger mask mandate and more restrictions. In Nashville, officialsare limiting gatherings to just eight people And Oregon's governor tellingpeople to call the cops on their neighbors if they violate the rules.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  This is no different than what happens if there's a party downthe street and it's keeping everyone awake. What do the neighbors do? Theycall law enforcement because it's too noisy.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  But could help be on the way? The company AstraZenecaannouncing its vaccine is up to 90 percent effective in trials, and Dr.Fauci says all the upcoming vaccines can help crush the pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH:  Help is on the way.Traditionally and historically, highly efficacious and effective vaccineshave crushed epidemics like smallpox and polio and measles. We can do thatwith the vaccines that are going to be coming online.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  So great news about vaccines and great to have atleast three options are more are on the way. But before you get to thatpoint, Jesse, it looks like there's going to be more of these rules andrestrictions. Like, I don't think you would ever rat me out or call thecops if I had more than eight people over over.(CROSSTALK)JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  The price is right, Dana. You never know ifthere's a fine involved for a reward system, I might pick up the phone.There is a silver lining to these restrictions around Thanksgiving, andthat is there is more juicy family gossip going around. Families aresilently judging other family members for how they are behaving during thepandemic.So you have the one family that's chock-full the twenty-somethings, andthese people are high-risk. They are like out at the beach, they are atbars, you know they are coming in, and they're going to get everybody sick.You don't really want them to come but it's hard to tell them not to come.If they do come, you put them at the kids table, even though they are 26.And you -- if anybody does get sick, you blame that family member. Thenthere's the family that just wants credit for coming. They will jumpthrough all these hoops to get there. They've been quarantining for twoweeks. They've got extensive tests done, and they want everybody in thefamily to know that they will stop at nothing to get there, and so theywant credit.You respect the fact that they're getting tested, but you kind of roll youreyes at their theatrics. Then there's the family that is looking for anexcuse not to show up. These are the people that don't follow guidelinesanyway, but now all of a sudden they have to follow these guidelines, sure.You are looking for an out.Fauci gave you an out, and you are pleasantly taking the out. That's fine.You didn't want to be there in the first place.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS HOST:  Jesse, which category do you fall in?WATTERS:  Oh, I'm getting there. Then there's the family -- more or likethe uncle or the aunt with the comorbidities, the people that have a lot ofunderlying conditions but you don't really want to tell them to their facethey have these conditions. Like the ant that's chain-smokes and puffs, theuncle that's obese and has a bad ticker.Everyone is saying, you know, Uncle Joe probably shouldn't come but theydon't have the courage to say it to their face. Then there is the liberalfamily.PERINO:  OK.WATTERS:  The liberal family is not going anywhere. You have to go to them.But if you go to them, you can't fly. You have to drive. You have to gettested. You have to get temperature checked before you enter. You have towear masks. You have to social distance at the table. And if you raise anyobjections to these three conditions, you are judged as a super-spreader.PERINO:  OK. And therefore, you are doing what?WATTERS:  What do you think?PERINO:  I think that you're going to be the most responsible, and a goodson, a good dad, a good husband. WATTERS:  I'm looking for an out.PERINO:  You want to watch football. Dagen, it is -- we're talking in thegreen room that a lot of these rules are not laws. They are the governmentsaying this is what we want you to do, but there is, like, no law behindit.                            DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  No, and the decisions are arbitrary anddraconian and made by politicians who are plagued with arrogant-inducedidiocy. Here's my favorite. I'm just going to open my phone and look at it.This is recently -- this is on Wednesday. Restaurants and bars are orderedin the state of Pennsylvania that they can't sell alcohol after 5:00 p.m.until 8:00 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day.Why is that? OK, when you're in a crowded people -- people are going tostock up the liquor stores and then crowd into people's homes. There is norhyme or reason. And all of the restaurant owners and bar owners are wakingup to the fact that these politicians have zero idea what they are doing,and they make it worse because they are so condescending and sanctimoniousabout those very decisions.Out in Los Angeles where they're shutting -- in LA County, shutting downrestaurants, the restaurant owners are, like, wait a minute. We'veinstalled thousands of dollars of this protective equipment and now wecan't operate at all? The American people, regular folks, understand how todo a risk-reward analysis, a cost-benefit analysis.They actually know, hey, these lockdowns are hurting our livelihoods, ourmental health, they're increasing drug and alcohol abuse. And thepoliticians can't see that. The American people getting on planes, good foryou, going to see relatives, people that even hate the ones that will bringthis economy out of this malaise. You want it. You want to encourage thatbehavior, not tsk tsk, shame shame them.PERINO:  OK. And then we have Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York. And Greg,he's getting an award.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  He talked about it today. Let's listen to what he said.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK:  I wish I could say that my dailyCOVID presentations were well choreographed, scripted, rehearsed, orreflected, any of the talents that you advance. They didn't. they offeredonly one thing, authentic truth and stability. But sometimes, that'senough.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  Very humble, Greg, very humble.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  So I guess that makes Chris Cuomo the smartCuomo. I always had it reversed. First of all, before I talk about Cuomo, Ihave to say this about sometimes people unintentionally reveal their majorflaws. And Governor Brown revealed that she has no friends or neighbors,because no person would ever tell you to call the police on your neighbors.Because neighbors never do that, because you have to still live there. It'snot like you can call the police on your neighbors and say there are 17people at their Thanksgiving, and then you're just going to move away. Youare there the day after Thanksgiving. And my God, you will pay. If aneighbor did that to me, you will pay in ways that you don't evenunderstand.There are things that I could do to your front lawn that don't go away, andthey smell so bad. All right, so to Cuomo, hey, just to show you that lifeisn't fair. People think that we should always be striving for fairness.It's good, but life is never fair. So you have one man that ushers in arevolutionary moon shot in terms of a vaccine that's never been donebefore.And that will be a breakthrough that you can map all future vaccines on.He's called evil, right. He's evil. Then you have a man indirectlyaffecting thousands of people in restaurants, killing them. He wins anEmmy. And one gets enmity and another one gets an Emmy. And why is that?Because we live in a society that rewards and punishes only words and notdeeds.So why did Chris Cuomo -- Andrew Cuomo, Cuomo whatever, win something? It'sabout his performance, his words, not about what he actually did, becausewhat he did was horrible, absolutely horrible. Meanwhile, we punish Trump,for what? Being kind of obnoxious, his words, but what does he do? Well, hejust ushered in a brand-new phase of vaccines and changed the world.But those are deeds, and we don't reward deeds. We only reward words.That's is why there is no real fairness in society, and it makes me sick tomy stomach. We deserve an Emmy. This show deserves an Emmy. This show is abest on TV, and we still don't have an Emmy.PERINO:  We do deserve an Emmy.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  Screw your Emmies.PERINO:  You are exactly right. Now, Richard, there are comments and somemeasures that can be taken to try to keep businesses open?FOWLER:  Where to start? I agree. I think Dagen is right. There has to besome equilibrium, though. I think we have to understand that we are monthsaway from possibly getting over Coronavirus. Right now in the status quo,every state has an increase in Coronavirus cases. Hospitalizations arethrough the roof, and that means we have got to be mindful as Americans.We have to wear masks. We have to socially distance. We have to follow someof these guidelines as the surgeon general said this morning, because it'sthe only way we will ever get to a vaccine. As for Cuomo, I'm not sure heshould have gotten an Emmy. But I think it's worth pointing out that duringhis press conference, for a lot of Americans, was the only information theywere getting on COVID-19 because they weren't getting it from the presidentwho told us to drink bleach.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  You are going to have to take that back. He never said --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  He said maybe you can try bleach or maybe you can use a light.GUTFELD:  If you are going to make an erroneous comment, at least be in theballpark.FOWLER:  Oh, what do you mean?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  Did he say inject bleach?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  He didn't. No, you got that from a reporter.FOWLER:  No, he said it in the press briefing.(CROSSTALK) PERINO:  I'm going to pull it up in the Google as soon as we break.GUTFELD:  He was talking about future research and they were talking abouthow it would be really good if there was a way to disinfect.PERINO:  Yeah, it was unfair.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  -- any time a president is going out and giving conjecture duringa press conference, that's inappropriate.(CROSSTALK)MCOWELL:  Cuomo was killing our elderly.FOWLER:  I'm not denying that, Dagen. I'm not denying that.PERINO:  We need Kennedy's whistle. All right, Georgia on Joe Biden's mind.The president-elect expected to make a stop there as control of the Senatehangs in the balance.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS (on camera):  Joe Biden going all in on the state of Georgia as thefate of his legislative agenda hangs in the balance. Mr. Biden is set tocampaign for both Democrats running in pivotal Senate runoff elections thisJanuary. GOP Congressman, Doug Collins, warning what's at stake.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  Georgians need to realize the reason Democrats are flooding thestate of Georgia outside of (Inaudible) is because they want tofundamentally change the Senate. They want to fundamentally to take awaythe investigative powers of Ron Johnson and Lindsey Graham and others intothings that we know have been happening.(END VIDEO TAPE)WATTERS (on camera):  But this endorsement may not help candidate RaphaelWarnock. Far left Congresswoman Ilhan Omar backing a controversial remarkfrom Warnock's 2011 sermon, in which he said, quote, "nobody can serve Godand the military." Omar calling criticism of Warnock's comments a disgraceand shameful.All right, what do you think about the strategy, Dana, of kind of goingafter Omar going after The Squad and kind of bringing them into thisGeorgia Senate race?PERINO:  Well, I think that the Republicans at the NRSC, the NationalRepublican Senatorial Committee, they like it when a Bernie Sanders saysI'm fully endorsing John Allsop (ph), like, great, we'll take that and runwith it. That is perfect. Also, you have a lot of celebrities fromHollywood parachuting into Georgia, and nothing helps more.(CROSSTALK) WATTERS:  They had actual parachutes.PERINO:  Yes. It's a pretty big show that they have. And let me just pointout, for example, in Maine. There's like $40 million came in from outsideof the state. Spend money in Maine for -- to challenge Susan Collins. SusanCollins ended up winning by 10 points. And on one of the things that peoplesaid was that outside many irritated them.They don't want Maine to change. And I don't think Georgians want Georgiato change. And the worst thing that the Democrats have going for them isthat comment that Chuck Schumer made. First, we will change Georgia andthen we will change America. That's working in Republicans' favor. However,it's very close. It's going to be a tight race.WATTERS:  And I just saw a poll today that said that a majority of Americanpeople want the Republicans to maintain the majority in the Senate becausethey like deadlock.PERINO:  Yup.MCOWELL:  Right. And they're worried about what the Democrats would do inthe terms of getting rid of the filibuster and stack the Supreme Court andstates to the union so they can also stack the Senate. And that's not somedream that was cooked up. That's actually been laid out by many people.Throwing money around is always the sign of desperation.Ask any woman who has been on a date with somebody who like is throwingmoney out at this big dinner and you walk out and you are driving a broncotoo with rusted out floorboards. So you know that that's not good at,number one. They only -- the Republicans only need to talk about one thing,gun control. Say the word, two words, gun confiscation.Because remember that Jen O'Malley Dillon meant talked when she was runningBeto O'Rourke's campaign, was talking about mandatory gun buyback. Well,that's gun confiscation. And today, you did a segment because I waswatching your show about the Biden gun tax that's being floated. And if youread into that plan, so it's $200 tax on weapons if you don't turn them inas part of a gun buyback.It looks like the way he was talking about it, it would apply to manyfirearms in the United States. Nobody in Georgia, nobody in the south wouldget on board with that.WATTERS:  Can you guys stop trying to fundamentally change this country,Richard? I mean, give it a rest. How much damage can one party do do?FOWLER:  Look, we try our best. Let's talk what's actually happening inGeorgia. If you really think about why we are here, it's because of twowords, Stacey Abrams. Stacey Abrams, for a very long time, believed thatGeorgia could be flipped into a blue state. Her -- and a lot of other blackwomen began to organize in suburbs of Atlanta, the new Georgia project.And as a result, there's two competitive Senate races, and this is going tocome down to how the suburbs of Atlanta turn out in this decision, themplus Savannah plus Columbia, Georgia will be the determiners in thiselection. And while Republicans do have a voter registration advantage,what Democrats have in their favor, they have momentum.And they also have a huge base of Atlanta-grown celebrities who live inAtlanta, Tyler Peary, Cardi B, 2 Chainz --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  And they're going to turn up their base. That's why Georgiaflipped in the first place, so --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  If they get both seats, Richard, you're not going to not be ableto afford Jordans. You know they're going to taxes --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  -- not going to be able to afford a third home. It's going to betrouble. It's going to destroy the recovery.GUTFELD:  You know, here's the deal. I don't want the Democrats to wineither of those seats. And I think it would help Joe Biden, because JoeBiden needs a bad cop, right? If you have a Republican House, a RepublicanSenate, and you have -- I mean a Democratic House, Democratic Senate, and aDemocrat in the White House, he's going to roll over.It's going to be like a tank over a Twinkie. No, he's not going to standup. He needs to have the bad cop there. Having said that -- and I will getto the real reason. I can't abide by attacking Warnock over the phrasing,because basically what he did is traditional, kind of you can't serve twomasters boiler plate.You know, he didn't just mention God in the military. He mentioned God andmoney and God and man (ph). So it's one of those -- like, I want to beathim, but I don't wanted to say he's drinking bleach, Richard, is what I'msaying --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  Anyway, so anyway.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  I will give you the point.GUTFELD:  Thank you.FOWLER:  And thanks for clarifying. It's from the Book of Matthew where hewas preaching from on that particular day.GUTFELD:  Exactly. And I'm a little brighter than I look, just barely. Butyou can't let Democrats have total power because they fight asymmetrically,right? You know what I mean? It's like when it comes to labeling andbanning speech, it's only one direction. They are antifascist unless it'sAntifa. They are totally me too, unless it's Joe and Tara Reade.They are against racists until Joe says you're not that black. And they'reagainst foreign wars until Trump wants to end them. So you can't trust themto be like, like, a fair-minded in all issues because they are soasymmetrical. You have to have the Republicans there.WATTERS:  That's true.GUTFELD:  Thank you.WATTERS:  And Gutfeld has a matching salmon outfit going, the shoes and theshirt, and a hint of salmon in the blazer. I want everybody to check thatout.GUTFELD:  Thank you.WATTERS:  Coming up, some familiar faces are reportedly joining the Bidenadministration, why his latest cabinet picks are signaling a return to theObama era foreign policy, uh-oh, and an end to an American-first agenda.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCOWELL:  So long, America first. Joe Biden already well on his way towardundoing four years of President Trump's accomplishments. Biden's transitionteam is partying like it's 2008. He's stocking his cabinet with Obama erarelics like career bureaucrat Tony Blinken who will be Biden's secretary ofstate. And that's not all. John Kerry is back.He's going to be the administration's new climate czar. Greg, I am excitedto see what John Kerry -- what work he's had done to his face. But otherthan that, I mean, he could destroy, I don't know, our standing in theworld in terms of energy dominance.GUTFELD:  Well, Yellen (ph), Kerry is a spry -- I like when he's sprybecause that means you're old. He's a spry 76, so I'm just curious whatBiden has against people who were born in the 1950s or up. Becauseapparently, he's stuck in the 40s. And it's like -- here's the problem, andI think people are going to figure this out especially the media.Trump has spoiled it for everybody, because you just -- they are goingright back to the trough. The trough of the same names, the same insiders,the same squalid bureaucrats that don't do squat. And they are back there,and they just have to wait around. They're just waiting around -- for fouryears, they wait around and write a few books. They do some consulting.And then when a Democrat comes in or let's say a Republicans. They justcome back and they get another job. They hang out. They get to theirfriends and eat at the fine restaurants of D.C. Trump exposed all this.Trump hired outsiders, right? When he hired insiders, he got screwed. So hetaught -- everybody's eyes are open right now.We see what's going on. We can't take this seriously, right? And what isCNN going to do, right? You know what CNN is like? If Trump leaves, wedon't know that yet, but if he leaves, what is CNN like? CNN is like ahouse that's put up for sale that a murder took place in. It's like noone's going to -- oh that's CNN. That's the Trump place. What happenedthere? It's really bad. It's the Trump place (Inaudible).PERINO:  We are going to have to raise it.GUTFELD:  We are going to have to raise -- it's like a house where a murdertook place and that's why they are selling it. And you can -- Trump couldbuy CNN for a steal right now. Don't do that.MCDOWELL:  Richard.FOWLER:  Listen, when PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN ran, he said he would make surethis cabinet looked like America. And from these announcements, that'sexactly what he plans to do. For the first time, a Latino man will head upthe Department for Homeland Security --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  He's more than qualified. A African-American woman with 35 yearsof experience in foreign relations will head up the United Nations post.GUTFELD:  Is she good?FOWLER:  Thirty years of experience --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  We can go and on. But once again, what Joe Biden is giving youhere is people who understand how to run government. The number one problemthat Donald Trump had in the first year of his administration was a wholebunch of folks who had no idea how to run the government.GUTFELD:  That's why we loved it.FOWLER:  But that's why the government didn't work effectively.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  And for the record, and to be fair, all of those individuals whoworked for him, they all have left and said he is horrible, including RexTillerson.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER:  We could go down the list.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  You're a liberal.WATTERS:  He got off to a rough start because there was a coup. Rememberthe witch hunt? That was the rough start.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  I like the difference between how the media characterizes thesepicks of Trump. If Trump appoint somebody that he knows really well, themedia calls him a Trump loyalist. But if Biden appoints someone he knowsreally well, oh, it's a long time adviser. It's very close confidant. Andthe same thing with the way they characterize the guys' resume, TonyBlinken.This is what the Washington Post called him. They said Blinken is acentrist with deep respect for institutions. He is there to rebuild ourglobal world order and has a reputation as a non-ideological consensusbuilder. This is a hard news article. That's not an opinion article. So,how easy it is to be a Democrat when you have the media writing pressreleases for you like that.I looked blank in myself and the guys for every single intervention in theMiddle East, he's soft on China, and he wants more and more refugees tocome to America. Now, that's not necessarily where the rest of the countryis, so I wouldn't call that centrist. There is a consensus that he has agreat head of hair and I will give him that. And that's a good jumping-offpoint for me, personally. Right now, it looks like Greg is right, as usual,Mr. Gutfeld.GUTFELD: Well, thank you.WATTERS: If this is a return to normalcy, to boring people, to people thathave done this for years, career diplomats, people in the Obama and theClinton administration, these aren't revolutionary ideas. They're not evenbright ideas that these people have. They're there not to rock the boat,and then people else can get rich, while everybody else isn't looking.MCDOWELL: We do know what John Kerry is capable of, Paris Climate Accordand the Iran Nuclear Deal, which basically hands money and power to nationsthat hate us. It's like here, take some of our money and then use it to tryand wipe us off the map.PERINO: I think that they're not going to be able or even -- I don't eventhink they're going to change things as much, because let me just tell you,I think that, for example, NATO is now paying more than they were fouryears ago. Do you think that Biden is going to say, actually, no, we don'tneed that money? No, I don't think that's going to change.I think that a lot of people on the left, including Bernie Sanders, likethe new approach on China. And I think that Joe Biden's eyes have beenopened on that. And I don't think that's going to change. I think the Irandeal, how -- if there are going to go back into that, that's going to takesome really good communications to try to explain to the American peoplewhy that makes sense when we've seen how they've been stymied and there wassomething new.So, I actually don't think that foreign policy turns quickly like that. Ithink that a lot more domestic policy could change. And I would say thatBiden is content to be the antidote to Trump, right? He said he's going tocampaign as like return to normal guy. Everybody that he's announced issomebody that has been already confirmed by the United States Senate.There's a strategy there that like, I don't want to get hung up in maybe aMitch McConnell Senate. I want to be able to say look, you already approvedthese guys four years ago, what's the problem? Try to check them off?RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's right.MCDOWELL: Yes. With Janet Yellen, especially, I'll steal -- I'll steal thatidea from Richard. Check out this incredible video. A man jumps into thewater to save his dog from an alligator. Greg's monologue on that when THEFIVE returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Talk about snatching victory from the jaws of defeat or a puppyfrom the jaws of an alligator. Here's Richard Wilbanks in his backyardcaught on camera by the Florida Wildlife Federation plunging into a pond torescue his puppy from said alligator. He risked life and limb attempting topry the helpless mud out of the mob, the scaly monster without even losinghis smoke.I'm sure when most people in the media saw this they thought, sure, hemight have saved that baby, but as smoking is no example for our youth. Iwonder who he voted for? But Rich doesn't even break a sweat or loses ash.He deserves the Emmy not Cuomo. So, yes, this isn't, and animals are great.It's more like a -- humans are great or maybe badass dudes from Florida aregreat. It's about time they do get a bad rap.So, what could this be an analogy for? Is Wilbanks a metaphor for Americatrying to wrestle a stolen election back from the swamp, or is it Trumptrying to snatch America back from the jaws of media elites? They are kindof reptilian now that I think about it. Or is the canine actually Joe Bidenand the reptile the far-left Democrats which is why we must keep the Senateor Joe that sad puppy will be eaten alive. Or maybe the alligators justpeckish and the puppies lucky he's got an owner with a stones the size ofMount Rushmore, right, Rich?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH WILBANKS, SAVED PUPPY FROM ALLIGATOR: All of a sudden, an alligatorjust came out from under the water and grab little Gunner and was headingback in the water and was swimming off with it. It all happened so fastthat fortunately I didn't have a lot of time to think. I just -- theinstinct of saving Gunner because he's such a wonderful little puppy andjust won't go let that alligator have him.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: There you go. So, whenever you're thinking that you're not up tothe day's unseen challenges, think of this guy. I'm sure Willbanks wasn'texpecting to react that way to that event, but he did. Because he didn'tthink, he just did. Not bad advice for all of us, especially me.All right, I was thinking, Jesse, you must have an analogy.WATTERS: I hate to do this, Greg. But that alligator was this big.PERINO: Jesse.WATTERS: It's a baby alligator. You're acting like this guy is -- this like-- you know, he charged into the teeth of the German Blitzkrieg. It's likea baby. And the puppy, like, pranced away like it didn't even get hurt.GUTFELD: It had its jaws clenched.WATTERS: You're making this fly out to be a little bit more than he is.Yes, he rescued the puppy --GUTFELD: Would you do it? You wouldn't have done it, Jesse.WATTERS: I mean, come on.GUTFELD: Jesse, you would let the dog die.WATTERS: I would have rescued Rookie.GUTFELD: No, you don't.WATTERS: Rookie could have beaten up that alligator.GUTFELD: I think we have an experiment this weekend. We're going to put analligator and your dog in a fence.WATTERS: Let's not get too carried away.GUTFELD: I think it was inspirational, Dana. I watched it 100 times.PERINO: I think so. You know that I used to spend a lot of time in SouthCarolina. And my biggest fear were the alligators walking by -- you know,when you go by, and then like, they get the dog, and I would always say toPeter, but what if an alligator -- and he's like Jasper is too big. It'llnever happen.But it does happen. And this guy, I think you're amazing. I think you'reamazing. And Gunner looks super cute.GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Rich, I once wrestled a pizza pie out of a dog'smouth who have taken it off the table. And actually, people were thankfulbecause he only had his mouth on one slice.WATTERS: It was a Chihuahua.FOWLER: Listen, strong Richards come from Florida. You're looking at me.GUTFELD: Yes, that's right. You're from Florida, Richard.FOWLER: Talking about the analogy, the analogy sort of tantamount to me tobe -- well, I didn't realize how small the alligator was, and so Jesse justpointed it out.WATTERS: Yes, see? See?FOWLER: But going off with what you said about the rifting about, you know,could this be Donald Trump? Maybe the man -- maybe Richard is, you know,Joe Biden and the 80 million Americans have voted for him ripping back thehands of democracy, right, and the puppy is the democracy.GUTFELD: Well, fair enough. I mean, I did do the --FOWLER: And Donald Trump is the alligator, the little one.GUTFELD: The little gator. All right, Dagen.FOWLER: With little hands.GUTFELD: They don't have hands, do they? Do alligators have hands? I shouldlook that up or not.MCDOWELL: Feet, feet.GUTFELD: They have feet. That's right.PERINO: They have feet.MCDOWELL: I know a lot about reptiles, sadly, because I have no friends.This is the new test for anyone who's judging a future mate or partner.Would you -- would you jump -- would you wrestle a puppy out of the jaws ofan alligator. And by the way, their jaws are still incredibly strong.PERINO: And their teeth are sharper.MCDOWELL: And so, it's very hard to --WATTERS: That puppy just walked away --MCDOWELL: Do he didn't. He was bleeding.GUTFELD: He was saved.FOWLER: His tail was like --GUTFELD: You're going to get so much hate mail, and I for one I'm going tocheer it on.WATTERS: Because it's not going to you for the first time.GUTFELD: Well, it's going to be like, I can't believe Jesse didn't care.MCDOWELL: The puppy was bleeding, says Louise, Wilbanks' wife. And one morething, Wilbanks is such a badass, he said he doesn't want the alligatorremoved from the pond or destroyed. That's part of nature and part of ourlives.PERINO: Wow.GUTFELD: I think it's --PERINO: I wouldn't kill the alligator.GUTFELD: I think we've learned a lot about ourselves and a lot about Jesse.We learned a lot about Jesse and it's not very good.WATTERS: I can handle alligators that size.GUTFELD: I'm kind of sad. I'm sad. You know what? The other thing too,though. You always have to eat -- what if your -- what if the dog is inthere, but somebody else is telling you to go in and do it, but they won'tdo it? That's what drives me crazy, you know what I mean? When the woman'sgoing, get in there.WATTERS: Why does it have to be a woman?GUTFELD: It could be anybody.MCDOWELL: You saved --GUTFELD: It could be Pete Hegseth. Because you know what, Jesse, he is areal hero. He's up next with this new book honoring our nation's mostdedicated heroes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FOWLER: Pete Hegseth has a new book out tomorrow called Modern Warriors:Real Stories From Real Heroes. Pete joins us to tell us about the book.Pete, welcome to the show. And tell me, what was the inspiration behindthis book?PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: The inspiration behind this book wastelling the real stories of real heroes in their own words. It's my bookbut it's not about me and I'm barely in it. You get to go behind thescenes, hear from their own mouths their fears, their anxieties, how theyovercame it, the pain, the sacrifice, the service of guys and gals who'veserved since 9/11.And when they sit down with me as someone who's been in some of the sameplaces, I think they feel a little bit more comfortable. It's raw, it'sreal, it's not politically correct. One, you're going to hear hard truthsabout what combat is really like and then how they transition back home.So, these will -- these stories will make you proud to be an American andit's time we start collecting them and sharing them. Because societies,what we -- what we celebrate, what we honor is a reflection of what wevalue. And these real one percenters, the men and women that have gone ondeployment after deployment put their lives on the line, are who we shouldbe learning from and listening (AUDIO GAP)FOWLER: Jesse, next question.WATTERS: Sure. Pete, before we get to the book, I don't know if you saw thelast segment. Did you see the size of that alligator?HEGSETH: I do.WATTERS: Are you on team Watters or team Gutfeld?HEGSETH: I'm not going in that lake. I'd rather walk down the streets ofBaghdad than take on an alligator.WATTERS: I mean, I didn't expect that, Pete, and it disappoints me rightnow. But I'm going to let it slide. I'm going to let it slide.HEGSETH: I'm telling you that animals are too unpredictable. They may begreat but they're unpredictable. I can deal with humans a little bit more.WATTERS: OK, well, that was the wrong answer. But again, I will let thatside. I also respect the fact that you have a book out under your name thatyou didn't write. And I think that's a brilliant move on your part. And Iwish -- I wish I could pull something like that off.But in all seriousness, with all these stories put together, what in youropinion was the most inspiring story where someone really stared down deathand got out alive?HEGSETH: Well, each page is a story of that. This is -- these are NavySEALs, Rangers, Green Berets, bomb technicians dismantling bombs in themiddle of firefights. These are snipers. I mean, the story that really tookme was Nick Irving. He's an Army Ranger sniper. He was given the nicknameThe Reaper because he was so effective at killing the enemy.Every patrol that went out wanted him to be able to oversee their movementas anyone would want. And he -- and he put the enemy in the ground, andhe's damn good at it. But then he came home and couldn't quite figure outhow to put the Reaper away. He had all these skills and was so effective atit. And the transition is a big part of the book, too.You meet my former First Sergeant from Iraq who's a total animal and atotal warrior, saved his company from an assault from Al Qaeda on his thirddeployment, earned the Silver Star. Page by page are -- they're ordinarypeople who get extraordinary training, then go to the most dangerous placeson earth, live to tell about it, have the humility but also the insight ofraw humanity, and it comes through in the pages.You're right. I didn't write it. These are interviews. You're hearing it intheir first-hand words. And listen, I think we got him to be a little bitmore candid that people are used to, so you're going to get the real -- thereal story.FOWLER: Dana?PERINO: Pete, I don't know if you're able to see the first block, and Ijust wanted to maybe ask you a little bit of the news of the day because Iknow that you've been so involved in this protection of people and theirbusinesses when it comes to these lockdowns that are likely to happenagain.And I mean, they've basically had to be their own warriors for theirbusinesses and maybe get a comment from you on that.HEGSETH: Yes. I mean, fool me once, shame you. Fool me twice, shame on me.And I think you're going to see a lot of business owners saying, this is mylivelihood, these shutdowns are draconian. And we know a lot more aboutthis than we did when we were asked, you know, eight months ago to do 15days to slow the spread.People are being crushed and you'll see more defiance and rightfully so.Guidelines are one thing, mandates and lockdowns are another. And this isAmerica, full of free citizens with courage. And I think you're going to --when the people say the curfew is over, the curfews over as we saw inCalifornia. And I think we'll see more of that. You just can't take it.FOWLER: Dagen.MCDOWELL: Who are you most afraid of in this book, Pete? I'd say Jocko --HEGSETH: Who am I most afraid of --MCDOWELL: I'd say Jocko but --HEGSETH: Probably Jocko. Yes, he was a Navy SEAL commander. He's a scarydude. And he trained seals and (AUDIO GAP) deployment himself. Each one ofthem though. I mean, you don't ever want a sniper to be on the wrong sideof the sniper, either. And you know Caroline Johnson, female fighter pilotdrop bombs on ISIS. So, it all depends on where you sit and what yourcurrent assignment is.But these are -- and you know what we did? On this show or any other, youget sometimes only three minutes to talk to somebody who scratches thesurface. The show Modern Warriors on Fox Nation, you know, gets these guysa couple of beers, get some comfortable telling stories, then you get thereal story under the story. That's what this book is. We went to the nextlevel. And that's when you realize how ferocious some of these guys are andhow much they love their country too, so I think both --WATTERS: So, you got to drink and write the book. Amazing. Again, I mean,unbelievable, unbelievable.FOWLER: Greg?GUTFELD: Hey, I wanted to talk to you. A lot of people don't realize this,but you are covered with tattoos. And I know that you're due for anothertattoo because you get a new one almost once every two years. And I justcame up with a couple of ideas. First, I was thinking, a bald eagle rippinga flag out of the hands of an Antifa protester as he's trying to crack theLiberty Bell.And then I came up with one that I think is really good. OK, so this. Youshould tattoo the Pledge of Allegiance in Morse code. So, when someonecomes up to you and says, hey, what's with all those weird freckles? Yousay, that's the Pledge of Allegiance, you communist, and then punch him inthe face.HEGSETH: I'll go with number two, Greg.GUTFELD: Thank you. You're going to do that, Pledge of Allegiance in Morsecode.HEGSETH: OK. If I say I'm going to do it, I might have to. I got to see thelooks first though.WATTERS: He's amazing with words.FOWLER: Thank you -- thank you so much for joining us, Pete. You could pickup his book anywhere books are sold. We'll be right back with "ONE MORETHING."(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for "ONE MORE THING." Jesse?WATTERS: Congratulations to Nick Richards. He just got drafted by theHornets, pick number 42 in the draft. Recruited out of Jamaica in 2013,played three years with the Tar Heels in North Carolina. He was actually in"WATTERS' WORLD" many years ago at Patrick's school in Hillsdale, NewJersey. We played a little one on one. He took me down on the post andembarrassed me. I mean, I was wearing my jacket so --FOWLER: He would have embarrassed you on --WATTERS: You know, some people say I taught him all he knows but --GUTFELD: He looks like he doesn't even want to be in this thing.PERINO: How tall is he?WATTERS: He was so humiliated to be in this package with me. He doesn'teven know who I am.GUTFELD: He won't even fist-bump you.WATTERS: He won't watch this.GUTFELD: He won't even fist-bump you.WATTERS: Yes. I think he hated me.PERINO: How tall is he, Jesse?WATTERS: He's like -- I think he was 6'11". And --PERINO: I don't want a picture with that guy.WATTERS: Well, I don't think you'd -- yes. That'd be --GUTFELD: I'm sure he's thrilled that THE FIVE is congratulating him.WATTERS: It's his favorite show.PERINO: Congratulations, sir.WATTERS: Sir.PERINO: OK, I'm next. Do you remember back in August there was a terriblestorm and that tore through Iowa, it's called The Derecho, and it toppledall these trees? Well, there was some good news. This Iowa preteen, he'sonly 12, OK. His name is Tommy Rhomberg. And he's been using fallen treebranches and logs to carve hundreds of handmade baseball bats that he'sbeen selling to raise money for Derecho relief.Tommy came up with the idea on the day of the storm and happened to be hisbest friend's birthday. So, he made the first bat for him as a gift. Andsince then, he has carved over 200 bats and has a waitlist of more than 600people, which is like -- isn't he amazing? A round of applause.GUTFELD: I'm sure he's quite a hit in the neighborhoods.WATTERS: Really going to bat for the community.PERINO: He's very good, very good. Greg, you're next.GUTFELD: I'm on deck.PERINO: Your next.GUTFELD: Greg's drunk squirrel news. Yes, another one of these. Take a lookat this little fellow coming home from work after a night out. He had a bit-- he had a bit too much of a fermented pear. When you haven't fermentedpear, you'll know because you can't really hold your balance. Either thator he was doing a Sam Bouken ghosts lager because we're doing shots, he was(INAUDIBLE).I don't like it when animals get drunk because they don't know they'reactually drunk. They just think they might be sick.PERINO: Have you ever seen that with elephants?GUTFELD: No.PERINO: There's like a special fruit that they eat. And once a year,everybody gets drunk.GUTFELD: Great story, Dana.PERINO: Thanks. I'll make some video tomorrow. Dagen?MCDOWELL: Macy's holiday windows this season are dedicated to all theessential workers here in New York, the first responders, the essentialworkers, everybody who bailed us out earlier this year. But if you go seethe windows, don't crowd around because you know Cuomo's henchmen will showup with cattle prize (INAUDIBLE).GUTFELD: I'll be there.PERINO: Richard.FOWLER: Thanksgiving is Thursday and a group of entre -- blackentrepreneurs in Atlanta -- Decatur, Georgia are giving back by payingpeople's Kroger bill. They spend thousands of dollars purchasing otherfolks groceries for this Thanksgiving dinner coming up. And here's onecustomer's reaction to this.Maybe, maybe not.
