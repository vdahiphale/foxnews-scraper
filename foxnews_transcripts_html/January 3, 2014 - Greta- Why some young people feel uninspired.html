'Off the Record', 1/3/14: Why are some young people reckless about responsibility? Maybe it's because high-profile lawbreakers and liars never seem to be held accountable for their actions 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. We just talked about the 54 percent who think we are on a downward spiral. Many wonder, why do some young people feel uninspired and even reckless about responsibility? Well, have you ever stopped to think about the message we send them? And, in particular, the message from role models.
Here are a couple of recent samples. A law school graduate, illegally in the country - yes, violating the law - was granted a license to practice law in California by the state supreme court. Now, that's a new twist on a lawyer understanding a client - be a law violator, too. That's no message to send young people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Then there is Congressman Radel. He got caught buying cocaine. But he didn't resign after his arrest and conviction. Instead, he is returning to Congress next week to vote on more laws. Who knows if he thinks those laws even apply to him? What message is Congressman Radel sending to young people? Try not to get caught, but if you do, it doesn't matter, especially if you are congressman. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Or how about director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He testified before Congress, told a lie, and it was a whopper. And what happens? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not even a grand jury investigation for him. He gets a complete pass for lying to Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What's the message to young people? Lying is OK if you are a big shot? Lying is only bad if you are not? So, here's my thought: If you are tough on the young, you might want to lighten up. They seem only to be imitating what they see.
