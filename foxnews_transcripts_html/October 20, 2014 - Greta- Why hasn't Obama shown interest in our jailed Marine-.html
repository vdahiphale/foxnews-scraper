Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I just don't get it. Why has President Obama shown no interest in our Marine, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi?
Since March 31, the poor guy has been rotting in a Mexico call prison plus struggling in a very sluggish, at best, Mexican court system. What I don't get all these months later is why President Obama is not all over this, being the fiercest advocate for our jailed Marine. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He is Sergeant Tahmooressi's Commander-in-Chief. And don't tell me President Obama is busy. Yes, indeed, he is busy. But President Obama has had lots of chances to make a statement at a press conference, or even in passing, as he walks in Marine One, just to show he cares - or at least he knows about - Sergeant Tahmooressi. He even had a chance to bring it up with the president in Mexico when they spoke over the summer. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But he never mentioned it. He ignored our Marine. I don't get it, all these months, not one word about our jailed Marine by President Obama. If there is a good reason President Obama is stiffing Sergeant Tahmooressi, tell us. If he knows something about Sergeant Tahmooressi that would change our minds, tell us. I don't want to push and get him out of that Mexican prison if there is not a good reason not to. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm also not going to dis Sergeant Tahmooressi, either. He fought for this country. I owe it to him. You owe it to him. And so does President Obama. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
