Former Democratic New York Governor Eliot Spitzer is giving a less than ringing endorsement for the candidate he has in the past said he would vote for. The Wall Street Journal reports Spitzer said of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Cuomo, "The problem Andrew has is that everybody knows that behind the scenes he's the dirtiest, nastiest political player out there. And that is his reputation from years in Washington." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A Cuomo spokesman responded with a not so subtle jab at Spitzer, "Cuomo's record, credibility, and honor speak for themselves, as do Mr. Spitzer's." Spitzer, of course, resigned two years ago in the wake of a prostitution scandal.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {

Virginia Republican Governor Bob McDonald offered apology and olive branch while speaking at a conference about slavery. The Washington Post reports McDonnell promised next April will not be called confederate history month as he originally said, but instead Civil War in Virginia month.
McDonnell was criticized earlier this year for the proclamation that at first did not include reference to slavery's role in the war. Today McDonnell said the omission was "an error of haste, not heart."

Regretfully Decline 
Former White House budget director Peter Orszag won't be seeing many of his former West Wing colleagues in the receiving line when he gets married in Manhattan this weekend. Politico reports Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and senior advisers David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett have all sent their regrets. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The New York Post says the trio were expected but bailed at the last minute. "The snub comes after Orszag, who resigned as budget director in late July, wrote an op-ed column that clashed with the Obama administration's stance in favor of raising taxes on earners of more than $250,000 a year." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Politico called the snub "pretty captain obvious... Orszag was already hated."  </pre>
