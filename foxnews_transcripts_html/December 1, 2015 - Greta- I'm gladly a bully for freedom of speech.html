Let's all go "Off the Record." I know Thailand is not a fan of mine. Remember, the Bangkok Post called me "rude and crude" after I called out the Thai government for sadistically sitting on its radar data about the missing Malaysia Airline Flight 370. For 10 days, they hid it. That was immoral of the military of Thailand.
Well, Thailand is about to get angrier with me. I'm calling them out again. Check out what a local Thai printer did to today's edition of the International New York Times. Why the big white spot? Well, because the front page story dared to report about Thailand's economy, which, as you might guess, is lousy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the story makes military-ruled government look likewise lousy. The Thai printer cut the story leaving blank white spaces not just on the front page, but also on page 6, which is part 26 the article. The Thai printing company is not explaining why, but I was not born yesterday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In Thailand, it's illegal - 15 years in prison - to defame, insult, or threaten the royal family. No doubt the ruling military junta does not like bad stories about itself. No freedom of speech and freedom of press in Thailand. And my guess, after this comment, tomorrow that space could once again be filled, trashing me again, not rude and crude this time, maybe a bully. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A bully for freedom of speech in the press? Bring it on! And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
