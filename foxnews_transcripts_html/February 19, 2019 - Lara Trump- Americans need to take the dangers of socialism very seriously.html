     Video  Lara Trump: Americans need to take the dangers of socialism very seriously 
Self-described Democratic socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are pushing the Democratic agenda further and further to the left; reaction from senior adviser for Trump 2020 Lara Trump. 
This is a rush transcript from "Hannity," February 19, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right, Tucker. Great show as always. Welcome to "Hannity."
All right. A lot of big breaking news tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Lawyers for Covington High School student Nicholas Sandmann, they have just filed and I have read a $250 million lawsuit against "The Washington Post". Also, breaking news surrounding lying Andrew McCabe. We have a special “Hannity” investigation into Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And that's all coming up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But we do start tonight with the very latest on "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett, he claimed that two late night pro-Trump racists tied a noose around his neck, doused him in a chemical, all the while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. But now, the actor has lawyered up. He's now refusing to meet with the police and multiple outlets now reporting that Smollett paid two acquaintances to stage the alleged assault and even rehearsed it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Those two men are now reportedly cooperating with investigators, and Smollett, he appears to be in big, big trouble, in the state of Illinois filing a police report, that's a felony punishable up to three years in prison. Remember that threatening racist letter filled with white substance, if there's any chance Smollett receive that prior to the attack, that there are reports maybe the FBI is investigating if you might have been involved in that. If that happens and he is responsible, well, he could also face federal felony charges. We're going to have a report from Illinois in just a moment.
But first on this show, we tell you, we wait for the investigation to play out. We keep you posted with all the facts as they come in, are available and we don't rush to judgment nor do we deny people presumption of innocence and that goes for Jussie Smollett. If his claims turn out to be a complete hoax, it would just be one in a long list of fake, phony, concocted, MAGA-inspired hate crimes in the Trump era. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, why is this happening? That's pretty simple, deranged attention seekers on the left, they know exactly how to extract sympathy from Hollywood and the media, just played their preferred narrative. Play right into it.
Now, for most members of the hate-Trump media, we, the people, remember we are the enemy. They believe anybody who supports Trump, his agenda as successful as it has been, we are scary, we are uneducated, racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic monsters -- and smelly Walmart people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The media really should get out of New York City and Washington, D.C., and L.A and San Francisco just a little more, because o this life could not be further from the truth. It is that every two to four years. Now, according to World Values Survey, look at this, the United States ranks among the single most tolerant nations in the world. Americans have led the way into charitable giving. The president's sweeping prison reform giving nonviolent offenders a second chance, widely supported among Trump supporters. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is the greatest, single best, kindest, country on the face of the earth. We are the most generous people. The average Americans, we are inherently good people.
But, sadly, that doesn't quite fit the left's narrative. So literally willing and ready and able to jump on any story regardless of the red flags, regardless of evidence to paint any Trump supporters as evil, and scary. And we've got the tape. And we'll show it to you.
Take a look. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

MIGUEL ALMAGUER, NBC NEWS: Certainly, there are many indications of a hate crime here. They are looking for two suspects apparently wearing "Make America Great Again" hats.
REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: It is coming from the president of the United States. He is dog whistling every day. He's separating and dividing.

HANNITY: This obsession, this rush to paint a sector of the American population, this racist, evil, pretty widespread. Democratic presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, well, they call Smollett case without evidence a modern day lynching. "GQ" runs the headline, quote, the racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far right America's endgame.
Look at NewsBusters -- ABC, CBS, NBC news a whopping 157 minutes covering the Smollett case from one perspective. Meanwhile, the same networks, they only spend 24 minutes covering, well, an actual hate crime in 2017 when a young man who happened to be white was kidnapped and tortured by a group of teens shouting anti-white, anti-Trump slurs. Those assailants actually filmed the attack, posted it to Facebook and were charged with actual hate crimes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the media cared more about Smollett and his too good to be true narrative. That is why you rarely see any outrage over what is now sharp rise, for example, of anti-Semitic attacks in De Blasio's New York. Comrade de Blasio. Because those attacks weren't carried out by Trump supporters with red hats that say make America great again, not a concern to the left. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Like this brutal attack caught on video, you can see there, a Jewish man savagely beaten, allegedly because of his faith, his religion, his ethnicity. Where is the outrage over this real hate crime? And let's not forget about the attack on Trump supporters simply because of their political beliefs.
Earlier this month, in Kentucky, a man reportedly pulled a gun on a couple for wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat. What is the obsessions with the hats? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Two days ago, a man's shoe store employee a graphic tirade against a teen because he was wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat and the employee has been fired. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {

        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And on Monday, a person reportedly called a 7-year-old kid "little Hitler," why? He had a hot chocolate stand that was raising money to protect the country for a border wall.
All of this happening in February. We are not even halfway through the month.
So ask yourself, why are people likely to get assaulted or accosted him the streets because they wear a hat that says they want to make their country great? According to the left, we are evil, we are bad, we are hateful. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is nothing new for the left. It is an age-old tactic, you can go back to Richard Jewell, the Duke Lacrosse case, Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, UVA, more recently Judge Kavanaugh, and more really recently, the Covington high school kid. Rushing to judgment is the left's M.O. and the media as well, no due process, no presumption of innocence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, breaking tonight, there are about to be real consequences for those who report fake news, slander, and libel innocent people. Lin Wood, he is the attorney that previously represented Richard Jewell and his defamation case and by the way, won a lot. He filed tonight $250 million suit against "Washington Post" on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann.
Remember, Sandmann was the young teen at the center of the media's fake outrage, lies, smears, slander, his lawful and completely normal conduct at a protest where he was attacked verbally and otherwise? Calmly, as you can see, he stood his ground, he smiled, and when a 64-year-old Native American activist walked over, approached him with his drum in his face, and kind of speaking loudly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HANNITY: These kids are 15, 16 years old and despite what you saw, members of the media like "The Washington Post" and NBC and others, by the way, you guys wait. I know Lin Wood. Lin Wood is one of the greatest attorneys in the country, and he will be here tomorrow night. You guys are in for a fight.
Vilified an innocent high school student, and according to the suit, we have an early copy of it says, quote, "The Washington Post" wanted to lead the charge against this child because he was a pawn in its political war against political adversaries, a war so disconnected and beyond the comprehension of a 16-year-old, Nicholas in this case, that it might as well been science-fiction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the suit against "The Post" says "The Post" must be dealt with the same way every bully is dealt with and that is, hold the bully fully accountable for its wrongdoing in a manner which effectively deters the bully from again bullying other children. In a civil suit, punishment and deterrence is found and awarding money, damages to the victim and target of the bully. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In order to fully compensate Nicholas for his damages and to punish, deter, and teach "The Washington Post" a lesson it will never forget, this action seeks money damages in excess of $250 million. By the way, the amount of Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, paid in cash for "The Washington Post" when his company, Nash Holdings, purchased the newspaper in 2013.
Finally, there is going to be justice. The good news is this happens daily with this hate-Trump media, this corrupt media, this rush to judgment, no presumption of innocence. It would have taken them 5 minutes to get this story right. They will now be held accountable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"The Washington Post" responded to the lawsuit today in email to Fox News, writing, quote, we are reviewing a copy of the lawsuit and we plan to mount a vigorous defense. My money is on Nicholas and Lin Wood.
Now, tonight, the hate Trump media, Hollywood, Democrats, they -- once again, they look foolish. They look stupid. They loudly and constantly claim to repudiate bullying of any kind. At the end of the day, the real bullies aren't wearing "Make America Great Again" hats. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And tonight, the real bullies, they will be held accountable. Mark my words, Bezos -- he's going to pay. According to Lin Wood, this is only the tip of the iceberg. NBC, CNN, stay tuned, coming attraction. Lin Wood, by the way, will be here for an exclusive interview.

But first, joining us with the very latest on this Smollett case, FOX 32 reporter, Rafer Weigel, is with us.
Rafer, good to see you. You've been at the forefront of breaking a lot of these stories, skeptical at first, unlike a lot of the national media but I have to give you credit for that because there has been horrific reporting in this case.
RAFER WEIGEL, WFLD FOX 32 CHICAGO REPORTER: Well, thank you, Sean, and I apologize to do this on your show, the name is Rafer, since I'm the only one on the show.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Really? You got to say something nice and you got to take -- no, Rafer, I'm sorry.
WEIGEL: No, I'm sorry, I apologize. You said something nice to me.
HANNITY: Right in the back of the head, we are getting along great. I'm just kidding, don't worry about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WEIGEL: The truth of my reporting, but no, you're absolutely right, very early but this case, Sean, I was very skeptical because the Chicago police were skeptical. You know, we were careful at FOX 32 News to report that Jussie Smollett says he was attacked because we were not there. We don't know if he was attacked. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Normally, I defend my profession but yes, the national media that ran with the headlines Jussie Smollett was attacked, that's journalism 101. I mean, it's the old adage. If your mother says she loves you, check it out. The police also told me that were very skeptical given the nature of this, the red hats, the bleach, the rope and the location in Streeterville.
I voiced that skepticism publicly on twitter. I did get backlash and now it appears that there might be some merit to that skepticism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As for the latest on the case right now, the very latest, this is the big news now. State Attorney Kim Foxx, a Democrat, announcing that she has recused herself from this case. I can tell you that this blindsided Chicago police. She just released a statement a moment ago was basically saying that out of impartiality, that there could have been, that they had -- let me get this right here -- that they want to address questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in this case.
So, this means the assistant state attorney Joseph Magats taking over the case. Today, the two Nigerian brothers went before police and prosecutors at 26 in Polk County courthouse. They were completely brought in total secrecy. We have every single entrance and exits staked out and we did not see these guys go out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The last time someone afforded that privilege with police and prosecutors was when Oprah Winfrey went there for jury duty. I did see the lawyer, Gloria Smith, she walked out a door marked grand jury and I asked the clients and she said I have no comment. Police then said no, the man did not testify before a grand jury today, but they are cooperating with the police and they are right now trying to help police build a case against Jussie Smollett. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the meantime, while all of this is going on, there was a separate investigation altogether, mind you the hate letter sent to the Empire Studios. That is being handled by the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service, the feds. We have no idea where that investigation stands. We have been getting some leads out of Chicago PD, but that is a host of potential trouble for Smollett because now you're looking at federal charges possibly linked to terrorism, completely independent of what might happen to the Chicago PD case against him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Rafer, let me ask you a question here. The Cook County state attorney, Kim Foxx's recusal, somebody sent me and I don't know if you know the truth of this so I'm asking do you know that she has endorsed Kamala Harris? I'm excited she is running for president. I would not be where I am today without excitements, et cetera.
Does any of this have to do with politics, presidential politics? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WEIGEL: Well, it could be politics but it really could be something as simple as she knows Jussie Smollett if she knows Kamala Harris.
As you know, Smollett has campaigned with Harris. You know, Kim Foxx, it's no secret, has aspirations of higher office and perhaps she didn't want to deal with any sort of political ramifications if she has to be the one to send Jussie Smollett to jail.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: May be she just saw potential conflict and got out which might be admirable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WEIGEL: And that is absolutely a possibility as well. Her assistant, Joseph Magats, I did not know him personally but I know that he is going to confidently, you know, handle this case and try to prosecute Smollett to the full letter of the law, if they find enough evidence to be guilty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: All right. Rafer, welcome first and last appearance on FOX --
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: Great job, great reporting all throughout and we appreciate you being with us.

Joining us now with more is Fox News correspondent at large, Gerardo Rivera, and the host of CBS show "Whistleblower", Judge Alex Ferrer, is with us.
Good to see you both. Gerald, I begin with you, the media, Geraldo, you have watch this over the years. You know, Lin Wood's lawsuit will be devastating to the -- not only to "The Washington Post" in the media companies, it will be devastating to big Hollywood stars.
He is an unrelenting. He is a tough, tough attorney. And I'm glad Nicholas and his parents hired this guy.
GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: Well, first of all, Sean, I hope this isn't my last appearance. You pronounced my name pretty accurately on a regular basis over the 18 years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: And you said my name wrong.
(LAUGHTER)
RIVERA: Cohunes, they call that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Sean, listen, first on the Smollett case. This guy played racism and politics inextricably interwoven as you know. It is not an accident that Trump is labeled a racist on a regular basis. You know, African-Americans tends to gravitate to the Democratic Party in huge numbers.
A charge like this was so incendiary, it caught on because it was, you know, kind of justifying and re-affirming the stereotype that people had, oh, poor black actor, guy, gets mugged by MAGA hats and the whole scenario with the news, and the bleach, you know and invoking the president's name. It was -- I mean, it was just so patently obvious, and yet, because of some toxic racism and because we want justice in this country while people have a fair shake, we bought this guy's unbelievable tale.
Now, it's coming apart at the seams and now people are being embarrassed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Geraldo, look at all the cases. They fall for obvious hoaxes, but, you know, they ignore, why is everyone getting attacked for wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat?
RIVERA: Let me just -- I cover Tawana Brawley, Sean.
HANNITY: So did I.
RIVERA: The mother of all race fake cases. Tawana Brawley reminds people with a 15-year-old upstate New York that went missing for four days and she surfaced, she was fithy, smeared with feces, graffiti written on her the N- word this and that and the other thing that she said she had been raped, not only kidnapped but raped by a group of six white men, including a cop and a prosecutor.
It turned out the whole thing was fake. But she did it to cover up on her own runaway behavior from her family. You know, the people went for it because oh, my god, it's the worst example of stereotypical racism and a racist country, and then the advocates jumped on board once they invested in her story, they were kind of stuck with it.
Al Sharpton, who I knew very well at the time. I was actually subpoenaed to be his character witness in that case to sue for defamation.
You know, but you ask, why do we believe these stories? Racism is real. Look at what happened in Charleston -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: That's a real story.
HANNITY: Geraldo, I gave all of these examples and it seems to go one way.
Let me bring the judge in.
Judge, good to see you. Welcome back.
Let's talk about the legal side of this from your perspective all the time, all the effort, all the police resources. There is a lot in play here and this is not a small deal if he, in fact, these witnesses cooperating or telling the truth.
JUDGE ALEX FERRER, "WHISTLEBLOWER" HOST: Absolutely. This is going to be a big problem for him because under Illinois law, making false police report falls under disorderly conduct statute and it's class 4 felony, which as you pointed out, exposes him up to -- between one and three years in prison. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What is going to be the deciding factor in theft, first of all, how much resource did he pull away? Chicago is not a town to afford to throw every detectives in every direction. They are buried in crime over there. On top of that, there's an indication that he may have been charged, criminally charged and convicted of making full statements before.
Those things do not weigh in his favor. Those are true. I can see a judge coming down very hard if it turns these allegations if the mail fraud investigation or not typically used as mail fraud because that is a purchase of products or lying to a federal officer as we've seen in recent political cases, they take that stuff seriously. If that bears fruit, then you are talking five years in prison.
So he's not in a light situation right now if this turns out to be the fraud that its' looking like it is. And the red flag that came up at the beginning were clear to the police officers. I assure you they were clear.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I have people warning me on day one , be careful. I have a good friends, thankfully, in Chicago.
The last 30 seconds, Geraldo.
RIVERA: I think this guy should get his just deserts. He played us like a fiddle, and all of the politicians who are not unequivocally condemning him now, shame on them, Sean. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: All right. Thank you both.
When we come back, Sara Carter, big breaking news report that you will want to hear next. Also, John Solomon.
Later on, Laura Trump will respond to the vicious, nasty comments that Bernie Sanders made about the president today. And on top of all of that, a big announcement at the end of the show.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Time for our “Hannity” watch on the deep state tonight. Liar, leaker Andrew McCabe, who served as James Comey's right-hand man for years, at the very center of the FBI's witch hunt into Trump-Russia collusion, who, by the way, under criminal investigation with others. On March 16th, 2018, fired, lying, leaking multiple times under oath. Read the DOJ inspector general's report.
McCabe is mentioned a whopping 800 times, and not in a good way. The report noted that McCabe lacked candor -- that means he lied, and referred McCabe to the U.S. attorney for consideration of criminal charges along with others.
As we speak, he is currently facing that a criminal investigation, likely over perjury charges and unauthorized leaks to the press. And now he is out hawking a new book trying to rewrite history with numerous public appearances, only from the outlets, all while jumping through hoops to avoid the facts about his difficult relationship with the truth. Take a look. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not convinced this is not just some kind of P.R. campaign to stop yourself from getting indicted. You were fired at the recommendation of the FBI, which in your book you cite four times how great of an organization it is, for your lack of candor.
I would like you to say it right here on national TV that you are not a source for "The New York Times." You were never a source for "The New York Times" or any other publication considering that is what you are accused of lying about.
Basically, were you a leaker to "The New York Times"?
ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER ACTING FBI DIRECTOR: Absolutely not, no, not in any time ever.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why did James Comey deny a claim that he approved a leak to the press?
MCCABE: I don't know why Jim Comey doesn't remember the conversations that we had in the same way that I do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Pretty disgraceful.
Now, so while he throws his longtime friend and buddy, and colleague, the ever so honorable James Comey under the bus and maybe not so honorable, he had nothing but praise for FBI lovebirds Strzok and Page. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCCABE: Lisa Page and Pete Strzok are good people who serve this country well. They have made some poor decisions in their private lives and in terms of the communications they exchanged with each other. That has brought incredible grief and scrutiny on the FBI, I'm sure they regret that. But good people make bad decisions every day.
HANNITY: Good people serving the country well, you mean when the supposedly nonpartisan, high ranking FBI officials talking about opening an investigation into Trump as an insurance policy, oh, with him, in order to literally destroy his presidency, undo a duly-elected president, Strzok calling the president an idiot, abysmal. Lisa Page calling Trump loathsome and awful. And Strzok saying that Hillary Clinton should win back the election in 2016, 100 million to zero, zero? It's probably why he rigged the investigation uncovered up the crimes we know she committed.
What about when they call Donald Trump an enormous leap, a bleeping idiot, worse. And let's not forget when Strzok texted, that he could smell Trump supporters, us, in a Walmart in southern Virginia. These two are harboring aggressive, sick, obsessive-compulsive, pro-Clinton, anti-Trump feelings, all while clearing Hillary Clinton of obvious crimes, which we have highlighted over and over again on the show. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then actively participated in the insurance policy, witch hunt against the president, even serving in Mueller's investigation, like all the other Clinton-sycophants Democratic donors. Their texts came to light, leading to the termination of Strzok and forcing Page to resign in shame.
Joining us now with a lot more, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, from "The Hill", John Solomon.
Besides, I'm gong to get to Rosenstein and we're going to get to wearing a wire and we're going to get to what obviously happened in the case of the FISA warrant, court applications, FISA judges being lied to repeatedly. They sign off on it, they were warned it's not verified, they were warned it's likely lies, they warned Hillary Clinton paid for it. They were warned Steele hates Trump.
But, you know, it was two years ago this March, right here on this program, that both of you, John Solomon, Sara Carter, broke the story about the abuse of intelligence gathering, and unmasking, and so on and so forth.
Sara, you just had an update on this today, and you are saying that still, the office of director of national intelligence and the NSA won't let Republican lawmakers and see how many people were unmasked. Why are they covering that up?
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: I think this is stunning, Sean. I mean, all we have to do is go back to, like you said, more than two years ago when the story started coming out. And now what I discovered, Representative Devin Nunes told me when I asked him, what is going on with this investigation? He said, well, we were promised a year ago, and the president ordered the director of national intelligence, as well as the National Security Agency, to set up a repository. This is a classified setting where they can go through these highly classified documents that basically unmasked Americans. And we are still waiting.
They have not given us access to it despite the fact that they told the lawmakers more than a year ago that they would do it immediately. And they have just stymied them and stymied them so they have not been able to review these unmaskings. Remember Samantha Powers, the U.N. Ambassador at that time? She--

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: --350 percent increase in surveillance unmasking, leaking raw intelligence. By the way, a crime that was committed even against General Flynn?
CARTER: Absolutely, there was. And we - and then we found enormous amounts of unmasking that was done by the U.N. Ambassador, and then she even said herself during a hearing to Trey Gowdy that she didn't sign off on all those requests. So not only were there unmasking, but potentially people were signing off on people's names to unmask Americans.
HANNITY: All right. Let me go to the--
CARTER: To unmask the Americans.
HANNITY: Oh, yes. Well, that would be abuse of power just like every other instance of abuse of power, including lying to FISA court judges.
Victor Davis Hanson, really brilliant writer, has a great article in detail. I don't have time to go through it. Autopsy of a Dead Coup and how it's failed. And John Solomon, your paper, The Hill, Mueller interviewed McCabe in search of Russia gate dirt. Well, first of all, we know this pit- bull Andrew Weissmann was briefed by Bruce Ohr in August 2016. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOHN SOLOMON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND INVESTIGATIVE COLUMNIST, THE HILL: That's right.
HANNITY: And number two, we know that Bruce Ohr was funneling information from Christopher Steele long after Steele was fired for lying and leaking by the FBI to the Special Counsel's Office. Does that mean the dossier that Hillary paid for with Russian lies, has that become the road map for this witch hunt?
SOLOMON: It certainly was one of the road maps. Tomorrow I'm going to report that there was a third dossier. Remember we know about the Steele dossier. We know about the Blumenthal dossier that was sent to the State Department, forwarded to the FBI. Tomorrow I'm going to report there was a third dossier put together and given to the Justice Department using Fusion GPS materials. And when you hear who wrote it, who gave it to the Justice Department and who knew about it, you are going to love this.
HANNITY: After two years of us being together, you are now going to not tell me and you know who wrote it.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: And you're not going to - and you have this story locked down?
SOLOMON: Absolutely. I do, indeed. Yes. I'll give you a little hint. Let's assume that in the Bruce Ohr family getting stuff to the FBI was a family business--
HANNITY: Ding, ding, ding.
SOLOMON: --and that should be a--
HANNITY: All right.
SOLOMON: Yes.
HANNITY: Message sent and received. Thank you. All right. Let me go to what we have here. And everybody that I know that knows William Barr says "straight arrow." William Barr is going to do his job. If he does his job, Sara, he has to go back to Hillary. He has to go back to rigged investigation. He has to go back to the crime she committed. He has to go to the FISA that everybody was warned about, the dossier, what lies were told to the FISA judges. Correct?
CARTER: Correct. And Sean, there is nobody else to actually have an investigation conducted on any of this but William Barr. Remember, the final say is going to be the Department of Justice. Congress can only do so much. But without the Department of Justice, actually opening up an investigation without William Barr, all of this goes nowhere.
HANNITY: Right.
CARTER: We absolutely have to have an investigation.
HANNITY: So, John, you're going to blow the story wide open tomorrow.
SOLOMON: Yes, sir.
HANNITY: Both of you -- and I'll ask John first. Do you believe now that things are closing in on those deep state people that tried to rig a Presidential election and undo a duly elected President using - breaking the law and doing nefarious things and illegal things? John.
SOLOMON: I do believe that the truth is finally coming about how a small group of people at the top of the justice and FBI - Department of Justice and FBI tried to undo what the American voters did and do it in ways that were in violation of the laws and regulations they were supposed to adhere to.
HANNITY: Last word, Sara.
CARTER: Sean, what we're seeing was a silent coup. And if the Department of Justice doesn't open an investigation into this, then it will be a disservice to the American people.
HANNITY: No, it's even worse than that. It'll be a shredding of the constitution and the--
CARTER: Absolutely.
HANNITY: --end of the rule of law, as we know it, and due process and equal justice and application of our laws. I hope the new Attorney General understands how significant and serious this all is. Go back to the beginning. He's got to start there. Thank you, both. Look forward to that report tomorrow.
All right. When we come back, a mini monologue, the Democrats move towards socialism and how it literally endangers every American citizen. Also, Lara Trump is here to react to that, and Bernie Sanders' atrocious remarks about the President, and a big Hannity announcement, as we continue.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: So I've been telling you an extreme radical new far left wing has taken over the Democratic Socialist Party, pushing an agenda based on, let's see, higher taxes like 70 percent top rates, a wealth tax after you've been - basically legalizing government stealing after you paid all your taxes, and more government control over pretty much every aspect of your life, nationalizing industry.
And just today, crazy Bernie Sanders threw his hat into the ring, promising even more far left extreme radical, socialism. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING, CBS NEWS: What's going to be different this time?
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: We're going to win. We're going to also launch what I think is unprecedented in modern American history. And that is a grassroots movement, John, to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. That's what's different.
We have a President who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a xenophobe, who is doing what no President in our lifetimes has come close to doing. And that is trying to divide us up.
DICKERSON: But all of your--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. We all know Bernie is nuts and a socialist. The problem is, his ideas are gaining a foothold as like the majority of the Democratic Socialist Party. Look no further than Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez who worked as an organizer for Bernie back in 2016, pushing hard for his crazy ideas like the job-killing Green New Deal, Medicare for all, $33 billion. And just look at her latest comments about border security. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: No matter how you feel about the wall, I think it's a moral abomination. I think it's like the Berlin wall.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Congresswoman, the Berlin wall served a much different purpose. You see, they were keeping East German citizens in the country because they wanted to escape the tyranny of that country. Just the opposite.
Now, so far, Senator Sanders and the Congresswoman are relying on platitudes and bumper stickers and everything is free, free, free to sell their ideas, guaranteeing the end, by the way, of the U.S., as we know it. Here are the specifics. Cost of Bernie's government-run health care plan, $33 trillion in 10 years. Ocasio-Cortez get us all fossil fuel, the all- natural gas, only green energy, that's going to cost trillions and trillions.
And remember, you've got to take these seriously because, what, we have 100 Democrats supporting this and other major 2020 candidates, Kamala Harris, Spartacus Booker on board with these loony ideas even though they are desperately trying hard to avoid the socialist label when that's what they are endorsing.
Is it starting to make sense? So why are these far left radicals, why do they want to hide the cost? Why do they want to cloak their comments in vague, lofty, rhetoric take free houses and free health care and free college, and by the way, healthy government food that's guaranteed, and no monopolies, the takeover of industry, promises that are supposed to take away all of your fears in life. How did it work out with keep your doctor, keep your plan and save money?
Joining us now, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President 2020, Lara Trump, is with us.
I know you're used to the attacks. More importantly, free health care, free housing - and Elizabeth Warren wants free day care. We're going to have guaranteed healthy food, guaranteed pretty - vacations, medical leave, all of that, even if you're unwilling to work.
LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP 2020: Yes. Well, it's also crazy, Sean. And what I think people need to realize when we're talking about socialism, it is essentially the government taking over, as you're explaining, almost every aspect of your life. And in America, that is not right. That is not who we are as a country. That's not what our country was founded on.
These things are becoming incredibly mainstream within the Democratic Party, and it's going to be very hard for people to distance themselves from these come the 2020 election. I tend to think let them keep digging themselves in a hole because the average American in this country, I think, sees how crazy these ideas are and how quickly this would bankrupt our country and lead us down a path much like Venezuela is right now where, Sean, they're eating dog and cat food to survive. You see that they don't even have beds in their hospitals. They're in deplorable conditions. People are starving to death. That is not something that we want to see happen in the United States of America. People have to take socialism and anyone running on a socialist platform incredibly seriously.
HANNITY: How will they going to convince Americans that we're going to eliminate all fossil fuels? The cars we love to drive, the lifeblood of our economy, every American is going to have to retrofit and remodel their home. Oh, cows (ph) are going away. No airplanes. And we're going to, what, have sailboats to Europe and high-speed trains to Australia, New Zealand?
TRUMP: It makes absolutely no sense. And when you actually get down to it and start to ask questions like this, I think oftentimes, they really can't answer you. They say, well, we'll find the money for it. Well, who's paying for it, Sean? The reality is they want to tax 70 to 90 percent taxes on the American citizens. Think about what that would mean for everyone across this country. It is so crazy. It's never going to happen in this country.
HANNITY: Well, let me ask you that - I think what's happening, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, California - California lost a million people. They left the state. 13,000 businesses left the state in less than 10 years. They're all losing - they're all losing people in their states because they're leaving--
TRUMP: Absolutely.
HANNITY: --because of high taxes and burdensome regulation. If they do it nationwide, what do you think those people that have money are going to do? They're going to move their money--
TRUMP: And get out of the country.
HANNITY: --and they're going to move themselves.
TRUMP: You got that right. Everybody in New York is moving to Florida. And guess what. If they try to do it in this country, people are moving out of the country. It is going to spell disaster, absolutely.
HANNITY: Yes. Pretty scary. All right. Lara Trump, great to see you. Congrats on the baby. I hear the baby is running around, jumping all over the place.
TRUMP: Climbing on the sofas and everything.
HANNITY: I know. The first walking stages, steps that - boo--
(LAUGHTER) HANNITY: --scary. All right. Good to see you.
TRUMP: Thank you.
HANNITY: Still to come. An exclusive interview, John James, apparently, reportedly being considered for the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., and Congressman Steve Scalise, and a huge programming announcement, you don't want to miss, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. The Democrats want you to believe it's a manufacturer crisis, but we have disturbing news. Mexican immigration officials say they have now deported 25 MS-13 gang members who were traveling with a migrant caravan to the U.S.
And with reaction to discuss the swirling rumors that President Trump may tap him to be the next Ambassador to the U.N., former U.S. Senate candidate, Michigan, who I wanted to win, endorsed to win, which probably killed any chance he had to win, John James, and House Minority Whip Congressman Steve Scalise. Any truth to the rumors?
JOHN JAMES, R-MICH., FORMER SENATE CANDIDATE: Any truth to the rumors about the--
HANNITY: About you.
JAMES: --potential for the U.S. ambassadorship?
HANNITY: Yes.
JAMES: I have not been in direct contact with the White House, but it's a tremendous honor to be considered. And I was just listening to your last segment, Sean. And now Bernie Sanders jumping in the race is absolutely hilarious. He has called our President racist, sexist, xenophobic when our President has considered among the people for this job a black man, a woman and openly gay person for the role to represent the United States on the floor of the General Assembly.
Well, I'm somebody who represents more than just my race. I'm somebody who represents the United States of America, who's a combat veteran and is willing to defend this nation and keeping this country first and making sure we advocate for what's best for this country in New York and around the world. I'm looking forward to it. I'm extremely honored to be considered for the post, and I'm looking forward to serving my country again honorably.
HANNITY: Steve Scalise, 25 MS-13 gang members just deported. We have ICE haters - this is this week alone - invading defacing images of fallen heroes at a museum. Border apprehension is nearly double what they were last year, as everyone tries to get in quickly before the wall is built. Fed has busted a massive Mexican drug cartel operation in North Carolina. And Beto and company, they want to tear down that border wall. Your reaction.
REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA., HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Well, Sean, first of all, anybody who tries to claim it's a manufactured crisis ought to first go out and apologize to everyone of those angel moms, the parents who have lost loved ones.
Look, in my own part of South Louisiana, we have Spencer Chauvin who's a hero, a firefighter, who was killed by somebody here illegally. Sean, just Friday, in South Louisiana, there was a person who was here in the country illegally convicted of molesting a child who was deported in 2016 because of that felony, got back into the country illegally again. Who knows how many more crimes he committed? They just captured him Friday.
We have a serious crisis at our border. You can't have such an open border where you literally have people who were deported for being child molesters that are able to come right back into this country unchecked, and Democrats are OK with that and call it a manufactured crisis.
HANNITY: Well, I don't think - it's funny because there's 4,000 homicides in a two-year period, 30,000 sex assaults, John James, in a two-year period; 100,000 violent assaults. And by the way, Nancy Pelosi saying no, ICE will not be alerted if illegals fail gun background checks. OK, that makes a lot of sense.
JAMES: Well, I absolutely support securing our borders, and I think that we need to make sure we give ICE and our Border Patrol and security personnel all the resources they need. Look, you can't control every variable. But you better doggone well control the variables that you can. And if you can do more to secure our border, if you can do more to keep our families safe, our President's number one job - his number one job is to enforce the laws of this country and to keep Americans safe.
And I don't see this as controversial for our President to finally keep his promises that other presidents have made to secure our border to keep Americans safe. Our President is actually doing it. So I don't find it controversial to keep Americans safe. And I'm looking forward to doing everything I can to do that here and above.
HANNITY: How is it possible though? Between cartels, gangs, 90 percent heroin, Steve Scalise, fentanyl, the homicides I mentioned, the sexual assaults I mentioned, the violent assaults I mentioned, angel moms and dads, how is it possible they can even suggest manufactured?
SCALISE: Well, this has become a real problem for the Democrat Party. When you see this denial, it looked - the Americans across the board believe in national security and border security. They know what's going on. They know that President Trump said that he's going to secure our border and he's following through on that promise. And frankly, he's going to be rewarded by it in any of these open border Democrats. I hope they continue to push back because it shows the divide. President Trump is working to keep our country safe.
HANNITY: Thank you, both. And John James, I hope there is a position for you in the administration. That'd be great.
When we come back, our Villain of the Day, one of the most deranged commentators and fake news, we've got the tape, and my big announcement. I'm pretty happy about this - well, some parts of it. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Love that animation.
All right. Our Villain of the Day, frequent guest on fake news CNN. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 


JEFFREY TOOBIN, CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST, CNN: I think the correct term is not "treasonous," but "patriotic." I mean, they are thinking about the national security of the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: One of the dumbest lawyers in the country.
All right. Now to your mail.
Arnold wrote on Twitter, "When you make everything free, you forget a very important point. Who the hell is paying for it?" That's a great question.
Gary writes, "I sure hope the Dem 2020 hopefuls are not flying around the country in big airplanes creating a big carbon footprint dirtying my air while on the campaign trail." They should take one of those high-speed trains.
All right. Our big announcement time. All right. Starting on Monday, we will be broadcasting live from Vietnam ahead of the historic second summit between the President and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. I will also have an interview with the President after they meet, an exclusive interview.
Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left. We are not the destroy- Trump media. But let not your heart be troubled.
