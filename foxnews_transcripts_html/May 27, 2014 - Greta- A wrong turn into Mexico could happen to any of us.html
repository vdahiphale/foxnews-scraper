Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Let's face it. This could happen to any one of us. That means you, too.
We have now reported two instances of drivers, a truck driver and Marine with legal contents in their vehicles, innocently making a wrong turn and ending up in Mexico. And worse, ending up in a Mexican prison -- and that's a really lousy place to be. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now in all likelihood, others have made turns, too, that are bad, that ended up where they didn't want to be in Mexico. But those others may not have been lucky enough to have the spotlight of the media to help them get out. For all we know, they're still sitting in a Mexican prison lost in the crowd. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, my thought, how about our government? State and federal? Wise up. Get more road signs, big signs, like this. Big arrows, big lights, clean the graffiti off the existing signs so you can read them. And how about a functioning U-turn so you they can actually turn around if you make a mistake turn on the first place? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a problem, and the solution -- it's obvious and simple. The government could help if they really care. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
