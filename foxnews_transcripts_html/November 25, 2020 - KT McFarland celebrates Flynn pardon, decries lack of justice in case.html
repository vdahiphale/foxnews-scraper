This is a rush transcript from “The Story with Martha MacCallum" November 25, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everybody. I'm Dana Perino in forMartha MacCallum and this is THE STORY. We begin tonight with a Fox NewsAlert. President Trump pardoning his former National Security AdviserMichael Flynn just a short time ago, ending a four-year legal saga for theretired Army Lieutenant General.Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 but was working to reversethat plea amid claims of prosecutorial misconduct. A lot of politicallycharged fallout surrounding this tonight. We will have the first reactionfrom K.T. McFarland who worked closely alongside General Flynn as well asByron York coming up.But first, a record number of Americans hitting the road tonight forThanksgiving travel despite CDC recommendations and this message fromPresident-elect Biden today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I know how hard it isto forego family traditions, but it's so very important. Our country is inthe middle of a dramatic spike in cases. I'd be surprised if we hit 200,000cases in a single day. (END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So, as state and local officials take measures that they claim willslow the spread including banning businesses from serving alcohol tonightand encouraging people to call the police on each other for violating rulesagainst large gatherings, some Americans are pushing back. One of them isRichard Giardino. He's the sheriff of Fulton County in New York State. Hesays tomorrow his deputies will not be enforcing the 10 person limit thatGovernor Cuomo has ordered on Thanksgiving celebrations. Sheriff, thank youfor joining us tonight. Tell us your take on why you said, what you did? RICHARD GIARDINO, FULTON COUNTY, NY SHERIFF: Thanks for having me, Dana.First of all, I think that all of us want to reduce the number of deathsand the people who are transmitting, but you can't do it in anunconstitutional fashion. So, I'm strictly looking at it from a legalstandpoint.Many people say, well under your legal view people may die. Well, you can'tkeep pushing liberties to the side to implement programs that may havebetter answers. So, first of all, the governor issued an executive order,that is not a law. It has the same effect and in fact in sanctions forbusinesses because they're licensed by state agencies like the LiquorAuthority or the health department. So, he can do that.But I think it's an overreach. And I've said this from two weeks becausethere's no position in the executive order which allows us to go intosomebody's house, to arrest them, to charge them or to find or do anythingelse with them. So, it's really has no teeth. And I think yesterday healmost conceded that when he said people misunderstood his order. He wasn'tsuggesting police were coming to their house.PERINO: Before he said that though, Sheriff, listen to what he said aboutthese decisions that some sheriffs are saying that they're not going to dothis. Here's what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): You don't have the right to pick laws that youthink you will enforce. And you don't enforce laws that you don't agreewith. Right. That's not a law enforcement officer. That's a dictator. (END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Sheriff, some might think that that's hard to swallow when duringthe protests Governor Cuomo tolerated those and encouraged those even whenwe were supposed to be social distancing.GIARDINO: Well, it's interesting that the governor would be calling anyonedictators when he's trying to tell you how many people you can have in yourown home. But I think people want us to stop the bickering. It'sunconstitutional on its face. You can't just order us into somebody's home.What I think is people like myself leaders on local level have to meet withthe governor and other people and say look, we all have the best interestsof our people in mind. Let's sit down. How can we fast orders that peoplewill follow that don't infringe on their rights? And Governor Cuomo saidsomething interesting at one of his Emmy Award winning press conferences,he put a picture of Abraham Lincoln and a quote on the screen and it saidtell people the truth and they will make the right decisions.And so, my belief is people in my community after eight months know whatthe risks are and can use precautions and make the right decisions fromthem. I'm not suggesting that people have 20 people at their house. I'mjust suggesting he can't do that.The other thing that's very important, Dr. Fauci has been telling all of usfor eight months, it's going to spike in the fall, it's going to spike inthe fall and winter, there's going to be more deaths, there's going to bemore illness and all of a sudden people - that's a surprise. We've beentold that we have to take precautions, flus spike in the winter, in thefall.And Dr. Fauci said just the other day people have to make a risk assessmentwhat's right for the families. I think one thing that's really important topeople around this country from the governor in California to the governorin New York, Michigan, mayors, do as I say not as I do. And if it's such avirulent threat to the society, why is it OK for them to violate their ownrules. And I think that's part of the reason there's such a push back. ButI think ultimately, we have to work together Dana to come to an enforceablerule that doesn't violate people's rights. PERINO: I think that sounds eminently reasonable and something he shouldtake you up on. Sheriff Giardino, I wish you a Happy Thanksgiving andthanks for coming on the show.GIARDINO: Hey, Dana, Happy Thanksgiving. Keep it to 10 or under or we'llhave to show up at your house.PERINO: You've got it.GIARDINO: Thank you very much. Bye-bye. PERINO: All right. Bye-bye. Also, here tonight, Robby Soave, he's senioreditor at Reason. And the sheriff just mentioned something that I wanted tobring up, which is that we have seen a series of examples where electedleaders are telling people to do one thing and then doing another.Earlier today, my sister, who lives just outside of Denver, sent me a note.She said, can you believe that the mayor of Denver, Michael Hancock is nowon a plane leaving DIA Airport headed to Texas and then on to Mississippi.He then has since tweeted an apology that you can see, I think up there onyour screen, basically saying that he made a mistake. It was too much. Andhe - but he did say, I don't think anyone would have thought I should spendThanksgiving alone, Robby. ROBBY SOAVE, SENIOR EDITOR, REASON: Yes. So, our elected officials, thepeople who are making these pronouncements for how we're supposed to live,they can't even follow their own guidance. We've seen that from countlessmayors, from some governors. And you know what, I don't blame them becausethis is really hard. It is hard to not see friends, to not see family,especially around the holidays. But that should make our leaders moresympathetic to the plight of everyone else and less inclined to resorttowards draconian, sending the police after everybody.I was glad to hear what the sheriff had to say. I fully agree with him.Didn't we also just have a summer where we had a conversation sort of as anation about too much policing or communities that feel overpoliced? Andnow you're going to say that we should send the police into more homes tobreak up, like private social gathering. That seems like a recipe forpossibly greater harm than even trying to prevent the Coronavirus. PERINO: The other thing is, I know that you are a little bit concernedabout the possibility that some of the things that the government hasdecided to do and look, and I understand a lot of them are under the gun,they're making complicated and complex decisions to figure out a way toprotect public health until we get the vaccine, which is not too far away,but that some of these measures are actually things that could last longerinto the future and infringe on liberties. SOAVE: Yes, I mean, there's no way around it. We're seeing a very, verydramatic expansion of what the government is apparently allowed to tell usto do, not just kind of in the public square or out in the public, but inyour own home. That's kind of a serious deal. And I understand why it'sbeing proposed. And we want everyone - I think it's fine for the governmentto propose to tell you, we'd prefer if you did this. Here's what we knowbased on the science, although even what they've said has not always fitit.We want people to actually eat at restaurants, outdoors, and in someplaces, they're closing those now. And so that will make people go to theirhomes where it's more dangerous. But anyway, it's just concerning to methat they can tell you what to do in that level of privacy violations isreally something to be concerned about that that sticks around that. Thatthat's a really, really scary precedent. PERINO: I think the other thing and you've made this point before is, theytold us in March, it was 15 days to slow the spread. And we've learned alot more about this virus that we know that the death rates are somethingwe would prefer not to have it where they are. We do know a lot more abouthow to treat the virus now, but we are looking at a potentially reallydifficult next couple of months while we try to get these vaccines out. Doyou think there's anything that the government can say to people toencourage them to try to hang tight? SOAVE: Right. They've been saying that for so long, the experts have beensaying that. This has been the longest 15 days of my life. I don't knowabout yours, and we wish we could redo it and say, actually, during thewarmer summer months, please go to the beach, don't close the beaches,don't close the parks, enjoy it now because we're in for actually a roughroad down the line. And I wish the government had done more to have to havetesting be really on a universal basis where you could be tested so muchthat you could be reasonably assured that some of these things are saferthan they seem.But the only silver lining really is that the vaccine does now finally seemlike it is just around the corner. So, maybe people can hold on just alittle bit longer, we've heard that before--PERINO: Just 15 more days.SOAVE: But I think it's true this time, yes, right. PERINO: A couple more of 15 more days along the way. Robby Soave, HappyThanksgiving. Thank you.SOAVE: Happy Thanksgiving to you too.PERINO: So, up next, teachers in one state plan to ask children to tell ontheir parents if they broke the stay home orders on Thanksgiving break.Kennedy is here to talk about that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Children in one state could face an interrogation when they returnto the classroom next week, Vermont teachers plan to ask students if theirparents violated travel restrictions by taking their families to otherhouseholds for Thanksgiving. And if the students say yes, they'll have toquarantine at home and learn remotely for seven to 14 days.Joining me now, Fox Business host Kennedy, who has two daughters of herown. What do you think about this whole thing? To me, you already have asituation where teachers and parents are almost pitted against each other.Now, you almost exacerbate that between parents and kids. LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: It's very true. So,anyone who has tried to help a student with math homework, you realize thatthose math lessons are set up, so parents are left completely in the dark.That's hard enough to begin with. But now children in Vermont are beingused as the wedge. And so, they're being indoctrinated to think that theirparents are doing something wrong and they have to spy on their own familyand then report back to operatives of the states, these teachers.And, they're going to ask little kids, did you see anyone? Did you have aplay date? And, of course, no one's going to encourage their children tolie. So, what does that mean? That we're all going to be shut ins for thisforeseeable future, that we can't have play dates, that we can't go to thepark and in places like Vermont, where it gets very cold earlier in theyear than it does in places like Arizona or California, kids can't playoutside. And we have to get creative. But this is not creative. This isoppressive. PERINO: In fact, one of the things that the student, the Vermont educationsecretary named, Dan French, one of the things he said is that schoolsoperate on trust. And that's, of course, true between their parents andtheir students and that they're hopeful that this guidance will give themsome additional tools to make sure that they do the right thing. MONTGOMERY: Isn't that wonderful? Yes. And also, if there is that degree oftrust, then people should have the opportunity to self-govern. And Ithought that those were ideals that were held onto pretty tightly in theNortheast. But my worry is that this type of behavior and these types ofsystems will continue and persist after the virus fades. When we are allvaccinated, and we achieve herd immunity, and we go about our daily lives.Will this be the new normal for kids? Will they be the ones who areessentially forced to spy on their own parents?Because the ramifications, they can be pretty dire, which is it's no wonderthe parents are looking into things like pods and micro schools and homeschooling, not just in Vermont, but all across the country. PERINO: That's an interesting point. I had a really great guest, ReshmaSaujani. She created Girls Who Code and I had her on the show, and she wastalking about how kids absolutely need to be in schools. And she said,look, I'm not going to worry about decisions that were made in the past,but what's the plan going forward? And her point, Kennedy, was that we areat risk of losing a generation of kids just because in this one year, Iknow of a young boy, he's seven years old, he has ADHD and asthma. Hehasn't been in the classroom since March. Kennedy, he has forgotten how toread.MONTGOMERY: Yes.PERINO: And that is devastating for a family and for his life. MONTGOMERY: Kids are at their wits end, and if they're not regressing, thenthey're static. And that's an awful place to be. PERINO: But not only that, Kennedy, but the data doesn't show that kidsshouldn't be in school. I think that's what's really frustrating. MONTGOMERY: Yes, it is. And kids are also they're not optimal vectors forthe virus. That means that they are not the ones who are spreading it. Butin big cities all across the country, these teachers' unions are the oneskeeping the schools closed. And that's scary because President-elect JoeBiden is talking about putting someone from one of the largest teachers'unions in the country, rather, in charge of the Department of Education.And we know the teacher's unions, they don't like school choice. They don'tlike charter schools. But parents are having a very different conversationthan that right now. And it's because of stories like this that manyfamilies are having a rethink when it comes to their kids' education. PERINO: There could be a complete revolution in terms of education out ofthis, which would be a good thing that could come out of this. Kennedy,Happy Thanksgiving to you and your girls.MONTGOMERY: You too, Dana. Thank you.PERINO: OK. Bye-bye. Up next, more on tonight's breaking news. PresidentTrump pardoning his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, takinga parting shot at the Russia probe. Strong reaction pouring in from bothsides of the aisle. Byron York and K.T. McFarland, who worked closely withGeneral Flynn join me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Breaking news tonight, President Trump announcing a full pardon forhis former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty tolying to the FBI in 2017. The president tweeting, it is my great honor toannounce a general. Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full pardon.Congratulations to General Flynn and his wonderful family. I know you willnow have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving.And just a couple of minutes ago, Flynn tweeted this, fight like a Flynn,God bless family. Here now, Byron York, Chief Political Correspondent forThe Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor. This has been quite alegal saga, Byron, and it comes to an end tonight. BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It does, and I think it's going to make alot of Republicans very happy because they believe that Michael Flynn hadbeen railroaded. If you go back to 2016 when he's part of the Trumpcampaign, the FBI is investigating him. They do a long investigation. Andby the beginning of 2017, they have decided that there is no improperrelationship at all between Michael Flynn and Russia.And they're going to close the investigation. And then they discover thiswiretap where Flynn was talking to the Russian ambassador, which isperfectly legitimate because Flynn was the incoming national securityadviser.They decide to go question him in the White House about this. There's somediscussion of trying to catch him in a lie. And even then, afterwards, theydon't think he has lied, and they decide not to do anything. It's not untilthe middle of 2017 when Robert Mueller, the special counsel was appointedthat they pulled the Flynn case down off-the-shelf and decided they can useit to try to pressure Flynn into testifying against the president. That'swhen he ultimately pleaded guilty and this whole terrible court saga began. PERINO: Byron, I want you to listen to some of the reaction after thispardon was granted today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is undemocratic. This is an attempt to rewritehistory. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Essentially, these pardons are yet another form ofobstruction of justice.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's not lose sight of just what a wild abuse of powerthis is by the president. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a body blow to our national security. It's also abody blow to the rule of law and I think makes a mockery of our democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Byron, as far as pardons go, do you really think this is one of themost controversial. YORK: No, as a matter of fact, it's kind of fits into a tradition ofpresidents pardoning people who've been caught up in investigations thatwere really targeting the president. On Christmas Eve in 1992, George H.W.Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger and several others who had been involved inthe Iran-Contra matter. When Bill Clinton left office in January of 2001,he pardoned a number of people who had been caught up in independentcounsel investigations that were basically targeting the Clintonadministration.Then in 2007, George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Scooter Libby, whohad been Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff, who was caught up in what was calledthe CIA leak investigation. And then. President Trump offered Libby a fullpardon, so these are entirely consistent with what presidents do on the wayout. If President Trump had won re-election. My guess is he would have letthis Flynn case continue in the courts. PERINO: Let me ask you about that, actually.YORK: Leaving office on January 20th.PERINO: Can I ask you about that? Because Judge Sullivan has been sittingfor about six months. The Justice Department had reversed itself. It wasasking for a dismissal. The Flynn folks were asking for a dismissal, andthe judge was waiting, and he tried to see if another court, what theythought and went back to him. He was sitting on this for so long that atthis point, I mean, now the case is moot. But a full dismissal was on thetable for Michael Flynn. YORK: Absolutely, because we had learned about FBI, the FBI's conduct inthis whole case, very questionable. They did not have a good reason tostart this investigation. The Justice Department this year in May decidedto just drop the case. We're no longer going to charge this man. This caseis over. The judge would not accept it, appointed his own advocate to argueagainst Flynn and has dragged this on at each time, even though otherjudges have suggested it's time for him to let it go because the JusticeDepartment does not want to prosecute. You're right. A pardon just makes itall moot now. PERINO: And Byron, I've followed all of your reporting on this as this hasgone on. And I thank you for keeping us informed and for being heretonight. Happy Thanksgiving.YORK: Thank you, Dana.PERINO: All right, also here tonight, K.T. McFarland, former DeputyNational Security Adviser who served under General Flynn for the Trumpadministration. She's also the author of Revolution, Trump, Washington, andWe the People. K.T., I feel like I should just open it up to you to expressyourself tonight. This is the first time we're hearing from you. And I'msure you're having a lot of emotions. K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Yes, I mean, firstof all, Dana, thank you for that, I'm very happy for General Flynn and forhis family and maybe they can now go about rebuilding their lives and hecan go about restoring his fortunes and reclaiming his reputation. But I like to look at it in even a bigger picture, because the effort to goafter General Flynn, it wasn't about General Flynn. They came after me too,it was never about me. It was always about getting Donald Trump. And theymade the whole thing up.Senior officials and the Obama administration in the West Wing and theJustice Department and the FBI and in the intelligence community, they knewMike Flynn didn't commit any crime and talking to the Russian ambassador,but they pursued it anyway. They made up the whole Russia hoax and theydragged not only Flynn and others, myself included, they destroyed ourcareers, our lives, but they knew that they were destroying the nation andthey still went ahead with it.And I look at that and I say, General Flynn has been pardoned. Good forhim. But how does the country get those three years back? How does theTrump administration, which was targeted from the beginning, and fromwithin, was sabotaged? How does he get that time back?How does the nation get the division back that these people sowed? I lookat the people themselves, they are never going to be held to account. Theyare never going to have to answer for what they did to the country and tothe rest of the people. They have collected their 30 pieces of silver and alot of them, in fact, are joining the Biden administration.PERINO:  I actually was going to ask you about that. You know, this casewas not dismissed as we just spoke to Byron about. Are you -- are youunsatisfied in terms of no one being held to account?MCFARLAND:  You bet. Because these people knew what they were doing. Andthey did it intentionally. And they leaked anonymous sources would beconstantly feeding this into the press about General Flynn, President Trumpand others. And yet now it's not anonymous sources that have come out.Documents have come out. A lot of it in their own hand. Text messages,phone messages. E-mails they were sending each other.They knew exactly what they were doing. They were saying one thing to theprivately to each other, we're going to get him. We're going to have thisgo on and on and on. We are going to try to even string it on past theelection in hopes that in a Biden administration they can go back afterFlynn.Look, if it hadn't been -- in my case, if it hadn't been for me having thebest lawyer in the country Bob Jeffer (Ph) of a law firm in New York andhaving a whistleblower on the Mueller investigation saying know, you can'tcharge her with crimes that she didn't commit, I would have been in thesame position.They knew what they were doing. They were charging people and blackmailingpeople with crimes they didn't commit. They were trying to get GeneralFlynn and myself to accuse President Trump of crimes he didn't commitbecause they hated him so much. And, yet, there is no justice. Now,whatever the Durham investigation is, I don't think that will ever see thelight of day.PERINO:  Well, K.T. McFarland, I know that this is -- it's a good day forthe Flynns. And I know that you feel good about it. I understand thefrustration.MCFARLAND:  I didn't.PERINO:  I hear it. And I hope you have a very, very happy Thanksgiving.You certainly deserve it.MCFARLAND:  Thank you very much, Dana.PERINO (voice over):  All right. Straight ahead, the true cost ofnationwide lockdowns. Food bank and unemployment lines are growing everyday. Our next guest says getting America back to work should be the numberone job for the next administration. This has been Andy -- Andy Puzderjoins me next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  As hard as itmay seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again. Our future isbright. In fact, we've never been -- I've never been more optimistic aboutthe future of America than I am right now. I honest to God believe the 21stcentury is going to be an American century. We are going to build aneconomy that leads the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO (on camera):  Joe Biden expressing economic optimism late todaydespite signs of a new slowdowns in jobs, long lines at U.S. food banks andCOVID-19 lockdowns returning to parts of the country. Jobless claims up fora second straight week with 778,000 Americans filing for unemployment andthere are more than six million Americans now receiving unemploymentbenefits.My next guest writes, job one for the next presidential administration willbe getting America back to work. The measure of that effort success will behow closely it can approximate the conditions of 2019. Not the result ofgovernment efforts to mandate economic equality, rather it was PresidentTrump's economic policies.Here now Andy Puzder. He former CKE Restaurants CEO and author of "It'sTime to Let America Work Again." So, I'm intrigued by what you wrote today.How do you think we can get back to 2019?ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS:  Well, first of all, we need tonot engage in the kind of policies we had during the Obama era which is biggovernment spending, tax increases. A deluge of regulations and attempts tosquash domestic energy production. We need to follow the kind of economicpolicies we had under President Trump.But in 2019, I call it the year of the worker. It produced the most dynamiclabor market in the history of the country. The strongest and highestgrowth in family income to the highest number ever and the highest declinein the poverty rate to the lowest poverty rate ever. We need to get backthere and we can get back there with the policies that are in placecurrently.PERINO:  I was going to point out to you the resilience of the Americanworker and the ingenuity and the creativity. Part of this might be out ofnecessity. But let me get your take on this.So new business applications in the United States for the third quarter of2020 were 1.5 million. So that's an increase of 77.4 percent compared tothe second quarter of 2020. People want to create new businesses. Now,again, that partly might be out of necessity because they lost their jobs.How can we help them keep it going?PUZDER:  Well, you know, and the economy is really on fire. That's why youare seeing these -- you are seeing these business applications. I saw -- Ichecked this morning on GDP now. And they've actually elevated, liftedtheir prediction for GDP growth for the fourth quarter to 11 percent. Twodays ago, they were estimating it would be 5 percent.So, people are really trying to get back to work. And these lockdowns, now,look, in cities where you have the potential for the hospitals or medicalfacilities to be overwhelmed. That's a different story.PERINO:  Yes.PUZDER:  We need to act very quickly.PERINO:  Agree.PUZDER:  But for the rest of the country getting back to work is incrediblyimportant. If you look at California. If you look at Illinois and New York.You take those three states of the 700 plus thousand new applications forunemployment insurance that came out today, 40 percent of those were fromthose three states and those are states that are locking their economiesdown.Damaging the people. Damaging businesses. Damaging workers. You know,elderly people can't meet with family members. We are seeing increases indepression, alcoholism, drug addiction, so, you know, we need to do what wecan to get the economy back on track.PERINO:  Also, we read today that many children Fairfax County schools inVirginia pointed out there are many children failing these classes whenthey are taking them remotely so we have to catch up there, too.I want to ask you about this though because we are in the holiday season,people are going to be wanting to buy Christmas gifts. I was interested inthis. Holiday spending plans are actually strengthening. Just a little bit.You know, last year people spent about $846. This year they plan to spend$852. Does that make sense to you?PUZDER:  Well, it does only there's -- people have a lot of savings.There's a lot of savings out there right now. Now that doesn't mean I don'tmean to demean any of the people that have lost jobs and are scraping toget by. But in general Americans have saved a lot of money over the pastsix, seven months because, number one, because they have been working fromhome and haven't been going anywhere. Number two there were governmentbenefits that went out.So, I think we could see consumer spending. People are getting -- I mean,people are really tired of this. And I can tell that you from personalexperience. We are all ready for --(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  Can I ask you one last question?PUZDER:  -- we're all ready for this to be over.PERINO:  I got one last quick question.PUZDER:  Sure.PERINO:  Do you think that the Congress needs to pass another COVID reliefbill before the end of this year?PUZDER:  No, I don't think they need to pass a massive COVID relief billthough. I think a bill that provided benefits for people that have losttheir jobs because of these lockdowns not because of anything of their ownfault but because of the lockdowns. Businesses that are now suffering likerestaurants that are suffering because of the lockdowns. We need to helpthose people. But we don't need a mass -- we don't need a $4 trillion bill.I mean, the 1.8 trillion that Senate proposed was more than sufficient.PERINO:  That's good -- it's good to hear you say that. An interesting asthey have those debates. We would love to have you back, of course. Thankyou, Andy.PUZDER:  Any time.PERINO:  Happy Thanksgiving.PUZDER:  Thanks, Dana. You too.PERINO:  Former President Barack Obama scold Hispanic voters for supportingRepublicans suggesting they don't know what's good for them. Raymond Arroyohere with reaction and some advice for a peaceful Thanksgiving dinner,next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO (voice over):  President Trump winning over many Latino Evangelicalsfrom the state of Florida and Texas. But today, President Obama claimedthat these key voters put aside Trump's, quote, "racist rhetoric because hesupports their religious views." Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  There area lot of Evangelical Hispanics who, you know, the fact that Trump saysracist things about Mexicans or puts detainees, you know, undocumentedworkers in cages, they think that's less important than the fact that, youknow, he supports their views on, you know, gay marriage or abortion.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO (on camera):  Joining me now Raymond Arroyo, EWTN news managingeditor and a Fox News contributor, he's also the author of "The Spider WhoSaved Christmas" which I have got to get indeed. Raymond, thank you so muchfor being here.You know, as soon as I heard that sound this morning I thought, my gosh, insome ways I think maybe in his mind a lot of things haven't changed. Butyou spent time on the ground talking to Catholic voters and Hispanic votersthat's not what you heard.RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Look, Dana, this clearly shows thatDemocrats and Barack Obama are worried about this constituency. PresidentTrump lost the Hispanic vote by 20 points to Hillary Clinton. With Biden heonly lost by 12. And in many of the -- in the hundred or so Hispanicmajority counties, he won those. He was -- he has increased his margins.So, they're worried. But to dismiss them on their religious beliefs, Dana,these are the things when I talk to voters, they kept talking about thestrength of Trump that attracted them. His pro-life position and his stanceagainst socialism. That was a deeply held fear for many of his Hispanicvoters.So, if he really wants to finish alienating the Hispanic voter for theDemocratic Party, keep talking and dismissing religion and their deeplyheld beliefs as well as letting the socialist wing of the Democratic Partylead. It will surely alienate.PERINO:  And then I read this this morning in Politico. I want to thebrings it up with you. This was saying that Biden must move quickly toprove he has learned from President Obama's mistakes on immigration. Obamadespite creating DACA was dubbed deporter-in-chief and is known forexpanding the detention of immigrant families and dragging his feet ormajor immigration legislation.So, you know, these issues are going to be front and center. In fact, Bidentoday said within the first 100 days he is going to have an immigrationplan. But that's not necessarily the only issue that people care about.ARROYO:  No. And not those Hispanics I talk to in Tampa, in Michigan. Theywere much more concerned about jobs, about the thriving economy and thesocialism. The fear of socialism coming to these shores. They just escapedit in their native countries.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  That's what they left, right.ARROYO:  Right. They don't want that, and that was a major, I think, forcein the Hispanic vote. And, look, we Hispanics do deeply hold our religiousbeliefs. We lead with that. That's a good thing. And the Democrats and theRepublicans should lean in to it, not disparage or make fun of people'sreligious beliefs.PERINO:  Hear here. I also wanted to talk to you wrote a piece for the NewYork Post about surviving Thanksgiving without political disagreement.ARROYO:  Yes.PERINO:  What's the secret?ARROYO:  Well, the big secret is, there shouldn't be politics at the table.PERINO:  Agree.ARROYO:  My friend Father John Youhas (Ph) used to say, Dana, the firstthing about politics is that politics is not first thing. But look, if youhave politically divisive members of your family that have to come over,use my containment strategy. Try to keep them at home and do a Zooms givingif you can. If they have to come to the table, seating is essential, Dana.Either site the CDC COVID regulations and put them out on the porch fortheir own safety, not for yours but for theirs. And if that doesn't work,seat children around them. It's awfully hard to get into political battleswith kids.PERINO:  I like that. Once they talk about TikTok the Instagram videos andBaby Yoda Uncle Fred will quickly go silent and focus on Dana's deliciouscasserole. I promise.PERINO:  I wish I can make a casserole.ARROYO:  Peace at the table.PERINO:  I'm kind of hopeless. But I love the idea of seating children inbetween people. It's great. Raymond, happy Thanksgiving to you.ARROYO:  It is a good strategy. Happy Thanksgiving to you.PERINO:  Thank you.ARROYO:  Thank you, Dana.PERINO:  And you can also catch Raymond later tonight on the IngrahamAngle. Up next, a story of true American patriotism. You'll meet a marinewho went above and beyond to help his friends serving in Vietnam bringingthem a little taste of home.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO:  Ahead of Thanksgiving we gave thanks to all the men and women whofight for our nation's freedom. My next guest has an incredible story ofhow he showed his gratitude back in the 1960s while protest flooded thestreets of the Vietnam War.The marine veteran, Chick Donohue had the idea of going overseas to givehis friends in the service some moral support and a much-needed beer. Thejourney to get there was one he will never forget.And when he arrived, the colonel who never drink on the job poured a drinkand cheer to Chick who, quote, "brought our boys beer, respect, pride andlove."Joining me now is John 'Chick' Donohue, the author of "The Greatest BeerRun Ever." And Chick, I have to say, this story completely blew me away.How in the world did you get in your head to put a bunch of beer and aduffel bag and get yourself to Vietnam?JOHN 'CHICK' DONOHUE, AUTHOR, THE GREATEST BEER RUN EVER:  Well, to tellyou the truth, it was like a dare. We had lost 26 guys in my neighborhoodup in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Somebody suggested it was the(Inaudible) actually that I should go or somebody should go over there. Iwas (Inaudible) qualified should go over there and bring them a beer andtell them that we supported them, and pat them on the back and thank them.So that's what I did.PERINO:  How did you figure out getting a job that helps you get to travelto get there?DONOHUE:  Well I was a merchant seaman at the time. I've been out of themarine corps a couple of years. And I was sailing ships. I knew I wasqualified. I had been there twice before on ships so I knew I'd just godown to union hall, find the ship, wait for a ship that the men I knew wasgoing to Vietnam and get on it, if I got off it, if I could not get off ofit, if I could find them, that's great, but I had to try. So that's what Idid to.PERINO:  How did you feel when you saw the living conditions of yourfriends and the people who were fighting for us were living in?DONOHUE:  Well, I really didn't expect to be out in the field. The guys Ifound were all out in the field. Nobody was living in. They were living outin the field. So, I didn't see any living conditions, a hole in the groundor a tent, a hooch, that was it.PERINO:  I bet that when they saw you, they're excited for the beer, nodoubt. What finally got you to write the story down?DONOHUE:  Well, I'd come home and like a lot of guys that came back fromthe war, most guys that seek combat and not sitting in a pub telling theirstories about combat. But I wasn't a veteran like that so I told the storyand nobody believed me. And I couldn't actually call them up and tell themto get down to pub and vouch for me.So, I had to wait 47 years before somebody suggested, Chick, you shouldwrite a book about this. This is a great story. So, it was only after 47years that those guys really talk to me about it and agreed to cooperatewith me and my coauthor to Joana Molloy to write a book.PERINO:  It's been quite a year this 2020. What are you thankful for as wehead to Thanksgiving and any words of encouragement to people who arestruggling right now?DONOHUE:  Well, the country was in a similar situation, differentcircumstances, but split right down the middle in '67. And we eventuallygot through it. It wasn't easy then. This has not been easy, but we'll getthrough it. This is why our ancestors all came here. This is the place thatyou can make it.PERINO:  And would you encourage young people who were thinking about theirfuture to consider public service whether it be in the military orelsewhere?DONOHUE:  Absolutely, absolutely. I think everybody is obligated to performpublic service. The benefits, they don't necessarily have to go into themilitary but I think just like everybody has an obligation to vote. I thinkeverybody has an obligation, assuming they can, to give public service tothe country.PERINO:  Well, John 'Chick' Donohue, this book, I'm telling you I'm gettingyour book for my husband for Christmas "The Greatest Beer Run Ever." HappyThanksgiving to you, sir.DONOHUE:  Thank you, Dana. Happy Thanksgiving to you.PERINO:  Thank you so much. And before we go, don't forget to subscribe toMartha's Untold Story podcast.
