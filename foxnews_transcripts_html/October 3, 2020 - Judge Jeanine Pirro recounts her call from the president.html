JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, a heartfelt message of gratitude to the American people from the Commander-in-Chief who says, he is feeling much better and hopes to be back on the campaign trail soon.

Hello, and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight.
You'll hear more from the President in a moment and I'll share some of what he told me in a phone conversation earlier this evening.

But first, let's get right to my open.
The President is determined to move forward and like the President, we cannot, must not and will not surrender and hide as if that will make the coronavirus and our problems go away. It is why the President reopened the country while others were wed to the gloom and doom scenario of hiding in the basement.

Life is full of surprises, hurdles and monumental crises for each of us. 
The issue is how we confront, stare it down and fight back against those crises.
This October surprise, the coronavirus infection of the President, the First Lady, the Chair of the Republican National Committee, a campaign manager, a White House aide, former counsel to the President, three members of the President's debate team and three United States senators is to some a crisis of unimaginable proportions, requiring the stoppage, slow down, a pause in the business of this country -- but not to President Donald Trump.

I've often said that President Trump is like the character that goes into the lion's den, comes out with a pelt over his shoulder and his tie straight. But not only the man, the innovation and advancements in American therapeutics and a vaccine soon to be available are typical of American ingenuity.
Americans deal with whatever is thrown at them. We do the best we can to protect ourselves, our family and our friends. We learn who is vulnerable and we take the appropriate precautions. We deal with it.
As patients, we fight to survive, because we have no other choice, and we move forward just as this country does.

We may still be in a crisis, but we face it head on. We know that cowing to an illness just like shutting down the country creates even more problems, social problems, mental health problems, criminal problems, enormous injury and illnesses with devastating results.

We will not cower. The President will not cower. The campaign for the President does not stop. The country does not stop. The appointment of a Supreme Court Justice does not stall.
The President continues to be the leader of the free world. There is no crisis or national security threat. The President is not sedated, the President has COVID, but he is capable of carrying out his duties, making decisions in going forward.

This President is a man who never gives up. He never runs away. He never cowers. He always perseveres, and he always triumphs.
He is the greatest nation on Earth. He has the best medical care and he has the prayers of the American people and the force continues to be with him.

        }
      
Our job right now is to continue to move forward to make sure that this does not affect the campaign or this country in any way, so that when the President steps out and hits the ground running, that we are there to support him and to continue the dreams, the hopes and the aspirations that make this country, the greatest country on Earth.

ERIC TRUMP, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS (via phone): Hey, good evening, Judge.
PIRRO: Thanks so much for being with us tonight. I know obviously, it's your dad. You love them. It's highly personal. But what can you tell us about how your dad is doing? And I understand that you've spoken with him today at length. Talk to us.

        }
      
E. TRUMP: Yes, no, I did, and listen, anytime you see your father go to the hospital, he is the man I love and I respect. He's an absolute warrior.
And I think everybody in this country has seen that. He is an absolute warrior, every single day, whether it's this or anything else, he gets up and he fight every single day. And he fights ferociously, no matter what it is. He fights, you know, incredibly hard for the American people.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, you know, obviously, COVID is very, very serious. Obviously, something that's affected a lot of people, and obviously something that hit him, you know, very hard in the opening days, but I probably spent 20 to 25 minutes on the phone with him today and he sounded incredible. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Honestly, he sounded clear. He sounded great. The entire time, he was actually talking about the new aid package. He was talking about Mitch McConnell and stimulus. And he actually mentioned the airline workers and things that he wanted to do them.
And I mean, the man just never takes his foot off the gas. He just never, ever lets up. He might be in Walter Reed, but I can assure you, he was running a thousand miles a minute, and that's the first thing I think most Americans come to see that the guy is absolutely incredible.
He's the Energizer Bunny. Nothing takes him down. And as serious as COVID is, and as scary as it is, for me as a son to kind of watch the whole thing. I mean, I don't think ever watching Marine One take off from the White House lawn to go over to Walter Reed is something I want to -- you know, it's probably a memory I won't forget.

But the man is just remarkable. I mean, he is an absolute warrior. I love him to death. He sounds great. He was full of energy.
And I think it's going to be a quick recovery, and then he needs to get back to it and just start fighting again, and we're all going to fight and we're going to keep winning for America, and we're going to win on November 3rd.

PIRRO: You know, Eric, I mean, it is your dad and to hear him say that, you know, you don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days. How does that make you feel?
E. TRUMP: Well, it looks like -- it doesn't make you feel great, at the same time, I mean, I heard the energy and I heard the vigor in his voice tonight. I mean, he was again, you know, incredible, as I said before, and so you know, this is a deadly virus. It is something that you have to take incredibly seriously. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

He was the first person to shut down, you know, travel to China. By the way, I think my father's going to hold China fully accountable because they need to be held accountable. But, you know, that's for a later date. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I mean, he is the first guy to shut down China travel. What they've done with the vaccines and therapeutics is unbelievable. No one could have done it faster than he did, what they did creating ventilators and other things, no one could have done it faster and now he is battling something that's affected so many Americans and so many people around the world, to tell you the truth that he's going to beat it and we're going to beat the virus and we're going to continue fixing this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
And you know, Judge, the last thing -- I mean, you know, I see videos all day on FOX, you know, of these incredible supporters outside Walter Reed. 
They're holding American flags and they're holding the Make America Great flags and it's just -- the outcry of support for him is incredible and we live in a nation that absolutely loves him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

You see that the rallies where they're literally chanting, "We love you," 
you know. A couple of years ago, it was "Build the wall." It was this and that. It was you know, a lot of red meat stuff.
Now you're chanting you know, "We love you." This nation loves him. He has done a great job for this country, and as a son, I just could not be more proud of the man and he's going to get past this and he's going to get healthy and we're going to go out there we're going to fight in order to keep winning for this great nation that we all love so much.
PIRRO: You know, a couple of things, Eric. You know, when we saw him today in that video that he put out this afternoon, you know, I think everyone kind of had the sense that if he was in Walter Reed, you know, it's a hospital, and he is probably going to be at a robe, but no, there he is in the navy suit and his shirt and he's got his hair combed, he looks great. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it is -- it's got to be reassuring to, you know, you not only, but to him as well, because he takes those incoming every day, but to have the opportunity to hear people outside of Walter Reed, you know, honking their horns, yelling, telling him they love him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, I see it when I go around the country. But you know, it's a wonderful thing for him to at least be able to take in the love and the prayers that people have for him. And hopefully, you know, this is something that, you know, he can carry with him to kind of fight off the hate that comes from the left that I'll talk about in a few minutes on this show.
But any last thoughts, Eric?
E. TRUMP: No, listen, there's tremendous hate from the left. That is tremendous, even in a time like this, which should be a somber moment for everybody, and there's also been tremendous love. I can't say, you know, more so than I've seen a long time. There's also been absolutely tremendous love. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But you know, he's done a great job for this nation. He sacrificed so much for this nation. He wakes up every single day, and he goes to war for this nation. Personally, there's probably never been a single President that sacrificed more than he has.
And, I again, I couldn't be more proud of him. The guy is an inspiration to me as a son and to so many others. And he's going to get through this and everybody is praying for him and he sounds great. And, and again, he keeps making America great. That's exactly what all of us want, somebody to stand up for red, white, blue, and never apologize for America, he keeps working on behalf of this country, which he does so well.
PIRRO: Now, Eric Trump, thank you so much for being with us tonight. And thanks for sharing.
E. TRUMP: Thank you.

PIRRO: All right, and we'll all be praying for the President, and joining me now, Trump 2020 National Press Secretary, Hogan Gidley to talk about the impact of President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis on the presidential election and more.
All right, good evening, Hogan. You know, I wrote a book called "Don't Lie to Me," and you know, it's like putting truth to the lies and light to the darkness, and here we are. The President is at Walter Reed. They're lying about him. They're engaging in all kinds of hyperbole as to how ill he is, how will they want him to be, what they want to have happen to him.
And you know, I saw something today that said, oh, he is just trying to get out of the debates with Joe Biden. What say you from the campaign trail?
HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Just more lies from the mainstream media, Judge. They've attacked this man relentlessly. We've never seen anything like it, 95 percent negative news coverage against President Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's be honest, the media and the Democrats, they don't like Joe Biden. They just hate Donald Trump. They don't like what he stands for. 
They don't like the fact that he has fought back against so many other people across this country and the world who have attacked this nation repeatedly, time and time again.
He has given power back to the American people. That's what the Democrats and the mainstream media hate so much. They don't want to be out of power.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So they are pushing everything they can, every mechanism to gain that power back.
So they're going to lie about the President. They're going to attack him at a time when he's at Walter Reed. He is as tough as nails. He has fought back time and time again, and the only person standing between the relentless onslaught of the mainstream media and Democrats to try and take this country to a socialist nation is President Donald Trump.
He has done it for the last four years. He's going to do it for the next four as well.
PIRRO: Well, you know, what's interesting is, you know, the opportunity to even take a break from the nonstop incoming that I just talked about with Eric Trump, you know, and say, well, look, I've got COVID. Maybe I'll take a day or two off.
I mean, there he is in a suit, doing videos for us, and by the way, I think all of us forgot, but didn't we have a debate this week? And, you know, so now there was the whole discussion about the President and what he said and what he didn't say, what he meant, what he didn't mean. Any thoughts on that?
GIDLEY: Absolutely. He dominated that debate because President Trump is the dominant force in American politics today. Again, the onslaught never stops.
We have the best candidate. He has the best message. He has the best record and Lord knows, he has got the best work ethic. He goes to more towns, cities and states in a week than Joe Biden does in an entire year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He's at Walter Reed, still working on behalf of the American people because he cares so much every single day about making sure our lives are better.
He has succeeded for that in his first term, he'll succeed in a second term, regardless of what the left tries to attack him with, regardless of what the media tries to smear him with. This President has fought through so many different levels of attacks over his term, and he has fought for the American people with trade deals, with peace deals, with tax cuts, with defeating ISIS, with bringing back people who were stuck in other countries that Joe Biden never thought about bringing back.
Our hostages came back at a record rate because this President cares about this country and will always fight for the American people.
PIRRO: I want to ask you -- I want to ask you about one of the hot issues this week, and we're talking about Jim Acosta in particular, how Jim Acosta and there is a tweet from him. It says, "Trump condemns the KKK and white supremacists commenting on Charlottesville, racism is evil."
All right, so that was on August 14 of 2017. This October 1, Jim Acosta, contrary to what he tweeted himself in 2017 says, "Trump has finally condemned white supremacists ... on Hannity."
He did it three years earlier, and even Jim Acosta said it. I mean, they're lying to themselves as well.
GIDLEY: Right. And so many of the people who are on these news networks had this conversation directly with Donald Trump, when he told them I disavow this, I condemn this, time and time again, and they're acting as though not only did he never say it, but he didn't ever say it directly to them. The video proves it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How many times does this man have to point out the fact that evils in this country that exist, it was Donald Trump, who declared the KKK would be tried as a terrorist organization in this country? Not Joe Biden.
Joe Biden has a very checkered past with race relations in this country. 
Donald Trump turns up everybody regardless of race, religion, color or creed.
PIRRO: For all of us. Hogan Gidley thanks so much for joining us.
GIDLEY: Thanks, Judge.
PIRRO: And Leo Terrell, Charlie Kirk and Senator Bill Cassidy are still ahead.
But next, one of the closest people to the President, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows joins me with a live update on the President's health and what's next. Don't go away.

        }
      
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Breaking right now, an update from President Trump's doctors, just in to FOX News.
They say the President is continuing to do well, remains fever free and off oxygen. The doctors say while the President is not out of the woods, they remain cautiously optimistic.
Joining me now to discuss this and more, White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Mark, I suspect that that you've been through a lot in the last couple of days. What is -- the statement from the doctors --
MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF (via phone): Well, not as much as the President of the United States, and certainly he is just has unbelievable courage. He's a fighter as we all know, probably one of the hardest working men that I've ever had the privilege of knowing.
But I can say this that the doctors are exactly right. He is doing extremely well. In fact, I'm very, very optimistic based on the current results.
And as the doctor said, he is not out of the woods. The next 48 hours or so, with the history of this virus, we know can be tough, but he's made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning when I know a number of us 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
-- the doctor and I were very concerned.
PIRRO: All right. But you know, when you say 48 hours from now, you really mean 48 hours from when he went into Walter Reed, correct?
MEADOWS: Well, it really -- this particular and I want to make sure I don't speak for the doctors. I've actually -- Doc Conley is right next door to me, and we just left the President right before he -- actually, he is probably tuned in right now watching you, Judge.
But I can tell you this, the biggest thing that we see is that with no fever now, and with him doing really well with his oxygen saturation levels, yesterday morning, we were real concerned with that.
He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly and yet, in typical style, this President was up and walking around and even as the experts from the medical facilities, not only at Walter Reed but also Johns Hopkins got there. They looked at his situation and recommended that out of an abundance of caution that he come here to Walter Reed.
But he has an outstanding patient with one exception, he continues to work and continues to believe that he has got to get ...
PIRRO: Of course, he has got a suit on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MEADOWS:  ... a number of things done for the American people.
PIRRO: The man has his suit on and his starched shirt. Really? But you know, here's a question. I would love to have been a fly on the wall, when there was talk yesterday about the President moving from the White House to Walter Reed and the President said, I want to stay in the White House. 
Everybody said I could go up to a room. And you know, I could recover there.
But you know, he said, I really need to -- you know, I really need to get working and I really need to be in the middle of everything. So we basically move the White House to Walter Reed.
I mean, this is a man who had no intention of ever resting, but rather just accepting whatever therapeutics and we'll have a doctor on in a few minutes, and you know, his simple perseverance. But as you can expect, the country was fearful, but now it looks like things are on the mend.
MEADOWS: Well, I think the country indeed was fearful, but I can tell you, some of those fears were irrational, too. I have seen some of the reports and all of the pictures about transition of power and who is going to replace this person or that person, and while that may make for good clicks on the internet or make for great hyperbole on TV, there was never a consideration and never even a risk of a transition power, and what I find appalling is just taking a real severe health issue that millions of people around the world have had to struggle with.
A lot of people can identify with this, and this is a virus that came from China. We didn't know what it was all about. And honestly, we're finding out more and more and listen, the President said it best, he, from his heart spoke to the American people. We filmed his address to the nation just a few hours ago that he put out and he says it best. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's all about making sure that he is the leader that he is going to make sure that America is great again, but also that we defeat this virus together and the therapeutics that he is on. Hopefully, those will produce good results and quick results and give hope. Give hope for the American people, that's what this President is all about.
PIRRO: And we're going to be addressing those therapeutics and then we know that the patient is on the mend and will do everything he can to make sure those therapeutics are out.
Mark Meadows, get a good night's sleep tonight. Thanks so much.
And Dr. Robert Hariri with some insight on all this still ahead.
But next Senator Bill Cassidy joins me live with his unique take as a physician and a recent COVID survivor. What could the President be experiencing right now? Senator Cassidy joins me live, next.

I'm Ashley Strohmier in New York.
President Trump released a video in which he says he is starting to feel better in his fight against COVID-19. This is word that's released that Mr. 
Trump went through a very concerning period, Friday.
The President's doctor says he remains fever free and off supplemental oxygen. The President sounded a little raspy, but appeared in good spirits. 
You be the judge here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I came here, I wasn't feeling so well. I feel much better now. We're working hard to get me all the way back. I have to be back because we still have to make America great again. We've done an awfully good job of that.

        }
      
But we still have steps to go and we have to finish that job, and I'll be back. I think I'll be back soon.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STROHMIER: I'm Ashley Strohmier. Now back to JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE.
PIRRO: President Trump remains at Walter Reed National Medical Center tonight where he will spend the next few days.
The President in good spirits even tweeting out that video you just saw a few hours ago.
My next guest is not only a doctor but also battled COVID-19. Senator Bill Cassidy joins me now.
Good evening, Senator. Aside from your being a senator, you are someone who has had COVID-19 and you've recovered. First of all, how are you feeling?
SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Well, I feel great. That was about three weeks ago. There's still a little bit of lingering. I don't smell quite the same, don't taste quite the same. But otherwise, it's all good.
PIRRO: All right. So what can you tell us and the American people what you think the President might be experiencing right now based on what you went through at this point of COVID?
CASSIDY: They mentioned he had fevers. They mentioned that his oxygen level went down. That tells us that that virus that actually probably entered his lungs and was beginning to have a reaction. When they gave the antibodies, and then the remdesivir, they clearly were just trying to stop the virus in its tracks and keep it from affecting the lungs.
The fact that the doctors are given a good report, Mark Meadows just did, and he has given us a video in which it looks fantastic. No oxygen tells us the treatment is working. The President is on the mend.
PIRRO: Well, clearly, and his doctor just issued a statement to FOX News that we just read a few minutes ago. I mean, you know, no oxygen, no fever. 
All seems to be on the mend. But you know, we hear stories of people who are in their 40s and their 50s who have COVID. And you know, the President is over 70. I believe he is 74.
But they seem to have lingering effects. I mean, what do you think that the President might have given that you're a medical doctor, in terms of lingering effects, if any? I mean, does it depend on the patient?
CASSIDY: It does depend upon the patient. We don't quite yet know who gets what and why they get it. He does have risk factors. He is over 70. He's a little heavy. Too many Big Macs.
So it could be like me, very mild, just some alteration of your taste and smell. Some people continue to have problems with their lungs or with their heart. So we hope that not to be the case.
The President, incredible resilience. We think of the stress that he's been under for the last four years, he does incredibly well. You'd like to think those kinds of genes, if you will, will tide him through, but we will have to watch for that.
PIRRO: Well, the stress that he's been through and the fact that, you know, I don't believe the President has even had a sick day. He's never canceled anything. We've never heard about any event being canceled in spite of everything that's been thrown at him for the last three years and nine or
10 months, I mean, gives you some sense of his resiliency and, you know his determination and perseverance. Is that part of this fight?
CASSIDY: Totally. In fact, I noted that that reporter said he looked tired getting on the helicopter. In the years that he has been President, this is the first time I've ever described somebody -- I ever heard somebody described him as being tired and I once spent an entire day when he came down to Louisiana in different parts.
And at the end of the day, he was still going strong and he doesn't drink coffee so I presume it's just the caffeine, you know of a Diet Coke or two
So really remarkable metabolism. But on the other hand, the virus can be incredibly severe, and we don't yet know what lingering effects there will be. We just have to hope for the President, for Melania, and for everyone who is infected that the viral course be short, and it would be brief, it would be short, and to be kind, if you will.
PIRRO: And no lingering effects. Senator Cassidy, thank you so much for being with us tonight.
CASSIDY: Hey, thank you.
PIRRO: All right. Charlie Kirk and Leo Terrell are on deck tonight.
But next, Dr. Robert Hariri is back on JUSTICE to break down what's going on with the President and the members of his inner circle battling coronavirus. Dr. Hariri is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If you look at the therapeutics which I'm taking right now, some of them and others that are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they're miracles, if you want to know the truth. They are miracles. People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they are miracles coming down from God.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: That's President Trump just a few hours ago talking about his battle with COVID. The next few days will be critical in terms of the President's treatment and symptoms.
Dr. Robert Drury, the founder and CEO of Celularity joins me now with more.
All right. Good evening, Dr. Hariri, good to have you back.
The visual yesterday of the President leaving the White House on a helicopter to Walter Reed, many found alarming and to them, it signaled dire straits. What did it signal to you?
DR. ROBERT HARIRI, FOUNDER AND CEO, CELULARITY: It signaled good medical judgment on the part of the medical staff at the White House. Dr. Conley made the right move.
In a situation like this, you've got the leader of the free world, you want to make certain that you're on top of things and ahead of the curve. So taking him to Walter Reed, one of the finest medical institutions in the world was absolutely the right choice. It got him the right kind of monitoring that he needed and it gave him access to all the treatments that he is currently on, and it appears that they're working.
PIRRO: Okay, let's talk about the President's risk factors. Why don't you go through it and give us an idea of what you think can create a problem, or if not?
HARIRI: Sure. What we know is that there are risk factors and there are comorbidities. The data from the C.D.C. indicates that the vast majority of people who have died from COVID had comorbidities. These are coexisting diseases, which is an indicator of poor health.
Risk factors like age, weight, and so on and so forth are different than comorbidities, but they do contribute to your overall risk analysis.
Now, the President is a 74-year-old man who people consider to be potentially overweight. The reality is, this is an incredibly active adult male who has lived a very active lifestyle. He walks miles and miles and miles every day, and so there is evidence that weight is not nearly as important as the ability to maintain strength and muscle mass.
And I can tell you, the President, based on his activity and his energy looks like he is more than healthy enough to be able to combat an illness. 
This illness is one that literally affects people's immune system, and the agents that the President is on are definitely working to enhance his immune response to the virus.
PIRRO: All right, and you know, but remdesivir very quickly, they say is experimental, but it still can accomplish the goal with him and what do we have to look forward to in the next 24 hours.
HARIRI: Remdesivir is a drug that works to interfere with the virus attempt to hijack the biochemical machinery of the cell, the synthetic machinery. 
The fact is that there are other agents that I believe the President is on, an experimental immunotherapeutic from Regeneron. That's a cocktail of antibodies.
There are other companies like Sorento, and others that are working on developing what we call neutralizing antibodies. They work to block the virus from entering the cell or enhance the ability to fight the virus by the immune system -- agents that are going to have -- this echoes the important in parallel to developing vaccine strategies.
PIRRO: All right, and very quickly, the President called me this evening, and I mean, the fact that he's doing videos, I mean, he is calling and he is speaking to his family and he called me this evening. I mean, what does that tell you about, you know, his health, his general health?
HARIRI: You know what, I was very encouraged to see the President in the video because first and foremost, as a doctor, we look at certain signs of a patient's -- respiratory rate appear to be normal. He wasn't short of breath. He was able to speak in sentences without being interrupted, and I'm very optimistic that that is an indicator that he is responding to treatment.
PIRRO: Doctor, I'm so sorry. We're losing you. Thanks. Thanks for being on. 
We'll have you on again. Anyway, thank you, Dr. Hariri.
Some insight into my phone call with the President this evening is still ahead. But Charlie Kirk and Leo Terrell are next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I had no choice because I just didn't want to stay in the White House. I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in, don't ever leave. I can't do that. I had to be out front.
And this is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens. I can't do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: That was President Trump from Walter Reed Hospital earlier this evening. A lot to talk about tonight with my panel as the President continues his battle with COVID-19, with doctors saying they are cautiously optimistic though he is not out of the woods.
Let's discuss it all with Civil Rights attorney and podcast host, Leo Terrell, along with Turning Point USA founder and author of the new book, "The MAGA Doctrine," Charlie Kirk.
All right, gentlemen, there you have it, a guy who had the choice to go upstairs and rest for a while, but instead he chose to go to Walter Reed, move the White House and the staff with him and keep on working and then issue all of these tweets and videos so that we know how he is doing.
I mean, have you ever met a man like this in your life? I'll start with you, Charlie.
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Well, look, first we're praying for the President and for his health. This was completely unexpected. And you're exactly right, Judge. I mean, he's doing so many things for our country. He is negotiating Middle East peace. He is campaigning for President, and then this unexpected curveball comes through.
But you're right. He is being transparent, and I'm hearing from people in the White House, he is in very good spirits. He has the same kind of, you know, good positivity that you and I both know, that He has for our country, and we pray he'll get through this and I think found a lot of comfort in the video that he released tonight and he has had our back and our country's back for the last couple of years and we all want him to know that we have his back.
PIRRO: You know, Leo, I have to tell you, the left can say all kinds of horrible things and I made a decision I wasn't even going to mention them, because they're not worthy of comment. But they have to be impressed that here he is, 74 years old, taking incoming every day and he is working. He is working.
LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND PODCAST HOST: Well, I'll tell you, Judge, first of all, God bless the President and the First Lady. He is a role model.
This man states it very clearly, he puts country first. The Democrats put power first. But this man has taken on the Democrats for the last three years. He is trying to right the economy, deal with the health crisis and he serves as an example of fighting this illness, and what he is doing right now, he is inspiring people. That's why there's people outside Walter Reed Hospital. That's why people are rallying around the President.
And even though those left-wing media organizations are trying to bring him down, he is not going to let it happen. The people know his value and he always places country first. I am personally proud of the President of the United States.
PIRRO: And, you know, in terms of the campaign, we had Hogan Gidley out earlier, you know, the campaign is moving forward, and the vice presidential debate is going to be moving forward, but the President, I believe, has another debate. What do you think, Charlie? I think it's October 15. What should happen?
KIRK: Yes, it's too soon -- yes, it's too soon to tell, but I could tell you, the President would want nothing more than for his campaign to continue. I could tell you that.
What we are doing at Students for Trump, we knocked on thousands of doors here in Georgia and all across the country. We are not slowing down, and the President right now is fighting this virus and he has worked so hard for so many years.
But he can rest easy tonight knowing that there are millions of supporters picking up the slack. I've been getting messages, Judge, like you wouldn't believe of people that are donating money, that are making phone calls and knocking on doors.
I mean, the guy is a total machine and so he should rest right now. He has to focus on getting over this virus, and people all across the country, myself included, we are going to work twice as hard right now for this President who has done so much for our country.
The vice presidential debate is coming up in a couple days. Judge, you and I both know, they'll want us to go back to work and keep on focusing on what is good for our country and also on this election.
PIRRO: You know, Leo, last night I was in Atlanta, Georgia. And there were about a thousand people there and they were all, you know, coming up to me and saying please tell the President that we love him. Please tell the President we're praying for him. Please, I have a letter for the President. 
Can you give it to him?
You know, it's this kind of stuff that we all get. But the love and the prayers for him is incredible. And with what Charlie just said about knocking from door to door and all of his supporters doing that. The Biden campaign said they wouldn't do that because it would be dangerous with COVID. Now, I hear they're starting to knock and go door to door. You think that's hypocritical, Leo?
TERRELL: It's very hypocritical. Let me tell you, you were in Atlanta on Friday. I was at that same convention on Thursday. And you're right, they love President Trump. And I was in the San Clemente rally today, and I'm -- and I have sent communications to the President's campaign and like, Charlie, I have said, President Trump, I am ready, willing and able to go to all those battleground states.
But the Democrats are trying to use the Trump playbook against him. And I'll tell you right now, it's going to backfire. Trump has a magic with people. He brings out thousands of people. The Biden campaign brings out five or 10 people. It is a total mismatch.
And President Trump, I know you're watching this show. I'm ready and willing to go to those battleground states on your behalf, just like Charlie, just like every Trump supporter in this country.
PIRRO: Yes. And the truth is, Charlie that you are now on the colleges and universities as well. You've got a whole army of young people. You know, everybody thinks that the young people, the millennials, they're all Democrats. That's not the case.
KIRK: Not at all. In fact, we are seeing unbelievable enthusiasm and crowds, despite the shutdowns. Just coming up this Tuesday, we will be right there on the heels of the vice presidential debate with another campus event. We are doing events basically every other day at Turning Point Action, our political vehicle.
And I can tell you this, Judge, Joe Biden is really struggling with younger voters. His socialist light message, his big government message is not resonating with young families that are struggling to pay their bills, with mounting health care costs and with business shutdowns.
We are an entrepreneurial generation. We don't want another lockdown as lockdown Biden would do to our country. And again, the President right now has a grassroots movement to get behind him.
PIRRO: All right, Leo. I have 10 seconds. You have a message for the President.
TERRELL: Yes, Mr. President, I'm in contact with your staff. Give me a call. Send me to those battleground states. Let's win Michigan. Let's win Wisconsin. Let's win Minnesota and let's win Pennsylvania. I'll wait for that call. Thank you, Judge.
PIRRO: Charlie Kirk and Leo Terrell. Thanks so much.
And I'll share details of my personal call with the President tonight, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Tonight, I received a phone call from the White House operator who said the President wanted to speak with me. I was stunned.
I didn't believe the mainstream media telling us he was at death's door, but I certainly didn't think he'd be in the mood to chat. But sure enough, against all odds, he was his energetic spirit itself.
His voice was strong. He told me his biggest concern was he didn't want us to worry about him. He said he was feeling better and he hopes to be back on the trail soon.
He talked about employment. He talked about the stock market, but I got the chance to tell him on behalf of all of us that although he has faced such venom and hate from the left, his remarkable strength continues to guide us all.
Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way. JUSTICE has been served. Greg Gutfeld is next.
