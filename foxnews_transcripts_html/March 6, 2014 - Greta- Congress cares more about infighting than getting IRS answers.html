'Off the Record', 3/6/14: Congress had time to consider punishment for House Oversight Chair Issa for his verbal battle with Rep. Cummings, but no time to demand that the IRS comply with its subpoena of Lois Lerner emails 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Now, I'm not in favor of rude behavior, but is this the best use of Congress's time? First, here is what Congress did not do today: Congress did not vote that the IRS comply forthwith with the subpoenas of Lois Lerner's emails.
The IRS is withholding Lois Lerner emails from Congress. Congress did not vote to consider holding Lois Lerner in contempt for not answering questions. I would assume Congress we say these issues are under consideration. That's not action. That's stalling. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And this might not surprise you: Congress did find time to vote on whether to punish Chairman Darrell Issa for cutting Ranking Member Elijah Cummings' microphone at yesterday's IRS hearing. Republicans, of course, are the majority, so, of course, the vote was not going to punish Chairman Issa. But think about it. If we are going to get caught in the weeds of good manners and begin to punish politicians in both parties for what they say and do to each other, the nation is going to need to add two more 24/7 cable networks to make sure we cover it all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So back to the IRS: Let me repeat, I'm not in the favor of rude behavior. But why didn't Congress use its extra time today not being the manners police but being the police for the people? Leave it to Congress to care more about their own personal political food fight than the problems of the American people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
