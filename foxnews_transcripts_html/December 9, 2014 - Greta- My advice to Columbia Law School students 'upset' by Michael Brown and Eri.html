Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. This blows my circuits. Columbia Law School is allowing law students to postpone exams if the recent controversial grand jury decisions in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases have upset them. Yes, upset them.
I didn't believe it when someone told me that, but then I read the dean's emails. It's true, the law school dean wrote, in essence, that if a Columbia law student feels impaired due to the upsetting grand jury decisions, the student can petition to postpone his or her exam. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That is so unbelievably pathetic. Would you ever hire a lawyer who hears of disappointing news in a case that he has not been a part of, but wants to crawl under the bed and hide because it's so upsetting? Or do you want your lawyer to be strong, using his law degree to fight for your rights? I could tell you, no great lawyer who has fought for the rights of others hides under beds or in the dean of Columbia Law School, upon feeling impaired, ran from responsibility. You all know Justice Thurgood Marshall. As a lawyer, he argued Brown versus board of education before the Supreme Court. That was tough. Imagine if he had not done that and said it's too hard, I'm upset. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, my advice to Columbia law students, buck up, take your exams, graduate and work to protect the rights of others. And my message to the dean: What were you thinking? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
