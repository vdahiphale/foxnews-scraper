'Off the Record', 4/17/14: The Senate Majority leader doesn't lead, is divisive, has an obsession with the Koch brothers and has taken aim at the Tea Party and now a Nevada rancher. He's nothing more than a school yard bully

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I can't figure this one out. How does Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid keep his job as leader of the Democrats?
I don't think they would give him the boot. He doesn't lead. The Senate has been in a virtual lockdown for years, but worse, he has become nothing more than a school yard bully. Slinging insults, not substantive arguments or debate. I love that. Just insults. Taking aim at the Tea Party, calling them "modern day anarchists." He spends too much time talking about the Koch brothers, as though they're the reason he can't get anything done. Now, that's peculiar. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here is what he said about the supporters of the ranker Cliven Bundy: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARRY REID, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: So, these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They are nothing more than domestic terrorists.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I'm not suggesting that Senator Reid should agree with the Bundys or not. That's certainly not the issue of this "Off the Record." The issue is leadership and the example one sets as a leader. He has become the Senate Majority bully. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
