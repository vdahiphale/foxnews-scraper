SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And welcome to "Hannity," and this is a "Fox News Alert." Fox News has confirmed a disturbing report from DailyCaller, a list containing the names of Republican lawmakers was found on the left- wing gunman who was targeting GOP lawmakers earlier this week for assassination.
Newt Gingrich, Michelle Malkin, Matt Schlapp, Patrick J. Buchanan, Mike Myers will all be here with reaction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, the unelected fourth branch of government, the deep state, is trying to overturn the results of November's election and throw this president out of office! So how did a bunch of unelected bureaucrats get so much power, feel so emboldened that think they can undermine a duly elected president of the United States and just take over? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus, after this week's left-wing assassination attempt on Republican lawmakers, the left's come together kumbaya moment, like I said last night, is nothing more than an illusion. It is a farce to hide the left's true intentions. We will expose all of this hypocrisy in tonight's very important "Opening Monologue." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right, so the unelected fourth branch of government is now being aided and abetted by the destroy Trump media, all in a massive effort to damage and destroy President Trump. Now, this week alone, we have seen unprecedented and potentially criminal leaks from the deep state to the liberal Washington Post. 
Now, the liberal smear machine is masquerading as a news outlet in their reporting, citing, of course, once again anonymous sources that the special counsel is investigating the president for possible obstruction of justice and that Robert Mueller is also looking into Jared Kushner's finances and business dealings. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK, how is it possible that they dare to leak information almost every single day without any fear of consequences? And by the way, they're wrong so often. Present Trump responding to that report today, tweeting, quote, "I am being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. That's a witch hung."
Now, the president, of course, is referring to the deputy attorney general, Rosenstein, who in a two-page memo laid out the strongest case on why Comey need to be fired. Now Rosenstein -- now he wants an investigation by the special counsel to investigate why the president fired Comey and whether or not this was the right thing to do! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is insanity! And by the way, the special counsel now has 13 attorneys. And on top of that, including Hillary Clinton's attorney and multiple attorneys that donated to both Obama and Hillary Clinton. Now, predictably, the destroy Trump media -- they're jumping all over this. They are, of course, hoping that it will lead to President Trump's downfall. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let me remind you the Washington Post, ABC News, The New York Times, CNN, NBC -- they have all gotten it wrong on this issue. They all at this point with the American public should have zero credibility. So we have to take these latest so-called smoking gun reports come out late night every night with a grain of salt.
Last night, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein -- he issued this statement about trusting these stories about the, quote (ph), coming out of the fake news media. He said this. He said, "Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to, quote (ph), anonymous officials, particularly when they do not identify the country, let along the branch or the agency of government with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations."
Now, the Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations. You know what? I don't trust that (ph) either, at this point. On top of that, James Comey -- remember, he testified last week the media has been so dead wrong when it comes to stories about Russia. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, while all that is alarming, it proves everything we have been saying on this program. This deep state, this fourth branch of government, as we're calling it, doesn't care about getting the truth to you, the American people. And of course, the media -- they're the willing accomplices. Their goal is the exact opposite here. They are selectively leaking information, intelligence information that is meant to damage, in this case, the president of United States of America, which is exactly what we have been seeing now almost on a nightly basis.
Here's a perfect example. James Comey told President Trump he wasn't under investigation. Somehow, that's the only one thing that never got leaked to the press. Why? The reason should be obvious. 
And what's worse is the growing targets for the deep state. They've been successful in totally slowing down the president's agenda, Congress's agenda. Now, so far, they haven't been able to stop him, which means the deep state is now going after anyone who's even close to the president, including his family and White House advisers, and by the way, even people in the media.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The deep state now plans to create as much collateral damage as possible, targeting everyone and everyone (sic) from the president straight on down. So what we're seeing now is this unelected fourth branch of government looking for retribution, overturning a duly elected election. (sic) And by the way, they're not going to stop until this president is either stopped or thrown out of office. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here's the problem. Whoever is leaking this information to the media -- they need to be arrested. They need to be prosecuted. Every one of them needs to be put in jail. Why hasn't every Obama holdover been fired? Why have the leakers, you know, not been discovered and arrested at this point?
Now, these people have now become a clear and present danger to this country and to you and the things that you care about deeply. Now, because these people now have, of course, done this to the country, well, that raises a lot of questions. Of course, now we have the left and their vicious and vile daily hatred that is now tearing this country apart and creating a climate where what we saw last week is now in some ways even encouraged by some. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, last night's so-called show of unity -- remember, I'm not falling for it, the kumbaya moment at the congressional baseball game. It was nothing more than an illusion. Now, this week's left-wing assassination attempt on these Republican lawmakers is the culmination of endless vitriolic rage, animus, hatred towards the president and Republicans.
I'm not saying anybody but this individual is responsible, but this atmosphere is so unhealthy. And those that are unhealthy -- are they susceptible to potential influence of daily lies, misinformation, conspiracy theories? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

HANNITY: And after Wednesday's left-wing assassination attempt, the Huffington Post -- they had to take down an article calling for the president's execution. Take a look at the headline we showed you last night, "Impeachment is no longer enough, Donald Trump must face justice." And here's the sub-headline, "Impeachment, removal from office are only the first steps. For America to be redeemed, Donald Trump must be prosecuted for treason. If convicted in a court of law, executed." Beyond disturbing.
But there are plenty of other examples. Earlier this week, liberal Hollywood actor, left-wing activist Mark Ruffalo -- he called on his followers to sign a petition that demands NBC News stop hiring conservatives for on-air positions, white conservatives? We've also seen people like Robert de Niro and Mickey Rourke and Marilyn Manson advocating for violence against this president. 
And outside of Hollywood, then, of course, you have groups like Black Lives Matter. What do we want, dead cops. When do we want them, now. Pigs in a blanket, fry `em like bacon. Hillary Clinton supported that group. President Obama met with them in the White House! They've been spewing hate for years. And by the way, where was their criticism of Kathy Griffin and her ISIS pose?

HANNITY: Also, we have all seen the out-of-control anger and rage that is springing up all over college campuses where -- you know, showing you video-- Berkeley, California, earlier this year, protesters starting a riot. Why? Because a conservative was going to speak at the university, the home of the Free Speech Movement. 
Now, while all these examples of hatred are shocking and alarming, they're not new. Now, the roots of the left's rage go back decades, if not further. In fact, it is part of the movement's DNA. You know, groups like the Mayday Labor Movement, the Weather Underground, remember them, led by Barack Obama's pals, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, the Occupy Wall Street movement all started with, subscribed to radical left-wing hate-filled ideology advocating for using violence to their advantage in their political objectives.
So while the Democrats and the left are putting their hate on pause for 24 hours last night, not even 24 hours, you can bet they're only getting started when it comes to the president, conservatives, Republicans in this country.
Here with reaction, the author of the brand-new book, "Understanding Trump" -- it's on Amazon.com, book stores everywhere -- former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Look, there's been a long history -- all right, we can argue, OK, we're not dueling in this country. And we went through the `60s and this period of horrible assassination from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Kent State and all these other cases.
But in my lifetime, there's never been anything like this! They will not accept this president as duly elected. And I don't think it stops at all. Your thoughts.
NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, what you just did was pretty overpowering. That is a lot of material and it's a lot of vivid proof where people are looking at the actual film. It's not -- you know, you're not making anything up. You're sharing with them the film. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So I do think that at a minimum, this resembles the late `60s, early `70s, the anti-Vietnam war period, the counterculture and the Free Speech Movement, all those things that came together out of great turmoil in that period.
I think this is different. I think the frenzy on the left is deeper and more rabid than what it was. I think their strength in Hollywood and the newsroom and on campuses is bigger than it was. So it's a real fight. 
You know, but I was thinking at the very beginning, when you were describing the Washington Post story, it may be that the deputy attorney general now has a new assignment, which is to create a special counsel to look into leaks from the special counsel. You know, it is -- it's illegal-
 -
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: You know how absurd that sounds?
GINGRICH: -- to be leaking. Well, I'm just saying, if you look -- I don't understand what Rosenstein's memo was supposed to tell us. Is he saying that The Washington Post lied, that that's not true? And if so, how does he know it? Does he say, Well, they might be true, but don't pay attention to them?
I didn't find his memo particularly enlightening. The Washington Post once again has an unnamed source who makes a series of allegations which may be true. It doesn't help any to have page one make an allegation, and then the bureaucrats at Justice piously explain that they can't tell you whether or not what was probably a leak from one of them is true.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think if he's serious about stopping leaks, maybe not this first round, but by the time we have three or four leaks which we will get from the special counsel's office--
HANNITY: We got two in two days.
GINGRICH: -- I think he's going to be forced to create a new special -- well, he's going to be forced to create a new special counsel to look into the special counsel's office.
HANNITY: But think of what the president tweeted out today. I'm being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director--
GINGRICH: Right.
HANNITY: -- in great specificity and detail in a strongly worded, what, two, two-and-a-half-page statement. That's insanity to me.
GINGRICH: Look, I don't blame Trump for being -- well, it is insanity, and I don't blame Trump for being frustrated, although I think he'd be better off to shift gears and go to a much more positive series of tweets because they -- they're doing so many good things nobody's learning about because the left is effectively getting him sucked into this fight, where all they talk about all day every day is junk. And despite all that, by the way, Trump is still -- today was at 41 percent approval, despite an unending barrage of six months--

        }
      
HANNITY: By the way, one poll is 50. But go ahead.
GINGRICH: -- lies and smears and innuendo. That's right. But my point is--
HANNITY: Yes. What do you make of--
GINGRICH: -- the president--
HANNITY: What do you make of this assassination attempt, targeting Republicans this week?
GINGRICH: Well, I think -- I think you said it right. First of all, when you have an individual act like that, it's the responsibility of the individual. He was guilty, and I think that should focus on him. 
The background noise effect is scary. The number of people willing to -- you know, it goes all the way back to your showing Madonna. I had forgotten. I thought she said she dreamed of bombing the White House. She actually talks about, I think, how she thought about blowing up the White House, which normally, by the way, would be considered a crime. We were very strict about protecting the presidency, no matter who you are. 
 Imagine in 2010 with the Tea Party movement, if a Tea Party movement person had talked about blowing up the White House with Barack Obama in it. I mean, the national media would've gone crazy!

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity" as we continue with the former speaker of the House. Newt Gingrich is with us.
Mr. Speaker, all right, so now you're the president. I want to go through this list. Loretta Lynch meets on the tarmac with Bill Clinton. Loretta Lynch then tells James Comey, Let's not call it investigation, it's only a little matter. Then Sara Carter and John Solomon come out with a blockbuster report that Comey confronts Lynch that she was never planning under any circumstances to indict Hillary, no matter the evidence said.
Where's the investigation into her?
GINGRICH: Well, what's amazing to me about the Republican passivity here is that Senator Feinstein, the ranking Democrat in the Intelligence (sic) Committee, said last week after Comey's testimony, You know, we really have to look into exactly what was going on with Loretta Lynch and with the -- and with President Obama.
Now, I was waiting for one of the two Intelligence chairmen in the House and Senate to get up and say they're opening a new investigation into exactly what Loretta Lynch said to Comey (INAUDIBLE) put in writing, whether or not she, in fact, had briefed President Obama.
I mean, I don't understand the Republicans allowing the left to define what these investigations are about, particularly when you have Senator Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, very respected senior Democrat from California, who is saying, Look, this is so weird, we have to look into it. 
 Fine. Let's look into it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: All right, let -- let me ask this. So you've got Rosenstein, who we talked about earlier, recommends the firing of Comey. Now we're going to investigate the obstruction because the president fired Comey on their recommendation. Then you got Mueller. Let's see. He's hiring Hillary Clinton's attorney on the -- on the Clinton Foundation to deny Freedom of Information Act requests. Then you got all these other people. He's got 13 high-powered attorneys. One guy, I think, argued before the Supreme Court 100 times, and so many of them donated to Clinton and Obama. 
Now, why do I think the deck is stacked? Should Mueller, should Rosenstein recuse themselves? To me, absolutely yes! And especially all of their connections to Comey, who leaked to get the special counsel!
GINGRICH: Well, first of all, under the Justice Department's own rules, Mueller has a legal obligation to recuse himself from anything involving Comey, which also makes you wonder why would they have picked a guy who's Comey's close friend to investigate a situation which inevitably involves Comey?
I mean, this whole thing stinks. But in addition, I think you've got to look at this and recognize -- and I said this to several audiences today. I said, look, they're going to get somebody. I don't think they'll get the president, but they're going to get somebody. And they're going to get him for something.
HANNITY: Always do.
GINGRICH: And they're probably going to go to jail because there are too many lawyers who are high-powered to go home without a scalp. This is like watching -- in the old-fashioned Western movies, this is an Indian hunting party. They're out looking for a couple scouts.
HANNITY: Yes. There's got to be a Scooter Libby.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GINGRICH: And they're not going to go home until they get some. That's right.
HANNITY: Let me ask you this--
GINGRICH: And I--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Why hasn't the president--
GINGRICH: -- by the way, be very careful -- go ahead.
HANNITY: Yes. Why hasn't the president gotten rid of -- and I talked to people at the White House just this weekend, a number of people confirmed -- there are a ton of Obama holdovers. These people -- we haven't gotten to the leakers. We haven't gotten to those people that do this day in and day out. Why not?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GINGRICH: Well, let me say even though I wrote a book called "Understanding Trump," I don't understand.
(LAUGHTER)
GINGRICH: This is so obvious--
HANNITY: I don't mean to laugh. That's sad!
GINGRICH: I'm serious. No, think about it. I mean, this is so obvious. You assign one person, you give him the list, and they don't get to go home until they finish firing all of them.
It's not that heavy -- I mean, it's -- you have to work through all of it, et cetera. But this has been a puzzle all through the government. The number of bad decisions being made in the departments because you still have Obama holdovers making them is really very discouraging. 
HANNITY: Yes.

GINGRICH: I mean, the president's done a lot of great things at a very big level, but all this underlying--
HANNITY: This has to be a priority.
GINGRICH: -- stuff, they are not very good at cleaning it up.
HANNITY: All right.
GINGRICH: That's right.
HANNITY: Mr. Speaker--
GINGRICH: Absolutely.
HANNITY: -- you have your new book out. It's on Amazon.com. Go to I think it's Newtgingrich.org for your travel schedule. You're giving speeches and signing books.
GINGRICH: Gingrich Productions.
HANNITY: -- and it's on Amazon -- Gingrich Productions. All right, thank you, sir.

PATTI ANN BROWNE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Patti Ann Browne. 
Seven American crewmembers are reported missing after a collision between a U.S. Navy destroyer and a cargo ship off the coast of Japan. The USS Fitzgerald was struck in the side by the container ship about 56 nautical miles south of Yokosuka, Japan. The Fitzgerald's commanding officer and another crewmember were airlifted to the U.S. naval hospital. There's flooding in several parts of the destroyer. The ship suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline. 
And the man who reunited east and west Germany after the cold war has died. Helmut Kohl served as Germany's chancellor from 1982 to 98. He is being remembered tonight as a true statesman. Former president Bill Clinton says Kohl's visionary leadership prepared Germany and Europe for the 21st first century. Kohl was 87-years-old.

RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Just last week Reuters reported on 18 new previous undisclosed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia government officials. U.S. investigators, including the FBI, are looking into a Russian citizen in conjunction with one of the incidents on the Trump campaign last year.
Maybe he is not as charitable as he says, or maybe he's not really under audit, like all those little things might be true. OK, that would be interesting to know. I don't know that that would change the world that much. But what would change the world is if Russia was interfering in the election and they weren't doing it on their own, and he was in on it.
The FBI director being fired by the president to try and change or stop an FBI investigation into the president's campaign and his top staffers; that is a big freakin' deal. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Big freakin' deal -- not true. And in a new interview with "Rolling Stone" magazine Maddow seems to be backtracking. When asked if she thinks it's quote, "possible the Trump campaign had no knowledge of Russian hacking," she replied, quote, "Oh, I absolutely believe it's possible. I mean, Russia clearly did this attack and there's lots of circumstantial evidence that points at lots of unexplained and surreptitious contact between Trump people and Russian people at the time that was happening, but circumstantial evidence is circumstantial evidence. This is a serious thing that needs to be chased down to the end."
Here with the reaction the host of "Michelle Malkin Investigates," Michelle Malkin. Even Chris Matthews after Comey testified said it's dead. This has gone on for nearly 11 months. What's your reaction to what's she says now after all that bad reporting? 
MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, "MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES": Yes, well, I think that Rachel Maddow must be Reynolds Wrap's number one consumer because the tinfoil had consumption there is through the roof. But it's not going to convince conspiracy theorists like her to stop. Her number one goal is to bash and obstruct the Trump administration. It has been from day one. And they're going to beat that dead horse until they can't do it anymore. 
So, look, I think it's especially ironic, too, Sean, that this interview that she gave that you quoted from his in "Rolling Stone" magazine, which apparently is billing her on its front cover as the most trusted name in news. Could there be a bigger joke? 
(LAUGHTER)
MALKIN: From the fake, right, the fake news purveyors of "Rolling Stone." 
HANNITY: She actually thinks she's a reporter, too.
MALKIN: Yes. Right, exactly. And we've talked about this so many times, Sean. You and I are always transparent about what our biases are, what our ideology is, what our perspective is. We put it all on the table, and what we ask people to do is do their own homework and verify their own facts. But anybody can commit journalism. The fact is that there are double standards of the likes of "Rolling Stone" which of course was founded by Jann Wenner, one of the Democrat Party's biggest donors. It is a propaganda machine for the Democratic Party just as Rachel Maddow is. 
HANNITY: And the think is they've done this for months and months. And what I'm having a hard time coming to grips with here, we have pointed out every Democrat, Mark Warner and Joe Manchin and Dianne Feinstein and then Clapper and Comey and Brennan and Rogers and everybody, no evidence of collusion. But yet they still keep going with the innuendo. And it's gone on for months, and months, and months. How do they get away with basically lying? That's what it is to their audience, and creating this breathless hysteria that, oh, maybe impeachment is around the corner. We've got him tonight. And then we've got him the next night, and then we got him next night. Never a retraction, never honesty. 
MALKIN: Yes. And you would think that what she told "rolling Stone" is something that she should us as a preface in front of every show. But, no, it is an illusion factory, it is an echo chamber. And Donald Trump doesn't have to just deal with the preexisting beltway swamp that exists. He has to deal with these festering fever swamps that feed this conspiracy machine. And people are sick and tired of it, Sean. There's so much real news that's going on. And the insult and slap in the face of "Rolling Stone," which, by the way, just this week had to settle a $1.6 million lawsuit by those poor guys at the fraternity at the University of Virginia over what? Fake news allegations. This is their coin. 
HANNITY: Of course they pay all the money and now they pick their favorite leftists, leftwing tinfoil hat conspiracies, black helicopter conspiracy pushing hosts to say the most trusted name in news. But we are fair and balanced here.
MALKIN: Yes, that's right. And what is she really? That's right. That's right.
HANNITY: The people are getting -- we're reporting things nobody else does. We're looking at Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton, the deep state, things that other people are not. And I know we will over time as usual be proven to be right. 
Michelle Malkin, thank you so much for being with us. 
All right, coming up, talking about the deep state. Guess what, it's out to get the Trump administration. How bad is it? How dangerous is it? Mike Meyers on the left, Matt Schlapp on the right will react. And also, more breaking news tonight. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look at Twitter. If I were shot and killed tomorrow half of Twitter would explode in applause and excitement. This is the world we live in now. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Kellyanne Conway earlier today talking about just how vicious and vile the left in this country has become. Patrick J. Buchanan joins us with a history lesson on the left and their anger, and a column out detailing this leftist hatred. That and more as "Hannity" continues this busy Friday night. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So President Trump has called the special counsel investigation of the Russian collusion story the single greatest witch hunt in American political history. Robert Mueller remains special counsel despite he and his team having massive conflicts of interest like Mueller's close relationship with former FBI director James Comey and the fact that three members of his team donated to Democrats. Oh, and by the way, they even hired, yes, one of Hillary Clinton's lawyers. We've been saying on this program it's time for him to recuse himself. 
Joining us now with reaction, from the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp, and from the New York Civil Rights Coalition Mike Meyers. You know, Mike, we've been friends a long time. You call yourself a liberal. You're not a liberal. 
MICHAEL MEYERS, NEW YORK CIVIL RIGHTS COALITION: I am a liberal.
HANNITY: You're not a liberal. You're not.
MEYERS: I'm a classical liberal who believes in justice through process, fairness, and the elected president of the United States. The people decided the election. The resistance movement has organized now to make sure he goes out any means necessary. This is the resistance movement. And what shocks me is the government, because we have so far failed to drain the swamp and the swamp is fighting back, the government itself is now leaking. The government itself has now become the surveillance state. 

 Liberals like me used to be opposed to the surveillance state. We used to believe in privacy and individual rights. 
HANNITY: So you're like with Alan Dershowitz.
MEYERS: We were at the ACLU. I'll tell you what the ACLU is. They are on the side of the Trump resistance movement. They are not any longer nonpartisan. 
HANNITY: And not caring about civil liberties, the constitution, not caring about the Fourth Amendment protections that we have against unreasonable search and seizure. 
MEYERS: If they did they would have said something by now. They are raising millions of dollars opposed to Trump, the Trump resistant movement. That's their literature, not my rhetoric. 
HANNITY: You know, there's just a few, Matt, like Mike Meyers, and Alan Dershowitz. He and I didn't get along a lot over the years, but he's been so dead on factually, legally accurate in all of this. Where are the rest of -- where are liberals like Mike and Dershowitz? 
MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Well, remember, Sean, when you take on the swamp, when you take on the elitists, when you take on all the people who have been running things for decades, they fight back. And Donald Trump is a victim of that. Even Republican lawyers are afraid to step in where they see these great abuses because they know Jim Comey is going to play a big role in the D.C. bar. So what you have is a lot of conflicted people, and the fact is, as you know, is that we have seen zero evidence of any collusion, and people like Alan Dershowitz have made it very clear, and Republican lawyers I have talked to who have served President Bush have said there is no obstruction of justice here. 
MEYERS: But that side is not conflicted. Look, we are at war. In the civil rights movement we used to have a saying, it is time to choose which side are you on. So we are at war. We have to fight for our national identity, we have to fight for our culture, and the 2016 presidential election was our last chance to save a nation, our last chance to save the culture, and therefore we can't be conflicted. We've got to fight back.
HANNITY: Last word, Matt.
SCHLAPP: That's right. And the other thing, the Department of Justice needs to put a counsel on Hillary Clinton, because where the Trump investigation is going, there's no evidence of collusion. They're going to go to inappropriate contact, what they're going to call inappropriate between DOJ and FBI and the White House. Guess what. That's exactly what we had with Loretta Lynch, and President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the other people in that cabal, and they need to put a counsel on that immediately. Let's get on offense and let's go find out where the real crimes occurred. 
MEYERS: It's time to fire some people in this swamp. The nerve of them, all of a sudden they want Trump's taxes because he won't release them, and that becomes the agenda of the special counsel? Are they nuts? 
HANNITY: Well said. All right, guys, thank you both. 
As we continue on this breaking Friday news edition on "Hannity."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CONWAY: Look at Twitter. If I were shot and killed tomorrow half of Twitter would explode in applause and excitement. This is the world we live in now. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Kellyanne Conway explaining just how vicious the leftwing hate has become in this country. Patrick J. Buchanan joins us with a history of leftwing hate. That's next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CONWAY: Look at Twitter. If I were shot and killed tomorrow half of Twitter would explode in applause and excitement. This is the world we live in now. And it's terrible because, again, it's one thing to say I disagree with you on health care repeal or on taxes or on your plan for national security. But you can't attack people personally in a way and think that tragedies like this won't happen. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was Kellyanne Conway earlier today describing the vile language coming from left today. My next guest has a column out that details the long history of vicious rhetoric and violent behavior coming from the left in America. Joining us now to explain all of this, author of "Nixon's White House Wars," Patrick J. Buchanan is with us. Good to see you. I love your knowledge of history. You were in the Nixon White House, Reagan White House. You've been around the block. You've been in crossfire. You've been at the forefront of passionate debate, Pat Buchanan. You are a pioneer. But have you ever seen it this bad as you look through that history? 
PATRICK J. BUCHANAN, AUTHOR, "NIXON'S WHITE HOUSE WARS": No, I have not. It's been vile, the attacks on the president of the United States have been unraveled, Sean. They were bad times back in the 1960s, I'll tell you, Richard Nixon coming down for his inaugural and you got people yelling "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, the NLF is going to win," cheering on communist killers of American troops in Vietnam. This is almost like that, but it's Americans against Americans. I think the levels, frankly, of hatred and detestation of Americans for other Americans, it's unexampled in my lifetime. 
HANNITY: I always go back to the predictable talking points every election cycle, racist, sexist, homophobic, misogynistic, Islamaphobic, xenophobic. By the way, Pat, you might have been called one or two of those names over the course of your long career as I have been. But to me, I think more than anything what it tell, now it's at a new low. Now it's worse than ever. 
BUCHANAN: Let me agree with you. Look, when Hillary Clinton just said half of Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables, used exactly your terms, racist, sexist, homophones, xenophobes, Islamaphones, bigots. How do you communicate and how do we argue about infrastructure with people who believe that about you? How do you get along? If America were a couple, so many things we disagree on and dislike one another so deeply, we would have been divorced a long time ago. There's really a secession of the heart taking place in this country all over this country in communities, towns, and cities. 
HANNITY: I guess it's just this whole thing. Then you have the Occupy movement, now you've got a violent aspect of this. Then you've got now the targeted assassination. What was your reaction to the targeted assassination of these Republicans in Alexandria now far from where you are, Pat? 
BUCHANAN: Well, it's literally sickening. And it took me back to the time when in 1954 when I was a kid and my parents came to visit me in a hospital where I and a broken leg, and said, you know, a Puerto Rican terrorist tried to shoot Harry Truman in Blair House. Then I was a sophomore in high school, and they say five Puerto Rican terrorists just shot up the House of Representatives. But it is appalling. And then frankly, Sean, when I was with Nixon, you've got Martin Luther King shot, John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm X. You had riots in American cities. But the vile and the hatred toward one another in unexampled. 
HANNITY: Then the Weather underground, Ayers and Dohrn. All right, Pat, good to see you. We better pay attention, because this is not a healthy environment in any way. All right, Patrick J. Buchanan, thank you. 
When we come back, we need your help, a very important Friday night, breaking news night, "Question of the Day" is straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, time for our "Question of the Day," a very simple one. Is the left of America trying to destroy the president's agenda and America in the process? In other words we don't get people out of poverty, off food stamps, back in the labor force? Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. 
That's all the time we have left on this evening. Hope you'll join us. Hope you have a great weekend. Remember, always fair and balanced, and we'll see you back here Monday.
