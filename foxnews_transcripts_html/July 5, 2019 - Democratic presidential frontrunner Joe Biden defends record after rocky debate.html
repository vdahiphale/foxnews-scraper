DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Today, we come together as one nation with this very special salute to America. We celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our flag, the brave men and women of the United States military. As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage. Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.

It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future. To this day, that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot. It lives on in each and every one of you here today. It is the spirit daring and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence, loyalty and love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. And our nation is stronger today than it ever was before.
For Americans, nothing is impossible.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a waste of money, you know. He's having a parade for himself, putting tanks out there for himself, and if he really cares about the men and women who are serving our nation, he'd be investing in higher pay, better housing, better healthcare.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we need money to go into affordable housing. I think we need money to go into rebuilding our infrastructure. I'm not quite sure that we need money to go in to put tanks in downtown Washington, D.C.

KOOIMAN: Of course, I did. I actually was watching from an airplane. I was heading back from Charleston, South Carolina, after doing our proud American coverage there and feeling extra patriotic on the heels of that. Anyway, I thought I was having a spiritual experience. And I think if you're an American watching this and it didn't matter how you felt about the president before this speech, it was beautiful. It was incredible. The critics that saw there, the Democrats saying, oh, he's just doing this for himself. He's throwing himself a parade. He didn't say anything about himself. He spoke about decorated military veterans. He talked about astronauts. He talked about civil rights leaders. He talked about American exceptionalism. He put politics aside for this. I was impressed.

You remember when he was on the campaign trail in 2016 and he said I'm going to be so presidential when I want to be. I'm going to be boring. Well, he wasn't boring, but he certainly presidential. He left his slings and arrows for a campaign rally on another day and another time and place. And I thought it was very appropriate, had the perfect tone.

WILLIAMS: So, Lawrence, one of the critics -- one of the things the critics was to mock him for saying the continental army was going to an airport, clearing out an airport. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. I know a lot of people didn't give Obama the benefit of the doubt when he said -- I think he said 57 states when he was campaigning. But I'm going to give the president the benefit of the doubt.
LAWRENCE JONES, HOST: Look at you, Juan.

JONES: Well, I think that his critics looked pretty dumb yesterday. All of them that said that this was going to be a Trump campaign rally, have you all been to a Trump campaign rally? That was nothing like a Trump campaign rally. They talk about multiple things. The crowd is much rowdier when it comes to -- Trump talks a lot about himself and not America, and his greatness as well.
And I think the president showed that he was willing to put politics aside and talk about what's best for the country and how to move forward. A lot of people said that it was boring because he gave a history lesson. I think it's important that we remember our history so we don't repeat it as well. There was some critics that talked about the military and the president flexing when it came to showing our great military.
Look, this a president that has been very restrained when it comes to military force. So if he wants to flex to show the world this is how you defend freedom. This is -- this is what we have to offer, I think that is to be applauded instead of sending our military into harm's way.

        }
      
TAMMY BRUCE, HOST: No. OK, all right.
WILLIAMS: But, Tammy, you saw there what Elizabeth Warren said there. He didn't have his donors pay for this event even though they had reserved seating and tickets. He could have -- you know, and I'm sure some of them would have paid for it. Instead, it was the U.S. Park Service that went, you know, millions of dollars, taken out of their budget. Budget money that could have gone to parks or helping young people to go to visit parks. What do you say to that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRUCE: You know, I think that as -- when you win the presidency there are benefits to that, right? You also invite people to the White House who supported you and are your supporters. That's part of the natural process here. The Natural Parks Service, I think, we had an estimated of about $2 to $2.5 million, nobody was clutching their pearls in 2016 when the National Parks Service spent $30 million for their own 100 year anniversary.
And, you know, that -- but I think all of that is a distraction. I think what you've got here are -- and when they worry -- worrying about the president talking about himself, there's only one group of people talking constantly about Donald Trump, and it's the Democrats. He is still in the building mode. He has condominiums in their head and it's the most affordable living situation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bernie Sanders wants affordable living, he's living in their heads for free. There is no rent. So this is -- I think there's a lot of projection going on. He is the center of their universe. You may disagree with this. But you have to admit, they think they're going to win the presidency based on obsessing about Donald Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as they do it -- like maybe you've even been changed a little bit about what happened yesterday. They're afraid that as the American people watch something like that, people are transformed and realize that they've been lied to for the last three years about this man.
WILLIAMS: Oh, you think it really would persuade people who are not pro- Trump.
BRUCE: Oh, I think so, because we've already seen it. I mean, when people -- with the Mueller report as an example, after all the stuff with CNN, and it was not what they said it was going to be, already people have realized they've been lied to about serious issues. They've retreated, you know, when it comes to ratings and who they're listening to, and that's a sign that the American people want the truth, they want information, and they're tired of being lied to.

JOHN RICH, HOST: I know, very cool.
WILLIAMS: John, we love you. And we're so grateful that you came today. So, let me ask you because in a way -- you know what, John? Let's just go beyond politics for a second. What did you think as a cultural critic about the event? Was it something that you enjoyed? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RICH: So, our military, the men and women that serve in our military are not Democrats, not Republicans, not independence, they're everybody that serves in the military. So I think, honestly, the president did a great service to the military in respecting that fact and not going into a partisan angle when he was talking. I watched the entire thing. And I kept waiting for him to, you know, go hard to his base or whatever, and he never did it. I mean, I heard everybody from Jackie Robinson to John Glenn talked about in these speeches.
And even for me these names start coming up. And you remember these powerful, powerful Americans, and entrepreneurs, and great talents that could only have succeeded like that had they lived in our country and had a military as strong as ours to protect their right to become great baseball players, or astronauts, or actors, or all the great people he was naming. So I thought he did a great job by staying right on the message.

And to say me it was almost like a history lesson, a refresher course going through every single branch of the military, pointing out great people that did great things. And then here comes the actual hardware. Flying right over the top of the Washington Monument, and you're like wow. I mean, I think for Americans, for me it was a moment of pride to see all of that come together in one moment.

And also, I think around the world, they're watching that going, yeah, they've got a lot of -- America is no joke. And look at how our principles of this country have developed so many incredible Americans. I mean, we've invented rock and roll. We've invented country music. We've invented R and B. We've invented the automobile. All the things he started reminding us up -- yes, it reminds you how great our country is and it's great because it's free.

His State of the Union addresses have been universally praised. This is not a surprise. And, as you've said, he said I'm going to be presidential. People continue to underestimate him, and this is why they get blindsided - -

The idea that I'd be intimidated by Donald Trump? He's the bully that I knew my whole life. He's the bully that I've always stood up to. He's the bully who used to make fun when I was a kid and stutter and I'd smack them in the mouth.

And if that's true, boy, that's big trouble because he should have known that as the frontrunner, there were long knives ready for him. That's how other people were going to rise and challenge him as the frontrunner. It's exactly what Kamala Harris did. She took command on the stage, and it's the reason why we've seen her jump ahead in the polls.
I think what you're seeing there is he's trying to strike the right tone. He doesn't want to be too aggressive in trying to take her out. And he says he's not going to play that game. Maybe he can have his surrogates, his aides, you know, plant stories and go after her in that fashion. But I think he wants to remain as if he's above the fray. That he's the frontrunner.

I think -- they think that's how they're going to beat him. But I don't really think that's how you beat him. I think you're just playing his ballgame when you step into that. He loves that.
And so, now, Biden is having haymakers thrown at him. You wouldn't have seen that in the past couple of elections. Nobody talked like that. Smacking somebody in the mouth or anything like that. But, you know, it looks like to me Biden -- I said this earlier, he's been left as in he can't go -- I don't think it's in his nature to go that left. But he's kind of out of his comfort zone because he's having to go that left to be able to have the same conversation everybody else is having.

So if he runs on saying I've got this place figured out. I can get things done. I'm the one who's looking forward to the general election to try to beat Donald Trump, rather than dealing with all of this, then maybe he's struck a cord?

In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education, healthcare. Look, my north star is the middle class, when the middle class does well, everybody does well.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JONES: Tammy, if that's the case then why is he flip-flopping on everything?
BRUCE: Well, I think what people are missing is that his reaction in, and of itself, to what Ms. Harris did reminds you that there's never been a real competitive primary for either party. First one was with Trump, and now this one. Is that he didn't expect to be held accountable. He didn't expect someone else in that lineup to say something harsh, or to maybe tell the truth, or what they saw as the truth because, gosh, they know each other.
This reveals to everyone the fact that this had been kind of a sham from the beginning which is what all Americans in both parties have rejected and haven't liked, this idea that this is prearranged, that he's the one who is supposed to get it. And he's got that kind of demeanor. Now, I agree, the Democratic voter is not the Democrat or the liberal on twitter. It is someone who is much more quiet and who's watching. But then, if that is the case, then he should have no problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

But what he knows is that Kamala Harris is going to cast herself as that. So, he knows he's not running against Sandy Ocasio-Cortez. He's running against, you know, Kamala Harris who's going to shift. No one is going to be running in the end in the general as on the left, but they've got to pander in a certain way.
So, I think, Joe Biden and then, just ultimately what people don't like is -- and I don't think he understands the irony of complaining about Trump being the divider and then trying to, you know, disembowel him with his -- you know, he's a racist. I punched these guys in the mouth. Nobody wants that, and especially when it's not natural. When it's -- when you're trying to a play a role in certain way.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think it's unnatural given some of the statements Trump has made on race. But I think the bigger point right now is we've got another debate in three weeks. And so, you're going to have a higher bar and it's going to be tough again for Joe Biden because he looked bad coming out of that debate, and other people made up ground.
So, people are going to be looking to punch again at Joe Biden. He better figure out how to deal with this. My sense is though that Joe Biden claim at this moment, Tammy, is that he's the most electable Democrat running against Donald Trump.
JONES: Even though he's on the ropes.
WILLIAMS: Even at this moment. Remember, he's still is in the lead. I mean, there some polls that have -- I think it's Elizabeth Warren -- Bernie Sanders, I'm sorry, Bernie Sanders within five points --
BRUCE: But still, that's misleading because, of course, this is going state by state. You're looking at -- most of this is like national approval. It's going to show very differently as they go into each state for the primaries. And then, it is -- the debates is still going to matter because of his attitude.

WILLIAMS: To me, you know, I think there's lot of pressure from the left. As all of you guys have been saying on the panel today. But, to my mind, the only way we've made progress on civil rights in this country is by dealing with people who have racist views, trying to work something out, and make steady progress that has taken us to what I think is the best point in the American history for people of color. So --
JONES: I think it's pretty shady that she made it a central issue and then reversed on it for the American people. It seems like --

JONES: We've got to go. Coming up, Colin Kaepernick breaking his silence for the first time since pressuring Nike to pull the patriotic sneakers from the shelves. More on “The Five,” next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BRUCE: All righty. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignited controversy surprise after pressuring Nike to stop selling sneakers featuring a version of the Betsy Ross American flag complaining that it was offensive. Now the anthem protestor breaking his silence on twitter quoting former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, quote, what have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? This 4th of July is yours, not mine. There's not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour, Frederick Douglass, unquote.
Now, look, it was very interesting, John, Ted Cruz pushed back on this because that was a very small section, a small segment of what Mr. Douglass had said and it was a very powerful statement which came back at the end to the promise and the hope of the United States. It was pre-civil war, still in the mire of the horror of slavery. And he said, you know, -- this is going to have to be fixed, but he had hope for the future of America. What do you think of this kind of positioning at this point in time with everything that we're going through?
RICH: I mean, I think it's sad that the only way a guy can stay relevant is to trash the American flag. I just -- I see that go -- you've got to be kidding me. And then, for a company that their corporate policy is to trash the American flag as many times they can. I honestly think Nike did it on purpose because they knew we all be talking about it for weeks on end. And I guess they have a big base that they agree with the message. You know, I wear redneck Rivera boots. I don't wear Nikes no matter. But, I don't like it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRUCE: Now, Lawrence, at the same time, there's a good shot there of those boots. At the same time, there's a presumption at that base is open to this message, but I'm finding, often, that, in fact, Americans, regardless of who you are, love the country and are patriotic, and maybe aren't even receptive to this message. What do you think?
JONES: Well, I think Nike has had great benefit. This is not them caring about civil rights, this is not caring -- they've had -- this is a business move for them. And I think -- because they've had such great successes, which is why they decided to double down on this.
But to go back to the Douglass quote, I think there're both sides that are getting this whole thing wrong. First of all, he was talking to Republicans and telling them that we're not living up to the ideas of this country. He was a Republican. And then he talked about his love of this country. And despite America not living up to his ideas, it was the Constitution that he used as his greatest defense, and I think that's where we need to get back to.
A lot of things I disagree in this country and I fight every single day to make sure we get those liberties back. But some people decide to trash the flag in the process of that. Douglass didn't do that.
BRUCE: Well there's a - Juan, there's a lot of imagery involved here. One of those good signs is, is a lot of people now know what the Betsy Ross flag is, maybe they didn't know what it was at first.
Do you think they're serious or is just this is just another way to make political statements and to get publicity or do you think that this is a sincere effort of?
WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, it's not the American flag, it's the Betsy Ross flag, which unfortunately has been appropriated by some white nationalist groups and that's what Kaepernick was talking about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think for Nike, in terms of their profits and - boy they have - since they embraced Colin Kaepernick their stock price has gone up. They've been making money and so a lot of people see this as an expression of American values. That if you kneel in protest and you have a legitimate protest, there's nothing wrong with it. So that's the other side of it.
I hear what you guys are saying, but I think that there are lots of people who say Nike apparently has tapped into this, especially among the younger generation. That you know what Colin Kaepernick should not be punished, thrown out because he has a different opinion. We all as Americans have a right to express--
JONES: That's not the only reason why he was thrown out.
BRUCE: So Anna. At the same time this is about narrowcasting and marketing. It's almost as though they could have had the same impact with a different opposite kind of message. Do you think this is natural? Is this kind of a natural good business mode to move into social justice warring?
KOOIMAN: Well, you're starting to see the Right do the exact same thing on the other side and cash in on the controversy as well. We've got - I just saw - I think it was on Fox & Friends or somewhere on social media, a t- shirt that had the Betsy Ross flag on it.
And you can only imagine that there are probably shoe companies that have gotten their - they're tread on the waffle iron right now trying to do their own--
BRUCE: That's right - entrepreneurship.

        }
      
KOOIMAN: --to cash in on it. I mean - but it is unfortunate that on the 4th of July this is what we're talking about rather than what kind of hotdog you are eating--
BRUCE: All right, all right. There we go. We got to move on here for this. The San Francisco School Board has decided to paint over a mural of George Washington featured at a public school and they're willing to pay $600,000 to get it done. The 83-year-old mural criticized as racist and degrading for its depiction of black and Native American people.
And now Lawrence, even if you think it should be painted over, there's this huge debate. Some people are wondering even about the cost of $600,000. Painted during the Depression, was meant to introduce difficult subjects, broaden - it was considered radical at the time, broadening out the image of Washington, involving the death of Native Americans, slavery and yet now it's too sensitive. And it's a school that's mostly of kids of color.
JONES: Well, I think the art tells a lot of the story. It tells the full story. And I'm afraid that we've become so sensitive when it comes to symbolism. Everybody is getting worked up over symbolism and I think it's going to destroy this country. Where is the line drawn? I think that's a lot of Americans would say.
BRUCE: All right, John.
RICH: I was just out in California, in San Francisco area and I was telling Juan I've been there many times playing concerts over the years. It does not look the same.
And so when I see people wanting to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover up a mural, instead of putting that money out on the street, getting people up off the street, I mean it is - it's quite a scene guys. I mean, that's really--

KOOIMAN: Yes, this is happening in San Francisco where homelessness is a problem.
RICH: --really shocking. And I wonder if the same people that are spending this money to cover up George Washington, are the same ones upset that Trump just spent $2 million dollars on a parade. Isn't it the same people?
BRUCE: So Anna, would it - isn't there point, though, about educating people about a genuine history, including its difficulties--
KOOIMAN: Yes. And, look, artist left up for interpretation too, isn't it? And I think the initial intention of the artists and those that allowed it to be on the school in the first place had in mind the idea that they would paint the whole picture of George Washington and who he was.
And the you know the scars that we do have on our country was slavery and the way that we treated Native Americans, and we can't forget our past or we're doomed to repeat it.
BRUCE: Yes, Juan, you get last word on this.
WILLIAMS: Well, I just - you know to me I worry about the kids. And I wonder that part of the justification is that you had a lot of minority kids seeing slavery, maybe thinking that's who their ancestors are, their place in history. It's not great. But I just can't buy into a racing history. See to me-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRUCE: We can add something--
WILLIAMS: --a lot of people on the Right want to say "Hey, the founding fathers are without flaw". Let me tell you, they were humans. They had flaws.
BRUCE: We've never known--
JONES: That's good.
WILLIAMS: But on the Left you can't erase the history. In other words, if you were in Germany and you say we're going to put up the Hitler something - OK that clearly unacceptable. But I think in our country this was within the parameters of the telling of a legitimate American historical tale.
BRUCE: I think most would agree. All right. Hollywood celebrities still reeling from the Mueller report now auditioning for a mock anti-Trump movie based on special counsel. Don't go anywhere.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
RICH: Our friends in liberal Hollywood looted still have no evidence of President Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. And after their embarrassing reading of the Mueller report, several celebrities are now pretending to audition for a fictitious movie based on the former special counsel's work.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MINNIE DRIVER, AMERICAN ACTRESS: Hi, My name is Minnie Driver.
DEBRA MESSING, AMERICAN ACTRESS: Debra Messing.
MARY LYNN RAJSKUB, AMERICAN ACTRESS: Mary Lynn Rajskub.
YVETTE NICOLE BROWN, AMERICAN ACTRESS: --and I'm reading for Mueller Report.
RAJSKUB: Mueller Report.
JON CRYER, AMERICAN ACTOR: Mueller Report.
KIRK ACEVEDO, AMERICAN ACTOR: Mueller Report - The Movie.
JOSHUA MALINA, AMERICAN ACTOR: According to Comey's account--
ACEVEDO: At one point during the dinner--
ALYSIA REINER, AMERICAN ACTRESS: The President stated--
MESSING: --I need loyalty.
ROB CORDDRY, AMERICAN ACTOR: I expect loyalty. What?
ANIKA NONI ROSE, AMERICAN ACTRESS: OK--
RAJSKUB: Do you imagine this was from the real report?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is.
RAJSKUB: Really?
BROWN: I mean, they got to impeach this guy, right?
MALINA: Is this supposed to be funny or terrifying, because it's both.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RICH: Oh, man. I'm going to audition for a movie called "BleachBit", that's going to be the movie I'm auditioning for. I mean - so I come from that world of music, right. And when I go out on tour and we do meet and greets before the shows and your meeting just regular everyday folks that are coming through the line, I can tell you they do not give two hoots about people acting in a movie for the Mueller Report.
The Mueller Report itself, now that we've already read what's in it. They don't care, but they're still hung up on it out there. And I wonder from you, is that just hilarious? I'm just laughing at it.
KOOIMAN: Well, I think it's smart in some ways on their part and stupid and some other ways on their part. It's smart because we're talking about it right now, right? The report is out. They ought to be focusing on something else. No collusion was - what was thrown up there. So come on get something else to focus your energy on.
But we're talk about it, social media is talking about it, you're talking about it around the water cooler and these clips are candy for liberals, right?
But I think it's stupid in another way, because you think about Hillary Clinton 2016. She had the endorsement of pretty much every single celebrity. It didn't matter who they were. They were in her camp. Did it help her? Didn't matter that Katy Perry was helping her with singing roar (ph), didn't help, she lost.
RICH: It almost makes it a harder for them. It's like a boomerang effect, have you not seen that happen?
JONES: Well, the problem is that, they're reading it like a script and it doesn't tell the full story. I mean there are a lot of interferences that that happened with the Hillary campaign colluding as well to get the information. I mean, the Mueller Report doesn't talk about any of that.
And so you're going to make a movie and get it historically correct, maybe you should bring all player--
RICH: I don't think historically correct is what they are worrying about with this particular--
JONES: Exactly.
RICH: This particular film. I mean, when is enough, enough ever?
BRUCE: Here's what the reality is here. They're doing a fake audition for a movie that is not meant to be made about a Mueller Report that is a fantasy in their head about collusion that was a hoax.
Their entire world is freaking fake. The entire war, it's made up. And so that I thought it was perfect - and even I would say, look I'm still a registered Democrat. There are many classical liberals out there that are looking at this and it's painful to have been lied to about the Mueller Report. This just reminds them about how they were taken for fools.
WILLIAMS: Well, if that's the case Tammy, then what's all the upset about on the Right? Because if they're just reading--
BRUCE: No one is upset--
RICH: I'm not upset about it.
WILLIAMS: --they are making anything of--
BRUCE: Nobody is upset.
WILLIAMS: They are reading it as it was written. And remember President Trump falsely says no conspiracy, no collusion. This was looking at evidence of conspiracy and the judgment was there was not sufficient evidence to make the case.
But so what? If you read the report you know that Russia interfered in our election in 2016--
BRUCE: And Barack Obama did nothing about it.
WILLIAMS: --to a fair bit. And you know that they wanted Donald Trump to win. So these guys were just reading it and if they want to read it, fine?
RICH: We have a phrase in the country in Texas called "Running around like a chicken with your head cut off", you ever heard that before?
BRUCE: Of course.
RICH: That's what apply.
JONES: I think it's especially troubling to say, so what, after there wasn't any enough any enough evidence presented to prosecute. That is a foundation of this.
WILLIAMS: Fine.
JONES: It is the burden of the prosecution--
WILLIAMS: Fine, Lawrence, let them read--
JONES: --to present their case.
WILLIAMS: Fine. But let - all they are doing is reading the report that President Trump says exonerates them. You would think that you guys would be celebrating, great. These liberals are reading they would Mueller Report. So the contrary, you are so threatened because you think people might actually listen.
RICH: Let's talk ice cream.
BRUCE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Absolutely.
RICH: This next story went viral for all the absolutely wrong reasons. The teen who was caught on camera licking a tub of ice cream and putting it back in the freezer has now been identified, and she is in big trouble guys, coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KOOIMAN: Hey everybody. This next video is grossing pretty much everybody out on the Internet.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lick it, lick it. Oh, you are foul. Put it back, put it back, put it back. Put it back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOOIMAN: Have you seen this yet? Authorities in Lufkin, Texas confirming that they have identified and spoken with a female juvenile suspect and her boyfriend after they allegedly posted video to Twitter of her licking a half gallon of Blue Bell Tin Roof ice cream in a Wal-Mart and then putting it right back into the freezer. Yuck!
Well, the nauseating stunt was being viewed by about 11 million people online. I'm sure more now. Previously police had said that she could have been charged with second-degree felony, tampering with a consumer product, which carries 2 to 20 years behind bars, and a possible fine of up to $10,000.
John Rich, what do you think? Now that we know it's a juvenile. I must be thinking, Oh, give girl - poor girl a break.
RICH: Well, I mean, if you're going to come down on her, there's somebody else you got to come down on too, and that's Ariana Grande. I don't know if you remember a couple years ago--
KOOIMAN: I forgot about that, yes.
RICH: A couple years ago her and her boyfriend are in a donut store and she licks the donut, then the boyfriend licks the donut and then she says she - I think she says "I hate America. I hate Americans" in this video. And I don't think anything ever happened to her and nothing about tampering was ever talked about with her.
So you know goose and gander. I mean, that listen what is wrong with people?
KOOIMAN: And Tammy, look, this is absolutely disgusting and I will not look at any ice cream the same probably after seeing that. But she wasn't putting razor blades or glass or something in there.
BRUCE: Well, you know, we live in an age where a lot of things can be transmitted. You've got a staph infection. You can have a yeast infection. You can have the flu. And if you're buying - any if you were a little kid, you've got a compromised immune system and you catch a virus, people die from those things.
I would suggest, though, that there should be serious action taken, because there then could be copycats. Maybe there's a copycat dynamic regarding Ariana Grande. But she is a minor, so it means that the juvenile court will deal with this.
But I'll remind everyone of the 1982 Tylenol poisoning situation, which changed the way that we packaged products, particularly medicines - triple packaging. A lot of people - when you get ice cream now you normally have to peel back like a plastic of strip, right? Blue Bell doesn't do that. They seal their lid to the ice cream. I bet you that's going to be changing soon.
JONES: Well, I grew up on Blue Bell Ice Cream in Texas.
BRUCE: You love it. You don't look like it.
JONES: That's literally the only ice cream I eat, is Blue Bell, because it's so flavorful. But again this is a child. And I believe consequences should happen. But the parents should be involved.
BRUCE: Her boyfriend is an adult by the way.
JONES: Well, the boyfriend should go to jail and face some consequences for participating in this. I think they should scare them straight. Look, no one was hurt in the process. But there has to be a signal to the country that this is not acceptable.
Kids do dumb things sometimes. And I don't think we need more of them in the criminal justice system over those dumb things, but a message has to be sent.
KOOIMAN: Yes, we also don't want other kids, like you said, copycatting and I was just reading a report that that supposedly some people are copycatting and there's another Wal-Mart in Texas that has an armed guard by their freezer section, because they're worried about it. Juan, what do you say lock her up and throw away the key or A-OK?
BRUCE: Well, basically, the person you're talking to now is Homer Simpson, and I love donuts and I love ice cream. John Rich, why do you have to remind me that she was licking donuts, I let my dinner out man.
RICH: What about this for a punishment? We just make her eat the entire thing of Blue Bell as fast she can with the worst ice cream made of all time - 30 minutes.
WILLIAMS: And I got to say, I mean, I love ice cream and I just think it's so - that's gross, that is offensive what she just did.
BRUCE: And it is dangerous.
WILLIAMS: But I do think that this is about people. I think it was the boyfriend who made that video.
BRUCE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And the boyfriend makes the video because he thinks it's cute and it's going to go viral or in the - not in the medical sense, Tammy. But - and so I think what it is, is so we're so hip, we're so cute. We were able to make fools out of ordinary people. That is just awful.
KOOIMAN: Well, we got to leave it there. But we'd love to hear from you online about this one. "One More Thing" is next. Don't go anywhere you're watching THE FIVE.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: It's time now for big fun, "One More Thing". I'm going to go first today. Here's a 4th of July tribute to the generous spirit that lives in America. A Michigan church just paid off medical bills valued like $1.8 million for 2,000 families. Here's Pastor Sam Rijfkogel of Grand Rapids First Church.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SAM RIJFKOGEL, GRAND RAPIDS FIRST CHURCH PASTOR: At first they didn't quite register. It was - because nobody does this kind of thing. It just didn't register with him. And finally they started realizing what we did. And they started clapping and then people started standing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: I'm telling you the church isn't alone, though. Last year, a Texas Church paid off $10.5 million in medical bills for 4,000 families. And keep this in mind, high school students in Florida recently raised $30,000 to eliminate 3 million in medical debts.
The power of all this generosity is even greater when you realize more than half of all the bankruptcy filings in America involve medical bills, so here's to you kind-hearted America, happy 4th of July. Lawrence?
JONES: Well, you never know what you're going to get when you're out on the streets reporting live. Anna, you know a little bit about this. But check out Darla Miles, she's a champ. A reporter from New York's WABC was doing a stand-up at a New York Port Authority bus terminal early this week, and check out what happens.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DARLA MILES, REPORTER, WABC CHANNEL 7: The height of the rush hour commute and there's going to be lots more confusion until this whole thing is wrapped up--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JONES: Blocked him like a champ. Toward the end of this, she gracefully blocked the man from walking in front of her live shot while continuing her reporter, props up to Darla Miles.
BRUCE: Beautiful done.
WILLIAMS: All right. Tammy Bruce?
BRUCE: All right. Now this wonderful 4th of July holiday weekend that - Juan, your story was great about future and what people are really made of, and for the next generation you're going to see what - why there's hope.
You've got now 2-year-old Abigail has nailed the national anthem in wonderful adorable fashion. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ABIGAIL, 2-YEAR-OLD SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM: O say, does that Star - Spangled Banner yet wave.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BRUCE: Thank you. Bravo.
WILLIAMS: That was terrific.
BRUCE: Little Abigail, she will be President one day. I told you right here. Good stuff right there.
WILLIAMS: Well she might be John Rich one day, what about that?
RICH: Hey, hey, that was right. She hit the high note--
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Yes.
RICH: Hey. So a good friend of mine McB, former Navy SEAL from 1993 to 2017, that's a long time to be a SEAL. He also works with Folds of Honor, which is a great organization, we all know about.

Go get this book it's - just look up "Uncommon Grit", you can find it. This is a real American--
JONES: --from the bud (ph) training. Navy SEALs training.
RICH: Yes, he now trains Navy SEALs, so that this guy's great. And while you're reading the book, so I brought everybody as my first time as a real host on the show, everybody gets a bottle of Redneck Riviera American blended whiskey.
10% of every bottle I get back to these guys, The Folds of Honor, find a store near you, redneckriviera.com, store locator put in your zip code, Wal-Mart, every store on U.S. has this now.
