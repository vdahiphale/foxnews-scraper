SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Tonight, another huge win for the Trump administration. That travel ban has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court and Democrats predictably -- they're lashing out. This, of course, coming as many on the left have literally started to completely and utterly unravel and be unhinged, unwilling to believe their own lying eyes. 
Now, the Trump agenda is actually succeeding, Mueller's investigation is crumbling and the Democrats' chances of a so-called blue wave in the midterms -- well, that's getting more and more remote in each passing day.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, in moments, we're going to highlight the unhinged rhetoric coming from one of the de facto leaders of the Democratic Party. That would be Congresswoman Maxine Waters. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus, another "Hannity" history lesson tonight you don't want to miss, revealing the blatant double standard surrounding the Democrats' use of women as political pawns.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also tonight, a new investigation casting serious doubt about the legitimacy of Robert Mueller's witch hunt. The case against George Papadopoulos, guess what? That was likely tainted by political bias. 
And according to a report, Robert Mueller, he's now focusing on his witch hunt on Russia collusion. Wasn't that supposed to be the point the entire time? Now, this is a running way fishing expedition.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Get ready, a lot to cover in tonight's jam-packed, breaking news, opening monologue.

HANNITY: All right. America's left call President Trump -- let's see -- racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, every name in the book. But today, the United States Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily restricting travel from seven countries with high security risks.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And here is how the president reacted earlier today. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today's Supreme Court ruling just coming out, a tremendous success, a tremendous victory for the American people, and for our Constitution. This is a great victory for our Constitution. We have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At a minimum, we have to make sure that we vet people coming into the country. We know who is coming in. We know where they are coming from. We just have to know who is coming here. 
The ruling shows that all of the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians are wrong and they turned out to be very wrong.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Now, as you might imagine, Democrats -- they are not taking this so well. Now, usually, they rely on the court system and activist judges on the West Coast to push their agenda, but after this judicial victory for the Trump administration, they are lashing out angrily and, of course, claiming racism.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As Congressman Keith Ellison, he wrote that this decision, quote, gives legitimacy to discrimination and Islamophobia. 
And a Hawaiian senator actually NBC News, quote: Who is going to be next? Is the president going to issue an executive order against Mexicans?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK, these people as I said are unhinged. 
Now, the Democrats' claim of racism, bigotry -- it should not surprise you, it's like clockwork. The left is right back to their old playbook, their favorite tactic, identity politics.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, last night, we showed you the long and storied history of how Democrats, they use race every two to four years to vilify Republicans, divide America and win votes. Republicans are racist, they are sexist, they are misogynistic, they're xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water, they want to kill children and they want your grandmother thrown over the cliff. Every two to four years. It's really predictable.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we have yet another "Hannity" history lesson tonight to bring you. This time, it involves yet another favorite tactic of the Democratic Party and gender identity politics. 
Now, let's start this lesson way back in 2012, then presidential candidate. Remember Mitt Romney? By the way, he probably will get the nomination out in Utah tonight -- touting his strong record of hiring women. He had a binder that highlighted resumes of women applicants that he wanted to hire. Remember this.

MITT ROMNEY, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said, can you help us find folks? And I brought whole binders full of women. 
I was proud of the fact after I stuffed my Cabinet and my senior staff that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states and concluded that might have more women in senior leadership positions than any of the state in America.

        }
      
HANNITY: Now, remember following those remarks, Mitt Romney brutalized by the mainstream media and many Democrats. Many insinuating that Mitt Romney was actually sexist because of those remarks. In other words, that he had resumes of women that he wanted to hire because he wanted to advance their life, their career, their opportunities, and be fair.

REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, D-FLA., OCT. 21, 2012 : Mitt Romney in a point-blank question the other night in the debate refused to answer whether he believes in equal pay for equal work. He referred to women as being binders and resumes.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, CNN, OCT. 17, 2012: It was very unfortunate for Governor Romney because it sort of raises this question, can he relate to working women? You know, he made it sound like working women are a mail order products that you can order out of colored binders. 
MIKA BRZEZINSKI, "MORNING JOE"/MSNBC, OCT. 18, 2012: Mitt Romney just completely doesn't have any leg to stand on when it comes to women and the economy.

Now, you think that's bad? Oh, they're so much more. Remember in 2012, House Democrats said any criticism of Susan Rice, any, is sexist and racist.

HANNITY: Scumbags, take Trump out. 
I've been telling you, there were four agenda items of the Democratic Party. One, they keep telling Maxine Waters -- actually, shhh, just don't say it. Agenda item number one, they want to impeach the president. Number two, they want open borders. Number three, they want Obamacare and they want the crumbs back. In other words, they want your tax cut back. And they are very vocal about it. 
Here's your question the American people need to decide, is this acceptable behavior and rhetoric from a member of Congress and de facto leader of your Democratic Party? Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, it's OK for you that Trump allies to be confronted, Pam Bondi, Secretary Nielsen, Sarah Sanders wherever they go, tell your friends, build the crowd and get in your face. Oh, that was Obama's words. Get in their face!
Remember, we'll send Mr. Burgess out there to get Sean Hannity, he'll tear a him up. Was that a threat? Should I have sued the president at the time?

As I said before, the rhetoric coming from the left, OK, it needs to cool down, because you know what? Something bad is going to happen. This is not going to end well if this keeps up. 
The hostility towards the president, his success, his allies, his supporters, it's all predictable. They now see the blue tidal wave receding, and that's what scares them. Donald Trump's success is their failure. That means they want the country to fail or they can't get their power back. 
Now, let's turn our attention to other breaking developments tonight surrounding Robert Mueller's runaway witch hunt. For months on this program, we have questioned the legitimacy of the investigation. We've been investigating the investigators, and just why it was all started in the first place. 
We have a new report tonight from "Real Clear Politics", much of what we have been saying now corroborated yet again. 
According to Real Clear, quote: The Federal Bureau of Investigation, they formally opened its Trump administration after Western intelligence assets and Clinton affiliated political operatives repeatedly approached the Trump campaign and tried but failed to damage it through associations with Russia. A growing body of evidence now suggesting, in other words, the FBI's partisan witch hunts started again because Hillary Clinton's campaign -- they push for it. That's exactly what we have been saying for months and there's more. 
Now, we're learning that the guilty plea is extracted from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, were connected to two anti-Trump FBI employees who have been now singled out for investigation by the inspector general because of their rampant abusive bias in politics. 
And one of those lovebirds, FBI lovebird Peter Strzok, oh, he's going to testify before Congress tomorrow. He is hiding behind closed doors.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Why are you letting him get away with that? Let the American people see it. We will have a full report. We'll find out what happens anyway. 
Meanwhile, Sara Carter reporting that for the first time, House Judiciary Committee passed a resolution demanding the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein turn over all requested documents regarding the FBI's handling of this Russia investigation or face impeachment or contempt. Sara will have more just a few minutes on this groundbreaking development. 
Finally tonight, we end with one more almost unbelievable revelation about the Mueller probe. According to a report, Bloomberg, Robert Mueller, he's actually now focusing on Trump Russian collusion allegations. We are now 405 days into the Russia probe. 
And the breaking news today is Mueller is just now starting investigating Russian collusion, which isn't a crime. What has he been doing the past 404 days? Oh, that's right, this is an anti-Trump fishing expedition, looking for something, anything, to take the president down. 
And as you can see, the so-called investigation has been exposed, the witch hunt is going before our eyes -- the economy is thriving and little rocket man is now sitting down at the table talking about the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. 
Here now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. You see this book? It's now coming out in July. That is only, what, two weeks away. Brand-new book, "The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump" available presales on amazon.com and hannity.com, FOX News.
All right. Sara, let's start with the breaking news tonight, and with the House Judiciary, and how is it that the guy in the center of all of this, Peter Strzok, gets to be behind closed doors. And will he be under oath, which is to me a big question?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it's a huge question. And let me tell you something, Sean. Tomorrow when he gets behind those closed doors, he is going to be grilled. 
I spoke to a number of lawmakers today that have said they're not going to let Peter Strzok just try to skate by. They're going to ask the tough questions and believe me, there are a lot of tough questions that he needs to answer. Peter Strzok was in the middle of the Hillary Clinton investigation, in the middle of the Hillary Clinton server investigation. He was the lead investigator and he needs to do a lot of explaining. Tomorrow, there are a number of lawmakers that are going to directly ask him what his text messages meant, what did he mean by saying, they're going to stop the president, they're going to stop him. 
I know there are other questions they have with regard to McCabe and his activities because former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was actively involved in a lot of this. And they want to know if he actually met with him as he talked about with Lisa Page and the text messages, what was the insurance policy? 
HANNITY: Let's go to Gregg. One of the important aspects of all of this, and that is the I.G. determines Strzok had a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. That sounds to me like an attempt at a soft coup in America with the power of the FBI and lead investigator. 
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Subverting the rule of law and undermining a democratic election. 
One of the critical questions he'll be asked is, on June 6th, 2016, you sat down at your computer with your mistress, Lisa Page, and two other people unidentified so far, and you changed the critical language of James Comey's statement that Hillary Clinton was grossly negligent, having committed a crime, to something that seemingly was then less than that -- 
HANNITY: So, this was written in (INAUDIBLE). This was June 6, they don't even interview her until July 2nd. So they are changing the standard, from the legal standard to just slightly less.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JARRETT: It's a similar almost identical term but, it's not in the statute. And thus, Comey felt he could exonerate Hillary Clinton with essentially a charade. And then, Strzok flies to London the day after the Trump Russia collusion investigation begins. 
Who did he meet with, Christopher Steele? Did you talk about the dossier? Did you already have the dossier? Did he give it to you? 
And what about your use of confidential informants? Did you assign them to investigate the Trump team before the investigation ever began? So, there are going to be a lot of questions.
HANNITY: But there's another on unfinished business. And, of course -- 
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: -- oh, we're not going to let that happen. And then we have the insurance policy that as Sara mentioned and you have talked about. 
JARRETT: And he talks about his organization. Trump is about to win and he says, I'm scared for our organization.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: This is important now. 
JARRETT: Yes, this is a text from Page to him. What did you mean by your organization? What did you mean by now I need to fix it and finish it? 
All of these things led the inspector general to conclude there was a willingness to influence the election. 
HANNITY: Sara, here's the big question. So, I would think Jim Jordan tomorrow is the guy to watch. Who else? 
CARTER: I think Jim Jordan is the guy to watch. I think Matt Gaetz is another guy to watch. There's going to be quite a few questions coming from both of them. And I think something that's very important, and Gregg touched on it, how many informants did they have? I mean, this is a big question. How many people were actively involved and did the taxpayers actually pay for this beforehand? 
HANNITY: Why was Michael Caputo approached? Why was a deal offered to -- 
CARTER: That's right.
HANNITY: -- Roger Stone? This isn't made before they ever even came anywhere this supposed Trump Russian collusion, right? And the FBI brought in a convicted convict from Russia to do this, why? Who authorized that? Was it the Clintons?
Sara, last point.
CARTER: Hopefully -- yes, hopefully, we'll get those answers tomorrow, or at least some of them. And remember if they don't, if they don't turn over those documents, Sean, Congress has other plans. Contempt or impeachment for Rod Rosenstein. 
HANNITY: This is just getting interesting. And, by the way, I would say that Chairman Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte -- release the transcripts. Release them. We deserve to see them. 
All right. When we come back, congrats on the book. Joe diGenova, Andy McCarthy -- and breaking news that just crossed to the AP, reporting Henry McMaster won the South Carolina GOP primary runoff. We'll tell you more.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Joining us now with reaction to tonight's breaking news, our opening monologue. He is a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova, Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy, and, of course, he writes for "The National Review, two of the smartest people I know. 
Good to see you. 
So, Strzok goes behind closed doors. He says he's going to talk, I don't believe it. 
ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he probably is going to talk, Sean, because he talked to Horowitz. So, you know, I think he sounds like he's one of these guys who thinks he can go into the room and kind of control the room. And Horowitz says that -- 
HANNITY: That is really arrogant and stupid. 
MCCARTHY: Well, Horowitz said that he had very long, involved answers on every question he asked him that, you know, why did you do this? Why did you do that? So, he may just be one of these guys who thinks he can go in to that environment and do OK. 
And he's got reasons to think that because in a court room, where there is a judge, somebody can't get away with just giving their side of the story and then saying, when you try to cross-examine him, oh, national security reasons, or, you know, investigative integrity. A judge would tell them, no, no, you told your side of the story, now they get to ask you about the hard stuff. 
In a congressional hearing, you can dodge that stuff. I mean, they get away with that all the time. 
HANNITY: I have some faith on a few of the congressmen there. Jordan, Gaetz, some of the people Sara was talking about. 
You know, one thing you said, Joe diGenova, that still sticks with me, because so many in my family -- my mom was a prison guard, my dad worked in family court probation. I have cousins that were on the NYPD. The guys that were dating were both FBI guys. 
And you say bad cop, and sadly, it's true. And he was the lead guy -- interviewed Clinton, interviewed Flynn, began the Russia investigation which I would argue renders it illegitimate from the get-go. This is the guy you are talking about. This is one of the guys, not the rank-and-file guys.
JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Yes, well, as I said from the very beginning of this, James Comey was a dirty cop. And Mr. Strzok is dirtier. 
The bottom line is very simple. He's going to go in tomorrow and he is going to lie. He's going to give explanations that are untruthful. He says that when Lisa Page asked him, he is not speaking about president or candidate Trump. He can't win, can he? He can't have him as president. And Strzok says, no, no, no, we'll stop it. 
Now, he is claiming that there is an explanation for "we'll stop it". I can't wait to hear it.
HANNITY: You know, you are the two people I don't think I wouldn't want to mess with in court room. I kind of agree but then there is the insurance policy. 
MCCARTHY: Sure.
HANNITY: Then there is a loathsome human being. Then there is, you know, beyond we'll stop, but then there's the action. Now it's real. This is real. You know, some superior believe that he's doing it from noble causes,.
DIGENOVA: Yes.
HANNITY: But really, he is almost attempting a coup, because somebody was guilty of crimes that he pushes under the rug. And then they go full force sledgehammer on the other candidate.
(CROSSTALK)
DIGENOVA: You know, let--
HANNITY: That to me is influencing an election and collusion. 
DIGENOVA: Let's just be very clear about this. This is not a complicated case. The FBI at the senior levels in the Obama administration and the Department of Justice, Loretta Lynch and all her minions had two goals in mind. Very simple, very plain. Exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally and then if she lost the election, to frame Donald Trump.
That's it. It's in a nutshell it's never changed over the last two years and everything that we have learned from the text messages, the I.G. reports, has proven conclusively that that is precisely what James Comey and Loretta Lynch and the Obama administration people wanted to do. And it was the most brazen plot in the history of U.S. law enforcement and it won't make much difference unless we get all the facts out on the table. 
HANNITY: Andy, I agree.
MCCARTHY: Look, I think it's clear that these were two investigations that were going on at the same time, and whether you are a liberal or conservative Republican or Democratic, I don't know how you look at them and say the same quality of justice was accorded to both. Clearly it wasn't. 
HANNITY: But you know, equal justice under the law. Equal application of our laws, our constitutional system here. Listen, it all started with Hillary. She committed felonies. The biggest most obvious case of obstruction, they made every consideration. Thread every needle, even though other people went to jail for far worse. 
And then you go to what they did to Donald Trump and what Joe was talking about.
MCCARTHY: Right.
HANNITY: Then how do you lie to a FISA judge, Andy, not once, but four times unverified and uncorroborated against the law and against FBI protocol, four times using bought and paid for political op research from an outsider of foreign national. 
MCCARTHY: Well, Sean, I think on one side of the coin with Hillary, it looks like they bent over backwards to not make the case in the face of mountainous evidence against her.
HANNITY: No.
MCCARTHY: And on the other side, where you don't have evidence of a crime, it seems that they scorched the earth to try to stop this presidency. 
HANNITY: That to me is an attempt at bypassing the will of the American people. And you're right, Joe. Really when you get down to the brass tacks here, it's a simple case. A simple case of the abuse of power, far deeper than anything we ever imagine with Watergate and corruption, in my opinion. 
DIGENOVA: Now, here is the simple fact. What the FBI and the DOJ and the Obama administration did was subversion. Plain and simple. This is 1954 communist stuff, subversion. They sought to subvert an election, and when the person that they didn't want got elected, they sought to subvert his presidency. 
They have done everything in their power, and don't forget, even though Peter Strzok is testifying tomorrow, the guy who started all this was John Brennan. The CIA director in cooperation with Clapper. None of this will be fair unless both of them find themselves in front of a grand jury. 
HANNITY: Last word, Andy.
MCCARTHY: I think he'll have a lot to say tomorrow behind closed doors, but I still think--
HANNITY: You do?
MCCARTHY: -- let the text speak for themselves. 
HANNITY: Should they release the transcript? Congress has the power to make that. The chairman have the power. 
MCCARTHY: I assume as they scrub it -- I assume they are asking him questions behind closed doors because they make it into classified matters, but I think as soon as they can scrub that it should be enough.
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: Why can't they do what they often do which is they do some in public and then whatever they need to ask? 
MCCARTHY: I hope -- I hope that -- what they are going to do. I think Jim Jordan said he regards this as step number one. So I think this is a step one and then will be a public hearing. 
HANNITY: I think there will be people to go to jail and I think it's the worst abuse of power we've ever seen. And I think it's going to get worse based on the people who tell me.
Thank you. Great work on NRO. Joe, you are always so shy. We really need you to come out of your shell a little bit more. Just a hair. Joe DiGenova, thank you. 
When we come back, all right, Democrats and the media freaking out over the Supreme Court decision today. It has upheld President Trump's travel ban. By the way, some media never-Trumpers probably wouldn't have had happen if they had their way. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. The president had a huge victory of the Supreme Court earlier today. The judges 5-4 decision upheld his travel ban with places limits on people from, let's see. Iran and Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, leading to travel to the U.S. 
And of course, some in the media, predicatively Democrats, predictably lashing out at the court's decision. Wow. It's not the ninth circuit for once. It's not their favorite judge shopping court, it didn't work out so well today. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE, MSNBC: And so today was a fantastic fulfillment of Usama Bin Laden's vision by Donald J. Trump. What Usama Bin Laden hope to provoke was a war of civilization. A war between the west and one billion Muslims. 
And so what Donald Trump in this Muslim ban signal to the world is that Muslims are not welcome here. 
REP. KEITH ELLISON, D-MINN.: If you steal and rip off a Supreme Court justice, then you can try to jam any kind of nasty, racist, ugly policy you can down the throats of American people. He has his Supreme Court tailor-made to his ugly philosophy. 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: This ruling did not make us any safer, and I believe that the court was wrong. It's un-American to do what has been done. 
SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: This is a moral moment in our country. What the Supreme Court decided today is not just wrong it is dangerous. It makes us less safe.
(END VIDEO CLIPS) 
HANNITY: Joining us now former Secret Service agent NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino, conservative columnist senior fellow for the London Center for Policy Research, Monica Crowley. Good to see you both. 
I'm just watching, wasn't Cory Booker the same guy yesterday encouraging people to create big groups of people and follow people into restaurants, like Pam Bondi and Sarah Huckabee and Secretary Nielsen, isn't that the same guy? 
MONICA CROWLEY, SENIOR FELLOW, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH: Well, he's also running for president which is why you get this kind of grandstanding. 
The president of the United States has two main jobs, Sean, protect and defend the Constitution and protect and defend the American people. He put this travel ban together after a couple of fits and starts and he finally had a final draft of it and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court validated what he came up with. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: What about the never-Trumpers people?
CROWLEY: And the country is safer as a result of what the commander in chief did. 
HANNITY: A hundred percent, it's not even a close call and all we're saying is we got to vet you, and make sure you don't bring radical views with you which is a reasonable request in line to 3,000 Americans killed on 9/11 and the series of other attacks. 
Dan Bongino, there is now the left unhinged. They are now attacking women. You see children, you see the power slipping away, the Mueller investigation crumbling, the economy moving and the president's foreign policy working. And that to the left is now setting them off because of the power they want back is slipping away. 
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR, NRATV: Sean, it is, and I'm really concerned, and I know you are, too. You know, I spent 12 years in the Secret Service. Sean, I've never, and correct me if I'm wrong anyone out there, but I never in my 12 years saw a press secretary have to get a Secret Service detail like Sarah Sanders apparently is being assigned now. You know what worries me about the left--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Her children were threatened. The president's son-- 
BONGINO: This is crazy.
HANNITY: What did Peter Pan to say, well, put them in a cage with pedophiles. 
BONGINO: Sean--
HANNITY: And they are talking about raping Secretary Nielsen. Look what they did to Pam Bondi? This is now -- and somebody is going to get killed. God forbid. 
BONGINO: Sean--
HANNITY: I pray nobody gets killed on any side of the aisle. Somebody is going to get killed here and something is going to happen, because they are pushing, provoking and seemingly wanting this confrontation. 
BONGINO: Sean, they have no emergency brake on their behavior, either. Remember the essence of conservatism is an adherence to God-given right. There is a moral emergency brake on your behavior. There is none of that for a liberalism. I'm not talking about Democrats. I'm taking about the radical left. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: So, I'm thinking about--
BONGINO: These are -- I'm very worried about these people. 
HANNITY: I'm almost thinking about tweeting out where I'm meeting so maybe they will leave, you know, the women and children alone. If they come after me I'd feel a little bit better and I'm not kidding. 
CROWLEY: They won't, Sean. They won't leave the women and children alone.
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: No, they won't.
CROWLEY: I mean, that's the point. This has been a longstanding--
HANNITY: Me and Dan will tweet out where we are going to eat. 
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: You had a good temper though, Sean, so that will be all right.
CROWLEY: This is nothing new. 
HANNITY: I'm not inviting you. 
CROWLEY: What I'm not invited? 
HANNITY: Me and Dan.
CROWLEY: That's on a personal affront. 
HANNITY: I know. 
CROWLEY: Look, this is not something that do--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I will only invite you if I don't tweet. 
CROWLEY: The left has been doing this now for decades, these are Alinsky tactics, this is coward and paving at the border overwhelming the system. 
HANNITY: It's different.
CROWLEY: What's different now is the level of intensity and activism on the part of the core left, but also on the part of the media which has created this alliance with the core left. 
When we've seen this kind of thing happen in the past there have been elder statesmen or elder stateswomen in the party or something to try to put the brakes on it.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You mean like Hillary, Elizabeth Warren?
CROWLEY: But this is now--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Barack Obama, Michelle?
CROWLEY: Barack Obama's party. This is now Brack Obama's party. It is a party to the left. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Barack Obama said, get in their face. Remember that? Barack Obama said we are going to send Mr. Burgess over to Sean Hannity, and he will tell tear him up. I'm still waiting. He hasn't shown up yet.
CROWLEY: Right. You bring a nice to the fight. We bring it down.
HANNITY: We bring it down. No, no, they go low, we go high. 
CROWLEY: Well, we know what that really--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: It's called B.S. Yes, we know what that is. 
CROWLEY: So these are tactics that the left has employed for decades. It's nothing new. But what's new is the level of intensity because they so -- they look at this president as an existential threat, therefore he, add everybody who is serving his administration add everybody who voted for him must be discredited and yes, destroyed. 
HANNITY: It's all part of what I was trying to say in my monologue, Dan. It's every two and four years, Republicans race is sexist and misogynist. There is an Islamophobic, xenophobic, homophobic. They want dirty air and water, they want to kill children and throw your granny over the cliff. 
It's just a --except this time they really are putting -- it seems like women. Look at, you know, Mitch McConnell's wife tonight. And by the way, I applaud her. She got in their grill and didn't back down and that's not an easy thing for people to do. 
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: And Sean, did you notice by the way, did you notice the snowflake cowards only started yelling at Elaine Chao really aggressively after she got in the car? 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: When she had walk away.
BONGINO: Yes, but she got in the car. Total cowards. But you're right. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: No, no, no, snowflake cowards.
BONGINO: That's right. 
HANNITY: I really mean this. And maybe -- maybe I'm very old-fashioned. I don't like women and children and I can't recall a time in Obama's administration or something like this happened. You know, leave the kids out of it, leave the women out of it. You know what, if you want to pick a fight, pick it with me, you, Don Jr. or Sebastian Gorka. Pick it with us at Sean Hannity Twitter. We will tell you where we are eating, you can come. Yell at us. Shame, shame, shame. You can chant all you want. 
Thanks for being with us. When we come back, Ed Henry with a live report on two big stories that will consume Washington tomorrow. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. A big day on Capitol Hill tomorrow. House representatives are going to vote on a highly contentious immigration bill. Also anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok is schedule to appear before the House judiciary committee in a closed-door hearing and we are going to be working hard to bring you that story. 
Here with a lot more on these stories and more, he's Fox News chief national correspondent, who didn't really want to hang out at the White House tonight, so he went to the studio where he's drinking coffee all night. 
I like those shot at the White House, it looks better.
(CROSSTALK)
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: All right. I'm going to start doing that.
HANNITY: Maybe the president will look outside and to say, hi, like he did to Steve Doocy.
HENRY: He's done that with Steve Doocy and he's done it with me, Sean. But I got to tell you this is a story about immigration in Capitol Hill so we decided to do it from the studio. We are a stone's throw from Capitol Hill but, now that you've shamed me I'll go back to the White House tomorrow night. 
President Trump as you noticed scored a major victory on his travel ban today, that gives him vindication on his approach of taking strong measures to protect the nation and he may now have to take more executive action in the months ahead because it's looking less likely that Republicans here on Capitol Hill are going to pass legislation cracking down on illegal immigration tomorrow. They have a big vote.
The president reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by saying, the nation needs to be tough in terms of vetting who is coming into the country. But right now House Republicans are working on a more moderate bill that will keep migrant families from being separated at the border but it's unlikely to include tougher provisions like e-verify. 
So it does not appear that enough conservatives are coming on board. As a result, moderate Republican Jeff Denham says tonight he's disappointed that even this watered-down bill is likely to fail in the House tomorrow, as the president continues to demand tough measures like funding for the wall. Watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have no -- we have bad laws. We have the worst immigration laws in the history of the world, OK. It's a joke. People can't believe it. Other countries look at us and they say, how is that possible? 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Meanwhile as you noted, FBI agent Peter Strzok is finally coming to Capitol Hill tomorrow for a closed-door deposition. The president's tweeted today that Strzok is a quote, unquote, "fraud" who should be instead, be questioned live on television. 
Sources on the Hill telling us tonight that Strzok will in fact be grilled in public in the next few weeks, Sean. So the president will get his chance.
By the way, there is a breaking story from Capitol Hill tonight with Joe Crowley, a very senior Democrat from New York who is been rumored to be in line to potentially replace Nancy Pelosi if Democrats win the House majority. 
You've heard all this talk, Sean, about a so-called blue wave, it turns out maybe the blue wave is turning on Democrats. With 82 percent of the vote in on this primary in New York tonight, Joe Crowley is losing by double digits. By 15 points, he's facing an unknown 28-year-old Latina woman named Alexandria Octavia Cortez. Joe Crowley has 42 percent of the vote and she has 52 percent. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: They called it, he lost. 
HENRY: He lost. So here's the point. Remember what happened with Eric Cantor? Remember Eric Cantor--
HANNITY: I do.
HENRY: -- a couple years ago losing that primary, and all -- there was all this talk, there was a major civil war in the Republican Party, big problems, we are hearing now the same. Big problems for President Trump and the Republicans, a Democratic way of coming. Guess what, there's a split in the Democratic Party and tonight it took out one of the most senior House Democrats. 
And I can tell you, I'm watching social media, Sean, there are a lot of Democrats tweeting and on Facebook, talking about if Crowley goes down, and as you say, A.P. has just called it, that Nancy Pelosi is going to be in trouble because with incumbents like this starting to fall-- 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: 'm defending Nancy--
HENRY: A lot of Democratic people who--
HANNITY: I stand Nancy and Maxine Waters. I stand with them. I don't -- they can stay right where they are.
HENRY: I'm just bringing the facts. You can pick who you want, I'm just bringing the facts. 
HANNITY: I'd trying to get you to get commentary, but I know you're never going to. That's what makes you great. Ed Henry at the White House
When we come back, wait until you see what was captured by a camera crew at the U.S.-Mexico border. That's next, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Can we show all of these people that are pointing at me. Put them on camera. All right. There you go. We got a jib that's moving over. This is a powerful machine. There you go. All right. Our video of the day though is truly stunning. During an interview yesterday with a border agent near McAllen, Texas, an ABC News crew ran into a human smuggler. Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So this is one of the areas where exclusively the smugglers use it to smuggle unaccompanied children and family into the U.S. So those migrant families, this is one of the pathway, they come through right here. This is the main pathway here in McAllen station they have a responsibility.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, there is a smuggler. Border patrol. We have a -- border patrol there's just got a smuggler. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a smuggler? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the smuggler right here. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Agent Rick (ph), you can't go in there. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I cannot go in the river to apprehend him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Unbelievable. All right. We will always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. There she is.
