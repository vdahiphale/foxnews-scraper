MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey there, Bret. Thank you very much.Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York, and this is THESTORY. So, as Dorsey and Zuckerberg and Bezos try to cancel the presidentand lots of conservatives off of their huge national platforms, theirstocks tumbled today. And an intense battle for freedom of speech in theUnited States has truly come to a head and is enjoined in this countryright now.Meanwhile, President-elect Biden will not take a real stand on whetherdragging the country through another impeachment at this violent andfragile moment for the country would be a good idea. He does think though,it could be schedule then if they decide they want to do it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Half a day on dealingwith impeachment, and half a day, getting my people nominated, andconfirmed in the Senate as well as we are moving out. So, let's hold anexpectation.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: And so, you have that. All right. So, Congressman Ken Buck, whofeels very strongly about this, joins me in moments. He and otherRepublicans just wrote a letter to President-elect Biden. They areimploring him to stop the impeachment effort and they want him to support amoment of healing for the whole country. We're going to talk to him in justa moment.The Wall Street Journal writes today that the president actually would notbe guilty of inciting violence on January the 6th. Democrats though insistthat they can prove it if it comes to it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Every day he's in office, he remains a real andpresent danger to the country.REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R-RI): It's not a waste of time for everyone in thiscountry and around the world to see us stand up and defend against aneffort to overthrow a duly elected president.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: All right. So, let's begin tonight with Byron York, ChiefPolitical Correspondent for The Washington Examiner, Andy McCarthy, formerFederal Prosecutor. Both are Fox News Contributors. Also joined tonight byJeffrey Scott Shapiro, a former D.C. prosecutor who wrote this piece in TheWall Street Journal today. And he argues that the president did not mentionviolence, much less provoke it. So, he'll explain to us his thinking onthat in just a moment.But, Byron, let me get started with you in terms of what we're watchingunfold here tonight, you've got a lot of threats of violence that arecoming forward for the coming days. And there is a big push amongDemocrats. They say they have the votes to impeach the president and theycould do it rather quickly.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I don't think there's any doubtthat they have the votes to impeach the president. They almost have enoughco-sponsors on the articles of impeachment to impeach the president. Butthere's enormous confusion about what will happen after that. If they dopass articles of impeachment this Wednesday, the 13th of January, there'sexactly one week left, and the president drops term.Now, we know the Senate is not supposed to come back until January 19th.There are rumors or talk tonight about Charles Schumer, the minority leaderright now trying to come up with some parliamentary maneuver to get theSenate back earlier. But even then, there's only seven days, six days leftfor them to act. And then there's this big debate about whether there couldactually be an impeachment trial of the president when he's the formerpresident, which personally I think the public might have a hard time goingfor that.But Democrats are seriously considering doing that, giving Joe Biden 100hundred days to pass his agenda, and then returning for a trial for thepresident, the former president.MACCALLUM: It seems, Andy, that it would be it would be a good thing atthis point for the president-elect to take a firm stance on how he seesthis and what he thinks is best for the country. You heard him there say,oh, they could have worked on the impeachment, I guess, in the morning andthen they could approve my nominees in the afternoon. Is that enough atthis point?ANDY MCCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I don't think so, Martha. And Ithink this goes to the gamesmanship that we're seeing. I'm actually of amind that the Constitution does permit an impeachment trial to take placeafter the impeach president is gone. But I don't see that the Democrats canhave it both ways. If there's a real need, an emergency needs to do animpeachment that you have to strip down and make sure and not have the dueprocess that would normally be attendant to a House impeachment proceeding.And then after that happens, Speaker Pelosi, instead of transmitting it tothe Senate, can stick it in her pocket. And they're just going to waitaround till some propitious political time for Schumer and Biden. That'snot an impeachment. That's a game.So, this is either really important and it has to be done this minute,which means if they vote impeachment, then she should immediately get thosearticles to the Senate and they should follow their rules and do nothinguntil they've gotten through the trial or there's no reason to do this now.And you should either just have a censure or do everything after thepresident has left office, but with all the due process that you wouldnormally require.MACCALLUM: Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, you wrote an interesting piece today, yousaid no, Trump isn't guilty of incitement. I think there has been so muchfrenzy and people look deeper back into the past to sort of make this casethat that he was not - sort of going after some of these groups that appearto have been involved in this strongly enough and that he opened the doorfor this. But what's your argument?JEFFREY SCOTT SHAPIRO, FORMER DC PROSECUTOR: Martha, I literally prosecutedhundreds of people in the District of Columbia during the Iraq war, mostlyon the Left, who had done many things at the U.S. Capitol, that was my job.I was nicknamed the protester prosecutor by Code Pink because I prosecutedso many unlawful protesters.And I can tell you that the standard for a lot of the charges in theDistrict of Columbia, such as disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly orinciting a riot are based on the principles of inciting violence. And thestatutory language in D.C. comes from a very important touchstone U.S.Supreme Court case, Brandenburg versus Ohio. That means that in order to beguilty or not have First Amendment protection when you're charged withcriminal speech, so to say, is that you are inciting imminent violence orlawlessness and that your speech is likely to produce violence.The president made it very clear that he wanted his followers to marchpeacefully down to the Capitol and cheer for senators, congressmen, andwomen. There is nothing in that speech that is likely to incite violence.If I was still working as a D.C. prosecutor today and I was at a chargingdesk and a police officer came in with a transcript of the president'swords, I would have looked at it no matter who it was, and I would havetold them this affidavit lacks probable cause and I'm rejecting this casefor criminal prosecution.MACCALLUM: Andy let me go back to you on that, what do you say about that?MCCARTHY: I think he's absolutely right; I tried a terrorist for incitementto crimes of violence, there's not a prayer that they could convictPresident Trump in a criminal court of incitement. You have to prove thathe intended violence to happen. He said things that were clearly calls forviolence and it was probable under the circumstances that violence couldimminently happen. They're not close to being able to make that case. Thatdoesn't mean that what he said might not be an impeachable offense becauseyou don't need a prosecutable criminal case for that. But the idea thatthey could prove incitement along the lines of what you'd need for acriminal case, no way.MACCALLUM: So, Byron, you find yourself in territory. It just takes me backto the last impeachment, right. And you ask yourself, well, was there anactual impeachable offense in that phone call? Right. It seems like amillion years ago in all of our lives. And I don't know how much thesethings matter at this point. I think this is an enormous political push.We're going to talk in a moment about all the companies and all the effortsto just cancel this president and erase him from history. Your thoughts onall that?YORK: Well, by the way, in the last impeachment, at the end of 2019,Republicans were accusing Democrats of racing to impeachment and cuttingcorners all along the way, which they actually weren't doing. But it stilltook 85 days from the beginning of impeachment to the actual vote onarticles. Now, it's going to be done in about 24 hours. So, it's absolutelyextraordinary.But there is another option, which Andy mentioned very briefly, which isthe idea of censure. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the Housesent out a letter tonight about various options that might be available inthis situation. And one of those he listed was censure. And back in 1998,when Republicans impeached Bill Clinton, a lot of Democrats said, look, donot impeach him, let's censure President Clinton.We Democrats will vote to censure our Democratic president and then thatwill handle this. But Republicans were absolutely determined to impeachBill Clinton and they did, and it didn't work. So, we could be in asituation here where there is time to pass an action of censure against thepresident in both the House and Senate. And it might get some Republicanvotes, by the way, but it appears that Democrats are absolutely determinedto impeach instead.MACCALLUM: But just a few seconds here, Andy. But I want to ask you, wouldthat accomplish the goal? It appears that for Democrats, the goal is tomake sure that the president can never run again.MCCARTHY: Martha, I think it's really ridiculous to be worrying aboutwhether you have a formal ban on whether the president can run again. If hedid what we all saw last Wednesday and what the wages of it were and youhad a censure that described, it accurately. I don't think there's a chancethat he could stand for office again. But if he did, you could impeach himthen. There's certainly no reason there has to be done now.MACCALLUM: All right, gentlemen, thank you very much. Jeffrey ScottShapiro, interesting piece today. Thank you for being here. Andy McCarthy,Byron York, always good to have you here. Thanks, gentlemen.So, Republican Congressman Ken Buck is calling on President-elect Biden toput a stop to the impeachment effort for the sake of the country. And hejoins me now. Congressman Buck, good to have you here tonight. Everywhere Igo, people talk about how upsetting and horrifying in many ways this wholeperiod is. When you looked at what happened at the U.S. Capitol and you seethe divisiveness. I mean, I thought we saw divisiveness a year ago. It'snothing like how frightening it is right now in this country. What is yourmessage to the president-elect this evening, sir?REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): My message is that this is being rushed, this is apolitical stunt, and what we need to do is take time and reflect and makesure that whatever decisions are made regarding the events of January 6thare done with intelligent action.This president-elect could gain a lot of goodwill among Republicans andDemocrats, frankly. But among Americans generally, if he told everybody,slow down, this president is not an imminent threat to this country at thispoint. Let's get through the inauguration and let's look back and make somedecisions.There are all kinds of mistakes that were made, some of epic proportions interms of protecting the Capitol building itself. And we really need to forma commission. We need to look at these issues and we need to come up withsome good ideas moving forward.MACCALLUM: I think one of the things that people look at is would it makethe country safer if you impeach the president right now. Chad Wolf at DHSput in his resignation today. So, there you have the acting chief of DHSsaying that he is not going to be there through the next 10 days of thisperiod. You have a couple of the security officials, Robert O'Brien at thetop, who is the national security adviser, who is staying, it appears, forthe purpose of making sure that he can make things as stable as possible.What does impeachment do to the safety of the country, in your mind?BUCK: Well, it doesn't help in any way. If anything, it further dividesthis country. When Speaker Pelosi reaches out to the chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff and talks about nuclear codes and then publicizes thatconversation and then she engages in this impeachment without anyinvestigation, we think we know some of the things that happened during theday, but we don't know all the things that happened. We don't know whoordered the National Guard to come in, who order to not to come inbeforehand. There are a lot of questions that that really need answersbefore we can make an intelligent decision on who's culpable and where andhow culpable people are.MACCALLUM: This is David Cicilline, Democrat from Rhode Island. Here's howhe sees it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CICILLINE: There are some people who think, oh, the president's leaving in10 days, let's just overlook it. Look, we took an oath to defend andprotect the constitution and our democracy. That responsibility falls tous. We have no other choice. Congress is obligated under our oath of officeto move forward and impeach this president.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What do you say to that argument?BUCK: Well, I serve on the Judiciary Committee with Congressman Cicilline,and I have a lot of respect for him, but he's wrong. We took an oath touphold the Constitution. We didn't take an oath to move in a direction thatclearly negates the intent of the impeachment clause and the idea ofimpeachment. Impeachment is something you do with great reflection. It'snot something you do as a political stunt and when a president is on hisway out.MACCALLUM: So, you heard the conversation that we just had about the optionof a censure. There are reports that there are several Republicans, HouseRepublicans, who believe that that is the way to go. Do you support thatmove?BUCK: I don't. I think there has been a lot of censurable conduct over thepast four or five years, and even before that, I think when the Speaker ofthe House rips up the State of the Union address on national television,when Maxine Waters talks about how Trump supporters should be harassed inrestaurants and public places, when the vice president elect talks aboutthe riots over the summer in glowing terms, I think there are really issuesthat we have to deal with in terms of our rhetoric in this country. But topoint at the president and only censure him, I think is unfair.MACCALLUM: It's so true. I mean, you think back about the bail funds thatKamala Harris wanted to raise. She wanted the people who were attackingsmall businesses and, in some cases, some of the business owners wereinjured in some of those riots. But she wanted, in some cases for people toget bail so they could get back out on the streets and do protest.Is there any way to get Democrats on the other side of the aisle andRepublicans to come together and see how destructive all of this is for thecountry and try to pull together some kind of unity here?BUCK: I think there are a lot of personal relationships that will onceagain be mended and move forward after January 20th, and I hope that myfellow, colleagues recognize that we're in the middle of a pandemic, we arein the middle of an economic crisis, and we have a lot of internationalissues to deal with. If we don't come together, we're making a seriousmistake and we're not doing the people's work.MACCALLUM: There's a job to be done, to be sure, and that is in the bestinterest of the people of this country. Thank you very much, CongressmanBuck. Thanks for being here tonight. Good to see you.BUCK: Thank you.MACCALLUM: In Colorado. So, we're going to continue this story later withKarl Rove. And next up, Shelby Steele on Morgan Stanley, Marriott, AT&T,American Express, many others making a political statement canceling theirdonations to Republicans who tried to overturn the Electoral College, whereis all that leading?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The effort to cancel the president now stretching well beyondsocial media as businesses take political stands against Trump and hiscompanies now. Correspondent Alex Hogan has that story for tonight. Hi,Alex.ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. Well, five days aftersupporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol, big tech companiespushing him offline and now big companies rescinding some of their support.The PGA is severing ties with Donald Trump. The board of directors having ameeting on Sunday last night announcing that they will cancel thechampionship at Trump's New Jersey golf course, which was planned for 2022.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM RICHERSON, PRESIDENT, PGA OF AMERICA: It's become clear that conductingthe PGA Championship, the Trump administer would be detrimental to the PGAof America brand. It would put at risk the PGA's ability to deliver on manyprograms and sustain the longevity of our mission.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOGAN: President Trump's campaign responding calling that a breach ofcontract. Educational institutions voiding documents as well. LehighUniversity in Pennsylvania and Wagner College in New York, rescindingDonald Trump's honorary degrees. A growing number of corporations alsoannouncing they will suspend political donations to Republicans who opposedPresident-elect Joe Biden certification.Among them, Marriott International, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Airbnb andAmerican Express. Greeting card company Hallmark making its message clear,calling the peaceful transition of power part of the bedrock of ourdemocracy.The company also pulling campaign contributions from two Republicansenators. Big name financial companies like Citigroup, JPMorgan, Visa areamong those announcing a pause on all political donations. Financialservices company Stripe saying it will no longer process contributions toTrump's campaign. And over the weekend, social media platform Facebook, aswell as Twitter and Instagram, either suspending or getting rid of hisaccounts.Now, tech servers like Amazon, Google and Apple announcing over the weekendthat they would pull Parler off of their websites and in return now Parleris suing Amazon. Martha.MACCALLUM: Alex, thank you very much. So, joining me now, Shelby Steele,Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and writer and producer of thedocumentary What Killed Michael Brown. We've spoken with him about thatdocumentary and about racial issues a lot over the recent years. Shelby,thank you so much for being here tonight. When you listen to Alex's reportand you hear about all of those companies canceling the president, in manyways, what goes through your mind tonight?SHELBY STEELE, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: That cancellation hasbecome an exercise of moral power. It is - if someone disagrees and theyhave a different politics, this is not something you engage in argument.It's something that you are so morally above that you obliterate, you justeliminate it, and you don't have to argue, you can get credit for all sortsof virtuous sentiments when all you've done really is run away from anissue.And so, it's a sad thing to see. It cuts off. It undermines our democracy,which is based on debate and cross-examination and so forth, and evidence.My film, the one you mentioned, What Killed Michael Brown was canceled byAmazon. We got a very nasty letter, one that wasn't just official, but thatwas actually - there was a tone of moral outrage that they were going tonot accept our film because it was somehow immoral.It was - because there was no such thing. It was a perfectly reasonable, nonudity, no excessive bad language, nothing like that. It was they did notlike the message which part was had to do with the film that the blackAmerica was - the protest was fading away as a viable means of advancement.And that whether one agrees with that and one doesn't agree with that, it'sgot to be something that Americans consider and think about for a moment.But Amazon felt that they were somehow so morally superior to that option,that option of that they - they were so wonderful, in other words, theycould simply cancel it and move on and do - and thereby do a good serviceto American life. So, in that sense, evil is dressed up as good and incancellation that seems to me to be the formula.MACCALLUM: I think that all of these companies set such a dangerousprecedent when they began doing these things, when they started makingpolitical judgments and boycotting different things based on sort of amoral decision, as you point out. So, now they find themselves where theyhave to respond to everything, and they put themselves in a box. They'regoing to alienate, obviously, a lot of their customers. We put the very bignames up on the screen for Dow and the like.Let's put this up on the screen. This is an interesting comparison of thedonations to the Trump campaign and to the Biden campaign by Alphabet,which is Google and Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. You can see thetremendous disparity. Google, 4.3 million to the Biden campaign, 106,000 toTrump, Microsoft, $2.3 million and you can see the Trump comparison at247,000.So, it's obviously a striking difference. Not surprising really in thatpoint. But I want to ask you about sort of - because we've talked a lotabout the changing of - the changing look from some African Americans atsort of which party actually does really deserve their vote and has donethe most to help these communities' overtime. And I know that you felt thatthat President Trump had done a lot of good things for the black community.So, where does that energy go now?STEELE: Well, I think, you know, I think I would not say that Donald Trumpwas the most sophisticated American when it comes to the complex issue ofrace. What I will say, though, is that he made room for, made space for usto look at this complex issue from another angle. He - and we had been in aparadigm for 60 years now since the 60s of a racial protest, protest,protest, and then, of course, always following protests, inevitably,dependency, dependency, dependency.The people were protesting. We're asking them to lift us up and take usforward. Donald Trump made space for another point of view, which is thatdependency and protest are obsolete, they've taken black America as far asthey can take us that now we have to look at a model, a paradigm that isbased more on individual responsibility, on self-help, moving ourselvesforward, not looking outside of ourselves as individuals, but takingresponsibility for that.Well, that of course, challenges the very foundation politically of theLeft in America. And so, again, let me repeat myself. But going back toAmazon, that's a message they did not one heard.MACCALLUM: No, it's clear. And you make great points, Shelby. Before I letyou go, I just want to ask you the tail end of my question again. Wheredoes that go from here? If there was growth in that belief and a way thatsome African American voters were looking differently at which party coulddo something to allow them to succeed on their own. Where does that energygo now, do you think?STEELE: It's one of the things I like most about the Trump era, let's say.There is beginning to be, certainly in black America, a counterpoint to 60years of rather tired and exhausted liberalism. There are young peopleseriously considering other ideas now.Looking beyond the gestures of protest and toward the idea ofresponsibility as an energy, a transformative energy. And that is a -that's a wonderful thing. And I'm sad to see Trump depart because I thinkhe was the right guy to sort of make space for that new point of view toemerge. But it will emerge and at this point, that job is done. It willemerge and will, I think, become more and more a part of our politics, away of life.MACCALLUM: Shelby Steele, thank you very much, sir. Always good to have youhere. Thanks for being here.STEELE: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, still ahead tonight - thank you, sir. Still ahead tonight,how Trump voters who spoke to us throughout the campaign are feeling aboutwhere they are with everything now, after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Breaking tonight, the FBI is warning that therecould be armed protests in all 50 state capitols and in Washington, D.C.,before, during, and after the inauguration day. The warning spark by fearsof more violence after last week's deadly storming of the United StatesCapitol.The Secret Service is saying that they will begin tightening security forinauguration day this Wednesday, almost a week earlier than they hadplanned to do that. Up to 15,000 National Guard members from several statescould be deployed in Washington during this upcoming inauguration of thepresident-elect.Also breaking tonight new concerns about COVID on Capitol Hill after lastweek's riot force, lawmakers shelter together closely for hours. Today, a75-year-old New Jersey congresswoman who was in that secure room announcedthat she had tested positive for COVID.White House correspondent Kevin Corke with the following tonight on thatstory. Hi, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Martha. Itcontinues to build, the numbers that is of cases of COVID-19 and deaths forthat matter all across the country even as the vaccine rollout begins topick up some steam.The U.S. now recording an average, Martha, of 3,239 virus deaths each andevery day. And if that weren't bad enough, as you mentioned there is greatand growing concern on Capitol Hill. In fact, Congress' attending physicianhas warned House members that they may have been exposed to the virus lastweek after evacuating the House chamber after violent protesters stormedthe U.S. Capitol.In an e-mail attending Dr. Brian Monahan writing that, after evacuating toa large committee hearing space, members may have been exposed to anotheroccupant with the virus infection. He goes on to say in an e-mail, pleasecontinue your usual daily coronavirus risk reduction measures and obtain anRT PCR coronavirus test next week as a precaution. Monahan goes on to sayin that e-mail.Now as you know, Martha, age is a significant risk factor for cases ofsevere COVID-19. In fact, according to the Mayo Clinic, about 80 percent ofU.S. deaths from the virus have been people 65 years of age and older. Andthe average age of the House Democratic leadership in the last Congress was71. Of course, new Congress just started.You mentioned this and this is important, in fact, it's worth pointing outthat a couple of members since that they may have now announced that theyhave COVID-19. Republican Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas announcinghe tested positive for COVID-19 though he confirmed that the day of theattack.And then today as you pointed out, we also learned that New JerseyCongresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman has tested positive for the virus. Shebelieves she was infected while isolating during the riots with otherlawmakers who, in her words, refused to wear masks. Watson Coleman is 75years old. Clearly in the risk category. We'll see if others are impactmoving forward, Martha.MACCALLUM:  All right. Kevin Corke, thank you very much, Kevin, in D.C.tonight.CORKE:  You bet.MACCALLUM:  So, some Trump voters who say that siege at the United StatesCapitol was a disgrace. Also believed that impeachment is not the answerfor them and we will hear from them after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Tonight, two voters who joined us before electionday and later voted for President Trump were back once again to talk aboutthe events that have transpired since then and what they think about all ofthis.We welcome back Christopher Formoso, a financial manager from Florida andJolene Austin, a stay-at-home mom from Ohio. It was a pleasure to meet bothof you and talk to you during the course of the campaign. And I wonder, Iguess first of all, Christopher, I just want to start with you, have yourthoughts changed or your feelings about the president changed sinceelection day? What do you think?CHRISTOPHER FORMOSO, TRUMP VOTER:  A little bit. I've always been a fanmore of Trump's policies more than the person. But I did wish that once helost the election and then he took it to court which he had every right todo. Once he lost in court, he should have been able to walk away with somedignity. He kept the tirade going for two more weeks, which culminated onJanuary 6th. The terrible acts that happened that day. I feel like he soldhis name and all the good that he did during his four years were sold onthat day.MACCALLUM:  Christopher, do you think it was his -- do you think he is toblame for what happened? I mean, you know, when you watch those videos andyou see some of those people, you know, what goes through your mind? Do youblame him for that though?FORMOSO:  I don't think he is ultimately responsible. It's definitely thethousand or so people, fools, that went to the capitol to cause thisdestruction and to protest with no peace whatsoever. They are the ones toblame but Donald Trump, in that speech he said go there and protestpeacefully. he didn't say other remarks that could be misinterpreted by alarge group of fools and we saw what that could turn into.MACCALLUM:  Staying with you, Christopher, and then I'm going to get toJolene. But what would you like to see him do in the remaining nine days ofhis presidency?JOLENE AUSTIN, TRUMP VOTER:  I would really like to see Trump show class.You know, he already said there will be a peaceful transition on January20th. Let's go away with some dignity. There are still 72 million peoplethat did vote for him. I think that we need to have unity, especially rightnow, I think he needs to call for everyone. I don't think that we needprotest at the next, you know, the 50 capitols as what people are callingfor. I'm saying enough is enough. It is time to change over.MACCALLUM:  So what would you tell him to say, Jolene, and then I'm goingto go back to Chris. You know, what, if you ever talk to him, what wouldyou have him say to those people who are talking about those armed protestsat 50 state capitols tonight, what would you ask him?AUSTIN:  I would tell him that it is an attack on our democracy and I thinkthat he knows that. He, like I said, it's over. And I believe thatPresident Trump does know that. But he really needs to reach out toeveryone, and especially with these protests. Especially with the COVID,especially with what happened on Wednesday. Violence is never going to bethe answer. All it does is anger of the other side more and actually it isanger, the Republicans, just as much as did the Democrats.MACCALLUM:  Do you think that, would you like to see him attend theinauguration, Jolene?AUSTIN:  I would find that between the new feeling of Biden, unfortunatelyI don't think he should go. Pence is more than capable of taking his spot,it's not that I like that idea. You know, even Obama hadn't gone toPresident Trump's but I think enough damage has been done between thatrelationship between the two men.MACCALLUM:  So, Chris, what would you like to see the president do if youcould tell him with the last nine days of his presidency?FORMOSO:  I think I would tell him that most politicians they make greatmistakes all the time. Trump I would go out there, apologize and try torectify the situation. And he is a prideful person.I'd say you go to the inauguration with your head held up high and show thepeople that you are a good person. You are better than what they are makingyou out to be. And show some dignity and try to add some peace to the worldbecause they were so much division, so much hate right now. And it's ascary place for me and my family and my three kids.MACCALLUM:  Chris, what do you think about the rupture that we've heardabout between the president and the Vice President, Mike Pence? It's beenreported that they are not speaking to each other right now.FORMOSO:  It's a shame to see. And remember, they are the leaders of theRepublican Party for the past four years. They still are today. Make somepeace and show the world we are a party of unity, a party of supporting oneanother. I would like to see them make peace before in these last ninedays. There is still plenty of time to do so.MACCALLUM:  Jolene, what you think about the impeachment push?AUSTIN:  I believe the impeachment push should not happen. At the earliest,I think they said if they invoke the 25th amendment he could be possiblytaken out of presidency the day before. I think that's just going to divideus more. I do not feel that he is going to try to, you know, do anythingfor the rest of his presidency.As I said, he already said January 20th, there is going to be a peacefultransition. I don't find impeaching him, at this point, to do anything butdivide this entire country even more. And I believe that if they did try toimpeach him, that would cause more violent protest on inauguration day.MACCALLUM:  Jolene, thank you very much. Christopher, great to have both ofyou here. Jolene Austin, we met on the campaign trail and had a great talkand Christopher Formoso, you've been a great guest to the show as wellthrough the course of the campaign, big Trump supporters, both of you. Andwe thank you for your thoughts tonight. Good to see you tonight.AUSTIN:  Thank you.FORMOSO:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So Karl Rove has been listening to our conversation. We'll talkto him about the future, about his reflections on what those two voters hadto say tonight, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Just moments ago, this crossing Patriots head coachBill Belichick announcing that he will no longer accept the PresidentialMedal of Freedom at the White House. Citing the quote, "tragic events oflast week."Here now with reaction to everything that we are talking about tonight.With the voters that we just spoke with. And a lot going on this evening.Karl Rove joins us, former deputy chief of staff under President George W.Bush and a Fox News contributor. Karl, good evening. Thanks for being heretonight.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good evening. You bet.MACCALLUM:  I just go, I want to get to the Trump voters with you in just asecond, but John Roberts is reporting this this evening that some time, ashort time ago, the president and vice president met in the Oval Office,had a good conversation according to this report. And they discussed theweek ahead and reflected on the last four years.They reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the capitol lastweek do not represent the America first movement backed by 75 millionAmericans. And pledge to continue to work on behalf of the country for theremainder of their term. Your thoughts on that tonight, Karl.ROVE:  Well, a little bit of normality, the last Wednesday the presidentwas standing in front of the White House, the south side of the White Houseand talking about how he hoped his vice president would commit anunconstitutional act, that is to say taking into himself the ability, thepower of sole discretion over who actually were the electors first stateand in essence to overturn the election results.So, I'm glad the two men met. But the damage was already done lastWednesday by the president. And pouring out his vice president and sayingthat if the vice president didn't undertake an unconstitutional act hewould like him. So glad they had a coming together today. A reproche mon, Iguess in French, but the damage was done.MACCALLUM:  What do you think about the Mike Pence story sort of,throughout the course of this. Obviously, he would be somebody who wouldnaturally want to look ahead to potentially running for president, mostvice presidents consider themselves a good candidate for that. And why, youknow, he might want to make this point tonight that he is trying to mendfences.ROVE:  Well, I think he does want to go out on a, you know, on a good note.I mean, the vice president has been a consistent advocate for thepresident, a defender of his actions and words. And, you know, I've knownthe vice president not well but for a number of years.In fact, in May of 2016 in a meeting to three people in an apartment in NewYork then Canada, Donald Trump turned to me and said who do you think Iought to pick for vice president? And I said, you ought to take a look atMike Pence, the Midwesterner who got sensible views and wasn't critical ofyou while he supported somebody else. He helps unify the party. And he'sgot a great support among Evangelicals around the country. But he's been aloyal vice president, and he deserved better than he got last Wednesday.MACCALLUM:  Your thoughts on the voters who we spoke with. We had spoken toboth of them over the course of the campaign, kind of touching base withthem about what they thought. What did you think about what they had to saytonight?ROVE:  A lot of good common sense there. And they reminded me a lot of myfriends who are Trump supporters, not very political, some of them and thatthey liked what he did but they were clear about who he was and how hesometimes took actions that they didn't like.But I thought a lot of good common sense there. Jolene, I thought wasabsolutely right. The president would have been and well advised to go tothe inaugural but having announced that he is not going to go. Now it'sbetter that he not flip and turn around, but that she wished he had.I thought Christopher was right on target when he lamented how thepresident's words and actions had overshadowed his accomplishments. And Ithought there was a lot of good common sense there. You know 75 millionpeople, me among them voted for the president in November. And you know, hehas done a lot but there's been a -- particularly this last week,problematic.MACCALLUM:  Karl Rove, always good to see you. Thank you very much, Karl,for being here tonight.ROVE:  You bet, thank you.MACCALLUM:  See you soon.
