SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And welcome to "Hannity." 
We start with major breaking news. Right now, we hear talk there may be a vote in the House of Representatives to end the Mueller witch hunt. We'll have more in a moment.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The hypocrisy on the left also has gone way over the top, over the boiling point. And with the midterms right around the corner, you have Democrats and, of course, their willing accomplices in the mainstream media, they're now trying to use illegal immigration to divide America. By the way, very predictable.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And meanwhile, the president is trying to fix our broken system and doing their job and undoing their mess. Democrats offered no solutions, no compromise, no cooperation. And their friends in the media they're cheering them on every step of the way.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In moments, we will uncover the deception that is arising from the American left. Their rhetoric is absolutely disgusting tonight. 
And plus, we have the First Lady Melania Trump making a surprise visit to the border in the facilities in Texas today. We're going to bring you her remarks and we'll also show you how absolutely apoplectic and insane the media is here, attacking her. And by the way, it's over a wardrobe choice. It's insane.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And tonight, we also have more fallout from the I.G. report that the media ignores, including new evidence that reveals some of the absolutely dirty tactics used against the Trump campaign and the biggest abuse of power. And the media is ignoring it all. 
And also, we have the latest from the ongoing obstruction that is at the DOJ. There is a fight abrewing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it's a sad day here at Fox News Channel. As we just mentioned, the brilliant Charles Krauthammer, he did pass away at the age of 68. A huge loss for the Fox News family. We'll have more on his life, his legacy and his profile in courage that was his life.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we are first calling out political bias, by the way, and holding our government accountable. That is the breaking news opening monologue.

HANNITY: All right. Just hours ago, the First Lady Melania Trump made a surprise trip to Texas where she visited a DHS-sponsored shelter serving as a temporary home to children that are detained at the border. Take a look.

MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: We all know they are having -- they're here without their families. And I want to thank you for your hard work, your compassion and your kindness you are giving them in this difficult time. I'm here to learn about your facility, and which I know you have children on a long-term basis. And I also like to ask you how I can help to these children to reunite with their families as quickly as possible.

        }
      
HANNITY: Now, the first lady's trip was important. Those remarks were important without a doubt. The first lady, she is doing a great job, and by the way, is offering so much needed compassion. As I said from the beginning, nobody wants children and parents to be separated. Neither did Donald Trump. He solved Congress' mess.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
But, of course, the media can only focus on one thing. What Melania was wearing while boarding literally the plane to Texas. With a jacket with the words on the back that read "I really don't care. Do you?" 
Yahoo wrote: Melania Trump wears a jacket to Texas with a pointed message. "I really don't care, do you?"

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Vanity Fair headlined: Did Melania Trump just undercut her border visit with a very poorly chosen jacket? Her visit to a migrant children shelter she cared. Well, her jacket seemed to say otherwise. 
And you got CNN editor at large, Melania's "I really don't care, do you" jacket was not mistake.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Vogue writing: Melania Trump one ups her hurricane stilettos with a really don't care jacket worn visiting children at the border.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And just take a look at how fake news CNN, which barely bothered to cover the president's rally last night, and the conspiracy TV MSNBC did not cover at all, look how they cover the jacket.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was impossible to think that that is aimed at the people she just saw. It's more I think likely just because we're -- this is what we do with the first lady when she wears these things, maybe the person who she is married to.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This one is not. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This one is not. You have a great story today of the first lady going down showing compassion for these children and yet you have this jacket.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a picture of Melania Trump boarding Air Force One to head to McAllen, Texas, to visit some of the children held in the detention center. She is wearing a green jacket. We believe it came from the clothing store Zara. On the back, it's written in white "I really don't care. Do you?" She is a model. I mean, she sort of knows the power of clothes.

HANNITY: Now, the director of communications for the first lady, Stephanie Graham, responded earlier today and tweeted out, quote: Today's visit with children in Texas impacted the FLOTUS greatly. If the media would spend their time and energy on her actions and efforts to help the kids rather than speculate and focus on her wardrobe, well, we could get so much accomplished on behalf of kids. Followed by #shecares and #itsjustajacket. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Even President Trump, he did weigh in. This tells a lot. "I really don't care, do you" written on the back of Melania's jacket refers to the fake news media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares. 
By the way, good for her. Why should she trust them? And it's pretty unbelievable. Now, the surprise trip took place less than 24 hours after the President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively preventing the separation of families and children who cross our borders illegally.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In doing so, what did he do? He bailed out the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress who by the way this is their mess. This is their law, not his. And the people that have failed to act on the issue.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No one wants children separated from parents. The president has been saying it day one. This action now literally, literally transcends these stupid laws that are on the books, passed by Congress, signed into law by a previous president. 
This is not a permanent solution. In fact, it's not going to hold up in the court system. The real answer, the real long-term solution, the real answer, if you care, the correct answer, the constitutional is Congress to do their job. Pass a bill. Send it to the White House. 
And despite all of this, President Trump was literally demonized for days in the media for Congress' law, before the executive action. Not see comparisons, slavery comparisons. Basically the mainstream media, what they do worst be? Themselves.

We should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand against the giant blank she is married to. Ninety million people in the streets on the same weekend in country, F.
Peter Fonda, OK, tried to issue a tepid apology. Melania Trump, she had to contact the Secret Service because her 12-year-old son is threatened. Beyond vile, beyond disgusting. You can't imagine it. 
And, by the way, Fonda wasn't the only repugnant person on the left to go after a Trump child. Look at this Canadian TV writer attacking Don Jr.'s 4-year-old on Twitter, saying, quote: We're coming for you.

Now, despite all this vile, all this hatred, all this insanity, the president is still ready, willing and able, and eager actually to address what is Congress' broken immigration system. It's not his system. It's not his laws. 
He wants to work with the Republicans and the Democrats alike. He wants to solve the problem. He is willing to give on DACA. He's wiling to give on separation of kids. He's already tried to clean up their mess -- by the way, caused by Obama and Clinton because they never did their jobs. 
And just months away from the midterms -- what is this? Democrats would rather use the issue to divide you the American people, raise money and win votes. By the way, it's a typical election year for them. It's all political.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My administration is also acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the southern border. Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremists, open border Democrats. 
And that's what they are. They are extremists open border Democrats. If you look at Nancy Pelosi, you look at Chuck Schumer, you'll see tapes where they wanted to have borders. They needed borders for security. 
Just a short while ago, a number of years ago, I see Chuck Schumer: we must have borders. Hillary Clinton: we must have borders. If people penetrate our borders we must get them out of the country.

They want to kill your children, throw granny over the cliff and they want dirty air and dirty water and to poison the air and water. You hear it every two and four years. 
And, by the way, the president is right. But you don't have to take their word for it. Despite him fixing their problem, signing the executive order to keep families together, despite working with the DHS to make sure that children are reunited with the parents -- despite all of that outrage over the Trump administration enforcing Congress law that been on the books for years and that Obama never fixed. By the way, Obama did the same thing. We have shown you the pictures. We'll go back to that in a minute. Democrats, even though he does what they want, they are still playing politics.

Instead of fixing America's problems, instead of really helping people and solving problems and helping immigrants, Democrats would rather demagogue, win a midterm election and impose a horrible agenda on the American people -- which includes, by the way, four points. 
One, they're not going to tell you. They told people like Maxine Waters don't say it. Don't say it. But we're going to do it. Impeach President Trump. 
Number two, they want to keep Obamacare. Do you like your doctor? Do you like your cares? Do you like your hospitals? Oh, that's right, forget that. And you pay less. 
Number three, they want, Nancy Pelosi said she wants her crumbs back. Remember she said the tax cuts were crumbs? She wants them back. 
And number four, they're open borders as you can see. 
Now, the Democrats, by the way, they're not acting alone. Their greatest ally is the mainstream media. They are basically the press office for the Democratic Party and they are backing them up every step of the way. 
Just look at how abusively, insanely bias your press is as they cover President Trump after he did what Obama never did. He solved the problem, solved -- signed an executive order that probably isn't going to hold muster in any courtroom. Take a look.

Those images -- they're children in cages. No parents in sight. Sleeping on the floor. Wrapped in foil blankets. 
Oh, those are under Obama's reign. Oh my gosh!
So, where was Tim Kaine, Nancy Pelosi, the liberal media, where was the outrage then? Where was the outrage when Obama enacted a policy where immigrant children were held for months without their moms and dads as punishment for their border crossing? Where was the outrage when the family of immigrant detainees sued President Obama for wrongful death? Where was the outrage following a report that minor illegal, immigrant detainees were brutally abused, beaten under the Obama administration? 
Remember, it was Obama who prosecuted nearly a half a million illegal immigrants. It was Obama who said he must follow the laws on the books and that he had no other choice but to deport illegal immigrants. And as a matter of fact, he was just doing what other presidents did, even if the consequences were severe, Obama said. 
He said it over and over again. He doesn't make the laws. It's just his job as president to enforce them. 
Well, let's go to videotape. A "Hannity" history lesson.

OBAMA: There are those in the immigrants rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are illegally with legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books. But I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. 
When I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works.
Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you, not just -- not just on immigration reform. But that's not how -- that's not how our system works.
I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The hypocrisy, the double standard is just unbelievable. As I said earlier, this is all politics. It's now the political season. We get it every two and four years. We'll have more on that in a few moments. 
First, we do have some breaking developments surrounding the deep state. Well, anti-Trump FBI love bird Peter Strzok, who was the lead prosecutor both to Hillary Clinton server investigation and the Trump-Russia witch hunt has now reportedly finally lost his security clearance. Now, of course, Strzok is just one of five high-ranking anti-Trump FBI employees who were referred for investigation by the inspector general. Now, we know that three of the five abusively biased individuals for Trump, those who loved Hillary and worked on both investigations. 
And, by the way, they include Strzok, they include Page and an FBI lawyer which was outed by Chairman Meadows named Kevin Clinesmith. By the way, Clinesmith was initially working as a primary attorney in the Russia investigation. But, of course, he was removed in February because his bias was revealed. 
What about the rest of the Mueller team? 
Tonight, the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows is sounding an alarm that possible witness statements may have been altered, what is known as 302s, by some of these bias investigators in order to clear or charge a suspect. That's a big problem. 
Now, Meadows is also warning that the subpoenas are, quote, forthcoming in days. Sara Carter, who will join us, now reporting this revelation could very likely apply to the prosecution of the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We'll talk to her shortly. 
Of course, we could get to the bottom of all the corruption going on in Obama's Justice Department and the FBI if DOJ would stop obstructing. 
Byron York now asking the important question: why did it take so long for Strzok's infamous anti-Trump texts to be released? Tonight, we're asking the same question. So, Mr. Rosenstein, what's going on? 
And let me be clear. The threat of impeachment for Rosenstein is very real. 
And look at this headline. Obama's cyber chief confirms stand-down order against Russian cyber attacks. As I said before, we are only scratching the surface. This deep state is more corrupt and this is more abuse of power than we have ever known. It's really, really dangerous. 
When we come back, the media insanity. Joe Concha and Judge Pirro, with my opening monologue. The great one, Mark Levin, coming up. I've got a lot more to say, too.

Thank you, guys. You are doing an amazing job. 
Here with reaction to our more, from "The Hill," Joe Concha, author of "Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." You know her as the host, the one of "Justice" Judge Jeanine Pirro. 
I really -- if you let me, I'm going to go on another hour because I'm so angry at how absolutely vicious these people are. 
JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: You know, I have to tell you, Sean. I really am frightened. I think that what has happened in the last month -- 
HANNITY: You know what Rush said? Somebody is going to get killed. 
PIRRO: There's no question about it. Look, the president did what he thought was right. This is a man two loves his family. All right? He didn't want families separated. As soon as he did it, now it's an internment camp. 
Wait a minute. The only people responsible for the separation of the parents and the children that the president has resolved now are the people who bring their children over or send their children over unaccompanied. 
But the left is not willing to give them any credit for anything. And what that means is they will continue to pound against him until someone gets hurt. 
HANNITY: You know, it's amazing, Joe, that it took Donald Trump to fix Congress' battle. I'm going to scroll pictures as you are talking here. These are all images when Barack Obama was president. Kids in cages. Kids separated. You know, 500,000 illegals prosecuted. We'll roll the pictures.
But you know what, I've never seen. Now there were also nobody in the media talks about going after a 12-year-old kid, they don't talk about going after a 4-year-old girl? And the things they say about the first lady and Ivanka? It's frankly, it's beyond disgusting. 
JOE CONCHA, REPORTER AND COLUMNIST, THE HILL: Yes. I'll tackle at least what was said about the first lady today in regard to her jacket. You have to go back in time, right. Not too long ago, 2017. Hurricane Harvey she wears stilettos going to the plane that's going to take her to Texas where she changes into sneakers. And she is mocked for that for being elitist and out of touch. 
This is a first lady who had kidney surgery and takes a couple of weeks to recover. She is seen in the West Wing by two reporters and yet conspiracy theories are thrown out about her whereabouts.
David Frum, a conservative actually even recklessly speculates she is the victim of spousal abuse. This is the first lady that speaks five languages. 
HANNITY: CNN fake news.
CONCHA: And a fraction of people on the planet can do that and she is mocked by an ABC host. Here's the good news though, if you are a Trump supporter, this will backfire. Because Melania Trump's poll numbers are higher than almost every politician in Washington, and definitely higher than the media that covers her. It's never a good idea to attack a first lady especially as this one as we've seen. 
HANNITY: Let me go to Judge Pirro, all right. So, where is Nancy? Where is, no, I'm serious. Nancy Pelosi. Where is Hillary? Where is Elizabeth Warren? I thought we were living in Me Too era, do we need a conservative Me Too movement if you are a conservative woman? 
PIRRO: If you're a conservative woman you are not entitled to the benefit of the doubt. You are not entitled to equal rights. You're not entitled to respect. If you're a conservative woman you don't have free speech. You can't speak on a campus and we're going to criticize everything you say and do. 
HANNITY: What they say about Ivanka? 
PIRRO: This is horrible what they say about her. This woman who spent her professional life trying to empower other women. And it's women who are trying to take her down. 
Here's the good news, Sean. The good news is that the American public is smarter than these people and they are infuriated with the fact that this president is doing everything he can and he gets up every day to try to make our lives better. And they want to destroy it. And the texts about put your son in a cage with a pedophile, that is the most outrageous thing I have heard in years. 
HANNITY: You are a lawyer. Isn't that a terroristic threat? 
PIRRO: It absolutely is. 
HANNITY: Is that a threat against the first family? 
PIRRO: It is a threat against the first family. And if it happened to a different first family, Barack Obama, the secret service would be there in a minute and people would be charged. 
HANNITY: The media is ignoring it all. 
PIRRO: Of course.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: It's like they ignoring the I.G. report, they're ignoring the economic success. 
PIRRO: And by the way, what haven't you heard of? Russia? 
HANNITY: Yes.
PIRRO: That's what this is about. 
HANNITY: Last word, Joe. 
CONCHA: I just want to say a few words about Charles Krauthammer, Sean. I know you are going to tackle it later in the show. He was the best political commentator in political TV history in my opinion. A Pulitzer winning columnist. And I'll leave you with this quote and I think it's so Charles Krauthammer. 
He said this. "Whenever you're faced with an explanation of what's going on in Washington, the choice between incompetence and conspiracy, always choose incompetence." A biting, self-deprecating wit and he will be missed certainly. 
PIRRO: Always.
HANNITY: An intellectual power. As you know, it's interesting. I'm going to show a clip, I chose it myself and I thought about it deeply. And it's Charles mocked me mercilessly. Because I didn't know he had been in a wheelchair. His whole life was a profile in courage. I'm going to show the clip. Because it just became a bond between us tonight throughout the years. 
Good to see you both. 
PIRRO: Good to see you.
HANNITY: And when we come back, the great one. Buckle up. Mark Levin next, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So much news going on today. Here to join us he is the host of CRTV's Levin TV, number one show on Sunday night at 10 Eastern right here on the Fox News Channel. It's Life, Liberty and Levin. Thank me. God bless us. I call him the great one. 
You know, Mark, we talk privately a lot. We're friends. And you know what, sometimes we get pretty heated. 
MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. 
HANNITY: I am literally boiling over the immigration lie, the outright hypocrisy.
LEVIN: Right.
HANNITY: The treatment of a 12-year-old kid and a 4-year-old little girl and our first lady. And the double standard is so despicable. And there is law involved here. 
LEVIN: Right.
HANNITY: And Obama was the one that said he is not an emperor, he's the president. He is compelled to enforce Congress' bad laws. 
LEVIN: I never thought I'd say this, Sean, but where is Stormy Daniels and her slip-and-fall lawyer when we need them? You know, the Democrats like to talk about Japanese internment camps I notice. They know a lot about Japanese internment camps, the Democrats, since they set them up. Franklin Roosevelt set them up. The Democrat Congress funded them. 
The FDR and the Supreme Court in the Korematsu decision upheld them. And then they took 120,000 Japanese Americans and Americans of Japanese decent and forcibly removed them from their homes and put them in these Japanese internment camps.
So the Democrats know a lot about them. They also know a lot about our current detention policies and facilities since they've been funding them for the last 30 years. They've existed eight years under Bill Clinton, eight years under George W. Bush, eight years under Obama. 
Then the Clinton administration entered in a consent decree with a liberal overseeing at all that required the release of minors coming across the border illegally and dragged here in many cases by adults. 
In 1997, it requires the release of them in 20 days. So, this administration says we have got to enforce our laws. We have too many illegal aliens coming in. So they separate the adults from the kids. Just like we do when we send American adults to prison, we don't send the little toddlers with them. 
So Donald Trump is now Hitler. So Donald Trump says well, let's unite the families. Well, he is uniting the families and he is still Hitler. Now they are saying well the only answer is -- and they are doing that, Sean, for one simple reason. 
They believe in open borders, they want all those people released. They don't want to deport them. They do not want to send them home. These are not human rights advocates from the left. They are leftist who seek power at all costs. 
Now if these Democrats really cared about little kids and little babies and so forth, why are they so hard core on partial birth abortion? Have you ever seen those pictures of partial birth abortion? Why do they want to fund the Planned Parenthood outfit? More and more money into that organization. 
Remember those undercover videos where they are selling babies' organs and body parts? I believe those are babies. And I believe that reminds me I might say of the Third Reich. But they support those organizations and they call partial birth abortion right up to one second before the birth, they call that a choice and a right. They are not fooling anybody. 
And by the way, where have the media been in the last 30 years? Where's Jake Tapper been? Other than handgun inc, handgun control inc, and a press secretary to a left wing member of Congress. All the stuff going on before Trump ever thought about running for president. All the Nazi concentration camps and Democrat Japanese internment camps. 
Somehow CNN missed them and MSNBC missed them and the New York Times and the Washington Post missed them. 
Let me tell you something. The American people aren't fooled by this crap. This is the latest baloney that they're throwing at this president. And this president is trying to get his managed. 
I have a simple solution. Secure the border but the Democrats won't secure the border. That way we get fewer little kids coming across and they can stay home in their nirvana in their country that they are from, which we know is a magnificent culture because Dick Durbin told us. They are coming from magnificent cultures. 
So let's secure the border and then we don't have to have Democrats style Japanese internment camps. The families can stay together and the families can live together. 
HANNITY: You know it really can be simple. You know what, Mark? If they cared about the separation issue, if they really cared about the DACA kids, well, convince me that I'm wrong, they could actually fix it in a day. You know, God forbid they do their job. 
Great one, thank you. Don't forget, don't miss it. 
LEVIN: God bless.
HANNITY: Mark's show. And by the way, I'm going to be a guest very soon on it. We'll give you the date. Life, Liberty and Levin. Number one show on cable, Sunday night right here on Fox. 
Coming up, Sara Carter and Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Later, also, the sad day here at the Fox News Channel and our Fox family. Charles Krauthammer died at the age of 68. Stay with us. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: What we are continuing to find, Buck, is this. Additional information from DOJ and FBI that has literally been hidden from Congress' oversight role for nine months. 
And so we are at the point where the frustration has reached the level that we've got to deal with it. So, you know, issuing subpoenas to compel people to come in and testify. Some of them who really I think want to testify, want to make sure that we clean this up will be actually forthcoming in days where we will get them to come in. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows promising subpoenas. Yes, they'll be forthcoming. Why? To compel individuals to testify over their involvement in the probe into the Russian election interference. 
Here with reaction, author of "Why We Fight: Recovering America's Will to Win" Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, this is your story about the fight and what has now, appears now to be contempt of Congress followed by an impeachment at least being filed against Rod Rosenstein. Are they going to do it? Because threats aren't going to work anymore. 
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Threats aren't going to work anymore. And they need to take this seriously. They have said over and over again, Sean, both Meadows, Jordan, and others that they are going to take this to the floor and they are going to file those impeachment papers. 
But remember, Rod Rosenstein is willing to go forward with this fight. And he is going to try to fight them all the way to the end. So they have got to be very serious about this. 
HANNITY: He wants them to sue. Congress should not sue because it's sort of like, you know, fast and furious, it's going to get lost in the court system and Rosenstein knows it. So they should do what they do to you and Dr. Gorka and me. And that's hold them in contempt. Maybe put them in, you know, a jail cell for 10 days. To make him, let's see. 
They are going to put the screws to him like they do to Manafort who is now in solitaire like he is a mob killer and then maybe he'll sing so they can then, quote, "either impeach or prosecute Trump." Maybe we should use the same tactic against Rosenstein that Mueller is using against the other people. 
CARTER: That he would use against any American that was withholding information from the FBI. But I don't know if that's going to happen. he need -- they need to have enough members of Congress really backing this and really pushing this forward. And this is why the subpoenas are so important. Why it's so important to get those FBI, those people in the bureau and those people in the DOJ who want to talk to come out and tell the American public the truth about what went on. 
HANNITY: My sources tell me there were at least four criminal referrals here. Probably more. And that the person in the most trouble tonight that doesn't know it is actually James Comey. Dr. Gorka? 
SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Well, it's very, very interesting. Remember Rod Rosenstein is very, very close friends with Comey, with Mueller, with all these individuals. This is a man who called congressional oversight over the Department of Justice extortion. This individual is a swamp dweller. This individual is all about the survival of himself. And the Obama cronies that was staffed into the DOJ.
This individual is now a rogue agent inside the DOJ and Congress should start to exercise its fully mandated oversight powers. 
HANNITY: The fact that Rod Rosenstein, Sara, thinks that he and one of his little, apparently well known temper tantrums. Apparently he's got a vicious violent temper. People that have seen it have told me. Threatens Congress with, we're going to use the power of the DOJ and we're going to subpoena your e-mails and we're going to go after you. If that's not abuse of power, I don't know what is. Why is he still there? 
CARTER: Well, you're right. And he not -- he doesn't just threaten members of Congress. These are people who can handle it and can punch back and can fight back. He threatens the investigators. The people that are behind the scenes, the people that are actually doing the investigations. The ones that he does not want to have access to these documents. He has done it to a number of them. Some of them have been publicly named in stories. And it's really--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Well, are they now going to subpoena your e-mails? Are they going to bang on my door? As Rod Rosenstein doesn't like what we say, he doesn't like that Congress is doing their constitutional duties so now he is going to threaten them? Well, what's next? Are we going to be a country anymore or are we going to a constitutional republic anymore? Dr. Gorka? 
GORKA: Rod Rosenstein has facilitated the subversion and the sabotaging of rule of law in the United States. 
HANNITY: He is a bully. 
GORKA: If he doesn't stop -- yes. He is--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: He is trying to bully Congress from doing their job. 
GORKA: But worse than that, worse than being a bully -- there are lots of bullies out there. We now know thanks to the I.G. report and thanks to the work of Sara of you, that the Department of Justice is a political entity that Obama turned it into a political police force and the FBI followed suit. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: It's like a super police. 
GORKA: That has to be fixed. 
HANNITY: You're right. Let me ask Sara.
GORKA: Rosenstein is part of the problem. 
HANNITY: Is Congress going to vote up or down to end this witch hunt? Because that is now making its way through Congress. Because I think they need to do it like yesterday. 
CARTER: I agree with you, Sean. And I think now that we know that at least three, three of the people that were on Mueller's special counsel were removed for extraordinary bias, you know, Clinesmith who was named by Meadows apparently was just removed in February. We know Peter Strozk was extraordinarily biased and right now Horowitz is actually investigating his role in the Russia investigation. 
HANNITY: In other words, it was legitimate -- illegitimate from day one. 
CARTER: Yes. And fruit from the poisonous tree, Sean. I mean, this is what--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Well said. 
CARTER: -- attorneys look at, at all times. 
HANNITY: We got to roll. 
CARTER: So there needs to be something done. 
HANNITY: Thank you, both. A very sad day here at the Fox News channel. Up next we're going to remember the life, the profile in courage, the legacy of our friend and colleague the brilliant Charles Krauthammer.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Sad day today for our Fox News family and frankly, the country, because he was such a patriot. Our colleague, our friend, the brilliant Charles Krauthammer he passed away today at the age of 68, a frequent guest on this program over the years. 
I actually picked this cut because it became, for him, a way for him to constantly make fun of me and it was a real kind of special moment between us I want to share with you. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: By the way, I love the fact that you gave a speech one day and you told a story about me and all the years that we have known each other. Go ahead. You can mock me on national TV. 
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FORMER SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't mock you. You know I'm always surprised that you are upset by that. 
HANNITY: I am.
KRAUTHAMMER: I think it's the most charming story. As you know, I told you again on a special that Bret Baier did, he prompted me, he was sort of the provocateur there. I said, you know Sean doesn't really like it but it's a wonderful story. It just shows. I mean, I like it because it shows how, you know, I haven't made this fact that I'm in a wheelchair sort of the center of my life and the fact that you weren't even aware of it I thought was lovely. So, it was a way to compliment you. 
HANNITY: No, listen. It's a friendly story that we have between the two of us.
KRAUTHAMMER: Yes.
HANNITY: And you know, but the story is really inspiring. The special was fantastic, by the way, and it reminds all of us I think we have problems sometimes that people are -- everybody has problems and some people are struggling with some really incredible things and your ability to overcome, I found inspiring. So thank you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: His whole life was a profile in courage. His whole life. I mean, he had a brilliant intellect. He was a patriot. He loved this country. And he fought hard to make this a better country. We are going to miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Robyn, and his son Daniel tonight.
Tomorrow night, instead of this program, the hour goes to Charles. A special program. Charles Krauthammer, his words. You'll see him in a very special light. The man we all love and knew.
That's all for us tonight. Laura Ingraham takes it away. Laura?
