Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Do you ever shoot first and then investigate? Well, regrettably I did that to Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. I did it in an "Off the Record" right here. I didn't like his outburst after the NFC game.

RICHARD SHERMAN, CORNERBACK, SEATTLE SEAHAWKS: Well, I'm the best one in the game. When you find me with a receiver like Crabtree! That's the result you are going to get. Don't you ever talk about me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ANDREWS: Who was talking about you?
SHERMAN: Crabtree! Don't you open your mouth about the best? Stand up for you real quick. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });

        }

I thought Sherman showed to be a poor winner, but then I learned he tried to shake hands with 49ers Michael Crabtree, was refused. Then he got pushed in the head by Crabtree and yesterday, I learned more. What Sherman said to Crabtree before the Handshake? That was all caught on a hot mic.

SHERMAN: Hell of a game. Hell of a game.

In my "Off the Record," I said Sherman was a jerk. Then I heard from former NFL players Terrell Owens and Everson Walls and they gave me another perspective. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

TERRELL OWENS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Everyone knows and anybody who knows Richard Sherman like I do knows that Richard Sherman is a very classy guy. He just didn't have a very class moment at that time.
EVERSON WALLS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: And is he a young man that I think has been disrespected and really discounted, probably throughout his entire early life in sports? And this was his moment to really show the world just how good he was. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {

        }
      
They got me thinking and then someone emailed me this picture this morning pointing out that Richard Sherman has been called a thug, even though he graduated from Stanford with a 3.9 grade point average, has no criminal record and called himself the best at what he does professionally, albeit with a rough delivery. That night and TV appearance was not his finest moment.
Meanwhile, Justin Bieber is called by many a "misguided kid" after being arrested for allegedly driving drunk, spitting on fans and disrespecting former President Bill Clinton. Bieber is the thug. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, I hope Richard Sherman accepts this apology. I see that actually I was the hot head, the jerk, I accused him of being. By the way, as for the NFL fine of Sherman for the other gesture, the choking gesture to the 49ers quarterback. we can talk about that on Monday. I have an opinion about that one, too.
