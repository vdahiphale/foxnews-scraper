GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi, I am Greg Gutfeld, with Dagen McDowell,Jessica Tarlov, Jesse Watters, and she captains a gravy boat, Dana Perino,THE FIVE. Hear that gurgling noise like something sucking on a pacifier?That is the media on hearing Joe's cabinet choices.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  These are all so serious, qualified individuals.UNKNOWN:  And it's not going to be political.UNKNOWN:  They are not political. This is about the least flashy team youcould possibly get. They are deeply experienced. They are humble, and theyare lifelong public servants.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Oh, my God. Yellen, Kerry, Blinken, all baby food fora colicky media. Add Warren and Sanders and they would be in a coma. SoTrump broke the mold and Joe's team thinks this is how you piece it allback together, although they have no idea what to fix because what theycall damage was progress, prosperity, peace, yeah, that sucks.First, there is Kerry, what morticians call the discount special. There isa deadly terror attack in Paris, he sends James Taylor.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  Just close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be thereto brighten up even your darkest night(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Yeah, they wanted that. He also said there would beriots if the U.S. embassy moved to Jerusalem. He was wrong. He said therewould be no peace with the Arab world without the Palestinian process.Wrong again. Jared Kushner, a mere novice, ran circles around Lurch. Bidenmade him climate czar because he mistook him for a tree.Then there is Blinken, my favorite reindeer. Like Kerry, he whiffed onMiddle East peace, but adds Syria, ISIS, Iran, and Libya, the guy has beenwrong on so many things it is better just to list what he is right on. Butthese aren't gifts for you, but presents to the media. An elite staff meanselite access so the press once again feel superior over you.And they are also boring, which the press mistakes as confident. The worstpart about war is that it's boringly efficient in filling up body bags.Something Trump avoided, but that won't happen again. But many things won'thappen again because they came from an outsider. Think about it, becausethe media won't. It's not their strong suit, 4,000 black men freed fromprison.That is faster than Harris could arrest them. Removing the North Koreathreat then stacking up Middle East peace deals, boosting the lowestearners pay and household income. Don't even start Yellen for that,ushering in vaccines faster than thought possible. Orange Godzilla did allof this while undermining hated by the establishment.No wonder they now seek refuge in the warm swamp of Joe's mediocrity. Theyare wimps. All right, Jesse, why does the media prefer this mob?JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, ideologically, they do it. But it'snot going to get clicks. It's not not going to get book deals. It's notgoing to get them on television. It's going to be boring, because they'renot going to be able to report on personality. They're going to have toreport on policy.GUTFELD:  Which they won't.WATTERS:  Which they won't. And they'll probably report more on Trumptweeting from the golf course then they will on Biden doing whatever thehell Biden is doing. But there was a method to Trump's madness. It gotresults. And that was not normal. In Washington, actual results, and themedia hated him. And the establishment did because he didn't respect theestablishment.He didn't listen to the establishment. He came in and did everything theestablishment had been promising for decades, and he did it faster andbetter than they ever could. Now, he has kind of destroyed the mystique ofthe swamp. You come in. You turbocharge the economy. You end wars. You winwars. You cut piece deals and trade deals. And you do it with a bigspectacle with everybody watching.And he didn't ask for any of their help. And all of the chaos and(Inaudible) that we saw the last four years was just Trump trying to changethings and the media fighting against him to make those changes, becausethey don't want a businessman who was an outsider to come in and actuallyget things done, because that is the job of the insiders. And once thathappened, the game was up.They should be thanking him on foreign policy. This is like the mostpeaceful world we've had since '92. I mean, the last time the North Koreansfired off an intercontinental ballistic missile, three and a half yearsago. The last time they tested a nuclear device, three years ago. You havepeace deals. You have China confronted. Now, they're reeling.No one respects them anymore after the way they handled the COVID crisis.And Jake Sullivan, the incoming national security adviser, said today thebiggest threat they face now is climate change and income inequality. Ican't wait to see how the Marines are going to tackle those.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Send in the SEALS.WATTERS:  Send in the SEALS.GUTFELD:  Yes. Dana, what does this feel like to you?PERINO:  It feels like the third Obama term.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  Well done.PERINO:  So if you think like four years ago, Donald Trump was the antidoteto Obama. People want change and then four years later, OK, wait, actuallymaybe not. But I think the one thing that is super interesting, not onlyare these people all confirmable by the Senate because they have alreadybeen confirmed by the Senate so I think they will try to do that.Make that easy. But you know, Biden also likes these people. He truststhem.  They've been around him forever. So I can see that, and I canrespect that, and I would want my friends around me, too. But who is goingto challenge your thinking?GUTFELD:  Yeah.PERINO:  A team of rivals, you know, that is always a good thing. You thinkabout Betsy Devos. Outside the box pick, right, and that was a hard fought,not confirmation process. And she still deals with that to this day. Ithink anybody on that list right there, they probably just waltz right in.The curious thing will be why does Biden not want to make his own mark.Why would you want to have just Obama's mark? Because -- Jessica can talkabout this. Apparently, a lot of the Bide people are very frustrated thatall of a sudden, parachuting in to help build out the administration is theObama people. And some of the Biden folks are saying, where were you? Youdidn't help us at all try to win this nomination fight. And now you wantall these jobs?GUTFELD:  I feel a three day story with this topic.PERINO:  Thank you.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  And may be Monday if we are lucky. We could squeeze this invasionof the Obama people, Jessica, to you.JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS HOST:  They are the Obama/Biden people. But I willsay this. This is exactly, to Dana's point, what happened in 08, that a lotof Obama people who were with him from the beginning and had worked withhim from Chicago onwards were annoyed that suddenly it was the Hillaryadministration and it took so many Clintonites in there.And this does trace back to the first Clinton, to Bill Clinton. That iswhere (Inaudible) comes from. But I would say to the team of rivals,remember (Inaudible) was actually quite outspokenly against Biden. They hadconflicts. And him picking him for chief of staff and actually letting himbe the lead on their COVID response was seen as really representative ofthe fact that Joe Biden was interested in hearing people who had pushedback on him in the past.PERINO:  I didn't realize that.TARLOV:  But the truth of the matter is these are all confirmable people,and Joe Biden is making good on his promise to pick moderate people thatare just public servants to get things done and will make this easy. Wewill see what the rest of the picks are, though. But to Jesse's point aboutthis is just so much better world.We do know that Iran has been ramping up their nuclear capabilities sincewe got rid of (AUDIO GAP) -- (CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  -- and the Saudis are coming together in terms of a deal. I thinkIran has never been weaker than they have been in the last 20 years.TARLOV:  You can say that, but that doesn't make it true.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  -- Jessica.(CROSSTALK)TARLOV:  You ate my time. I will get you back.GUTFELD:  Dagen, OK, we're just basically going back to the way thingswere. It's kind of sad. I mean, that is what this is. We're just going to -- we're going -- they are actually not even hiding it.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  And are we going to seed our power as theworld's biggest energy producer, because that is how you take power awayfrom Iran. We are at the swing producer. We controls prices. We controlsupplies. And that is how you stick it to the nations that hate us. We'regoing to get John Kerry genuflecting in front of China, another nation thatus?And basically handing -- oh, I will cut your emissions. Start doing it in10 years, while we basically raise energy prices for hardworking men andwomen here. I'm very excited, though, to sit back and watch the press corpsyear after year plumb the depths of embarrassment, and humiliate themselvesin public self-flagellation just to curry favor with these people in thisadministration.Oh, can I give any cabinet member a pedicure just to get invited to thefirst state dinner, because that will fill up my empty soul.PERINO:  Wow, you are awesome when you've been awake since 3:00 a.m.MCDOWELL:  I worked with a lot of these members in the press, and I like tosee them embarrass themselves. It brings me great joy.GUTFELD:  It does bring me great joy, too. All right, President Trumpalready the frontrunner in 2024, who came up with that idea?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS:  I can hear the heads exploding already. A majority of Republicanssay they want President Trump to run again in 2024. That is according to anew poll that finds 54 percent of GOP voters want to see Trump stage thepolitical comeback of a lifetime. And in the meantime, the president givinghis blessings to the Biden transition process, while still vowing to keepup his legal fight.Quote, "remember the GSA has been terrific, and Emily Murphy has done agreat job, but the GSA does not determine who the next president of theUnited States will be." Here is more from the president today.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The Dow Jones industrialaverage just broke for the first time in history, 30,000. It is now -- thatis good. It's great for jobs and it's good for everything. With thevaccines now coming out one after another, it is an incredible thing thathappened. The greatest medical achievement that this planet has ever seen.(END VIDEO TAPE)WATTERS (on camera):  So you are pretty confident he runs again.GUTFELD:  Absolutely. By the way, an overwhelming percentage of Republicansdo not buy this election when you ask and they think it's if fraudulent.But 30 percent of Republicans feel the same way. Democrats feel the sameway about it. They think that Joe Biden stole the election.WATTERS:  And they are OK with it.GUTFELD:  And it makes me sick. Anyway, but to this point, 2024, this isthe sequel, right? And for  sequel, you need a break that is long enough tomake you miss the first four years, right? So you get the first -- you havethe excitement of the first movie, Trump 2020, and then you yearn for  parttwo, but you need that part in between where Joe Biden poops the bed.You know, he might even bring a new war in, high taxes. He might allowcrime and unemployment to soar, so Trump will end up cruising back into theWhite House fairly easily. This is why -- I know Trump that supporter's areupset about the outcome of the election and the media's hand in this. Butthis might end up being better than you might expect for one reason.If Trump had remained in 2020, the odds are there would have been a massivescandal to hobble him because that is what happens. The second term you hadWatergate, you had Monica Lewinsky, you had Iran contra. You had others --space on (ph). So how do you beat a second term? Two first terms.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  With a really boring admission in between. He's back, even thepress -- Jeff Zucker will say thank God he's back.WATTERS:  Dana, the press does love a rematch. And I think maybe if they docover Biden for four years or cover up for him, you know, they're going tobe itching to get Trump back in the ring and, you know, big collusion allover again.PERINO:  I think a lot of reporters long to be bored. Like, they didn'twant to wake up Sunday morning and go, oh, my gosh, here we go again. Theynever had a break. But I think that, you know, boredom, when that sets inafter a while, then you want something else. And I think that PresidentTrump, he will have a big platform. He'll have a lot of influence.The first influential seat, as I imagine him weighing in on  Georgia Senateraces. That would be kind of of the first test. But what this also does,however, is there are a lot of 2024 Republican hopefuls. And now, they areall playing freeze tag in Georgia, because they don't want to make a moveif they think they're going to make him mad. So that will stifle a lot ofRepublicans for a while.WATTERS:  You are right about that. What do you think the argument wouldbe? So let's just say the economy kind of wobbles around for the next fouryears. You know, Trump can come back and say, listen, I can get this thingback humming again like I did. I was the one that delivered the vaccines.That is a pretty strong argument if that plays out.TARLOV:  Absolutely. It make complete sense to me that you would see 50percent think that Trump would be the frontrunner in the second runner-upin so that would be Mike Pence.And that makes sense. That's who people havehad. And we can't forget the fact Joe Biden so far has won 6.5 million morevotes, but Trump got 10 million more votes than he did the time before.So there are plenty of people in the country who thought that the last fouryears were hunky-dory, or they didn't want a change from it. And I don'tknow what the next four years of normalcy under an Obama term will changetheir mind about that. But watching Republicans deal with the Trump legacy,like Dana said, will be the most fascinating part of it.Trump has already tweeted about Kelly Loeffler (Inaudible) off of onetweet. There are people who are saying they should write in Trump in theGeorgia Senate runoffs, which is obviously incredibly dangerous for thosecandidates on the ballot. And he will play kingmaker for the next fouryears, because people will continue to run in his legacy because it hasworked on ballot. It just didn't work at the top of the ticket.WATTERS:  And if Biden governs like a lot of people think he might, he caninvite a challenge, maybe a primary challenge that can weaken him and thenreally have President Trump come in and --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  It's my fantasy.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  How dare you insult his fantasy?WATTERS:  Bernie already said he'll think about if Biden doesn't --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  I wouldn't put it past, Bernie.MCDOWELL:  But we can -- the Biden administration over four years is justconstant criticism from the -- you know, getting shived in the back bypeople on the far left, like, that gaggle of young gals who are currentlyin Congress. The press is going to try and act like Trump is irrelevant.And by trying to act that way, they're going to continue to make himrelevant. The telltale sign today -- and by the way, Greg, you did callthis.GUTFELD:  Thank you.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  You know exactly how to butter him up.MCDOWELL:  Yes.WATTERS:  Everybody was talking about it. He just likes to claim credit.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  Even Trump was talking about it, remember, third term?WATTERS:  Exactly.MCDOWELL:  So it dawned on me today when he walked in the White House inthe briefing room, and he walked in front of the mic and went Dow 30,000vaccines. He didn't quite do that. But the biggest problem for theDemocrats will be about 74 million people who voted for Trump. The lastfour years, they were bigoted Nazi racists. It is going to get worse.Those 74 million people, you know, eat bowls of kittens for breakfast andhave g-ma and grandpa locked up in the cellar. That is the level ofloathing that you will hear on the left about Trump voters. So bring it onbecause it gives rise to Trump --(CROSSTALK) WATTERS:  Bring it on. Andrew Cuomo forced to cancel his Thanksgiving plansafter breaking his own rules, more on the backlash governors are receivingfor their COVID crackdowns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TARLOV:  Governors continue to face increased backlash as states ramp upCOVID restriction. Los Angeles County set to ban in-person dining for threeweeks starting tomorrow. Pennsylvania has banned bars and restaurants fromselling alcohol the night before Thanksgiving. And New York Governor AndrewCuomo canceling his Thanksgiving plans after heavy criticism he received,hours after saying his 89-year-old mom and daughters were coming to dinner.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  My plan was to be with my mother and two of my daughters. You canbe with your mother. A lot of people are going to be with their mother.Safe is you should be quarantined, removed from other people, and take atest. I'm not in a position to do that. Nobody said sit alone in your roomand lock the door.(END VIDEO TAPE)TARLOV (on camera):  Dagen, I want to start with you. We spoken about therestrictions and how difficult this is going to be through a holidayseason. What I'm curious to know from you is if you were a governor, whatwould the restrictions you out in place or the guidance be, realistically,knowing how serious the disease is but that people do have to get on withtheir lives?MCDOWELL:  It would be a lot more nuanced than this. And it would be -- Ithink Bill McGurn wrote about this. Use more persuasion than edict andmandate and order and finer-pointing, that that is part of what it takesbecause you look at Los Angeles County. I was looking at the infectionrates. So you are basically killing businesses by doing this.You're wiping out thousands of dollars in a small restaurant even that ifit puts up partitions to try to stay in business. So you shut them downanother three weeks other than then take out. They did tracing, casetracing out in Los Angeles County. Restaurants and bars accounted for 3.1percent of the total confirmed cases.This is recent data, 7.27 percent of those COVID cases were traced back togovernment agencies, including LA County entities like the registrar andthe fire department. So how do you explain that? And the restaurantlocations and bar locations where the cases were tracked back to wheremostly chains like Mickey D's and Panda Express and Subway.So you are going to crush a family-owned business for that. These governorsand mayors simply don't know what they are doing. They are pulling it outof their backsides. And the people have woken up to their complete idiocyand stupidity on this.GUTFELD:  Where do pandas come from, Dana?PERINO:  Panda zoo? I don't know the joke.GUTFELD:  China.PERINO:  Oh. (CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  I like pandas.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  But to Dagen's point, though, persuasion over edict. It onlybrings war. You know, the backbone of America -- is this kind of weird,genetic freedom. It's like it's in our blood. And you flip a switchwhenever you kind of get too close to that. Like, if you do -- persuasionis about, like, getting people to give up freedoms to help themselves.Edicts don't even pay attention to that, so you can't blame citizens. Youhave got to blame these politicians who basically just overreached. Andthat is what is creating, I think, more of these problems. We need nuanceand we need more persuasion, but it might be too late. Yesterday, we talkedabout the Oregon governor freaking telling people that to narc on their ownneighbors while you can just shoot an arrow on the street.But call the cops on your neighbors who want to see their families? Thatgovernor should be run out of town. Run out of town, I say.TARLOV:  Jesse, you want to get in here?WATTERS:  Well, I would say -- first of all, I want to live in GovernorMcDowell's state. That sounds like a great place to live. I'd do very wellif you were governor everywhere. Just pretend for a minuted that Cuomo is aRepublican, OK? Put an R next to his name. Now, a Republican has overseenthe highest death toll in the country.And in fact (Inaudible) -- Republican had no stockpiles for PPE orventilators. A Republican threatens a Democrat president if he ever went tothat state and refuses a vaccine. A Republican governor wrote a book duringthe pandemic and then he went on a publicity tour. A Republican governorwent maybe to his brother's show on Fox News and clowned around and thenbroke his Thanksgiving day guidelines.This guy would not get an Emmy. He'd get indicted. The fact that the mediacan look at a guy like this, whose performance has been atrocious and givehim good press, makes me think if you are a Democrat, it doesn't matter howyou perform.If you're a Democrat, you could perform horribly and get great press. Ifyou're Republican, perform great, you get bad press. I'm thinking aboutchanging parties just to get good press. I get bad ratings, but I'd be onthe cover of GQ. And it actually sounds --TARLOV: I mean, wouldn't that be nice? We'll talk later. I don't know ifyou're invited to the party, but final thoughts from Dana.PERINO: So, there's a young woman, I'd love to meet, Mary Margaret Olohan,or Olohan if I have that wrong. She works with a Daily Caller. And she hasthis amazing thread listing all of the hypocrites of the political naturewho have said to their constituents, you have to do this but they're doingsomething else. It's a big long list at The Daily Caller. You can checkthat out there.But you know, the other thing is that they're doing things that are quitepolitical. So, in Virginia, the Attorney General I believe, voted to shutdown a gun show over the weekend, even though the county had approved it,and said it was because of COVID. But it looks to the people of Virginia,we can go back to Dagen for this, that it was political. That they don'tlike guns, and they don't want to set the gun show, so they're using COVIDas the excuse. That's the problem of not having persuasion along the way.I do think it is concerning that a lot of these hospitals are starting tobe overwhelmed, having to ration care. Like, nobody wants to be in aposition to do that. So, that's why also personal responsibility and commonsense is more important even than trying to be persuaded by yourgovernment.TARLOV: I think that's absolutely correct. And you are seeing some redstate governors like Governor Christie Noem is having to now talk aboutmask -- wearing your mask and not going to a huge Thanksgiving because theyreached what, 68 percent positivity a couple of weeks ago. So red stategovernors are paying the price for not following the rules to begin with.We got to move on. Coming up, despite progress on vaccines, a new studysays the media overwhelmingly focuses on the bad news when it comes toCOVID.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCDOWELL: The media's pandemic pessimism on full display. Researchersfinding that COVID media coverage in America is strikingly negative,actually downplaying good news on stuff like vaccines. The study foundthis. "Among us major media outlet, stories discussing President DonaldTrump and hydroxychloroquine are more numerous than all stories combinedthat cover companies and individual researchers working on COVID-19vaccines. Greg?GUTFELD: Yes?MCDOWELL: Go.GUTFELD: Oh, I would say that the pessimism is often born from an inabilityto understand human innovation. Like, there's -- most people are optimisticbecause they see a way out of things. And it actually does happenespecially with disasters that are coming at you as opposed to a disasterjust suddenly happens. If you can see something coming, human beings arereally good at planning ahead.And the media doesn't understand that because they're just used to praisingpeople for throwing money at things. They don't understand people whoactually work on something. And optimism only helps Trump. So, if someonein the media says, well, you know, the economy's doing pretty well or thesevaccines are great, your peers will go, why are you trying to help DonaldTrump? Why do you have -- you can't do that.If you say nice things about Trump, he could win the election. That's whyyou didn't hear about the vaccines until afterwards.MCDOWELL: Point. And Jesse, it wasn't in the interest of the media if theywere trying to prop up Joe Biden is to scare the bejesus out of people. Italk about COVID, COVID, COVID because that was really the only thing thatthe Biden campaign was about, not being Trump and COVID.TARLOV: Yes, obviously, the central issue in Americans' lives was the leadissue for Joe Biden's campaign. And it was ranked as the number one issuethroughout the entirety of the primary, and then going into the generalelection. So, I think that makes sense.To Greg's point about the focus on like the less interesting stuff, I dotake that one, but I don't on the "we can't ever say anything good aboutTrump" because I think the vaccine coverage once Pfizer released theirtrial data became positive. But I read an amazing profile in The Guardianof the woman who leads the AstraZeneca team, and she has almost in acompletely female team at Oxford doing this. And you know, it really spoketo my estrogen and I got so excited about it. I was like, yes, you know,like a lady boss story.And I would have loved more of those in the American press for sure, so Igive you that. But I don't think that it was just everything Donald Trumpdoes bad. He handled the pandemic very, very badly and admitted that he wasdownplaying it to Bob Woodward and we heard him say that.MCDOWELL: Well, except for the -- except for the vaccines that are gettingus out of this, Jesse.WATTERS: Breaking survey, it turns out that a third of Biden voters, whenthey went to vote, had never heard of Operation Warp Speed. A third ofBiden voters had never heard of it. And then they say when they found outif they had known, five percent said they would have voted for DonaldTrump.That's why Trump calls the press the enemy of the people because theysuppress that information and it's really tragic. Another survey said thatthe people that consume most of their news through CNN have the most warpedview of COVID-19 of anybody. That they believe it's 10 times more deadly,and they believe that the most people are dying are in their 30s and 40s,not in their 70s and 80s. So, I'm just sick of you guys and I've had. I'vehad it.TARLOV: Well, it's only 20 more minutes, and then you won't have to see me.WATTERS: I've ceded -- you know, I'll cede back my time.MCDOWELL: So, Dana, this research found that the negativity was notcorrelated with partisanship and that Fox News, for example, was asnegative as CNN.PERINO: On vaccine?MCDOWELL: Just in general, on the coverage. And that they concluded, theauthors did, that U.S. readers demand negative stories, period. That's whatthey would rather read.PERINO: No, I think -- look, well, if there was skepticism about it, fine.And also, you had people without jobs, etcetera. Now, you have thesevaccines that is out there. And you actually have seen that, I think,there's been like a 12-point swing from people who said they wouldn't takethe vaccine and people saying that they would be willing to.GUTFELD: Imagine.PERINO: There is light at the end of the tunnel. It is coming. And when thegovernment thinks about persuading people, they could use that and say it'shappening. But I have a prediction that immediately after these vaccinesare ready, and Dr. Robert Redfield from the CDC set on "THE DAILYBRIEFING," that could be the first jabs the second week of December.Immediately, though, I think you're starting to see it already. There'sgoing to be a lot of controversy about how the government, and I'm notsaying making it about Trump or about Biden, but how the government, howthe bureaucrats figure out who's going to get it first and nobody's goingto be happy.GUTFELD: It's going to be the talk show hosts.PERINO: I mean, it really should.GUTFELD: Because we're the important people.PERINO: And then we can sit closer together.GUTFELD: Yes. Just to piggyback with -- now, we're seeing the Trump isright articles because it no longer counts, right, if the election is over.Now, all these people say well, he did -- he really did --WATTERS: On the foreign policy article in USA Today.GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. Oh, he really did do a good job. They suppressed allof the --- all of that stuff until now. It's disgusting. And you know what?I'm done too. Jessica, I'm finished as well.TARLOV: 19 minutes left for you.MCDOWELL: Well, I'll wrap up by saying, I like negative stories. I'd rathersee divorce announcements in the paper than the wedding announced.PERINO: Wow, Dagen.MCDOWELL: That would be so much more fun to read just dirt, just lay it allout there.GUTFELD: It's there.MCDOWELL: Who is it running around on? How many? The "FASTEST SEVEN" upnext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back. It's time for the "FASTEST SEVEN." First up, a newop-ed is calling to cancel the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Yes,that's right. The writer fairly upset over that owl that was recentlydiscovered and its branches, arguing it's proof of America's toxicrelationship with nature."When I saw the Rockefeller Center tree propped up as it shed entire boughsto the cold Plaza ground this year, I felt no elation. I just felt sad thatwe venerate the continued subjugation of nature at the expense ofunfettered growth and consumption." That almost makes me sick saying thatout loud, reading his words. I can't take it,GUTFELD: You should wash your mouth out with soap right now.PERINO: Yes, this is disgusting -- and a bough of something.GUTFELD: Do you know what's interesting? People who write any kind ofcancellation type feature only demand the cancellation of things that theydon't actually use or need. It's a really kind of an easy but fascistinstinct. It's like saying like -- it would be like me saying like, I don'tthink kids should be allowed on planes. And I don't have kids, so I don'thave to worry about it. Or like, you know what, they should close theliquor stores. I don't drink, so it's not a problem.So, this guy, he's telling you that he has no friends or family that arewilling to take him to see the Christmas tree. So, this is more like a cryfor the human touch and this is the most famous -- what's his name, BrianKahn, will ever be.PERINO: Well, and he teaches up at Columbia University, Dagen. And this ishappening at a time when we're considering a proposal to cancel studentloan debt. So, people like, that took his classes for that tuition money,I'm not paying it.MCDOWELL: Right. And if he's for the environment, why is he encouragingpeople to go out and buy petroleum-based Christmas trees that are made inChina and have to be carted across --PERINO: Thank you.MCDOWELL: And then they're ever in like fake glitter snow that you theninhale and have to go to the hospital because you leave the tree up allyear long.WATTERS: That's a good point.PERINO: Also, it's not that great of a looking tree.MCDOWELL: It's a horrible looking tree.PERINO: Yes. It didn't -- it didn't you know, fill out like they thought itwould.TARLOV: No. I think that an article about that, and there have been somegood memes about how it's symbolic of De Blasio's mayoralty that like thisis the final Christmas tree that we get. And during COVID, we should havethe best tree we've ever had.WATTERS: That's the tree?TARLOV: Yes. It's right across the street, Jesse.PERINO: Yes, it's not very good. Jesse, any other thoughts about this guy?WATTERS: Well, I would say, the first shots have been fired on the war andChristmas.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: I'm ready to --TARLOV: They're coming from inside the house, though. You read what Melaniawas saying about Christmas.WATTERS: I would think Greg knows this better than I do. But it seems to mea place like Gizmodo or however you pronounce it. They hire someone towrite a controversial piece to get picked up on THE FIVE for web traffic.GUTFELD: That's precisely right. We play into it because we could use thecontent.PERINO: Well, we do love the "FASTEST SEVEN." All right --WATTERS: It's very good. And the producers are great on the show.PERINO: Next up -- OK, Greg, we want to ask you this. How much would wehave to pay you to watch this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This holiday season, all you need is Love Actually.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: That's right. It's his favorite. But a company is looking to paysomeone $2,500 to watch 25 holiday movies in 25 days. So, that's really nota bad deal because on top of the money, they will also throw in a year's-worth of streaming to seven different services. Jessica, would you do this?TARLOV: I would pay someone to let me do that. I think that seems like fun.And it's what people do actually during the holidays anyway, I think in theaverage household.PERINO: Are you going to -- are you going to join this contest?WATTERS: Yes. Where do I sign up for these things? You keep hearing aboutall these great deals you get by these companies that pay you to do stuff.Like, where, when, how?PERINO: You think it's horrible?GUTFELD: We just give him this free advertising and they -- they're goingto just run away with it.PERINO: Do you think this is a horrible idea?GUTFELD: I think it's --PERINO: Would you ever -- would you do that? Would it be torture for you?GUTFELD: Why does it have to be Christmas movies? Why do we pick that one?PERINO: Oh, the second -- The Second Shot and The War on Christmas.GUTFELD: Yes. I want 25 --PERINO: The Enemy Within. OK, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes. My top three Christmas movies are Apocalypse Now, ClockworkOrange, and Goodfellas, so there you go.GUTFELD: That's very good.MCDOWELL: I can knock down these 25 movies or 25 Christmas movies in twodays because I'm a loser and have no friends. And my favorite is actuallyFour Christmases with Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon.WATTERS: That is a good one.MCDOWELL: With Jon Favreau.WATTERS: That is a good one.MCDOWELL: Jon Favreau flipped it to.PERINO: I'm going to -- I'm going to watch that one. OK, finally --GUTFELD: Have you seen that kid since Love Actually?PERINO: No.GUTFELD: What he looks like?PERINO: Like a little boy?GUTFELD: He's in --PERINO: Oh, he's in the Queen's Gambit.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: He looks a little weird.GUTFELD: He looks like a child with a mustache.PERINO: No, we couldn't say like -- and I said, he's a kid --GUTFELD: He won't trick me.PERINO: The kid from Love Actually. All right, and finally thinking oftaking your Thanksgiving dinner to go this year, the TSA is releasing thislist of holiday foods that you can bring on your flight. So, solid foodslike a whole turkey stuffing etcetera, that can go in your carry on, butyou better pack the gravy and anything liquid like cranberry sauce or winein your checked luggage. Any nobody's -- anybody is fine?TARLOV: No.PERINO: I don't want to shame anybody. OK, I'm not -- I'm not trying toshame anybody on what your holiday plans are. Would you sit next tosomebody that had gravy?GUTFELD: Yes, I would. But I -- the closest thing I ever brought tosomething like Thanksgiving was like a flask of wild turkey in myunderwear. I'm not going to tell you where I kept the shot glass.PERINO: OK, Jesse?WATTERS: I can't follow that. That's disgusting. But I do -- I do kind oflook down on people that bring lots of complicated food items on a plane onplanes. I look down on them.PERINO: Yes. You know, when I first met Peter --WATTERS: And then I envy them.PERINO: When I met Peter on the airplane, he -- I'm sorry, Peter. I'm goingto tell the story again. But it is public information. He brought a chicken-- no, a fish sandwich --WATTERS: Fish?PERINO: From McDonald's on to the plane.WATTERS: No. Fish fillet?GUTFELD: That's is the --PERINO: Fish fillet.GUTFELD: No.TARLOV: And you still married him?PERINO: But he didn't eat it. But he didn't eat it. Yes, I mean, the accenthelped a lot. But don't ever take fish on a plane. Never. That's my adviceto all of you.MCDOWELL: The worst thing to take on a plane is a gallon Ziplock bag ofhardboiled eggs.PERINO: Oh, no. One time, this lady ate sunflower seeds that she crackedbetween her teeth individually the whole day. It was --GUTFELD: Worse thing to take on the plane, my Uncle Vic.PERINO: "ONE MORE THING is up next, everybody.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It's time for "ONE MORE THING." I haven't done this yet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: They are so great. Have you ever eat some that doesn't go downright and you got to get to a bathroom but you can't move that fast,because if you move too fast, you'd get worse like this little fellow here.I got him trying to walk it through. We've all been there. Fortunately,this poor fellow is wearing a tux. You know, it's a rented tux so he'sgoing to lose the deposit. Well, called the actual toucan. Toucan play thatgame, I say. You, toucan. All right, I'll shut up now. Jesse.WATTERS: All right, Jesse would like to make a correction. At least I dothat. I mean, you guys make all kinds of mistakes and just let it slide.GUTFELD: This is like rich wrong.WATTERS: So, yesterday, on the show, I mocked a man for rescuing what Isaid was a baby alligator. And if everybody can look at the screen, it's amini gator. I mean, this thing's not a threat. What I didn't -- what Ididn't understand was if there's a baby gator in the water, the mama gatoris probably really close by. So, in that sense, the man was very brave toenter these dangerous waters because a real gator could have been swimmingaround and really done some damage. So, that is my clarification.Also, minor clarification. I misidentified Nick Richards as a Tar Heel.He's actually a Wildcat. And again, these are the only two mistakes I'vemade on the show in my almost four years on it. So, I just want to beupfront with the audience about that.PERINO: Did you get a lot of alligator --GUTFELD: I get the alligator spillover from him.PERINO: I did too.WATTERS: You got it? Yes, I got a lot of that.GUTFELD: A lot of people, victims of small alligators, Dana.PERINO: That's true. All right, so my turn. You know, abstract painting,abstract art, you might think that like anybody could do that. Well, it'skind of true. Look at Paw-blo Picasso here. This is a little Popely. It's amini Labradoodle from Australia. He's learned how to paint abstract art.WATTERS: That'll be $60,000.PERINO: Exactly. Popely owner is a dog trainer in Melbourne. That is a cityin Australia. And her pup was able to pick up the scale in just 30 minutes.So, next time you go and you think you're going to spend a lot of money,just think about having Jasper do this.WATTERS: Labradoodle.GUTFELD: That wasn't any real skill for that dog. She's just pushing thedog towards a white piece of paper.WATTERS: So, it was Jackson Pollock. You think that looks cool?TARLOV: Your correction tomorrow over that.WATTERS: Oops, I spilled it.GUTFELD: Jackson Pollock. All right, Dagen.MCDOWELL: So, closed aquarium means a field trip for some penguins. So Isee your tuxedo and I raise you some penguin tuxedo. Chicago's SheddAquarium had announced plans to close temporarily for the rest of year. Andso, they took the penguins to Soldier Field in Chicago with the bear -- theBears and the soccer team, the Chicago Fire. They were in the locker room,they're out there on the field.Apparently, they need to experience the wild, if you will, new sights andsounds and smells like. They've also in the past been to the Field Museumin Chicago and the Museum of Contemporary Art where Ferris Bueller'sfilmed.PERINO: They look like that toucan.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: And they didn't get shot.GUTFELD: You know, their patron saint is Mitt Romney.WATTERS: He walks like a penguin.GUTFELD: Yes. All right, Jessica.TARLOV: No one gave the liberal the memo that we were supposed to doanimals today so I have something about humans. It's been way too longsince we all applauded health care workers each evening. They're stillworking just as hard as they were in the spring.And one COVID patient in Utah, Grover Wilhelmsen found a unique way to saythank you to the heroic doctors and nurses taking care of him. Grover is aretired music teacher and had his wife Diana bring him his violin to theintensive care unit where he's been intubated. He played his thank you tohis nurse who then piped the music to the whole unit.Tears ensued and for good reason. A beautiful tribute and reminder of thepower of music and saying thanks however we can.GUTFELD: Very, very touching.WATTERS: Also, I just want to apologize to Jackson Pollock.MCDOWELL: He's dead.WATTERS: God rest his soul.GUTFELD: All right. That's it for us. "SPECIAL REPORT" is up next. Hey,Bret.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
