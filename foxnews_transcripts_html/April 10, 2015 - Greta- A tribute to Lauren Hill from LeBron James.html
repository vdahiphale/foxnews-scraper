Let's go "Off the Record." I didn't know Lauren Hill, but I wish I had. This courageous, tough, 19-year-old college basketball player died of brain cancer today, but not before raising $1.45 million for cancer research to help others.
In her much too short life, Lauren touched many people, including NBA star Lebron James, who posted a tribute to Lauren on Twitter. So tonight, I'm going to turn "Off the Record" over to LeBron because no one says it like he does. Here it goes: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Dear Lauren Hill. You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, et cetera, et cetera. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Your time spent on Earth will never be forgotten. I never got the chance to meet you in person, but know you inspired me the whole time for every life you touched. You made the biggest impact on them by just being you. You are in a far better place now, and please don't have too much fun without all your family and friends. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Can you please tell my grandmother I said hello? Don't be afraid. She knows you because we spoke about you plenty of times. Until we officially meet again, take care and continue to be that leader we all love.
"Rest in peace, Lauren Hill. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Sincerely, LeBron James."
Well said LeBron. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
