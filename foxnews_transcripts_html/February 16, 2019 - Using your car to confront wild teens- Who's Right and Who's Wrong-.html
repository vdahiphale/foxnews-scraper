JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to "Watters' World." I'm Jesse Watters. Democrat control freaks. That's the subject of tonight's "Watters' Words."
Democrats like to say they want government out of the bedroom, but ironically, the Democrats want the government in every other room in your house and your neighbors' house and your car and your restaurants, and everybody everywhere else in America.

Senator Cory Booker is a vegan and says eating meat will destroy the planet, "The tragic reality is this planet simply can't sustain billions of people consuming industrial produced animal agriculture because of environmental impact. It's just not possible." Booker wants to crack down on big beef and big pork. Good luck running for President trying to take away meet.

WATTERS: Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva tried to remove the words, quote, "So help you, God," from the oath that witnesses take before testifying. That's right. Democrats want to remove God from Congress.
Enter the word "police." Apparently the word man is now offensive. In New York, Democrats wants to change the words "fireman" and "policeman" to more gender neutral terms like "firefighter" and "police officer."
California politicians just banned the use of "he" and "she" during committee hearings.

HANNAH-BETH JACKSON, D-CALIF, STATE SENATOR: We are now a state recognizing the non-binary designation as a gender. We are using the phrase "they" in replacing other designation so that it is a gender neutral designation, "they." Basically, that's the primary reforms and revisions to the committee rules.

Bloomingdales was forced to remove a t-shirt that said "fake news." Because a sniveling little reporter said it was hurtful. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm sick of liberals telling us what to wear, what to say, what to drive, what to eat and who to listen to.
Take a look at a liberal. Does it look like they know what they are doing? Why do we even have to listen to these people? It doesn't look like they know how to control their own lives, let alone how to control yours.

REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA: Hey, if it gets any weirder in Washington, Jesse, we're going to have build a wall around Congress and then pad the inside of that wall, but you know, you focus on all the weird things that liberals are doing.
Remember, this past week was Valentine's Day week, so love was in the air. I even got to wish a Happy Valentine's Day to AOC, and I hope that she finds love that burns so bright that it is illegal under the new carbon emissions of the standards of the Green New Deal, so who knows.

He gave a big interview on "60 Minutes," because he needs to make money and sell books because he is probably going to go to jail. And this is what he said basically admitting that he was investigating the President of the United States early on. Roll it.

ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR: I met with the team investigating the Russia cases, and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward. I was very concerned I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace.

WATTERS: So Trump fires James Comey which the Democrats would have done if Hillary were elected, and this guy McCabe launches a counterintelligence investigation against the President of the United States, an obstruction investigation against the President of the United States and then starts rounding up other administration officials to see if they could invoke the 25th Amendment, administrative coup and talking with high-ranking officials about wiring themselves to speak to the President and secretly record him.

GAETZ: It most certainly is. A year ago, I said that there were unelected bureaucrats planning a coup against the President who was duly elected. The mainstream media widely panned me for those comments, and now that very same mainstream media is covering the fact that Andrew McCabe of saying that unelected bureaucrats were conspiring to oust the President of the United States.
You'll also remember that Jim Baker, who was the top lawyer at the FBI confirms McCabe's accounts and says that Rosenstein did want to wear a wire on the President and you'll also remember that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were texting each other 10 months into the investigation that there was no there, there. There was no evidence of collusion and McCabe's admission is crazy.
He wanted to establish an investigation that was un-closable even if there is no evidence. That's not justice, that's a politicized FBI.

WATTERS: Three freshmen Democratic congresswomen are making a bad first impression with not just Republicans, pretty much everybody. POLITICO taking note, quote, "The Republican Party has a new trio of Democratic villains -- Rashida Tlaib, Congresswoman Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The GOP strategy risks a backlash -- a party that has problems with women and minorities continues to focus its attacks on women of color, even as the freshmen say they are not surprised by it.
Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pierson and RNC spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany. All right, ladies, so I had a problem with this POLITICO report because they said, you know, the Republicans, they are moving away from Nancy Pelosi as just demonizing her because they did that in the midterms.
There are other women that are now coming up and they are making so much controversy with these radical proposals and things they are saying that are anti-Semitic and whatnot that Republicans are targeting them, but Republicans better be careful according to the media, Kayleigh because you don't want to ever criticize someone who is a female or a minority that might make you look mean.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, SPOKESMWOMAN, RNC: That's an absurd gender politics - identity politics argument. The GOP is targeting anti-Semitism and that is a complete red herring to say they are focusing on these people because of their gender. We are focusing on people who have fundraisers, Rashida Tlaib who run a page with a video that says, "Jews are satanic." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We are focusing on Ilhan Omar for having an anti-Semitic tweet. There is no room for that kind of hate in our country and that is our exclusive focus is the absurd and hateful places. Things they have said that have no place in this society.
WATTERS: Yes, Katrina, Republicans are going after these three freshmen because of their crazy, socialist, radical proposals and anti-Semitism. Remember, the one woman said "Impeach the m-fer" like on her first day. It's not because they are women or minorities, it is because they are crazy socialists that they'd go after if it was a man or if the person was green.
KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Oh, Jesse, there is no question about that and if Democrats don't want these individuals to be in the spotlight, they shouldn't be given prominent positions on committees and Kayleigh is right, there are serious issues with these individuals and it seems like, the Democrats thought they could package the anti-Semitism with a brown woman and expect there not to be criticism, but what Republicans know is that in the future elections, these races are going to be won at home on the ground. The people who are not watching cable news, they don't know the things that Kayleigh just said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have to get those message to the people because most people don't know that Ilhan Omar, just three years ago went to a judge for leniency for individuals who either pled guilty or were tried and found guilty of supporting ISIS and she sits on the foreign intelligence committee.
WATTERS: Right.
PIERSON: How does that happen? People need to know.
WATTERS: Yes, she is lowering the intelligence of the committee just by sitting on it. You can't ask for leniency for people trying to join ISIS. What kind of message does that send? And to use their -- I guess, identity as a sword and as a shield because you know, they attack you with it and then if you attack them back, they say, "Oh, no, you can't criticize me, you're just criticizing me because I'm a woman or I'm a minority." Here was Representative Omar - kind of a nasty little exchange with Mr. Abrams who has done a lot for American foreign policy over the years. Let's roll the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN: I fail to understand why members of this Committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.
ELLIOTT ABRAMS, SPECIAL ENVOY TO VENEZUELA: If I can respond to that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OMAR: It wasn't a question. Yes or no, would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide if you believed they were serving U.S. interests as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.
ABRAMS: I am not going to respond to that question, I am sorry. I don't think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions and so I will not reply.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Okay, so there she is, you know, really, really humiliating herself out there. I believe this person isn't going to stop and she is going to keep making news. She is going to keep saying anti-Semitic things, and we know that Nancy Pelosi tried to cut her out, and I don't think she got the message. I'll give you guys the last word, 30 seconds.
MCENANY: Absolutely, she did not get the message. It's why she slated to speak beside someone who promotes anti-Semitism in the coming months. She didn't get the message. She is going to keep saying these things but make no mistake, and I am sure, Katrina would agree. This 2020 contenders bow down to her, it is why Bernie Sanders privately called her in the background saying, "I support you," amid her tweet that anti-Semitic. The 2020 contenders cower to these individuals.
WATTERS: I think I know why, Katrina, it's because leadership of the party wants these young radicals out there. They take all the heat. But they are just saying the things that I think a lot of the rest of the party truly believe or maybe say behind closed doors. Ten seconds.
PIERSON: Well, I mean, silence is consent, Jesse. You know, when you traffic in identity politics and class warfare, eventually you are stuck with it, but the American people are going to reject it because where we are today with these radicals is completely absurd and against the democracy that we're in.

PIERSON: Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn't be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling, and then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake and we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.

WATTERS: President Trump declaring the situation at the border a national emergency to fund the border wall and predicting the legal fight ahead. With all the fighting in Washington, not many people realize just how dangerous the situation is for the border agents on the ground. Tomi Lahren got a first-hand look for Fox Nation.
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
TOMI LAHREN, CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This area right now, this is our border protected by this barbed wire fencing and you know, wood. Would this area be suitable for fencing if you could afford fencing to put here?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way the terrain is set up, it is viable to construct border fencing in this area.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had learned over the years that when we put a solid barrier, we couldn't see through our adversaries whether it would be drug smugglers, illegal aliens, or smugglers would hide behind them and then use it to basically assault our agents, throw rocks at our agents, or just hide like lots and lots of people and then all at one time run across.
LAHREN: Would then this line your border? One of these prototypes would then line your border? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That design right there is basically what we are looking at going forward.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is inhospitable terrain, not only for them, but also for us. It's difficult for us to deploy technology into these areas, so we have to make up for that by either using aircraft or just having agents on the ground hiking in and that's where the real work of the Border Patrol comes into play.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Agents have to get up here either by us or by foot. We have a 100-foot long flasher which is a rope above the diameter of a fireman's pole that you could slide down.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are roughly eight miles north of the border and we encounter camouflaged groups. They wear like the military or musk hill type camou from head to toe.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's fine for us to arrest people that have crossed the border illegally, but the true targets and the true people that we want to hit hard every single day are the facilitators. It's the scouts on the mountain tops, it's the guys that are foot guides for the groups that are bringing them across. It's the low drivers and all of the criminal that are facilitating this illegal trafficking of people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no value on human life when it comes to the cartel that is operating south of the border. The people that are crossing have no say in when they are crossing, where they are crossing or how they are crossing. They are being crossed in the hands of criminals and it's a dangerous situation.

WATTERS: Tomi Lahren joins me now. So Tomi, when you were shooting the inhospitable terrain and those men were kind of just climbing down off of a helicopter and pursuing illegal crossing on foot, where exactly was that?
LAHREN: That was in the Nogales-Tucson area in Arizona.
WATTERS: In Arizona.
LAHREN: And it was about 115 degrees when we were there. So what these guys are doing day in and day out, they are hiking into the middle of the desert. They are hiking back some areas, it's so remote that they can't even take ATVs. So these people are the real heroes of this country and they don't get nearly enough credit.
WATTERS: So some of that inhospitable terrain, it was almost like huge mountain tops and cliffs. You couldn't put border fencing there. That's where you would have to surge a lot of Border Patrol agents, correct?
LAHREN: Yes, and so that's what I asked them about because obviously, that area is not really suitable for a lot of fencing or a wall, but if we have wall in other places where we can put a wall, then our agents can focus on those remote areas.
WATTERS: Exactly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LAHREN: So when I went there, I asked them, time and time again does the wall work, and they said we need a wall because then we can focus on these areas because and we don't have to be sitting there worrying about people running across and we divert our efforts. That really makes sense, but the Democrats can't seem to get it.
WATTERS: Yes, they don't want to listen to the experts. They think they know better than the people on the ground. When you in the beginning of the package, could you see where you kind of highlighted that pathetic little fence, it was about as tall -- about 5 feet tall here with some little barbed wire. Where exactly was that?
LAHREN: That was in Arizona as well.
WATTERS: Also in Arizona.
LAHREN: The Nogales area, and yes, and it was that bad. I mean, that was not just a small little area, there was a lot of area that either had no fencing at all or had that. I mean, I think you and I have talked about this before, but I grew up in South Dakota and we had better fencing to keep livestock in than we do protecting our border, which is really pathetic.
WATTERS: Well, you know, the Democrats don't want meat around. You know, they want to get rid of your hamburger like Cory Booker, so that fencing could come in handy later. What a lot of people don't understand, Tomi, is they say you know, with all the drugs, all the narcotics, they come through ports of entry, but you know what? Who do you think deals the drugs? You have to have men.
And the guys that are dealing it in the United States, they cross the border illegally on foot between the ports of entry. Listen, great job down there on the border. That was great footage. And you guys can check that out with Tomi on Fox Nation. See you later.

ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Robert Gray. Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, once one of the highest ranking U.S. Catholic leaders has now been removed from the priesthood. Pope Francis made the rare move to defrock McCarrick after Vatican officials found him guilty of decades-long sex crimes against minors and adults. McCarrick once served as the Archbishop of Washington, D.C. The decision comes days before the Pope is set to lead a Vatican Summit in which bishops will discuss preventing sexual abuse.
Heather Nauert removes herself from consideration as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. In a statement, she said her decision was quote, "In the best interest for her family." President Trump had picked her for the job following the departure of Nikki Haley. Nauert currently serves as Chief Spokesperson for the State Department and is a former Fox News anchor. Now back to "Watters' World."

ROBIN ROBERTS, HOST, ABC: What is it that has you so angry? Is it the attackers?
SMOLLETT: It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks. It's like, you know, at first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing like of like, "Oh, how can you doubt that? Like how do you not believe that? It's the truth."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That's actor, Jussie Smollett telling ABC's Robin Roberts that people doubting his story about Trump supporters attacking him is making him very angry. Here is the latest.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good evening, Jesse. A Chicago Police Department spokesman tells me today, Jussie Smollett is still quote, "the listed victim in this case." But the two men who were identified by police just yesterday as potential suspects have now been released and are apparently no longer suspects.
With the Chicago Police Department spokesman saying yesterday, quote, "Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the "Empire" case have been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete." That statement came just hours after Chicago Police said they had probable cause to believe the two men did commit assault and battery against actor, Jussie Smollett.
But whatever the two told investigators appears to have been enough to change minds. The two men are apparently brothers. They are originally from Nigeria, and police say at least one of them worked with Smollett on the set of the Fox TV show "Empire."
And now, Jussie Smollett has reportedly hired a high-priced defense lawyer amid reports Chicago Police are looking into the theory that the entire attack may have been staged -- Jesse.
WATTERS: Joining me now, former NYPD officer, Darrin Porcher and former Tucson police officer and the Director of Urban Engagement at Turning Point, USA, Brandon Tatum. All right, I just want to play for you, guys, Smollett talking to Robin Roberts describing the attack. Let's hear it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SMOLLETT: I heard [bleep] Empire. [Bleep]. So I turned around, and I said "[bleep], what did you just say to me? And then I see the attacker masked. And he said, "This is MAGA country, [bleep]," and punches me right in the face, so I punched his ass back. And then we started tussling. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back. And then it just stopped. And they ran off. And I saw where they ran. And the phone was in my pocket, but it had fallen out. It was sitting there, and my manager was still on the phone. So I picked up the phone, and I said, "Brandon," and he was like, "What's going on?" And I said, "I was just jumped." And then I look down and see there is a rope around my neck.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Okay, Brandon, why do you think the story makes no sense?
BRANDON TATUM, DIRECTOR OF URBAN ENGAGEMENT, TURNING POINT USA: I mean, come now. You're talking about in Chicago, negative 20-degree weather, you've got some guys spewing out racial epithets with MAGA hats on saying, "MAGA country." It makes almost zero sense.
And as a former police officer who has done hundreds of investigations of crimes similar to this, his story makes no sense. Inconsistent articulation of what happened. Like for instance, he says the fight, it just stopped.
When people are kicking your butt because they hate you, they are not going to just randomly stop fighting you and walk away. Those things are not consistent with the behaviors of victims of hate crimes and also someone who actually want to get something done.
WATTERS: Darrin, the allegation was that they hurled racial epithets at Smollett. Everybody is black involved, allegedly. Does that make sense to you or not?
DARRIN PORCHER, FORMER NYPD OFFICER: Well, you've got to take into consideration, when someone is the victim of a crime, it's a horrific experience, and oftentimes they don't see things the way someone that is not the victim of crime would see it, and coupled with there being an assault.
Here, when we look at the statements, he has been somewhat surreptitious in terms of the documentation he introduced in connection with his phone records. Your phone is a very sacred thing. He may not want to introduce his contacts or his communications or if there is a medical issue to police, I understand it.
But going back to the situation in terms of did this happen? I genuinely believe that a crime did occur. However, it's difficult and we are getting through the evidence to determine what in fact had occurred.
WATTERS: Right, because there clearly were physical injuries involved.
PORCHER: Exactly.
WATTERS: You mentioned the phone. I want to play you guys tape. This is his explanation about why he has not handed his phone over to investigators because the story was that he was on the phone with his manager during the actual attack. Let's listen to what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SMOLLETT: They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do that.
ROBERTS: Why?
SMOLLETT: Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Brandon, are you sympathetic to that explanation or not?
TATUM: No. It's absolutely ridiculous. Like I said, if I was investigating his crime and I see a person who has been beat up and has been a victim of a hate crime and you are refusing to give your phone to investigators to find these suspects because of those excuses, I find it not credible at all. It is absolutely ridiculous. I don't believe anything he says and that was one of the starting points.
WATTERS: Darrin, what do you think?
PORCHER: I mean, I disagree. I mean, I conduct -- I was a lieutenant at the NYPD. I had a detective squad that I commanded and I can tell you first hand, oftentimes, you will get information that may seem to be all over the place, but the truth of the matter is, a credible investigation is going to uncover a lot of this stuff.
We don't just have to go with what he introduces. We've got to expand the video. Initially, when this happened, it was a video -- there was a camera that was pointed in the opposite direction. If we didn't get anything there, what we are going to do is we are just going to keep expanding the video so we can see who came to that particular location.
We may dump the cellphone tower. But the truth of the matter is, it's an amalgamation of different components of material evidence that will make us gain that assessment as to what happened or what didn't happen. Case and point, the inconsistency was it was white, and then the make America great hat, and then there were individuals --
WATTERS: Well, you know what though, that can't be all on Smollett because there is a lot of fake news being reported about someone wearing a hat, injuries that were inconsistent. You know, a lot of that goes on the media as well, too.
Listen, guys, we've got to run, but something happened. We know that. And the police it looks like they are doing a very good job, slowly putting this together and we are going to continue to follow the story as it develops. Thanks, guys.
TATUM: Thanks for having me.
WATTERS: Up next, Diamond and Silk on Spike Lee's very controversial comments.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Filmmaker, Spike Lee in the hot seat again this week criticizing the Founding Fathers of America saying the roots of our racist history go all the way back to Christopher Columbus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPIKE LEE, FILMMAKER: When I was in public school in Brooklyn, New York, I was not told George Washington owned slaves. I was just told that he chopped down the cherry tree and wouldn't tell a lie.
In 1492, this terrorist sailed the ocean blue. This country was built on - - in my opinion, genocide of Native Americans and slavery. That's the foundation of this country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joining me now, Diamond and Silk. Ladies, you know what bothers me? This guy speaks more harshly of the founding of this country than ISIS. Where is that tough talk for ISIS?
DIAMOND, HOST, FOX NATION: Yes, you know, Jesse, when you look at Spike Lee, he talks about genocide, but what about the 16 million black babies that have been aborted since 1973. To us, that's genocide and why isn't he talking about that?
You know, we live in the greatest country on Earth.
SILK, HOST, FOX NATION: That's right.
DIAMOND: It is the greatest country on Earth and he has been able to obtain the American dream right here in the United States of America.
SILK: Right here.
DIAMOND: And if he don't like this country and what it was founded on, then maybe he needs to move to another country like Venezuela and see how it feels to live in a nightmare of poverty and not having enough food to eat, and then tell us how that's working for him.
SILK: That's right.
WATTERS: Okay, so Diamond and Silk want to send Spike to Venezuela.
DIAMOND: Yes.
WATTERS: Okay, ladies. Up next, we have Kamala Harris, now we know how we pronounce her name, Kamala Harris, okay and this is her talking to some people about smoking weed back in the day and what she listened to on the radio. Roll it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, HOST, THE BREAKFAST CLUB RADIO SHOW: Have you ever smoked?
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I have.
CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: Okay, in college?
HARRIS: And I did inhale.
CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: You were then in college?
HARRIS: Yes.
CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: What were you listening to when you were high? What was on? What song was on?
HARRIS: Oh my goodness. Oh yes, definitely Snoop, uh-huh. Tupac for sure. For sure.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I mean, the best thing we could take away from this situation is now, politicians don't have to lie about inhaling, they can just admit they did it.
DIAMOND: But then, okay, so let's look at the timeframe when she did it.
SILK: That's right.
DIAMOND: Now, she graduated from college, I believe in 1989, in law school, I think in 1989. She started working as a Deputy District Attorney in the 90s, so that means she was getting high while she was having black men locked up for getting high, so maybe we should go back and take a look at Kamala Harris' past and maybe we should start pressing some charges around here.
SILK: That's right.
WATTERS: Wow, Diamond and Silk with their own investigation. Unbelievable. Maybe she couldn't remember because she was high. That would explain the timeline difference. All right, so there is this big festival or there was a carnival or parade or something like that in Italy. They love those things over there in Europe. This is a float, it is called God Trump Emperor. I think this was meant to be insulting. The minute Trump probably looks at this float, I think he is going to want it for the military parade here in the United States. That's a good float.
DIAMOND: Well, possibly, but you know what, I'll turn it around like this here. I think that people look at President Trump as a savior. They look at him how he is saving America. He has the economy booming. He is draining the swamp and some of the ones that's been stuck and drowning in the swamp, they're outing their own selves through books.
SILK: That's right.
DIAMOND: He is doing and amazing job over here and I don't take it as an insult. I am going to take it as something good.
SILK: That's right.
WATTERS: All right, well, when we do have the military parade, I think you guys should be the grand marshals. How about that?
DIAMOND: Okay.
SILK: Right there.
WATTERS: You guys and Gorka. I think you guys would be great leading the parade. All right, ladies, thanks a lot. Take a look at the "Chit-Chat Tour" coming to a city near you. Up next, Carley and Abby are back and they are giving us tips on how to discipline someone else's kids. All right, I don't know how to do it. They do.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Seattle recently hit with the most snow in decades, which led to a huge snowball fight for some kids. One driver wasn't having it after her car was allegedly hit by a snowball and took matters into her own hands. So who is right and who is wrong? There she is getting out of the car and confronting the kids.
Joining me again this week, Fox Nation host, Abby Hornacek and Fox News 24/7 headlines reporter, Carley Shimkus. Do you guys even drive? Do you guys even have driver's licenses?
CARLEY SHIMKUS, 24/7 HEADLINES REPORTER: I haven't driven a car in a decade.
WATTERS: Okay, so I am going to go to you, Abby. So if you're driving in the snow and a bunch of wild teenagers throw snowballs at the car, do you get out or do you just keep driving.
ABBY HORNACEK, HOST, FOX NATION: I keep driving. I feel like life is too short to be so angry all the time. The kids are throwing snowballs. I mean, you have to chalk this up as kids just being kids.
Now, I will say, if it put the person driving in danger and somehow the snow broke and then she crashed her car, then I think you may be get out, you have a stern talking to --
WATTERS: A stern talking.
HORNACEK: A stern talking. That to me is scary and they can get hit by a car anyway.
WATTERS: So like an adult female comes out and gives a stern talking.
SHIMKUS: She's such an angel, I can never imagine Abby.
WATTERS: Would you probably run the kids out of the street?
SHIMKUS: Listen, I did some --
WATTERS: Back up right into them.
SHIMKUS: I did some intense research on this story.
WATTERS: You didn't need to do that.
SHIMKUS: I found a local news report. It turns out, they were not kids.
WATTERS: How old?
SHIMKUS: They were like 25, 27.
WATTERS: So even worse. That's an adult, they're not minors. You can charge them and send them to prison.
SHIMKUS: They still have the right to play in the snow and the woman was arrested for drunk driving because she tried to run them over.
WATTERS: Oh, wait, she was drunk?
SHIMKUS: Yes.
HORNACEK: Yes, DUI.
WATTERS: She was drunk. Wait, so you've done more research than I have on this.
SHIMKUS: Coming in with all the facts.
WATTERS: Okay, all right, this is it. So in that case, if she is drunk.
SHIMKUS: She was wrong.
WATTERS: She was wrong.
SHIMKUS: Legally.
WATTERS: To get out of the car. She basically busted herself.
HORNACEK: If she wasn't drunk though would you still --
WATTERS: If you're drunk, you stay in the car.
HORNACEK: If she was driving -- if you were sober?
SHIMKUS: We're talking about killing somebody for throwing a snowball.
HORNACEK: But she did --
WATTERS: I am actually I'm hearing she just had weed. She was high, not drunk. She was a Kamala Harris situation.
HORNACEK: She did say she wasn't trying to kill them. She was just trying to scare them.
WATTERS: Scare them.
HORNACEK: Yes.
WATTERS: Okay, well, that would be scary if some high woman came out and ran after me on the street. All right, next up. Valentine's Day. A lot of guys out there probably are in big trouble or they are getting treated like kings for how they performed on Valentine's Day. Carley, what is the move for men on Valentine's Day? How much do they have to spend? How much do they have to do?
SHIMKUS: Well, the crazy thing is, this year I saw a study that said that --
WATTERS: You're all about studies and facts.
SHIMKUS: Thank you.
WATTERS: Wow.
SHIMKUS: Appreciate that. On average, a man that celebrated Valentine's Day this year spent $340.00.
WATTERS: That's a lot of money.
SHIMKUS: That is an insane amount of money. All I expected was a text message.
WATTERS: You just want a text.
SHIMKUS: I mean, I don't really celebrate.
HORNACEK: Carley, you deserve more than a text, though, maybe like a phone call, at least.
SHIMKUS: I know.
WATTERS: You disagree? You like guys spending money.
HORNACEK: No, I don't and I'm with Carley on this one. I do not want a guy to take me to a fancy dinner. I would rather go to a bowling alley or roller skating or go to a diner and have like a burger and just do something down to earth.
WATTERS: Okay, first of all, guys that are watching right now, do not listen. This is a trap. This is what women say to lower expectations so then you exceed expectations.
SHIMKUS: This is like the first date, and then a week later, we are like knives out.
WATTERS: No one believes you. I don't believe a thing. I think you want to get wined and dined with flowers.
HORNACEK: No, that's cliche. That is cliche.
WATTERS: Okay, roller skating.
HORNACEK: I don't want flowers.
WATTERS: You guys want to be taken roller skating.
SHIMKUS: I do not want to go roller skating.
WATTERS: Do they even have roller skating rinks anymore?
HORNACEK: Or play Backgammon. That doesn't cost any money. Wine and Backgammon.
WATTERS: You are a cheap date, Abby.
HORNACEK: I am a very cheap date.
SHIMKUS: I don't do any of those things ever, but I just don't expect flowers and candy on Valentine's Day, especially because I don't want to spend the money and the time getting my husband something.
WATTERS: Oh, so it's selfish.
SHIMKUS: Absolutely.
WATTERS: You don't want to have to reciprocate.
SHIMKUS: Hundred percent.
WATTERS: At least you're honest about that. I can respect that, okay. Let's go to people talking that are talking loudly on cell phones. You guys are on the train, you guys you are in the airport. Someone just screaming into the cell phone. Is it the right thing to do, right or wrong, Abby to confront that person and shush them or to let them scream? Are you a shusher or are you not a shusher?
HORNACEK: I am not a shusher. I think it's even more rude to shush someone, but I will stew on it. I will be so annoyed with that person and I will stew, but I am not one to actually say something.
WATTERS: So you won't get out of the car and confront the snow ballers, you won't shush, you will stew.
HORNACEK: No, but I will stew on it.
WATTERS: You'll stew. What about you?
SHIMKUS: She will try and run somebody over though, apparently.
WATTERS: That's right.
SHIMKUS: No, I would never say anything.
WATTERS: You're probably the one that's loud on the phone that's why.
SHIMKUS: No, you know, I thought about it because I always worry that they may have like a hearing issue, they may be hearing impaired. And then what if you say, listen, you are being a little loud.
WATTERS: You're right about that and then you look like a total idiot.
SHIMKUS: Yes.
WATTERS: Okay, well that wouldn't be the first time for me. Let's look at the poll results from last time. Remember, should men go shirtless in public? This is based off the Adam Levine deal. look at that? 69% say no. Were you guys right or wrong about that?
SHIMKUS: That is a very broad question.
HORNACEK: That is very --
SHIMKUS: Just go shirtless in public.
HORNACEK: Yes, where are they going? Are they going to the gym? Are they going to the grocery because you can't go shirtless to the grocery store.
SHIMKUS: Church.
HORNACEK: Church, you can't go --
WATTERS: Maybe in California.
HORNACEK: Maybe.
WATTERS: Depends where he worship.
SHIMKUS: No, we both said, no, we don't need Adam Levine Super Bowl shirtless.
WATTERS: Okay, so you guys think you're right about that.
SHIMKUS: Yes.
HORNACEK: Yes.
SHIMKUS: Clearly.
WATTERS: Okay, well, Americans disagree. Abby, Carley, thank you, guys, very much. Up next, "Last Call."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time now for "Last Call." Presidents' Day is Monday. We figured we'd honor the men who heldd office by asking a few people how much they know about past Presidents. Remember this?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my god.
WATTERS: No new --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Policies?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Friends?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Taxes?
WATTERS: He had a famous saying, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Economy? I don't know.
RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
WATTERS: What were they talking about?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Great Wall of China. I don't know.
WATTERS: The Berlin Wall.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. "Justice With Judge Jeanine" is next. And remember, I'm Watters, and this is my world.
