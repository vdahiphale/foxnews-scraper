We had an election that was stolen from us, but you have to gohome now. We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're veryspecial. I know how you feel. But go home and go home at peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER (on camera): Today's extraordinary events come as Democrats take bothGeorgia Senate seats giving them a 50-50 split in the Senate and with VicePresident-Elect Kamala Harris set to be the tie breaking vote achievingeffective control of the majority. As of January 20th, controlling theHouse, the Senate and the White House.Correspondent Rich Edson has been in the thick of the action all afternoonand this evening. He joins us now live up on Capitol Hill. Rich, what's thelatest? Good evening.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret.And over the last 20 minutes or so, the police department's MetropolitanPolice Department here in Washington D.C. and the Capitol Hill PoliceDepartment have cleared the bulk of the mob and demonstrators who have beenhere.So, there's really not all that much going on on the actual Capitol groundshere. We'll take you over this way. This is the perimeter where everybodyhas largely been pushed to.But earlier today, you had thousands of protesters to this point and beyondwho came to the Capitol Building, as you reported many who breached theCapitol Building. And now, we've got a police line right in here.And this is the remainder of it and both -- within the last 15 to 20minutes, there were hundreds if not a few thousand people remaining on thelawn of the Capitol Hill.And those police officers swept down and moved very quickly to finally movepeople off. There was tear gas, there was flashbangs. Much of what we hadseen throughout the day, trying to push folks back from the Capitol.But finally, this is the point in the evening where that has all dispersed.We know that thousands of people who had slowly been leaving after a while,they finally begin to disperse and fully leave this area.And we are seeing that a lot of them have dispersed throughout the city,many have left, but there are those who are within Washington D.C. So,we're trying to figure out what's going in there. And it was a real fullday here in Washington D.C. that culminated in violence here at theCapitol, take a listen.OK, Bret, I guess we don't have that. But we do have reporting now thatthere was a shooting inside the Capitol Building. We are hearing from thepolice that that woman has died as a result of that shooting. We do notknow the circumstances surround that shooting, but we do from some of thevideo that's been posted online, it was involved when people breached theCapitol Building in inside the Capitol Complex.We had police officers throughout the day, and riot gear rushing to thescene trying to reinforce here. So, it appears for the most part that thescene that we had been seeing over the last several hours here, it is much,much more quiet now as people have dispersed throughout the city, Bret.BAIER: You know, Rich, quickly, the presence though -- the securitypresence really doubled quickly, didn't it? I mean, you saw a real step upjust in the past hour or so?EDSON: Oh, absolutely. I'd have to say within the last couple of hours, youbegan to see Metropolitan Police Department which is our police departmenthere in Washington D.C.And remember, there are multiple multiple police departments, federal andlocal police departments. Capitol Hill police are in charge of thiscomplex. D.C. police, they got the city itself. D.C. police startedstreaming up here in vans, in vehicles, running up the hill in riot gear.So, you saw a massive police response from other parts around the city totry to reinforce the Capitol Hill Police Department.BAIER: Rich Edson live on the Hill. Rich, thanks.Let's get the latest on what's happening on the Hill. CongressionalCorrespondent Chad Pergram has status report from the Capitol. Goodevening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Good evening, Bret. Well, where we stand right now is that the Capitolitself appears to be secure. That's something that Capitol police have beenworking on all afternoon, making sure there are no marauders so goingthrough the building, they've been telling that to lawmakers.There was just an announcement that went out over the loudspeaker here atthe Capitol. Telling people on the Capitol grounds that if you are stillout, you're going to be arrested because of this curfew, you have to getout of here. You have to leave the Capitol grounds.Now, it is often said that American history plays out under the Capitoldome and we certainly saw that today January 6th, 2021. An ignominious dayfor democracy especially on an important constitutional day, thecertification of the electoral college.And this was the worst incursion of an institution of American governmentsince the British burned the Capitol on August 24th, 1814 after the Battleof Bladensburg not far from here in suburban Maryland.Now, we're told that the House and Senate may well meet tonight. They wantto show that mob rule will not stand, and democracy will prevail.We don't know if it will be a truncated process when they come back intosession and whether lawmakers who oppose certifying electoral votes willback down from their challenges.Now, the House and Senate they don't have to meet in the Capitol to finishthis process. They don't have to meet here at all, whatsoever. We'll see.But make no mistake, Bret, this was an epic security failure at theCapitol, which is now etched into the history of this building.You know, in the Old House chamber Statuary Hall, there's a statue of Clio,the Muse of History. She looks down on lawmakers recording events inCongress and here on Capitol Hill. We have yet another black entry today inClio's book, Bret.BAIER: OK, Chad, always with the history of there on Capitol Hill, someamazing images throughout the day and throughout the show. We'll show youthese still images, some of them with guns drawn on the House floor, othersas lawmakers are trying to escape at the guidance of Capitol Police. Theimages throughout the day have just been stunning. And throughout thisshow, we'll be bringing them to you live.Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin is actually on the ground with some of theprotesters. Good evening, Mike what can you tell us?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, I can tellyou, Bret, frankly, a lot of the same information you heard reported fromRich Edson, but I can show you a different angle. We're now towards thecenter of the Capitol and you can see the line of Metropolitan Police whoare making certain that no one gets on this lawn on the west side.Behind them, you can see a lot of people and what those are, are morepolice officers. They came and they secured this lawn if you would. And wesaw a lot of them stand down with the riot shields. So, they are back therevery close to the Capitol.Now on the west side of the Capitol, we can say it's a rather calmsituation or a standoff, particularly where you have the police. And youstill out here on First Street, still have a lot of people milling around,waiting to see what's happening next.Now, we came over to this side of the Capitol after the -- after the eastside of the Capitol had largely drawn down, people had gone home. From thewhole time we've been here, we've seen people leaving more and more theywere leaving before the president made his announcement telling people togo home.And then, around 4:00, a little after 4:00, that's when we started to smellthe tear gas. And on that side of the building, but for some damage that wecould see particularly at the top of the steps on the south east entranceof the Capitol -- on the southeast side of the Capitol, I saw some brokenwindows and saw what looked like bullet scars on one of the doors overthere.We came over to this side and that's where we saw a lot of people, we sawthe flashbangs and the tear gas being deployed.And I guess it would be about 45 minutes ago, we saw that large force withthe Metropolitan Police truncheons at the ready clear out this side of theCapitol with very deliberate force. They had the truncheons at the ready.They were knocking guys over. There were scraps on the ground as the policemoved rather rapidly. And they got here to the -- to the Peace Memorial andthey're just holding the line now preventing people from getting back ontothe Capitol grounds, Bret.BAIER: By Mike Tobin, thank you. You can see this image on the screen withthe guns drawn on the House floor. I mean, just one of the stunning imagesand lawmakers ducking down taking cover.And we heard from the House Minority Leader -- Minority Leader earlier,Kevin McCarthy, look at these images at that House door, talking about howhe heard on the radio shots fired.The drama today is hard to overstate. Let's look at what started all ofthis today. President Trump obviously stirring up supporters but duringthis noon time rally, but it devolved once it got to Capitol Hill andthat's where it happened.Let's go to Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts. Seen a lot in hisyears in Washington, nothing like this, I'm sure. John, good evening.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):I've seen a lot of things around the world, Bret but not many that comparedto what we've seen here. But this was a day that was really weeks in themaking as President Trump kept up a constant stream of criticisms andaccusations, complaints about the November 3rd election, really escalatingthe passions and anger of his most devout supporters. It all came to a headtoday, when thousands of those supporters came to Washington to backPresident Trump's final try for a second term.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (voice over): It was a massive crowd that descended on Washingtonto support President Trump in his campaign to overturn the results of theNovember election. The president making clear what he was expecting fromthe vice president who was presiding over the electoral collegecertification.TRUMP: Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of ourConstitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm goingto be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearinggood stories.ROBERTS: President Trump repeatedly insisting that Mike Pence had theauthority to unilaterally accept or reject slates of electors that had beencertified by states and sent to Congress.In a remarkable break with the president, Pence sending a letter tolawmakers saying in part: It is my considered judgment that my oath tosupport and defend the Constitution constrains me from unilateral authorityto determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.As Trump supporters marched to Capitol Hill and laid seeds to the CapitolBuilding, President Trump through four years of unswerving loyalty from hisvice president under the bus tweeting: Mike Pence didn't have the courageto do what should have been done to protect our country and ourConstitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts,not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones, which they were asked to previouslycertify. USA demands the truth.President Trump has labeled Republicans who will not support the challengeto the electors as "The surrender caucus".Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying: to not certify the electoralcollege vote would be the loose thread to begin unraveling democracy.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): This election were overturned by mereallegations from the losing side are democracy would enter a death spiral.We'd never see the whole nation except an election again. Every four yearswould be a scramble for power.ROBERTS: At a rally that preceded the march to the Capitol, President Trumpagain reciting a long list of grievances regarding the November 3rdelection and today adding regardless of what the democratic processdetermines with the certification of electors, he will never accept defeat.TRUMP: We will never give up. We will never concede, it doesn't happen. Youdon't concede when theft is involved. Our country has had enough. We willnot take it anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (on camera): Couple of tweets at a video that the president put outon Twitter to try to de-escalate the situation at the Capitol Building.The president just tweeted again a few minutes ago, make it this what youwill, the president saying of today's events, "These are the things andevents that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is sounceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great patriots who havebeen so badly and unfairly treated for so long." Bret?BAIER: OK. John Roberts, live on the North Lawn. John, thanks. We'veinvited the president to come on to call on to the show. We'd love to talkto him.Let's bring in Wyoming representative Republican Liz Cheney, joins us nowon the phone. She's the House GOP Conference chair.Congresswoman thanks for being here. Where are you now?REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY) (via telephone): Well, we're secure, Bret. I don'twant to say specifically where we are. But, we're secure, we look forwardon a bipartisan basis to returning to the chamber to continue and completeour constitutional obligation of counting the electoral votes.BAIER (voice over): Well, tell me about your experience today. First, youknow, the play-by-play, if you would, but then, what you think about it?CHENEY: Well, I mean, look, I think what's the important is to justrecognize -- we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in anattempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty. Andthere's no question that the president formed the mob, the presidentinvited the mob, the president addressed the mob, he lit the plane. Andthis is -- this is what America is mock.There's just been, you know, absolutely intolerable and unacceptable. Andthe mob will not prevail. You know, we all have taken an oath to theConstitution. It's an oath that we carry out, it doesn't bend, you know, tomob rule, it doesn't bend the political threats.It's an oath under God and we'll carry it out. And what happened today cannever happen again in the United States and the president needs to takeresponsibility for it.BAIER: Congresswoman, he did -- the president did put out a video urgingthe protesters to go home and to be peaceful. But as John just mentioned,the tweet he just sent out, "These are the things and events that happenwhen a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously andviciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly andunfairly treated for so long. Go home with love, in peace. Remember thisday forever."Your thoughts about that tweet and the message the president is sending?CHENEY: Look, you know, the president is abusing the trust of the Americanpeople. He's abusing the trust of the people who supported him. The -- youknow, that the -- we've never in our 245-year history had a presidentrefused to concede and leave office after the Electoral College had voted.And the Electoral College voted on December 14th.And our job here in the Capitol is to count the votes. We will count thevotes, but there are serious questions about the president's involvementand responsibility for what happened here tonight, here today at theCapitol, and it cannot be tolerated.BAIER: Congressman, do you expect to get back at it tonight as far asaction on the House floor?CHENEY: I do. I think that there's agreement that we must do that,agreement that we will do that, that we won't be deterred in completingthis constitutional task. And that agreement is bipartisan.So, I look forward doing that. I think it's really important for us to dothat. It's important for us to send a message to the nation and to theworld that America is not ruled by mob violence. We have, you know, thistremendous history of the peaceful transfer of power. Something that wetake for granted, but Ronald Reagan said it was miraculous.And I think what we've seen today demonstrates how fragile it is and theobligation and the responsibility of everybody in the position of authorityto step up, to make sure that we're abiding by our oath, and to make surethat this insurrection is not allowed to proceed, and that, you know, we'renot going to be ruled by the violence.I also want to say, you've got scores of law enforcement -- the Capitolpolice officers who were injured. It is just absolutely unacceptable. Andthe president's response so far has been completely intolerable andinsufficient.BAIER: Congresswoman Liz Cheney, thank you very much. Stay safe. We arelooking live at D.C. National Guard. Some 1,800 -- 1,100 rather arriving tothe area. They've been mobilized. They are supplementing the police forcethere, both the Metropolitan police in D.C. and also the Capitol police.You can see them with their riot gear on there as they create a surroundingof the Capitol, we're told. And that may take another couple of hours asnight has fallen in D.C. You can see the Capitol dome in the backgroundquite a distance away.And now the job of clearing the Capitol inside to make sure there are noother people in there before they can go through, sort through, and makesure it is safe for the resumption, we believe, of the Electoral Collegecertification efforts today.Let's bring in our panel, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the AmericanConservative Union. Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook PoliticalReport. Byron York, chief political correspondent of the WashingtonExaminer, and Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume.Brit, I want to start with you. You've seen a lot in Washington. We haven'tseen anything like this. What about the president's reaction and what thisday really means?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (voice over): Well, Idon't think there's much doubt, Bret, that the president's actions and hisentire conduct post the election are what led us to this point.He -- if you were a Trump believer, and you believe the extravagant claimshe has made about how this election was stolen, you believe, therefore,that something truly horrible had happened that changes the face of ourrepublic.It is utter nonsense, but he believed it, and he got them to believe it.And believing that, they did what they did today. I sense, Bret, thatthere's a sea change now in the Republican Party as a result of this.Trump's post-election conduct, I think, has split him off from about half,maybe more than that of his voting base. Which is to say this, his votingbase has two elements. One, are the hardcore Trump supporters who will dowhatever he wants, believe whatever he says, will never desert him nomatter what.The rest of them are everyday Republicans who sort of signed on to Trumpbecause they liked what he was doing. They may not have liked what he saidall the time, they may have been put off by his manner, by his vulgarityand the rest of it, but they were with him, and they voted for him.I think those people now and almost certainly have deserted him with -- andif the election were held tonight, he'd lose by far more than he lost thelast time, and I don't think they'll be around for any effort by Trump tobe elected again four years from now.BAIER: Matt Schlapp, you're a believer that this election was stolen. Youhave fought for the president. The things that happened on the Capitoltoday, the mob that got in. I call them the mob, we said protestersearlier, but that's not accurate for the folks who went inside and diddamage inside the capitol. Those are extremists. Is it fair to say that?And despite the fact that there is a lot large portion of that Trump crowdout there that may have just been showing up to be peaceful, the people whostormed the Capitol were extremists and dangerous.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: You know, I was prettyharsh on the Black Lives Matter protesters. And when they encroached theWhite House perimeter, I was there. I actually went into the crowd onenight and said, I was right there when they -- right before they set fireto the Saint John's Church, which is the president's church. I was prettycritical of that.What I considered violent attacks on cops; I feel the same way today. Ifeel like this is way over the line. You know that those cops are someone'ssons and someone's daughter, someone's grandkids, and that will be treatedwith respect.And we need to have a big vigorous First Amendment that allows for massiveamounts of freedom of political speech. And that's what rallies are for.This was well beyond just a rally by these people who, I think, there issome section of these people that intended this maybe all along.They seemed very prepared for it and I think we should condemn it. I thinkit was wrong, I think it's a terrible dark day for our country, and I'mjust still in a little bit of shock overall.BAIER: Well, what about what the president did today and how he's handledit, Matt? I mean, what would you say about all of that?SCHLAPP: Look, I've spent five years with everyone trying to say what thepresident should say or shouldn't say. All I can tell you is my view iswhat happened today does not represent the Trump supporters who I've gottento know and love, the thousands and millions of them who I spent a lot oftime with over the course of the last four years, and really intensely overthe course of the last six months.I think the president was right to tell people to be peaceful, to keep theprotest peaceful. To stop anything that wasn't peaceful. But I think youought to do what he always does. He ought to keep talking to this. BecauseI think there's a lot of Americans out there who are rattled by what theysaw.You know, I understand there's a 16-year-old young woman who was shot. Now,you know, maybe she was doing terrible things and deserve to be shot. Butas we -- when people breach these lines, and they go after cops, you know,where are the -- where are the party that talks about law and order andrespecting cops? We shouldn't be taking them on and challenging them.And, you know, I worked in the Capitol and I worked at the White House. Ithink these are very sacred places. I want people to be able toaggressively disagree with politicians from the other party, but there'sgot to be some rules of the road and some boundaries, and these peoplecrossed it today.BAIER: That woman we reported has died from that gunshot up on CapitolHill.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.BAIER: Byron York, I want to -- I want to read this statement or at leastpart of it from President George W. Bush. "Laura and I are watching thescenes of mayhem unfolding at the seat of our nation's government indisbelief and dismay. It is sickening and heartbreaking sight.This is how election results are disputed in the banana republic, not ourdemocratic republic. I'm appalled by the reckless behavior of somepolitical leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown todayfor institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.The violent assault on the Capitol and disruption of the constitutionallymandated meeting of Congress was undertaken by people whose passions hadbeen inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.Insurrection could do grave damage to our nation and reputation. In theUnited States of America, it is the fundamental responsibility of everypatriotic citizen to support the rule of law.To those who are disappointed in the results of the election, our countryis more important than the politics of the moment. Let the officialselected by the people fulfill their duties and represent our voices inpeace and safety. May God continue to bless the United States of America."A statement by president -- former President George W. Bush. Byron, yourthoughts.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (voice over): Well, hard todisagree with anything that the former president said there. A reallystunning and terrible day. It's amazing to think you had the first and thesecond in line in the presidential line of succession, the vice presidentand the Speaker of the House, together in the same room with a mob tryingto break in to the Capitol. It's really quite stunning.And there is an irony here in the sense that, you know, over the lastseveral months, a lot of downtown Washington, the businesses were boardedup. And a number of Trump reporter -- supporters would say to each other,you know, they're not afraid of violence by Trump supporters, they'reafraid of the left in case Donald Trump is re-elected. They're afraid ofAntifa and the left. And now look at what has happened.And as far as the president's most passionate supporters are concerned,there's no doubt that he's whipped them up about this. And he has whippedthem up long past when his legal options were exhausted. And I think thatwas on December 14th, when the Supreme Court declined to hear the Texascase and the Electoral College voted.So, there's no doubt that they were in Washington. The crowd is inWashington because the president wanted them to be there to protest theElectoral College certification in Congress.And now this has happened, and it's going to be with the president whenhe's -- when he's a former president and long beyond.BAIER: Joining us now, Dan Crenshaw, Republican Congressman from Texas,former Navy SEAL. Congressman, thanks for joining us. Your thoughts on thisday, this moment, and how we got here?REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX) (via telephone): It's atrocious. You know, we'rewatching our fellow Americans storm the Capitol. And what disturbs me themost about seeing some of it is these American flags being carried in asthis is some patriotic duty.Well, I recall wearing an American flag on my shoulder as I stormed myenemies and the enemies of our nation. That's what the flag is for. Todefend this country against our enemies.The people in this Capitol are not your enemy, right? These are our fellowAmericans. This is not what you do and call yourself a patriot. There'snothing to be proud of here. This is not OK. We should be condemned to the-- to the fullest extent. And I'm just -- I'm just saddened, I think, morethan anything and disappointed by what I've seen. It's unacceptable.BAIER: Congressman, what do you say to the people who point to the rallythat happened today and what was said at that rally, and say that it wasigniting what had already been stirred up, but it was really, reallysteering it up to produce what happened.There's all kinds of things online that the people who went into theCapitol were not part of the Trump rally, all of that. We're going to findout who those people are eventually, but they clearly were part of thisrally and they moved to the Capitol together.Your thoughts about that and whether that rally and the president himselfstirred up this and kind of led to this.CRENSHAW: Yes. So many hyped-up this day as this day of reckoning. As this-- as this big win that would happen. So many told -- so many people saidthis would be the last stand, the last fight, the last -- the last effortto win back the republic, it's our 1776.When you use that kind of language, you should not be surprised that peopletend to believe it. And a lot of people saying, it thought this was a game,right?They didn't -- to them, it was all performer to politics. But to others whowere misled and deliberately angered, this was real. And it became reallyreal, and it's not OK.And I want to say something else here. This is exactly what we could expectevery four years if we were to deem this process constitutional. Thisprocess is not constitutional. The founders envisioned this. They knew thatif you put the power within a single body, then that power, or that bodywould receive all sorts of pressure to do what people wanted it to do.This is why we diffuse power to the states to choose electors and elect apresident. This is exactly what we can expect every single time if wedecide that this process is constitutional, this objection process, and wedecide that Congress can simply overturn electors. We are seeing it playout right before our eyes. Many of us have said this all along, this is whyyou can't do this, you cannot accept this precedent. And we did.And we have to stop it. This is a deeply unconstitutional process. I wantedPresident Trump to win, but I, as a member of Congress, cannot overturn anelection. This is fundamentally what this is about. It doesn't meant thatpeople's anger about election irregularities and the bad processes that wesee in many states are invalid. Those are very, very valid concerns, andthey must be addressed. But we must address them in the right way. We canchange laws at the state level.There needs to be a year 2000 Florida awakening for each of these stateswhere we clean it up and we give people certitude that their vote reallycounts. There's nothing more important in this democracy, but therecouldn't be a worse way to solve it then by what happened today day.BAIER:  Congressman, last thing. We have two weeks here, two weeks untilinauguration. And it's going to be a long two weeks if you listen to thepresident and what his message was. He did say let's be peaceful, let'ssupport the law enforcement, go home. But he also said, essentially,continue the fight and this election is not over, and let's continue to tryto overturn it. What should he be saying tonight?CRENSHAW:  I wanted everybody who is objecting, I want the president, Iwanted everybody out in front of those protestors as they were storming thecapitol to be there and say stop. That is the only acceptable outcome. Butyou've got to man up and go down there and say enough is enough. This isn'tOK. I wanted them to say that they misled them, because I think that'sreally what happened here. And that message has to be far more forcefulthan it has been.BAIER:  Congressman Dan Crenshaw, thanks very much for the time, and wewill follow it if you get back on the House floor and continue your job.A lot of things are developing, the Defense Department walking thistightrope tonight, wanting to avoid being seen as law enforcement on theCapitol with soldiers in uniform, preferring to use, obviously, theNational Guard in a backup role.National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon right nowfollowing all of this. And kind of a late development, a story about whatVice President Pence's role is in all of this. Jennifer?JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, there'sbeen a lot of confusion about the role of the D.C. National Guard. Andremember, a request for the National Guard has to come from the mayor'soffice. So Mayor Muriel Bowser requested some D.C. National Guardsmen onMonday. Those were agreed to by the Pentagon. The Army Secretary RyanMcCarthy was put in charge of those troops. There were 340 troops that wereapproved on Monday.Now we have learned that a series of phone calls at about between 2:00 and3:00 today, that is when Vice President Mike Pence from the White House wason a series of short phone calls with the Acting Defense Secretary ChrisMiller, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, and General Mark Milley, the chairmanof the Joint Chiefs, authorizing, allowing the Pentagon to authorize themobilization of 1,100, the entire D.C. National Guard. That is what we'velearned happened.We also have heard that President Trump was not involved in that decision,that it was Mike Pence on those phone calls. And remember, he had just cameback from the capitol having been escorted out by the Secret Service whenthe mob broke into the capitol. So a little bit unusual because those,technically, President Trump would be in the chain of command, and theWhite House is pushing back on that, saying that the president authorizedthe troops. But I'm told it was Mike Pence, the vice president, who was onthose goals with the Pentagon.BAIER:  That's a big development. Do we -- we'll press the White House foranswers on that, about President Trump's role. And do they have a sense ofhow long they're going to be deployed here or what this deployment lookslike?GRIFFIN:  It's an open-ended deployment at this point in time. But what issignificant, and this was true as of Monday when the acting defensivesecretary agreed to mobilize the National Guard, and that was that thesewould be unarmed troops that would be used. They would not be wearing camo,flak jackets. They would be used for basically traffic patrol and forhelping with move crowds, but they were not going to be used in a lawenforcement. That was at Mayor Bowser's request and that was the agreementwith the Pentagon. And that is the agreement for the 1,100 troops who arebeing mobilized. We're told that a call to D.C. National Guard gone out andthey're going to meet at 7:00 at the D.C. armory here in D.C.BAIER:  OK, again, enforcing a curfew now. Jennifer Griffin live at thePentagon, Jennifer, thank you.New information from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Let's get the latest onwhat's happening on the Hill and go back to Chad Pergram there. Chad?CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER:  Good evening, Bret. The House Speaker hasjust put out a statement here, indicating that the House of Representativesis going to come back into session at some point later tonight once theyget the capitol fully secure. She tells members, I look forward to seeingyou later tonight. She says that we knew that today would be a part ofhistory in a positive way. But she said, we are a part of history now. Ashameful picture of our country was put out to the world, instigated at thehighest level.She also says, in consultation with Leader Hoyer and with Clyburn and thePentagon, we decided we should proceed tonight at the capitol once it iscleared for use. She called what happened here today when these marauderscame storming into the building a, quote, shameful assault being made ondemocracy, quote, it was anointed at the highest level of government.And also, and this is something to watch in the coming hours if the Housein the Senate do come back into session later tonight to actually certifythe Electoral College. Will those members who were willing to go to the matand fight for Arizona and Pennsylvania and so on, will they still bewilling to do that with the same level of invective and vitriol? Oneexample of members starting to flip on this, Cathy McMorris Rodgers used tobe the chair of the House Republican Conference, a Republican fromWashington state. She was for fighting and arguing about the certificationof some of these electoral votes. She has now changed her position. Sowatch for that night as members might start to recalibrate their thinking,Bret.BAIER:  Chad, so do we have a timing on when they're going to be clearedout and back on the floor?PERGRAM:  Absolutely not. First of all, they have to make sure that theHouse and Senate chambers are OK. Again, as I said before, they don't haveto meet there necessarily. But you still have members and staff who aresheltering in place in undisclosed locations here in the Capitol Complex.That is part of the problem. We are probably several hours away from this.And again, if some of those members who wanted to contest the electoralvotes back off of their original positions, this will take about 40minutes.BAIER:  Yes, and that is going to take a long time. They were only onArizona when this all happened. Chad, thank you. We'll head back with anybreaking details.Let's get more on the streets of Washington D.C. Correspondent Kevin Corkeout there tonight. Good evening, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening, Bret. I'm on the north sideof the capitol, which has been a very active protest scene throughout theafternoon. We arrived here a little bit after 1:30 this afternoon, and itwas very active and, frankly had been that way right up until around 6:00p.m. eastern time. As you know, that is when the official D.C. curfew wentinto effect.I'm going to step off camera for just a second and allow you to see behindme. We see a long line of law enforcement officials here. As you know,we're talking about multiagency approach to clearing out the crowd herepost curfew, metropolitan police, capitol police. I've seen the NationalGuard on the other side of the capitol.In the distance, on my walk over here from the bureau, I noticed about adozen fire and other ambulances and different law enforcement vehicles upand down this particular avenue. We are talking about Constitution. And Ican still see the red and blue strobes in the distance. But for right now,it's relatively quiet here on the north side of the capitol, in starkcontrast to what we saw earlier today, Bret.BAIER:  OK, panel, thank you -- or, Kevin, thank you very much.I'm going to bring back the panel. Amy Walter, you have been listening into these interviews and these developments. Your thoughts?AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, "COOK POLITICAL REPORT":  It's a prettyremarkable moment that we are in, Bret, and I think the point that Chadmade is a really important one about what Congress does now. You heard fromone of the higher ranking members in Congresswoman Liz Cheney saying thatthis was a terrible moment and instigated by the president of the UnitedStates. I think that this vote needs to happen on the Electoral College andshould be finished with. Other states should be agreed to. The idea thatwe're going to go through multiple ballots here and continue what is afarcical attempt to overturn an election.And I just want to read something that the Senate majority leader saidtoday earlier before the rioters got into the capitol, where he said, in astatement that he noted that he was going to come out against the ElectoralCollege, going against the votes of the Electoral College. He said I willnot pretend such a vote will be a harmless protest gesture while relying onothers to do the right thing. And little did he realize that harmlessprotests gesture would truly turn into what we saw today with the UnitedStates capitol.This election is over. The president apparently will not concede. That doesnot mean that those around him cannot argue that this is over, that whilethe president may not do it, to say to his supporters and anyone else whois listening, the race is over. In 14 days there will be a new president.There will be a peaceful transfer of power. This has to happen now. Thisisn't a joke. There is a woman who is dead.BAIER:  Yes, 100 percent. I have a full screen from the prime minister ofGreat Britain, of the U.K. Boris Johnson, and it says "Disgraceful scenesin U.S. Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world,and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer ofpower." That came from the U.K., Boris Johnson.Brit, there are a number of lawmakers weighing in. Do you think today'sevents change the dynamic for how this vote goes forward, and anybody whowas supporting the challenge or how it develops?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I must say, Bret, this wasnever going to succeed, this protest, this challenge to these electors. Itwas never going anywhere. The votes were never even close to being therefor that.But politically, some of these House members in particular and someSenators as well who were backing this and supporting it were obviouslydoing so because they felt there was this level of support for Trump intheir base made it necessary for them to do so politically. This day andthese events and the reaction to it may change that calculus. I suspectthey will all go through the motions, but I bet a bunch of them are wishingthat they hadn't done this, that they weren't supporting this. They arealready committed to it, I guess. But I bet a lot of them probably regretit now and may regret it even more later, because this is an event that isgoing to turn off the American people in a big way.And you saw leaders of the Republican Party, I can't think of one of anydimension who is really backing this. Liz Cheney, Mitch McConnell, MikePence, in fact, the list goes on. Something has changed in the RepublicanParty today, in my judgment, make no mistake about it.BAIER:  You mention Mike Pence. And the statement he released just beforethe proceedings started, literally at about 1:00 p.m. eastern time. He said"It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend theConstitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determinewhich electoral votes should be counted and which should not." And thatmade the president very angry, and he sent out another tweet, Matt. Is ittime, 14 days from inauguration, for the president to come out and dosomething on camera where he concedes? Is that even possible with thispresident?MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Let me get to, when youstarted off the panel in the show, you talked about these claims of voterirregularities. I would like just to take a minute on that, because that iswhat this is all about. I'm 53-years-old. I've spent my whole adult life inpolitics. When I was asked to go to Las Vegas to try to ascertain whathappened in Nevada, nobody really knew. It was a little bit of a black box.And I was shocked. Quite honestly, I was shocked to find tens of thousandsof votes that we could prove should not have legally been in the count. Bythe end it was over 100,000 votes. And all those exhibits were sent to thejudges, each step in the legal process. And the judges really had no desireto look at any of the evidence because they viewed it as a politicalquestion.BAIER:  So Matt, I just want to interrupt you. I just want to interruptyou. I got it, and I do hear you.SCHLAPP:  But don't I have a right to talk about that? Because that is whatthis is all about. It's all about --BAIER:  But there are 60 court cases, you couldn't find one judge, Trumpjudges, any judge to get you a hearing to the evidence that you're layingout? The president spent all this time talking about it, and we now havehad a certification in all 50 states. And now you're saying there is notone judge anywhere?SCHLAPP:  If I could just finish. In the state of Michigan, it has beensaid several times that the president has exhausted all of his legal steps.The state of Michigan, excuse me, the state of Georgia just gave a judge, adesignated judge yesterday, that case has not even gone to court.So people can dismiss it and say that's not a real thing. All I can tellyou is that I've been briefed on what happened in Georgia and the illegalvotes cast that are in this count would be enough to switch the result. AndI know that to be the case in Nevada.So I think this. I would like to see this country heal. It only heals ifthe vast 50 percent of the country that believes that this illegal votinghas been systemic and widespread has the chance to run its full course.Everyone in this process who has tried to short circuit that, includingjudges that won't even look at the evidence, they are causing us to be moredivided. Now, this is all going to be over and we're going to have onepresident.BAIER:  OK, I hear you, I hear you, Matt, but listen.SCHLAPP:  And we're going to have to figure out how to live with each otherand heal as a country.BAIER:  Let me play a sound bite from today's rally.SCHLAPP:  I am listening.BAIER:  And this is Rudy Giuliani and Don Jr. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  Let's have trial by combat.(APPLAUSE)GIULIANI:  I'm willing to stake my reputation, the president is willing tostake his reputation on the fact that we're going to find criminalitythere.DONALD TRUMP JR., PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON:  These guys better fight forTrump, because if not, guess what. I'm going to be in your backyard in acouple of months. If you are going to be the zero and not the hero, we'recoming for you, and we're going to have a good time doing it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Now, you're talking about unity, you're talking about comingtogether, you're talking about letting court cases go. That's not whatthey're talking about.SCHLAPP:  Well, I said first you have to adjudicate the wrongdoing.Remember, the type of wrongdoing I saw in Nevada and was just briefed on inGeorgia, these are felonies, Bret. These are serious problems. In the stateof Nevada you had widespread, people voting in more than one state, peoplewho didn't live in Nevada voting. You can't do that in a democracy.Usually, there is always some of this, and it's more minimal. And what theDemocratic Party and their allies have done very well is, because of thisuniversal mail-in ballot system, they were able to do this on a verywidescale. And in these states --BAIER:  And that's a fair point. Article two and state legislatures,however, the Supreme Court didn't take it up either.So Brit Hume, just weigh in on this. I want to get an update from ChadPergram, but just your thoughts on what has just been talked about.HUME:  The question all along has not been whether this was a perfectelection. There never is such a thing. The question has not been whetherthere was significant irregularities. There were a lot of things that weredone, particularly prior to Election Day, that were manifestly unfair, andthat I think are the main reason that Trump might have a claim to say thatthe election was unfair.But unfair and illegal and subject to reversal are different mattersentirely. And I have read through a number of the opinions written byjudges in this case, and it is not true that in those cases, that I haveread, at least, that they didn't look at the evidence. They did. In mostcases, their opinions, and they're pretty strong, demolished the so calledevidence.So I understand Matt has a grievance, Trump had a grievance, and we do needto do something about the kind of mail-in voting situation we had where itwas being done in states which had never really tried it before, and itmanifestly helped the other side. But that doesn't make the electionstolen. It just doesn't.And Trump was saying all kinds of wild things today, including his claim,for example, that Mike Pence had the authority to reject electors, toreject the certifications. He does not. His job here is purely ministerial.And when he said he couldn't do that, he was right. He can't under theConstitution. So that's where we are.BAIER:  That is where we are. And what happened today cannot happen. Let'sget the latest from Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram. Again, astatus report, Chad.PERGRAM:  We are told in the past few minutes, Bret, that there is a goal,and that's one senior source told me here, for the House and Senate to comeback around 8:00. But they were very skeptical that that would happen. Theydo intend at this stage to try to finish the certification of the ElectoralCollege.But the problem is both chambers, both the House chamber and the Senatechamber are trashed. They are these escape hoods all over the place.There's broken out glass. They're just a mess. The floors are slippery. Andkeep in mind, we're doing this during a pandemic, and so they can't exactlythrow those protocols out the window. So they thought that that goal of8:00 was a little ambitious. But we do expect them to come back at somepoint tonight and try to finish, but maybe as early as 8:00, Bret.BAIER:  But again, this is a process that is going to take some time. Wewent to Alabama, Alaska, and Arizona.PERGRAM:  That's right. And keep in mind that the House and Senate weremeeting separately. So even if you want to say, OK, we're really not goingto go through and go to the mat and contest Arizona, you still have to haveroll call vote on that, because that's a live question in both the Houseand Senate, and then come back into session in the joint session and thensee whether or not they are going to continue with any of these otherelectoral challenges maybe to Pennsylvania or Georgia, or maybe someRepublicans might pack it in.If they do pack it in after those roll call votes to certify Arizona ornot, or you could do it by unanimous consent or a voice vote, that couldmake it pretty quick, frankly. You come back into session, and you could bewrapped up in 30 or 40 minutes.BAIER:  Chad, thank you. Let's heard to Mike Emanuel, chief congressionalcorrespondent. Quite a day on the hill. What do you know, mike?MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, I've beentalking to some of the key players who have been challenging thecertification of the election, and they're really trying to figure out whattheir next play is at this point. Obviously, they are still upset about the2020 election, but they recognize there's an optics problem. They've haveseen all this unfolding on their TV sets as we have, as we've been talkingabout it. And they recognize that a lot of people on their side of theaisle are totally aggravated and that some are starting to flip on them.And so they are really looking ahead to try to figure out how much of afight to put up as this goes forward, presumably later tonight. But I'mtold no final decisions have been made, but there are serious conversationsunderway about how they're going to play it, because they recognize theirbases still is aggravated about the election, but the reaction today reallyhurt the cause going forward, Bret.BAIER:  Do we know anything from Capitol police about the people? Forexample, the woman who was shot at the House, the door of the Housechamber, do we know anything yet about specifics?EMANUEL:  So far we have not heard specifics. Obviously, it's still a veryactive scene. We are in lockdown here at the Russell Senate OfficeBuilding, basically told to shelter in place, and so they have a veryactive scene going on. I think they are still trying to assess who theyhave arrested, who they are dealing with on the front lines of this disputetonight. But bottom line, we have not heard anything about the woman wholost her life earlier today.BAIER:  And can you tell us, is the tear gas smell gone from the capitol?EMANUEL:  It is dissipating, let's put it that way. It was bad earlier, butit is definitely clearing out. And so what would anticipate with somecleaning and perhaps some cleanup of some of the mess left behind that theymay be able to get back in session in the next hour-and-a-half or so.BAIER:  All right, Mike, we'll head back for any details.Back with the panel. Byron, I think the question a lot of people have isabout security and about the Capitol police. Why didn't they know this wasa possibility? They deal with tons and tons of protests all the time. But asiege, a lot of people all at once can overwhelm security quickly. And wejust don't have a sense of what the situation was.BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":   No, andbelieve me, there is going to be a commission to investigate the events ofthis day, I feel absolutely certain. To expand a little bit about what Mikewas just reporting, this effort, this Republican effort to challengeElectoral College results has just blown up in their face because of theseevents today.There were really two different kind of efforts in the House and in theSenate. A lot of people in the House really did want to overturn theresult, change the result of this election, while a number of people in theSenate said they were just trying to study things. Ted Cruz and the 10senators he'd gotten to go along with him on this challenge were proposinga commission, a quickie commission to do a quickie investigation of theelection results and weren't really coming out in favor of actuallyoverturning the results.But for both of them, this has absolutely blown up in their face, and theidea of doing it with multiple states, as you pointed out, they just got toArizona, the idea of doing it with multiple states taking hours and hoursand hours, I think that is probably going to be completely out the windowas of now.BAIER:  Yes. Let's head back to the White House, the North Lawn, JohnRoberts. John, info?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  A couple of things, Bret. First ofall, the tweet that I read you earlier in the program was deleted by thepresident along with that video that he tweeted out to try to diffuse thesituation on Capitol Hill. Unclear at this point why those two things weredeleted, though they did fall under criticism for being somewhatinsensitive. The first tweet, or at least the tweeted video, the presidentagain talked about the election being stolen as he did in the writtentweet. It's possible he got a little bit of blowback on that.The other thing is over who called out the National Guard. "The New YorkTimes" reporting that it was Vice President Mike Pence, not the presidentwho called out the Guard. I was told just a few minutes ago by ChrisMiller, the acting defense secretary's chief of staff Kash Patel that itwas, in fact, the president who authorized the deployment of the NationalGuard, that he and Miller have been talking for a couple of days aboutcontingency plans for the march, making sure that buildings, the federalbuilding here in Washington, D.C., as well as citizens were protected.Mayor Muriel Bowser a couple of days ago asked for 340 National Guards.They were authorized right away and deployed. And it wasn't until, I'm toldby Patel, until after the siege began at the Capitol Building that she putout the call for the National Guard, the rest of the National Guardcontingent to be brought in, and that was immediately authorized by thepresident through his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. So potentially that goessome distance to clearing that up. Bret?BAIER:  The National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien tweeting out that hehad spoken with Vice President Pence, he's a genuinely find and decent man.He exhibited courage today, as he did at the capitol on 9/11. As aCongressman, I'm proud to serve with him, kind of backing up Pence's movestoday?ROBERTS:  Yes, and I've got to tell you, after unswerving loyalty to thepresident over the past four years, even some very difficult circumstancesthat have been much publicized, it was a remarkable break between the vicepresident and the president. The vice president has got 16 more days inoffice, potentially he's looking beyond that. He did say, his office didsay that he would conduct the proceedings on the capital, at the capitalwith the fidelity to the law and the Constitution. And maybe he just sawwhat the president was saying about what authority the vice president didand didn't have as a bridge too far. And the vice president said, look, I'mgoing to clear this up, and sent that letter to members of Congress to say,I do not have the authority to act unilaterally here. He didn't say despitewhat the president says, but that's basically what in net effect of it was.But after this long being in lockstep with the president, to see that breaktoday really was quite extraordinary and something we haven't seen before.Bret?BAIER:  John, last thing here. There a lot of people who say, listen, thepresident has a lot of supporters. After today, you have people who arealways his critics saying that he's leading in insurrection, that the vicepresident should lead the 25th Amendment and take him out in the two weeksbefore the inauguration. Is there any sense of a worry about today yet,about his future because of today affecting this president, how hedismounts from his office?ROBERTS:  Yes, and I think we saw that with the vice president, with whatMitch McConnell said as well. It's quite possible that President Trumpwould find the White House a fairly lonely place to be politically for thenext 16 days.BAIER:  All right, John, thank you very much.Finally tonight, we'll take a look back at the sights and sounds of ahistoric day in Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CROWD:  Stop the Steal!
