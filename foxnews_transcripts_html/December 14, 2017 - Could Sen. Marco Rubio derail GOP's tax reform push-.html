KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five."
President Trump promised Americans a giant tax cut for Christmas. He expressed confidence again today it's happening. Republicans plan to unveil a final merged house and Senate bill tomorrow with the aim of voting sometime early next week. Will it pass? Republican senator Marco Rubio says he's a no unless the child tax credit for the working poor is expanded. The president believes the senator will come around.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he'll be there. He's really been a great guy, very supportive. I think that Senator Rubio will be there. We're doing very well on the tax front. We have tremendous support. We have tremendous spirit. It will be the largest tax cut in the history of our country. And I will say the Republican senators and congressmen and women have been incredible. So I think we will get there. It will be in a very short period of time. It will be the greatest Christmas present that a lot of people have ever received. It will be something special.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: It will be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote.

GUILFOYLE: All right. Dana, so this is to be expected by Schumer because, of course, they don't want this to go through, so anything that they can do to be obstructionist to prevent this from being implemented is to be expected. 
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yeah, and it's not going to happen. And also, I read today that they said like it's some false deadline, but the Republicans have always said they wanted to get this to the president's desk before Christmas, at the end of the year. And so, it's been right on track, and this is before the Washington Post story came out about Roy Moore. The deadline that the Republican set was after Obamacare repeal and replace failed. So, that's not going to happen. They're not going to wait. I think the Democrats -- they're trying to find something to say. But I thought today was really interesting to watch the president. He's just so close to getting this done. I think it to be expected that you would have a couple members who really want something to press their advantage right now because there is this deadline. They do want a little bit more on the child tax credit. We can debate the merit of that. Ivanka Trump wants that as well. So, they know that they have a chance to possibly get that. I don't think that at the end of this that they will actually not vote for it. There could be a little bit of room to play with on the corporate rate because the president wanted 15, agreed to 20. Now it's at 21. Marco Rubio's point is, well, going to 22 percent isn't that big a deal. The corporations are still going to be happy and we could actually do more to help the working poor. I don't know if that will be persuasive, but it could be with the president. 
GUILFOYLE: All right. So a little bit of last-minute negotiations and deal making, Jesse.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah. He's using his leverage, and he probably going to be effective because the deadline is fast approaching. I think this deal is much better than what we saw before. I don't love the tax cut. It's not big or bold enough, but it's gotten better in conference. They're dropping the top rate from 39 right now to 37, which is going to have a similitude effect. That's good. And 20 percent is better than 25 percent for the corporate rate reduction, which is also positive. And the Obamacare mandate, Juan, that will get repealed and that is a huge accomplishment for the Republican congress. No one thought that was even going to happen. And then, we talked about this, people who live in high tax states like New York and California will be able to deduct your state and local taxes up to 10,000. Not all of it, but up to 10,000, so that's a goof thing. So I think this train is moving towards the station and it's going to happen. I don't know if it's going to be the best Christmas present everyone is going to get because it's not as generous towards, I think, lower class and middle class Americans. It's also about $38 a week, but it's better than nothing. And it's very similitude.

WILLIAMS: Even the corporations say it's not going to create jobs. 
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Let me just say this is so absurd and crude and rude and unfair in the Christmas season. But let me say something to what Dana was talking about. This thing is far shakier than anybody wants to pretend. All the Republicans want to do is say this is on a train, we're leaving the station. It's about to happen. It's not only -- not only do have Bob Corker, rightly, as a true conservative worried about blowing up the deficit, but you have Marco Rubio now saying, hey, what about working people? What about the working poor? What about Mike Lee? He's on the edge too. What about McCain and Corker? Both of them sick. May not be able to vote. And then, of course, Doug Jones. If Doug Jones gets in there and he's the rightly elected senator from Alabama, and it's only because Mitch McConnell wants to play parliamentary games that his sitting is being delayed, then all all of a sudden, the math shifts radically against this horrible bill.

PERINO: No, the only think I would add that there's another thing that's happening here, the house always talked about that they pass all these bills and gets stalled in the Senate. Actually, what happens is Senate has a different procedure. The other thing in addition to the individual mandate getting repeal that the Republicans have wanted for a really long time and it's not been possible is drilling in Anwar. And that actually would be a part of this bill.
WILLIAMS: See, the reindeer gets celebrating.

Everything is awful. That's why nobody believes you. I don't mean you, Juan, but the left, because everything is the end of the world. That neutrality repealed today.

And under Trump, which is quite possibly the most transparent presidency I've lived in. You see everything -- it's not pretty -- it's not pretty, but you're learning. You learn about the media, how the media lies. You learn about all the infighting. You learn about the flaws of the presidency. You learn about everything.

GUTFELD: You know what's amazing about that though -- we have so many people consumed by Russian collusion and palace infighting, you say nothing's happened?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president did speak to the speaker not too long ago and made sure that the speaker knew very clearly and in no uncertain terms that if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it. The speaker assured the president that those were not accurate reports, and that they look forward to working together for a long time to come.

GUILFOYLE: Yeah.
PERINO: OK. But I think we've seen a couple things happen that are different, there's been personnel changes in the White House. You see the president actually thinking, oh, wait a second, they are trying to actually pass my agenda. Passing a lot of bills in the house and getting some of the stuff done in the Senate where they can, but also being supportive, especially on judges in particular.

PERINO: And then, you have the Paul Ryan's office saying no, this is not happening, it's not happening. Now, I will just say that's what Speaker Boehner's office said right up until the day that he made it -- kind of a sudden decision if you read the political piece that says overnight, he woke up and he was like, you know what, I think I'm good here, and he resigns all of a sudden. So I don't think that's necessarily going to happen, but I think it is interesting and good if you're a Republican to say, OK, now they all look like we're on the same team with President Trump as the head coach and pulling people together, if they do get this bill passed, the tax reform bill with the other pieces that are in it. I think that successful feel good to them, and they'll be able to figure out what they can do in a second year which is not a lot, legislatively. Those are usually the most difficult.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OMAROSA: I wanted to make the one-year mark. That was one of the goals that I've set out too. And then get back to my life. I like to hear all of these interesting tales, but I have to tell you that they're 100 percent false. 
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Did you try to enter the residence? Did that happen?

UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Such as? 
OMAROSA: Because I can't expand upon it because I have to still go back and work with these individuals, but when I have a chance to tell my story, Michael, quite a story to tell. As the only African- American woman in this White House as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally. It has affected my community and my people. And when I can tell my story it is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.

PERINO: That's it, OK. Jesse, have any insight scope on this? You've got lots of sources down there. 
WATTERS: Oh, no. I do not have the inside scoop on Omarosa, but she does rub people the wrong way. I've met her a few times. She's been nice to me a few times. Other times she corrected the way a pronounced Omarosa. I still don't know if I have it correctly. I don't like how the media has treated her. The whole thing. So Trump hires a very intelligent successful black woman, and what they do is they say, oh, she's a joke. And then, when he fires an intelligent and successful black woman, they say, oh, you can't do that. Where's the diversity? So it's like no matter what Trump does he'll be criticized. I think she stuck around so long because she's so loyal and we know the president values loyalty. I don't really know what she did in the White House. I still think that's a question a lot people are asking. It was the office of -- it's a public liaison. So you build support with outside groups for the president's agenda.

PERINO: Sounds like you know what she did.
WATTERS: I believe -- well, I don't know if I've seen a lot of results in that department because I think there's a lot of opportunity there when you think of all the things he's put forward to generate a lot more support when it comes of people in congress, outside groups, associations or corporations. 
PERINO: I thought one of the toughest questions that Sarah Sanders got today, Kimberly, was the question of, so she got fired yesterday or resigned, whatever. She's escorted out. She's not there any longer, but she gets to be paid by the taxpayers until January 20, because she said she wanted to last a year. So maybe her book title would be, my year at the White House.
WATTERS: That's your inside scoop.
PERINO: I'm just assuming. 
GUILFOYLE: Yeah. That means that is true. She's going to be paid for the remainder of the year. So maybe that's sort of the deal that she brokered, you know, on her way out. Therefore, it's a full year. But also, you have other people that were there have stayed on the books for a period of time as well. Like Reince Priebus and things like that. So, we'll see what happens. I think it's very clear from the tease there when she was talking about that she tried to, you know, push a book. She's going to tell her story and we'll see who she, you know, identifies and lays out in terms of people that she was unhappy with about their policies or viewpoints. I mean, one thing is she's a savvy businesswoman. She got a story to tell, so you've got to be aware of that when you hire somebody in that capacity. 
PERINO: I guess, rumors might not be true, but it is kind of fun to imagine her storming the east wing, demanding to see the president. 
GUTFELD: It's an American tragedy. Trump lost a stalker. She was the official stalker. She trafficked on the idea that she had a special relationship with your boss. If you've ever worked in a place where somebody claims that they have a special relationship, it's a fabrication, it's a way to like -- kind of rub your face in it. But you know what, I see a huge potential here for a reality show. Who's out this week? You've got Omarosa. You've got Roy Moore. Roymarosa? They move into a house in Alabama and they live together, and they just see how things work out. It's kind of like the worst idea I've ever had. 
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: It sounds like a drink.
PERINO: Or they can get contributor ship at a cable TV network providing some insightful commentary about the goings-on in the White House. 
PERINO: Juan, let me ask you for a quick comment because we've got some news break. 
WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, obviously, what's striking here is the John Kelly, the chief of staff, really couldn't stand and really was pushing to get her out, and that's the inside story. And then, the question is exactly how she got pushed out. But to me, she didn't do the job that Jesse articulated, which is to build relationships with the black community or anybody else. And Jesse, her primary credential that she was a celebrity, that she was a celebrity who got fired on Celebrity Apprentice.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: This woman had no reason -- I mean, black, white, Asian -- I don't care what. There was no reason for her to be there. 
WATTERS: Manage to maneuver herself to a very prestigious position. So, she's obviously intelligent. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, that's great. In other words, everybody who was on a hustle deserves to be there? 
WATTERS: You're calling her a hustler?
GUTFELD: She was definitely better than Gary Busey, the other choice.
WILLIAMS: Oh, I didn't realize. 
PERINO: All right. We have breaking news tonight regarding the FBI's investigation into the Hillary Clinton email scandal. Some brand-new development right after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Breaking news on the Clinton email investigation. Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is live in D.C. with details. Catherine? 
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thanks, Juan. Within the last 2 minutes, Fox News has obtained a letter that was sent this afternoon to FBI director Christopher Wray from the Senate homeland security committee. But what's key about this letter is we believe it's the first time we've seen one of the original drafts of Director Comey's exoneration statement from July of last year that recommended against criminal charges in the Clinton email case. I have the five pages of that exoneration statement here. And we've been combing through it here at Fox News. And there're really two big takeaways. Number one, this term, grossly negligent, was removed from the draft at least twice and it was downgraded to extremely careless, and that was the language that Director Comey used in his public statement. And we know based on our reporting that the removal of the term grossly negligent was made by this FBI agent Peter Strzok, who sent these anti-Trump texts. The reason that term matters is because gross negligence is the legal standard under the federal statute for prosecution for the mishandling of classified information. 
The other key thing, and we haven't seen this in any media reports until now, is that they made a change about the likelihood that a hostile actor was able to penetrate Hillary Clinton's email server. And the original drafts said that given the combination of factors, talking about the lack of security with the server and the fact that it was a target, we assess it is reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's private email account. And in the public statement by Director Comey, that was downgraded to the term, possible, that they access the Clinton email server, and the hundreds of classified messages that it contained. So bottomline, we've got one of the original drafts of the exoneration statement. It shows a key term grossly negligent was dropped, softened at least twice, and that the original statement said that it was likely that the server had been accessed, have been hacked by foreign actors or hostile actors, and that was not included in that final public statement, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Catherine, thank you so much. 
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
WILLIAMS: That's so interesting. Dana, what do you make of this? 
PERINO: Well, a couple of things. First of all, James Comey has resurfaced on Twitter, and he sends a few cryptic tweets now and then. They're usually in response to something that's happening in the news or to the president. 
WATTERS: Tick-tock.
PERINO: And -- not quite those. But I do think that -- I know that the investigations are ongoing, but at some point you have to wonder if, to the benefit of the FBI and to the American people, if there doesn't need to be some sort of public accounting by him sooner than later. 
I think that we -- I felt like I kind of knew the part about the removal of the standards, the "grossly negligent." 
WILLIAMS: "Grossly negligent" versus "extremely careless," yes.
PERINO: I thought we sort of knew that. This question about, that it was reasonably likely, that still is not proof that it happened. 
So I don't know what Strzok was doing. Maybe he was pulling one over on James Comey or perhaps he was just persuasive either on the merits or for some other nefarious reason. But James Comey owns those words. 
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: He's the one. When you sign off on it as the principal, when you speak them, they are yours. So Peter Strzok might've been a bad actor possibly. I don't know. But I do think that James Comey has to own it, and he probably should talk about it sooner than later. 
WILLIAMS: So Kimberly...
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WILLIAMS: ... you're in the prosecution business. At least you used to be. So grossly negligent...
GUILFOYLE: I still prosecute you every day, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Thank you. "Grossly negligent" versus "extremely careless." Some people say it's the same thing. What do you think? 
GUILFOYLE: Well, no, it isn't. I mean, one is a higher standard and more egregious example of a violation here. That's why one would be prosecutable and one wouldn't. So in terms of the intention and what occurred, that would be persuasive. 
And then you would take something like this where you have that evidence, that information. Then it should be the purview of the A.G. to be able to decide, in fact, whether you should proceed forward on a charge. So that's, like, another example of, you know, James Comey overstepping his bounds by, in fact, trying to make the decision as to whether or not it would be sufficient evidence and rising to that level. 
So what it looks like is they actually tried to tip the scale.
WILLIAMS: OK.
GUILFOYLE: And that is not the job of the FBI. And that's why what Dana is saying that he's going to have to make a statement about this and own it, because he's the one that got up there and read the statement and made that determination, et cetera. So I think we need to hear from him. We need to hear from Strzok. 
And it's very disturbing. And anybody, whether you're Republican or Democrat, declined to state and independent, you should be concerned about this. Because this goes to the heart of, you know, our top investigatory agency and the job that they needed to do to be fair and impartial. 
WILLIAMS: Jesse and Greg, the other key point that Catherine said was, instead of the --saying that there was likely that it was the server being hacked, it just said possible. What do you guys make of that? 
GUTFELD: Do you want us to answer it together? 
WILLIAMS: Or...
WATTERS: Let's hold hands. 
WILLIAMS: Go ahead, Greg.
WATTERS: You want me to say something?
GUILFOYLE: However you're most comfortable. Yes.
WATTERS: Go ahead.
WILLIAMS: Well, that's the last time I throw a jump ball. 
GUTFELD: The edits show that they were going out of their way to help Hillary Clinton, which ironically preserved her candidacy, which then elected Donald Trump. By that election, ironically now, allowed us to find out that they went out of their way to help Hillary Clinton. This is what's so fantastic about this. That they -- what they did ended up creating the opposite result. 
GUILFOYLE: Opposite day. 
PERINO: That's true.
GUTFELD: It's true.
GUILFOYLE: An opposite presidency. That's what happened.
GUTFELD: Crazy laugh.
WATTERS: Juan, I hate to correct you right to your face like this but last week...
GUTFELD: You don't hate it. 
WATTERS: ... we had a debate about whether or not it was hacked; and you said no, no, no. 
WILLIAMS: It wasn't. That's what -- that's exactly what...
WATTERS: Now we have the FBI saying it was reasonably likely that it was penetrated, and then they decided, oh, it was possible. So either way, there's a chance it was hacked. 
WILLIAMS: In other words, they don't have any proof. They don't have any proof.
WATTERS: But hackers don't leave footprints, Juan. That's why they're so sophisticated.
WILLIAMS: Get out of town.
WATTERS: What do you know about it?
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: What do you know?
WATTERS: President Obama said on camera when he was asked about this, there is no national security at risk. 
WILLIAMS: Right.
WATTERS: This is just a small thing. So that goes against that.
And this isn't the first time he's been pressured to change language. I know it was his underling here, but Loretta Lynch, the DOJ had, when she said, "I want you to call the investigation 'a matter.' Don't call it an investigation."
GUILFOYLE: Remember that?
WATTERS: "Just call it 'a matter'." And he caved. So Comey has a record of being persuaded... 
PERINO: He has answered that. Come on.
WATTERS: ... by a bunch of people.
PERINO: He answered that, though. 
WATTERS: What did he say?
PERINO: He said that FBI investigations are matters. So he thought that it was, like, equal.
WATTERS: But it's another example of him doing something to benefit the Hillary Clinton campaign. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, please. This is so ridiculous.
GUTFELD: Which elected Trump. That's the beauty of this.
WILLIAMS: Let me just say you should not go into a case with some kind of prejudice against the person being investigated. And yet you guys now say, "Oh, yes..." 
PERINO: But that's what the president's supporters are saying now about Strzok regarding the Mueller investigation. 
WILLIAMS: But there was no prejudice against Hillary or Trump but that doesn't serve the conspiracy theories. 
WATTERS: Yes, there was. 
WILLIAMS: Let me just...
WATTERS: We talked about it all this week, Juan. The attacks...
WILLIAMS: Oh, you get out of town. Mr. Conspiracy here.
Ahead on "The Five," Mr. Gregory on campus coddling patrol. Why some colleges have now turned into petting zoos. Next.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: To help fight stress of upcoming finals, colleges are using therapy llamas. University of South Florida and Radford University are trucking in llamas and other beasts to help students cope. 
So this is great for the students, poor things. But what about the llamas who have to absorb the noxious, annoying angst of fragile idlers as they moan about their insulated existence and perhaps the easiest phase of their comfy lives? 
Yes, some studies show that pets lower stress, but what about the stress of the pet? Talk about torture. Imagine being a llama and you're bussed miles from the comforts of a pleasant petting zoo only to have some whiny bozo with issues running their bony, stinky fingers through your gorgeous fur. 
Imagine a poor bunny -- yes, they're using bunnies, too -- forced to sit on the lap of a gender studies major griping about how studying has really cut into her social justice puppetry theater. I'd put these critters on suicide watch, because if I were an alpaca, guinea pig or a slow loris, I'd hurl myself into traffic before becoming a stress sponge for these pampered slackers. 
And where will this end anyway? When these precious pupils graduate, how will they handle the real world? Will llamas accompany you to a job interview? Yes, that will go over well. Well, unless it's this one.

GUTFELD: My stress levels have already plummeted. Thanks, Lorenzo. 
GUILFOYLE: Wow. Was that a real block? 
GUTFELD: It is a real block, Kimberly, and I'm going to you first. Isn't this animal abuse? The poor llamas are having a good time, and they've got to sit there and be petted by, like, neurotic kids. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Don't they, like, spit viciously at you? 
PERINO: They can.
GUILFOYLE: No, really. If you'd get too close and try to mess with it. So this might be the llamas' revenge. This is all, like...
PERINO: It's, like, gross spit, too.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. It's really -- I think it's not good. It might be, like...
GUTFELD: You know what you do? You go there, if they spit -- you have them spit on your driver's license, and it is llama-nating. 
PERINO: Very good. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, boy. Producers, you let them do this.
GUTFELD: I don't know. Animal abuse?
PERINO: I -- I had a very different college experience. 
GUTFELD: Yes. I had No-Doz. In finals, I'd just pop No-Doz. You remember those pills? 
WILLIAMS: Yes, you had speed. That's what it was.
GUTFELD: Anybody has any, you know my address.
PERINO: I never tried one of those. I was too afraid. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. GUILFOYLE: 
WATTERS: I'm surprised that fraternity boys haven't stolen the llamas and gone and, like, drank with it.
GUTFELD: Yes. 
WILLIAMS: Can I ask a question? Why do you...
GUILFOYLE: That's what they do.
WILLIAMS: Why do you regularly beat up on college students? 
GUTFELD: I do not regularly beat them up. I'm not even allowed on the campuses, Juan.
GUILFOYLE: Neither is Jesse.
WATTERS: By court order. 
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.
GUILFOYLE: Jesse, you're never allowed.
GUTFELD: Colleges aren't -- most college students are now becoming more conservative, more libertarian, because they're rebelling against the social justice...
GUILFOYLE: The antithesis of it, yes.
GUTFELD: They're the new rebels. 
WILLIAMS: Excuse me, where did you go to college? 
GUTFELD: I went to Berkeley. But that's a long time ago.
WILLIAMS: Mr. Left-wing. 
GUILFOYLE: Berzerkly.
WATTERS: I think the llamas are at Berkeley. Isn't that -- that was it.
GUILFOYLE: They came over to UC Davis now. We used to be normal. I don't know what happened.
WILLIAMS: I just think college is pretty competitive and even to get into Berkeley, you've got to be really good. And then to succeed, I think... 
GUILFOYLE: Top 3 percent of the country. 
WILLIAMS: So why are you picking -- why are you making them into snowflakes? 
GUTFELD: Here's -- here. You know what it is? I see what you're saying, Juan. You know that the Democratic Party needs llamas. Because Trump is breaking the brain.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: And so you need to pet. Like to get through this week, you've got to pet a llama.
WILLIAMS: Send those llamas to Alabama. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my...
WILLIAMS: A llama in 'Bama. 
GUTFELD: Actually, I think it's -- I think it's fine. Let them have the pets. 
GUILFOYLE: I think it's so ridiculous.
WATTERS: I'm having a llama on my show next weekend. 
GUTFELD: Really?
WATTERS: Yes. And exclusive. Llama exclusive. We're going to talk to one of these llama professors. 
GUILFOYLE: By the way, if they do social media with a lot of it, how are you going to get a job in the future if they're, like, hanging out with llamas and needing comfort and stress reduction? You have spit all over your face? No one wants you. 
WILLIAMS: If you went to Conservative U., they'd cut that llama up into steaks. That's what they'd do.
GUTFELD: You know what? 
GUILFOYLE: Or booze (ph).
GUTFELD: I hope so. All right. An update on Piegate next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(MUSIC: LENNY KRAVITZ, "FLY AWAY")
GUILFOYLE: I like him. Why are you mean?
WATTERS: Not a Lenny Kravitz fan, I guess, Gutfeld?
GUTFELD: No, I'm not. 
WATTERS: All right. Remember Piegate? It's back. Press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeting out some new pictures to prove she can bake perfect pecan pies. Trolling reporter April Ryan, who accused her list time of posting fakes. Today at the press potluck, Sanders presented them to Ryan, and here's what happened.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can't believe you would question my ability to make a pie. 
APRIL RYAN, JOURNALIST: It was a joke. 
SANDERS: I'm from the South.
RYAN: At the beginning it was a joke. So what? You could be from the south and you can't cook. A lot of people can't cook. She doesn't like that.
It was a joke at the beginning. It went awry. And -- but I look at this as a reset. I think this is an earnest attempt for you to reach out to all of us, not just to me. 
SANDERS: That's true. I try to reach out to you guys every day, but this is, I think, a great time. It's Christmas. And it's a time to be generous, hospitable which I try to do every day. But particularly for you today.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Juan, it's a reset. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.
WATTERS: Is that going to work? 
WILLIAMS: I don't know. Putin. Maybe Putin is next. A pie for Putin. 
WATTERS: Like the reset button.
WILLIAMS: Yes, that's right.
WATTERS: Kimberly, was this -- did they bury the hatchet? Or are they still going to hate each other the next day.
GUILFOYLE: Pie in your face.
WATTERS: Your face. On April's face.
GUILFOYLE: Like, you know what? Here you go. No fake news. I know how to bake, and here's what's happening. And she doubled it up. I liked that.
WATTERS: April looked a little apologetic. 
PERINO: But April confirmed what I said the first day, was that she was joking. 
GUILFOYLE: That it was a joke, yes.
PERINO: Why are they taking it so seriously? I don't think I ever made a single thing for the press corps. 
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: Or my husband. I don't cook very well at all. I did make these no-bake cookies one time. 
WILLIAMS: No bake?
PERINO: Yes, they're called no-bake cookies. And this is when we lived in England. And I was very proud of them. And they're supposed to be, like, very healthy. And they really did look like... 
GUILFOYLE: No-bake cookies? 
PERINO: But they tasted good.
GUILFOYLE: Wait a second. You made that queso that time that was good.
PERINO: I can make queso. That's true.
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: That's cheese for people that don't speak Spanish. 
Greg Gutfeld.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. Thanks, Rosetta Stone. Please.
GUTFELD: This is nothing but "bake" news. 
GUILFOYLE: This is not a real one for sure...
GUTFELD: The media immediately took half the pie and wanted to give it to the Department of Pie Consumption. That's all I've got. I've got nothing on this. I wanted to talk about something else. 
GUILFOYLE: Move to the next batch.
GUTFELD: I got a Payday. 
GUILFOYLE: He keeps holding that up.
GUTFELD: Speaking of food, I got this. They still sell these. It's peanuts and caramel. It's delicious. 
GUILFOYLE: Wasn't it your prop in the A-block?
GUTFELD: I haven't eaten all day. I hadn't eaten, so...
PERINO: How can you resist opening it? 
GUTFELD: I'm going to wait until after the show, and then I'm going to shove it down my throat. 
WATTERS: You have more of those, by the way?
GUTFELD: No, I don't. But I'll -- I'll give you half of it. And we'll just be like the government. 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: Redistributed. 
GUTFELD: It will be a giveaway. 
PERINO: Give him 37 cents.
GUILFOYLE: Juan will be happy. 
WATTERS: Spread the Payday around.
GUILFOYLE: Giveaway to the rich. Just give it to Jesse. 
WATTERS: Yes, Juan gets nothing. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. Yes, and you know what? And you know what? Greg has a peanut allergy. So give him a Payday. 
GUTFELD: I don't. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God!
GUTFELD: I'm glad you said "peanut."
GUILFOYLE: How murderous of you!
WATTERS: "One More Thing" is up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: All right. It's time now for "One More Thing." I'll begin with myself, since I am so prepared with this one. I love it.
So this is our first lady, Melania, visiting kids and sorting through Toys for Tots donations before making holiday cards with military children and getting into the holiday spirit. And by the way, for the record, I saw the White House, the decorations and everything for the holiday Christmas party, and they were absolutely beautiful. Not scary at all. I thought they were really well done. But anyway, so take a look at this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: It is my hope that during this holiday season, people will remember it is not about gifts. It is about family, service, and gratitude. We must continue to look out for and help each other. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Beautiful message from our first lady. 
All right. Go ahead, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, thanks. Hey, it's a birthday weekend in my house. So today is my son Raffi's birthday. Happy birthday. And my wife's birthday, Delise's birthday, is coming up. So happy birthday, everybody. 
Now, check out this adorable video. It's gone viral. A toddler running to the rescue of his big sister during a wrestling match that he thought was real, that it was a real fight. So watch.

(TODDLER RUNS ONTO RING DURING WRESTLING MATCH)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is the best thing I've ever seen.

WATTERS: That is a good brother. 
WILLIAMS: He is a good brother. He was out to protect his sister. It's adorable.
GUILFOYLE: Isn't that nice? 
PERINO: Do you think you would've done that, Jesse? For Eliza?
WATTERS: Maybe when she was older in her teen years when the boys came knocking. 
GUTFELD: I -- how can you condone this? No, this is blatant sexism. That -- thinking that, oh, the little boy has to go out and help the girl. Because the girl is in trouble. This is pure patriarchal male privilege to allow the -- I think -- I think they have to arrest the entire family. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, God. Why don't you go pet a llama in the corner, Gutfeld?
GUTFELD: They have to arrest the family. That should arrest the family.
GUILFOYLE: Right? He's just so offended. 
GUTFELD: I didn't know little kids wrestle. Little girls wrestle. Anyway.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my -- how sexist is that? Why can't girls wrestle?
WILLIAMS: Here we go.
GUILFOYLE: You think just boys can wrestle? I've seen little girls crush little boys at wrestling. And in fact, I used to do that.
GUTFELD: You know that I'm -- I don't see gender, Kimberly.
GUILFOYLE: Right.
GUTFELD: So just stop it. 
WILLIAMS: If you saw big girls wrestle, you'd notice gender. 
GUTFELD: Oh, please. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.
GUTFELD: Time for... 
WATTERS: Juan, from the top rope.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: I hate these people!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You know, I love AirBNB. I think it's an amazing thing. People can go and find places to live. But I hate the people who use it. 
If you're going to move -- if you're going to rent somebody's apartment, you better realize that they have neighbors, so you don't treat the neighbors like they're somehow some kind of hotel guests. No, that's where we live. So don't be leaving your trash out in front of my door! Because I will hunt you down, and I will kill you! 
WILLIAMS: Oh, my...
GUTFELD: I will kill you! 
GUILFOYLE: Wow, what a total psycho. OK. I can't. I don't know what to do now.
GUTFELD: I hate people who leave their trash. All right. They have no respect.
PERINO: No respect.
GUTFELD: No respect. And by the way the people that rent their places out, I'm coming for you, too. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, why don't you talk to your neighbor about it? 
GUTFELD: Big problem. And I love AirBNB. I think AirBNB's great. But the people that do it, they've got to...
GUILFOYLE: How does AirBNB exist without the people that rent it? 
GUTFELD: The people need to treat these places with more -- treat the neighbors with more respect. They come in and they party very hard, and they don't care about the neighbors. 
GUILFOYLE: You need to have, with your homeowners' association or condo board, a meeting. 
GUTFELD: I am. I am.
GUILFOYLE: That will include this kind of activity.
GUTFELD: I'm on the board, Kimberly. We're talking about you specifically. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, this explains everything.
GUTFELD: I think it's you. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
GUILFOYLE: Not at all. I'm far from homeless. 
WILLIAMS: We need a break. Thank you. We need a break.
GUILFOYLE: Let's be honest. Llama boy. Yes.
WATTERS: It's hard to follow Rodney Dangerfield over here, but I'm going to try. 
All right. It's so hard to get into Harvard. One of the best schools in the country. It's even harder when you're 16. But this kid got into Harvard, Ayrton Little, and watch his reaction. Go.

GUTFELD: At least you're not full of yourself, Dana. 
WATTERS: Get Gutfeld a nipple.
PERINO: Yes, I'm just giving Jesse ideas for his future Christmas gifts.
GUILFOYLE: This looks very presidential. 
PERINO: I do this, Juan, every year.

PERINO: Good wine, actually.

PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Very good, very good. I'll drink this before I do Tucker tonight. I'm on Tucker tonight. I'll be smashed. 
WATTERS: You won't be able to tell the difference.
GUTFELD: You won't tell the difference. 
GUILFOYLE: You mean you're on Tucker's show tonight. 
GUTFELD: Then I'll be away. Then I'll be away for a week, you know, on a vacation.
WATTERS: That was smart to say. That was smart. 
GUILFOYLE: All right.
GUTFELD: It will be Christmas, but...
GUILFOYLE: Have we ruined "Special Report" yet? 
GUTFELD: No, we're getting there, though.
GUILFOYLE: I don't think so. Nobody could save it, but Bret Baier can. Can we go to him? Is he ready for us? 
GUTFELD: No.
GUILFOYLE: I think I'll put the alcohol down. You never want to miss an episode of the coo-coo-kachoo over here. "Special Report" up next. Bret, over to you.
