DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST (on camera):  Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino,along with Greg Gutfeld, Geraldo Rivera, Will Cain, and Emily Compagno. Itis 5:00 in New York City, and welcome to the special edition of The Five.Turkey fresh on the minds of millions of Americans as they hit the roadthis Thanksgiving, maybe you are on the road right now.But things are going to be different this year, as states are taking somevery aggressive steps to curve an ongoing surge in new COVID-19 casesacross the country. No last-minute food shopping in New Mexico. Thegovernor shutting down a dozen grocery stores in that state after employeestested positive for the virus.New York City is adding checkpoints at bridges to enforce quarantine forout-of-state travelers. And despite no evidence linking outdoor dining to asurge in cases, restaurants in Los Angeles County are being forced to shuttheir doors except for takeout and delivery. The mayor there even callingon residents to cancel nonessential travel.Earlier, President-Elect Joe Biden delivered a Thanksgiving address, andsaid each of us has a responsibility in the fight against COVID.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The federal governmentcannot do this alone. Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives todo what we can do to slow the virus. Every decision we make matters. Everydecision we make can save lives. None of these steps we are asking peopleto take are political statements. Everyone of them is based on science,real science.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  All right. Let's go around here. Emily, one of thethings about the science, though, especially when it comes to outdoordining, you know, the Los Angeles County health department said it does nothave data showing that outdoor dining is leading to the spread. And yet,now these restaurants are going to be closed for at least three weeks.EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST:  That is exactly right, Dana. And to thecontrary, we have data evidence in the fact that these small businesses andthese restaurants are dying. As we know, the restaurant industry's thesingle largest private employer in the United States. That's 11 millionjobs that are on the line with 100,000 already shuttered permanently.I don't understand why people think that government is the answer and thesolution to problem and not the cause of it. And especially with theseexecutive orders coming down the line, all of these governors know how todo is fearmonger and ticket and fine their way out of this virus, but thatis not going to work.So take Maine where the Sunday River Brewery dared to stay open, and inresponse, Maine inspected them 30 times and fined them $6,000 a day. Andthere was not one COVID contraction found at that brewery, and they areshut down. Or in LA, like you mentioned, Casa Vega, that's a restaurantwith 62-year multi-generational history now with no outside dining, they'reat a loss.And by the way, it's almost 70 degrees today in LA. So that is what we aredealing with, zero data that COVID can be contracted with outside dining orto support these overblown, over broad government overreach, (Inaudible)and executive orders, and yet all the data pointing to the detriments ofthese orders.PERINO:  And not only that, Geraldo. A lot of these restaurant owners andsmall businesses have invested to figure out a way to make things safer,right? So they did the plexiglass, the distancing, they spruced it up alittle bit, even like some flowers, some plants, things like that, so thoseare costs as well.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST:  I think many -- Dana, these measures maybeoverblown and overwrought. But you don't want to be the governor or themayor who presides over people dying just as a vaccine is coming online. Wehad 156 deaths here in Ohio yesterday. It was a record for the BuckeyeState. It's very, very concerning.And we are all looking with this bitter irony at December 10 or December 11the beginning of the distribution of the vaccine at the end of this longnational nightmare. So I mean, for three weeks, I think we've to grin andbear it. My dad in the coffee shop diner business. I know how tough it isto start, to restart. But you know, you just don't want to be the lastperson dying before the vaccine gets to you, Dana.PERINO:  Well, I get that. And I do think that things are prettycomplicated. Greg, let me ask you about -- some of these decisions, closingan entire grocery store because there were a few cases of -- whereemployees tested positive. So now, it just makes it that much harder to getthe essentials, because the essentials were staying open the first time.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah. It seems like there was anothersolution that I would like to quote the philosopher Michael Malice who saidtyranny is when the population is imprisoned. Freedom is when thepoliticians are. And I'm thinking about this, as Geraldo brings up the --you don't want to be the governor. And that is actually why you become apolitician.You want to be the governor, not just during the good times but the badtimes. And you have to take these risks. You're not just going to be thegovernor when everybody's healthy. Closing the grocery stores, you knowthat the people who made that decision knew in advance they were doing it.And you know they didn't close the grocery stores until after they are maidwent shopping.That is what gets me so mad about this, is that people -- the people thatare making these rules are making these rules with the exemptions built infor themselves. And we have seen this with Lori Lightfoot, with GavinNewsom, with Andrew Cuomo and his brother, Chris. They all take advantageof their status and their political power.Meanwhile, we -- well, not we, because I have -- I do wield a bit of power,Dana. I don't know if you know that.PERINO:  I feel it.GUTFELD:  We do have to look at the statistics. Emily is right. There is noscience behind the outdoor dining. It's ridiculous. When the temperature is70 freaking degrees that you're sending people inside, inside in tightrooms which are often stuffy, which is -- viruses enjoy places where thereis not air current flowing, right? So this doesn't help.And then you're threatening to arrest people. Where are you going to putthem, in jails, where COVID is rising? So this makes no sense at all. ButI'm a broken record on this. We have been talking about this forever. Theprison of two ideas, you know, freedom versus lockdown. We have to keepstarting this conversation over every single day.Because we are looking at deaths, and we are looking at risk, but we haveto remind ourselves that death and injury is around every corner. And wehave to look at this with a sober eye. The case of fatality rate hasdropped substantially to 2.3 percent since May, and that is because we'rebetter at treatment. We are testing more.So when there are more cases, the death rate will drop. And we are justbetter at isolating the vulnerable, which is what we should keep doing.PERINO:  Well, the hypocrisy has continued. My sister lives in -- justoutside of Denver. She sent me this morning the word that Denver MayorMichael Hancock, you know, he boarded a flight to go to Houston, and he'son his way to Mississippi. But then his office had put out a statementsaying don't travel this weekend.WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS HOST:  The rules are not for the rule makers, Dana.They're for the little people. They're for us. They're for the rulefollowers, the citizens. But I'm actually proud of Americans for showing anindependent spirit. You know, Dana, I know you know would remember this.But after 9/11, we had a ton of conversations and debates about how muchfreedom we are willing to trade for security.Why are we having those same conversations when it comes to this pandemicwhere surely we're trading just as many? More freedoms for security from avirus that we have to take seriously? With all due respect to Geraldo, grinand bear what? Bear curfew, you have to be home 10:00 p.m. Bear the factthat these mandates have invaded our families, our holidays, ourtraditions.That we can't have a beer without ordering an appetizer in New York? Thatnow in Vermont, there's this east German stazi (ph) style encouragement ofchildren to tell on each other about what they did over the Thanksgivingholidays. Geraldo, at some point, grin and bear it is not enough. And bythe way, before we move on to Greg's point about this.To Greg's point really quick about politicians versus freedom-lovingAmericans. My favorite little authoritarian through this whole thing sofar, I think is actually Republican Governor Larry Hogan from Maryland, whosaid earlier this week, you don't have a constitutional right to go mask-less. He compared it to drunk driving.You don't have a constitutional right to drink and drive, so you don't havea constitutional right to go mask free. The constitution binds governorsand politicians. It doesn't bind --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  -- this jingle rhetoric -- this faux rage that you are generatingamong people rather than stressing wear the damn mask, keep your distance,wash your hands. Let's get practical here. There is a vaccine that's comingtomorrow. Why can't we just be patient? We have got three weeks.CAIN:  Geraldo, I promise you --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  -- we have record deaths here in Ohio yesterday, not six monthsago, not six months from now, yesterday. People here are scared to death.(CROSSTALK)CAIN:  I assure you this outrage is not faux. I'm telling you you can takethis virus seriously, and the American people can be and have beenresponsible. We don't need politicians to mandate --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  Wear your damn mask.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  All right, guys guys, good talk. President Trump issuing a fullpardon to General Michael Flynn. That just happened. We'll talk about itnext on The Five.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD:  President Trump issuing a full pardon for Michael Flynn, hisformer national security adviser. Trump tweeted, quote, "it is my greathonor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a fullpardon. Congratulations to General Flynn and his wonderful family. I knowyou will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving."Flynn had pled guilty in 2017 to lying in the FBI in the early stages ofthe Russia investigation, i.e., hoax. So Geraldo, I believe that this isgreat news. I know you feel the same way, because we know he was entrappedby a group of people out for a Trump scalp. And he was just happen to -- hewas a victim of circumstances. That is me.RIVERA:  I don't know about that -- I don't know about the circumstances.But bravo, President Trump, you did exactly the right thing. General Flynnwas a great soldier in Afghanistan and in Iraq. He became very political, Iget that. I get that he rubbed some people the wrong way because he was apolitical activist/But this whole thing with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador and thoseconversations that he had. He knew Kislyak that he had been in Moscow. Hehad been in Washington, D.C. together. He's just chatting him up, and he becool. And for the FBI to come to the White House and entrap him, Greg, youare exactly right. It was entrapment.They went there to get him, and it was a perjury trap. You know, they askedhim a question that they knew that he could not answer without embarrassinghimself. And then they parlayed that. They wanted to get them fired or gethim arrested. And because of their greedy, anti-Trump hatred with the wholebureau was churned by Mueller into this revenge squad to get Trump. Flynnwas just collateral damage, Greg.GUTFELD:  Yeah. You know, Dana -- and the other thing that was justbothersome is this Judge Sullivan who refused, I guess, to grant dismissal,even though pretty much everybody was on the same page.PERINO:  Right. So as I understand it, judges are very reluctant tooverturn things when you had somebody that pled guilty originally. Then hewanted to change his plea. But then you had the Justice Department saywe're cool with him changing his plea. So then the judge, Sullivan, he'sjust dragged this out for about six months.And I know that, you know, I'm sure that Michael Flynn and his lawyer andhis family would have preferred a dismissal, because that means we -- thereis nothing on your record. There is nothing. Now, a full pardon means alsothat he has a full pardon. But I do think that a dismissal would have beenbetter. But given that the judge was not granting that, that the pardon wasgiven, and now that case is moot in front of the judge.GUTFELD:  Moot, I love that word. That is a great word. I'll remind peoplethat if anybody upset about the Michael Flynn think, remember who PresidentObama pardoned. An AFLN in terrorist who was responsible for something likea 100 bombings. Will, this is the first time I have asked you a question inmaybe 10 years. Back in the days of Redeye, you have definitely cleaned up,I have to say.CAIN:  Thank you.GUTFELD:  What are your thoughts on any other pardons? You can talk aboutFlynn, but do you see any other pardons coming up?CAIN:  Well, we will see about other pardons. Let me talk about Flynn, if Imight. Adam Schiff has talked about the president's pardoning process beingsomething akin to organized crime. What would organized crime look like? Itwould look like bringing all the levers of power onto a single individual,using extortion to break that person, both judicially, and legislatively,and financially.And all of that is what happened to Michael Flynn. He is broke. The JusticeDepartment originally, the court system, his own lawyers, the FBI, alllevered against this one single individual to see this man receive a pardonis honestly an act of justice. Maybe, to Dana's point, he might have got adismissal, but this is the only guaranteed path to justice to Michael Flynnthat he very much deserves at this moment.GUTFELD:  So Emily, I'm going to ask you a curve ball question, so beprepared. I hope you are prepared. You are a lawyer. A question was askedin the Cavuto hour whether Donald Trump should pardon himself, and theperson who was answering the question might have been Karl Rove, said no,that would make him look guilty.And I'm thinking to myself that  people that are saying they're going toafter Trump don't even have a crime to charge him. So it is like he shouldpardon himself because they're going to after him and then find the charge.So wouldn't you tell Trump, yeah, you should pardon yourself because thesepeople are coming after you without even a crime?COMPAGNO:  Greg, I like your style. I think that is a really creative movefor him in the form of messaging NPR. But legally, it is moot, to use oneof your favorite words. Because without a crime, without a conviction,there is nothing to pardon. So if I can as well as peak to this. To me, youguys, it's not the Flynn pardon. It's the reason the pardon was necessary.And just taking it a step further, from you talking about Judge Sullivan.You guys, he sat on an uncontested Department of Justice motion to dismissfor almost seven months. Now, we know that the incoming administration haspledged not to use the DOJ to wield it like a weapon, but I hope thatincludes conducting an audit of the judiciary and holding responsible thesekinds of errant judges that are clearly political activists.And you know me, I'm not usually a fearmonger, but this to me wasabsolutely absurd. And he truly tried to circumnavigate the justice system.So I hope moving forward that at least we see some of these judges beingheld responsible.GUTFELD:  Absolutely. You know, Dana, I know he's going to pardon morepeople. I am putting out the name of Lil' Kim. PERINO:  What did Lil' Kim do?GUTFELD:  She went to jail because she refused to snitch on her friends andgot a year for lying to -- who you ever lie to in court, who is thatperson, the judge?PERINO:  The judge.GUTFELD:  Yeah. I'm pretty much a law abiding person. But it happened in ashoot-out back in, like, 2001. So -- and I think that Trump should do itbefore the Grammy's, because she did win a Grammy for the Lady Marmaladeremake.PERINO:  I love that album.GUTFELD:  Trump did this, then Lil' Kim can go to the Grammy's and thankDonald Trump at the Grammy's. I know you are watching.PERINO:  Great idea, Greg.GUTFELD:  It's a great idea. Pardon Lil' Kim.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  But don't pardon that other person. Do not do it. GUTFELD:  I know what you are saying. But wouldn't it drive people crazy ifhe pardon --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  All right, Big Ed.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  -- the congressman from Staten Island.GUTFELD:  There you go. That's not bad. All right, Joe Biden answeringcritics who say he's just Obama's third term.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA (on camera):  Welcome back, everybody. Is the Biden administrationdestined to be nothing more than a third term for President Obama? Biden'sincoming cabinet is chock full with many familiar faces and giving bothsupporters and critics a major case of Obama era deja vu. But thepresident-elect said, hey, not so fast.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)BIDEN:  This is not a third Obama term, because we face a totally differentworld then we faced in the Obama/Biden administration. The president, this-- President Trump has changed the landscape. It has become America first,which meant (ph) America alone. We find ourselves in a position wherealliances are being frayed.(END VIDEO TAPE)RIVERA (on camera):  The president-elect is also laying out his first 100days in office what they would be like.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)BIDEN:  I am going to make a commitment the first 100 days. I will send animmigration bill to the United States Senate with a pathway to citizenshipfor over 11 million undocumented people in America.(END VIDEO TAPE)RIVERA (on camera):  I like that idea of giving the pathway to citizenshipfor the 11 million. It won't fly. I think the Senate though, Greg, willhold it up, will never allow it to be passed. I think they shouldcompromise and go with DACA, get the dreamers legalized. Do that first,what do you think?GUTFELD:  Well, first of all, let me talk about what he said, which wasincorrect, that he said our alliances are afraid under Trump here. That isnot true at all. He's got the whole equation backwards. Alliances do notmake a country strong. A strong country gets you alliances. And we sawthat. We saw that under Trump. We saw so many people realizing that, youknow what, he's not that bad.He's OK. And then he starts working, and everybody realizes, well, he knowshow to create an economy. There are no bodybags coming home. All of asudden, this kind of a person that they perceived as obnoxious turns out tobe a pretty good leader. To your point about amnesty, OK? This again islike who is this helping? Who is this helping, and why is he doing it?Because the fact is we had the lowest unemployment for minorities andteenagers and women in modern history. Why was that? Because jobs wereavailable, and he's going to reverse that. It's not going to help people.RIVERA:  You know, Dana, you recognize these names. Let me -- Janet Yellen,she's the new treasury secretary, Ron Klain, who was, you know, the vicepresident's chief of staff is now going to be his chief of staff aspresident. He is bringing back old John Kerry, Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken,it is like the return, Dana, of the preppies.PERINO:  Yeah. So I think that -- one thing that we have learned about JoeBiden is that he likes to surround himself with people that he's known fora long time. He likes the fact that some of these people have had multipleyears of experience. And don't forget, Geraldo, that -- I think everybodyon the list that he has announced so far has already been confirmed by theSenate, at least for something along the way.And so that makes Senate confirmation a little bit easier. And Biden's,like, seems to be quite happy to be seen as, like, the normal, boring guy.Like, that is how he ran. That is how he plan to govern, back to normal,everything is fine. So I think that maybe we should just let them get theirfeet on the ground and see how it looks, because no term is exactly like aprevious president.Something always happens. I mean, just take a look at this year. COVIDhappened. Something happened. Something changes. In 2001, 9/11, like,something always changes that makes it a little bit different. So it is notexactly a third Obama term until they get underway, but it looks like it atthe moment.GUTFELD:  But do they deserve patience from -- after what they have done?That is the hard thing that --PERINO:  I am just saying that I'm not prepared to say that it's a thirdObama until they're actually in office.GUTFELD:  Yeah. I don't know. They deserve --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  Well, that may be. But, you know, Will Cain, looking at this team,what you don't see is Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, none of TheSquad, the entire progressive wing of the Democratic Party, at least sofar, has been cut out of the new Biden administration, Will.CAIN:  That is true, Geraldo. Still, I think it will be a third Obama term,an Obama term on steroids. Dana is right. This administration will facedifferent issues than the Obama administration face. But the tools andtactics, Dana, I think will be the same. Let me give you an example. Oncethere's some pushback on this immigration pursuit, what do you think willhappen? They'll revert to identity politics that which is defined not justthe Obama administration, but the Democratic Party for some years now.They'll call anyone who disagrees with it a racist. I give you, forexample, President Obama this morning on The Breakfast Club, when hepondered on why Latinos voted in increasing numbers for President Trump. Hesaid, well, they forgave, "racist things," because they are evangelicals,and they're into abortion, and they're --RIVERA: Will, I think we have the president -- Will, hold on. I think wehave the president, President Obama saying that. Here's POTUS 44.CAIN: Right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's a lot ofEvangelical Hispanics, who, you know, the fact that Trump says racistthings about Mexicans or puts detainees, you know, undocumented workers incages, they think that's less important than the fact that, you know, hesupports their views on gay marriage or abortion.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAIN: So, Geraldo --RIVERA: And it could not be more wrong from my point of view.CAIN: On so many levels, on so many levels, Geraldo. First of all, thinkabout the stones it takes from President Obama to accuse President Trump orcriticize President Trump about putting kids in cages. This started underthe Obama administration.Number two, President Trump is for gay marriage. In fact, it was Obama whowas not for gay marriage in the beginning, and thus President Trump doubledhis vote with the LGBTQ community. Every step of the way, he's wrong. Hecondescends on religious grounds. He condescends to Latinos there.So, to Dana's point, what I'm saying is, they'll revert to identitypolitics. They'll revert to this hammer, this tool they use, no matter whatissue comes before them in this administration.RIVERA: The reason Latinos voted in the increasing numbers for PresidentTrump is because Latinos are inherently socially conservative. And I don'tmeet the generalized, but I am on the inside on this one. They are faith-based, family-oriented, you know, they're entrepreneurial, they're naturalRepublicans. They just have to recognize that fact.But, Emily, you know what is interesting to me also is, you know, the Bidenteam is saying, now, they're going to be back at the head of the table inthis international community, with the World Health Organization, and NATO,and so forth. Do you think that the American people want the United Statesto abandon America first and embrace -- re-embrace like the palace -- theParis Climate Accord or these other -- these other internationalagreements, Emily?COMPAGNO: I don't think the American people want their interests deflatedin any way regardless of what you call it or where you're saying that weare sitting. I think, to me, this new administration is sort of like whenJourney got Arnel Pineda, where you go to their concerts and it sounds likeJourney, but it's not. It's still not Steve Perry.And here, I think we can look forward to, unfortunately, some sameholdovers like that capitulating foreign policy that we saw during theObama administration. Hopefully, we won't be subjected to that definitelyelitist, classic Obama talking down to people like you just played and inaddition to -- remember his comments about how Midwesterners cling to theirreligion and their guns.But in terms of him focusing on immigration, and immigration reform, Ithink what's interesting to me is the continued oversimplification, whichis that all you were hearing from the administration is that it's not goingto be a racist policy.And finally, we will welcome immigrants without any consideration ortalking about the push factors coming from Central and South America inpart or the cartel or the international narco cartel drug industry thatplays such a momentous part. And there's tons more but I know we're out oftime now.RIVERA: OK. I wonder if they're going to tear the wall down. I wonder howthat would go over. Defund the police backfires. A judge hands down aruling allowing fed up residents to sue the city over cuts to the policeforce.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAIN: Welcome back to this special edition of THE FIVE. Now, fed upMinneapolis residents are upset with the surging crime rate in that bigcity and they just got a big win in court. A judge is ruling that they areallowed to sue the city over major cuts to the police force. Now, thiscomes as violent crime has skyrocketed in Minneapolis. Nearly 200 officershave left the force since the beginning of the year.So, could this happen in Seattle next because there, the city council isvoting this week to cut the police budget by 18 percent. Emily, I knowyou're from Seattle. You're familiar with that community. What will be thereaction if the police budget there's cut by 18 percent?COMPAGNO: We're already seeing the reaction and people are upset and theyhate this because it's not rational. So, right now the size of the policeforce has been decimated already. It's the size of the -- of what it was in1990, yet the population of Seattle has grown by almost 50 percent.Now, the city council said, well, this was to invest in alternativemeasures to provide healthier outcomes for minority communities. And ofcourse, the mayor says yes, this is deliberate and measured and I applaudthis. But it's such a fallacy and it's so naive. Here's just one smallexample.The Seattle Police Force has a Harbor Unit, because here with our uniquetopography we have 100 miles of waterways and coastlines, right. So,there's businesses homes, public roads that are along the water's edge. So,our police force that is in the harbor unit, they act as paramedics,firefighters, coast guard, and cops.And guess what the police budget pays for. It pays for their overtime,which is the only way that these guys can obtain and maintain the licensesrequired for them to provide and fulfill these roles, right, like scubadiving and piloting these boats. So, this isn't measured are healthy by anymeans. It's simple and basic economics, and it's not a functioning healthysociety.CAIN: Right. Geraldo, one of the plaintiffs in Minneapolis said they're ina pandemic of violence, that the city is bleeding. What are your thoughts?RIVERA: My thought -- basic thought is that will you reap what you sow? Imean, these folks have been actively, you know, trying to get the copsdefunded. Well, guess what? The cops are defunded, and now violence isspiking. But what broke my heart, going back to Seattle one second, whenCarmen Best quit, a black woman, wonderful leader of the Seattle PoliceDepartment. She quitted the disgust.I mean, what the hell? All the people who are quitting, a lot of the chief-- the high brass that acquitting are minority police officers, the mosteffective possible antidotes to crime. And they're leaving the job becauseof this radicalism that knows no bounds, Will.CAIN: Hey, Greg, it strikes me that the victims of these rising crime ratesare the ones that are supposed to be helped by this idea of defund thepolice.GUTFELD: Yes. And actually, to Geraldo his point about the fact that theseleaders and minorities, a lot of the people that are -- that are causingthis to happen are white, over-educated leftists who are miserable people,who are on the street, destroying businesses, and harassing, harassingminorities.I have a solution. We need two 911s. You have a real 911 for people whoaren't hypocrites for the citizens who need help. And then you have a fake911 that's for like the Portland mayor, and the Seattle mayor, and peoplewho say burn it all down until they call the cops.And when you call fake 911, they connect you to somebody just like you. Andthey send in that little leftist to your house. And that person helps youwith the mugger or the -- or the arsonist, because right now they do needto reap what they sow. These children need to get sick on the candy. Theyneed to get the hangover to learn their lesson.CAIN: Dana, I'll give you the final thought.PERINO: I just would say that I think this has even longer-termconsequences what's happening now. Because how many young people that mighthave thought that they wanted to be police officers are making a differentdecision right now. And then you're going to have a situation where notonly do you have fewer police officers now, but well into the future isgoing to be hard to get them to want to sign up.CAIN: It's an absolute travesty happening in multiple cities now acrossthis country. All right, stay right there because the "FASTEST SEVEN" is upnext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COMPAGNO: Welcome back. All right, what the heck is this? A mysteriousmetal structure randomly discovered in the Utah desert? It's stumpingofficials and the world? Is it an avant-garde art installation or messageleft behind by aliens? We may never know. But the truth is out there.OK, you guys know how I feel about aliens. Yes, I believe but I think thisis just an unauthorized artwork on federal property. What say you, WillCain?CAIN: I don't know. I'm not going to dismiss some kind of alien message oralien shrine. Look, if somebody told me there were zombies on the other endof this building right now, I wouldn't dismiss them. This is 2020. I thinkin the spring, the government acknowledged the existence of UFOs.RIVERA: This is New York. There are zombies.CAIN: I don't -- Geraldo, I do not dismiss anything. Not election fraud,not zombies, not UFO, not a message from the aliens. I don't dismissanything.COMPAGNO: All right, Greg, what do you say?GUTFELD: Well, you know how I feel about aliens. So, this was a total PRmarketing move to sell more monoliths. The monolith -- the monolithindustry has hit quite a slump since 2001 Space Odyssey. It had a big, bigleap there when they had the monolith there. And then the monolith -- thewhole market just went down and tanked.I think I should have learned this. Imagine if I had built a giant cover ofmy book The Plus and left it in the middle of the Sahara Desert. I couldhave sold a zillion copies. Stupid me.COMPAGNO: Dana, what do you say?PERINO: I think that Greg's explanation is more believable to me than UFOs.I think that we're -- I think that when this mystery is found out, it'll besomeone having a little bit --GUTFELD: Everybody is going to want a monolith.PERINO: I don't want one.COMPAGNO: Geraldo, what do you think, zombies or no zombies then?RIVERA: I think, Emily, that somebody was very creative. I love that modernart aspect of it. It looks like it's very substantial. It cost a bunch ofmoney. So, I think that Dana is onto something which he says we shouldtrack the creator just because of the curiosity of someone who would investso much in so little.CAIN: You all are too cynical. Hey, Greg, the problem with you -- theproblem with you putting a book copy in the desert, Greg, is you have noidea how long you have to leave it there before it's discovered. How longis this thing been sitting there?GUTFELD: That's true. That is true.COMPAGNO: All right, next up, Google is releasing data on the most uniquelysearched Thanksgiving side edition state by state so let's break it down byhost. For Greg and my home state of California, lots of people aresearching for mac and cheese, which seems kind of basic. Will is fromTexas, where they apparently love fruit salad. Geraldo is from New Yorkwhere cornbread stuffing is all the rage. And, finally, Dana is fromWyoming where crescent rolls are the bomb.OK, Geraldo, how do you feel about your state's choice? Do you agree withit?RIVERA: Well, here in Ohio, it's stuffed mushrooms. But I like thecornbread of New York. I was raised on it. It's delicious. I love stuffing.I'm all about stuffing. I'm all about the size. I'm all about cannedcranberry sauce. I like the canned cranberry, you know, the one -- what'sthe brand?COMPAGNO: Yes, with the ridges.PERINO: Ocean Spray.COMPAGNO: Ocean -- yes.RIVERA: Ocean Spray, Ocean Spray.COMPAGNO: With the ridges.RIVERA: With the ridges.COMPAGNO: So, Dana, how do you feel about those crescent rolls? And are you-- is it stuffing versus gravy? Is that how you -- the two --PERINO: I like stuffed -- I like the gravy on this -- I think gravy shouldgo on the stuffing. I think crescent rolls are fantastic. I did readthrough this list and I was really confused that North Dakota's most searchfor topic or side dish is keto soup. How? Why? I don't get it. Somebodyfrom North Dakota?COMPAGNO: All the Californians are moving there. That's why.GUTFELD: That's a euphemism for urine.COMPAGNO: Oh, gosh. All right, so, Greg, you and me from California so it'sall about mac and cheese. I thought that was interesting searching for itbecause it seems kind of typical, right?GUTFELD: Yes. You know, I have a theory on people who have special sidesthat they bring. When someone prides themselves on a special Thanksgivingside, it's because no one will tell them it's bad. So, it becomes atradition. It becomes a yearly thing like creamed corn became a traditionbecause no one wanted to tell Peggy the pilgrim that it's kind of gross.Ambrosia salad, like, who brings Ambrosia salad unless they were lied totheir entire lives that Ambrosia salad mattered.PERINO: OK, it might have.COMPAGNO: Edward Scissorhands -- remember, that was like the main food inEdward Scissorhands, Ambrosia salad. That where I learned what that was.GUTFELD: I rest my case.COMPAGNO: All right, Will, tell us about fruit salad.CAIN: No, I can't. I can't, Emily. This is fake news. This poll is fakenews designed to troll Texans. I would trade Geraldo right now. Geraldo,will you trade me that cornbread pudding, please? I would trade you that --if you have sweet potato, I'll do anything --RIVERA: For fruit salad? No, thanks.CAIN: Sweet potatoes, anything. I would take that cream corn that Greghates.GUTFELD: Yes.RIVERA: Pumpkin pie. What about pumpkin pie?PERINO: That's not a side dish.GUTFELD: That's a dessert, Geraldo. Geez, typical hipster.COMPAGNO: Gosh. All right, guys, "ONE MORE THING" is up next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hey there. It's time now for "ONE MORE THING." Greg, what you got?GUTFELD: All right, so if you're stuck inside Saturday night, we have abrand new "GREG GUTFELD SHOW" and what a cast. Tom Shillue, Joe Machi, KatTimpf, Tyrus. That's Saturday, November 28th, 10:00 p.m. It's news.Now, we'll do this. Greg's Ice Breaking News. Now, if you ever take thesubway in New York City or anywhere for that matter, sometimes you come outof the subway and you're just not really sure where you are. Well, this isme. I'm like, whenever I come out from the underground, I never know wherethe heck I am. Then, he got his -- he got his lunch and now he's goingback. There he goes breaking the ice.PERINO: I don't think that's his lunch. I think that he's making a dam.GUTFELD: Yes, I don't know. That damn, Beaver. We'll be right back withmore news.PERINO: All right, I'm going to go next. I haven't done this in a while. Ihave a book recommendation. This is a book that I'm in love with. I loveit. It goes on sale on Amazon on Friday. She's self-publishing. This is byAimee Mayo. It's called Talking To This Sky.So, who is Aimee Mayo? She's a Grammy-nominated songwriter and author.These are some songs that she wrote that you'll know. This One's for theGirls, Martina McBride. Every Time I Hear That Song, Blake Shelton. Amazed,Lone Star, and then Boys II Men. I mean, she is amazing.This book to me is like educated the glass castle and also somethinghilarious all in one. She's had an incredible life. She's been through alot. She's overcome -- it's amazing.GUTFELD: Hold the Mayo.PERINO: Hold the Mayo. Here it is. One funny story, when she was growingup. She thought she truly believed when she was like 13 or 14 that she wasgoing to marry Rick Springfield. And she went to a concert, and she gotback --GUTFELD: Her too?PERINO: Yes, her too. And then, years later, guess what, they meet insongwriting. It's amazing story.GUTFELD: Wait, they got married? What?COMPAGNO: That's like, the secret.PERINO: No, they meet, and they have good songwriting.GUTFELD: No, I just hooked up with her.PERINO: That would have been a good story, though, as well. All right,Geraldo, you're next.GUTFELD: I'm joking.RIVERA: Well, two quick things. One, I just wanted to note, seriously, thepassing of this week at the age of 93 of New York's first black mayor,David Dinkins. He was a gracious, welcoming, underrated, fair-mindedgentleman who could show us more of his moderation and his optimism onmatters of race going forward.Closer to home, my 15-year-old soul is starting an ethnic cookbook, youknow, with famously Jew-Rican, half Jewish half of Puerto Rican. So shemade her first meal in homage to my mom, potato latkes on the one side.That was from my mom's favorite. And rice and beans from my dad's favoriterecipe on the other. So, it's rice and beans and potato latkes is in theRivera house.PERINO: Well, she has grown into a very beautiful young woman.RIVERA: Thank you. Thank you, Dana.PERINO: Will Cain, what you got. You better make this good.CAIN: Yes. So, I know this --PERINO: You better make this "ONE MORE THING" good.CAIN: Well, I know this is the moment on THE FIVE when you plug stuff. So,can I say that I'll be hosting "THE STORY WITH MARTHA MCCALLUM" on Fridaynight. Please come join me.PERINO: Oh, I forgot to plug. I'm doing that tonight.CAIN: You just came over the top of me. But I want to say this. I got intonot a debate, a discussion with my buddy, Pete Hegseth, on "FOX & FRIENDS"about what you do when you are frying a turkey, because we keep havingthese turkeys explode, right? Like, you can see on your screen.I think we have -- that's right. There's 1,700 cooking fires every year,triple the number -- it's not funny, Greg -- Geraldo.COMPAGNO: Oh, my gosh.CAIN: Hey, here's the tip. Here's the tip. Don't put a frozen turkey into afryer full of oil. That's it.PERINO: That's a -- that's a good tip. Emily, I got 25 seconds for you.COMPAGNO: Smoky Mountain Service Dogs is an incredible organization thatpairs mobility assistance dogs with the disabled U.S. veterans. And theyjust got a batch of new puppies that I wanted to show you, Winston, Sully,Oak, Blaze, and Duncan.PERINO: Super cute.COMPAGNO: It's a really wonderful organization doing incredible things.PERINO: Fabulous.
