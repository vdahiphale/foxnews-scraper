SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right, Tucker. Great show as always.
Welcome to “Hannity.” What a day this has been. In the middle of a partial government shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she was all set to leave on a jet plane -- well, actually a U.S. military plane, on your dime, embark on a seven-day excursion with other Democratic members of Congress. That is until President Trump pulled the plug. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In a letter, the president wrote: Nancy Pelosi, due to the government shutdown, I'm so sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels and Egypt and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over. In light the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I'm sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I also feel that during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, well, that would certainly be your prerogative. I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous southern border finally receive the attention, funding, and the security it so desperately deserves. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And keep in mind this letter comes roughly 24 hours after Speaker Pelosi called for the State of the Union to be cancelled because of some phantom, it turns out, concerns about inadequate security due to the ongoing shutdown. Of course, we now discovered Nancy Pelosi never ever, not once, reached out to the Department of Homeland Security or the Secret Service before making that announcement.
Now, both departments have long been planning for the joint address, they were fully prepared and Nancy Pelosi made up those concerns. Why? Obviously, a political ploy, political game and a political show, rather than actually negotiating a real border security deal and an opening of the government. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
She was perfectly happy to take a government-funded plane and a government- funded intercontinental trip instead of staying in Washington, D.C. and actually doing her job. Now, keep in mind, her seven-day absence from Washington, that would have guaranteed the hundreds of thousands of furloughed, federal workers. They would miss their next paycheck it would have been impossible to get it.
So, she obviously doesn't care about furloughed workers. She only feigns moral outrage because she had no intention of being there to solve the problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, today on the Hill, the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy backed up the president's letter 100 percent, rightly so. Take a look.

REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Being speaker of the House and leaving the country with a shutdown I don't think is appropriate. Especially the speaker thinks we shouldn't even have the State of the Union? I think the best thing that could happen and everybody could calm a little bit, get in a room together and put the American people first before their travels and solve the problems.

HANNITY: Now, remember again and again, including yesterday, Democrats refused to go to the White House at the president's invitation, remember that weekend when the vice president was staying all weekend to negotiate with Pelosi and Schumer, they just sent their aides. They didn't want a solution to the problem.
So, Leader McCarthy is right. Speaker Pelosi should be embarrassed. She claims that she cares about furloughed government workers but she tried to postpone, shutdown negotiations so she can take her government funded international trip.
She pretends that her fellow Democrats are ready to open the government immediately, but allowed dozens of her colleagues to take that luxurious, lobbyist-paid extravagant tropical vacation to Puerto Rico. Those are the ones with lobbyists, corporate executives. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Guess what? You can see right there Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. He's next to the woman in the bikini. Does that look like a man that's worried about furloughed employees of the government? His all expense paid vacation? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, that's only 10 days into the new Congress. Vacation paid for 10 days in. Now, nice gig if you can get it.
So, only a dollar for the wall and the wall is immoral. Nancy Pelosi pretends that a partial shutdown is a major crisis. Somehow made ample time, where was she over the Christmas holiday? Vacationing in Hawaii. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
President urged to come to the White House, meet face to face to negotiate. He stayed in Washington. Gave up his vacation. She obviously doesn't care about the furloughed workers, and she obviously doesn't care about reopening the government.
What's worse, she doesn't care about the root cause of the shutdown, which is border security. This is literally for many Americans life and death. When angel moms and dads, families, yesterday, those that lost loved ones at the hands of illegal immigrants went to her office to visit with Speaker Pelosi, she was in the office, she refused to come out and even meet them yesterday.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: A White House official tells CNN that Pelosi and members of Congress are welcome to fly commercial to Afghanistan. A remarkable statement given that the president just announced to the world, including the Taliban, that the speaker of the house was headed there.

HANNITY: He actually told them she is not headed there, unless she wants to go commercial.
So, Nancy Pelosi - - she is obviously paying politics with the safety, the security, of all Americans, all because she just hates Donald Trump. Remember, Democrats sounded like Donald Trump four years ago. So, yes, it might be pretty easy to make this up on fake news CNN and their friends in the Democratic Party to call border security, they will use the same phrase manufactured crisis. Really? Manufactured?
Tell that to the face of Angel Moms and Dads that were on this program on Friday all of whom lost their kids because of illegal immigration and sanctuary policies. You know, the facts paint a very different picture.

Now, over the past two years, approximately 4,000 criminal aliens have been arrested for homicide, 30,000 for sex crimes, over 100,000 for violent assaults. In just 2018 alone, 17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border. We also saw 122 percent increase in fentanyl being smuggled across our southern border.

Americans are dying every day from overdoses, at least 300. Now, over the last few weeks, over 20,000 children were smuggled or trafficked into the United States and as you can see, for so many, this is literally life and death.
Angel Moms, you know what? They are never going to see their kids again. That's permanent separation. Remember the Democrats? They seem to care about the issue of child separation, but only when they could politically bludgeon President Trump who, in the end, fixed that problem, one that he inherited from their beloved Barack Obama, they never criticized him.

Now, some victims will never recover. But this doesn't protect Democrats safe and secure on Capitol Hill living it up or taking junkets to Puerto Rico. That's why many of them have no problem calling border walls -- actually saying walls protect both sides immoral. Easy to play politics when you are not impacted, you are not affected. It hasn't been your family. And that's probably why Nancy Pelosi's district has now become covered.
Look at this. We sent our cameras from the “Hannity” show over to Nancy Pelosi's district. We showed you last night. Human feces, needles, while she's up there in Washington, D.C., raising money, playing politics without tackling any serious important issues. This is what her district looks like. Take a look.

This party has now been hijacked by the most radical individuals, including devout socialist and bigoted anti-Semites and lawmakers who want to dismantle, literally, the U.S. Constitution, it's beginning to be a pretty scary picture.
And yesterday, we saw publicity seeker far left freshman congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filming herself storming into the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office. She is demanding that he reopen the government. Watch this.

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: We're marching over to Mitch McConnell's office to show them what's up; is that right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
CROWD: That's right.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: OK, guys. We went to Mitch McConnell's office where we went to the Senate cloak room. #wheremitch? You can run but you can't hide. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

HANNITY: When Ocasio-Cortez is not busy plotting next publicity stunt, well, she's teaching her far less media savvy colleagues how to do the same. Yesterday, she hosted a Twitter 101 class for her fellow Democrats because, I guess, they don't have other pressing issues to deal with. She learned teaching them Twitter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's not forget, Ocasio-Cortez is the same member of Congress who literally wants to take all of your hard earned money to pay for what are reckless, wasteful, big government programs, even floating a 70 percent income tax rate for some Americans. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Dan Bongino had a great suggestion we would like to echo here on this program. Ocasio-Cortez let her lead by example. She can donate 70 percent of her income right now, give it to the government. After all, her salary as a sitting member of Congress is actually triple median income for an entire American family. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Ocasio-Cortez, while you want to take everyone else's money, will you donate your own? Will you actually put your money where your mouth is? Or better yet, will you take a trip? Maybe go to Cuba or Venezuela and see how your socialist utopia is working in action.
That's right. You can't because of the extreme conditions like crime and civil unrest and crumbling infrastructure. Now, even ran out of toilet paper in Venezuela last year because of socialism. The entire country is going hungry because of socialism. They don't have basic medical supplies because of socialism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you really that for America? How well did that work out for the former Soviet Union?
Now, sadly, Ocasio-Cortez is not the only Democrat with these radical views. It's actually getting much worse. For example, many Democrats, including presidential contender, Kirsten Gillibrand, get this, actively participating side by side with the well-known anti-Semite by the name of Linda Sarsour.
Remember Sarsour? She has been known to praise and promote Sharia law. We know what Sharia does for women, gays, lesbians, Christians and Jews. That's right. All persecuted.
She rants about so-called Zionists in Israel. She said that Ayaan Hirsi Ali doesn't deserve to be a woman and have her anatomy taken away. And you remember that Ali was a victim of female genital mutilation. When she was accused of blatant anti-Semitism, she blamed, quote, the Jewish media. That's Kirsten Gillibrand's friend Sarsour. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, her, along with Tamika Mallory and a few others, they are now the founders and lead organizers of this coming weekend's Women's March in Washington, D.C. They are both avid fans of the bigoted, hate-monger, anti-Semite, racist Louis Farrakhan. Mallory even calling Farrakhan the greatest of all time on Twitter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Now, a reminder, here is the person often praised by the founders of the women's march come up this Saturday. Take a look.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN, NATION OF ISLAM: The Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.

The satanic Jews, they control everything and mostly everybody.
There were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks.
See, the Jews have control over those agencies of government.
The powerful Jews are my enemy.

HANNITY: And according to recent reports, the Women's March actively coordinated with Farrakhan's Nation of Islam for security and other purposes.
And on "The View" this week, Tamika Mallory refused to condemn this hate preacher anti-Semite.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did not make those remarks.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But you are associating with a man who does publicly.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I would say to you is I don't agree with many of Mr. Farrakhan's statements.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Simply about Jewish people.

HANNITY: Organizers of the Women's March.
And until recently, the DNC was sponsoring this march coming up Saturday. They knew it was being run by bigoted anti-Semites. But only now that it out in the open the DNC has cancelled partnership.
But laughably, they won't acknowledge the reason for the cancellation. Now, believe it or not, Democrats have a long history with Farrakhan. Remember, not that long ago, President Bill Clinton recently appearing right there on stage with Farrakhan. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Obama was pictured hanging out with this hate preacher just prior to his time as president. By the way, they hid this picture from you, the American people for eight years.
And sadly, the Democrats' close relationship with anti-Semitism, well, it doesn't stop there. You have freshman congresswoman, Omar, who is also a known anti-Semite, once called Israel apartheid state and that's just the tip of the. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You wrote, Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.
You commented a lot since then, trying to explain what you meant by that. And I wonder just what your message is this morning as the first on our game changer series to Jewish-Americans who find that deeply offensive.
REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN.: Oh, that's really regrettable way of expressing that. I don't know how my comments would be offensive to Jewish-Americans.

HANNITY: Your new radical extreme Democratic socialist party in America -- Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, are you proud to call this anti-Semitic Democrat colleague of yours?
And when Congresswoman Omar is not trashing Israel, she is attacking Republican Senator Lindsey Graham because of his support for President Trump. Without any evidence, she tweeted quote: They got to him. He's compromised.
And on CNN, she had a hard time explaining her disgusting allegations. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OMAR: He is somehow compromised. No longer stand up for the truth. To make sure that he is fighting to protect the oath that he took in serving the American people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But that's quite a charge to make. You say you are pretty sure based on what evidence? What fact? That's remarkable comment to make about a sitting U.S. senator?
OMAR: The evidence really is present to us -- is being presented to us in the way he is behaving.

OMAR: My tweet was just an opinion based on what I believe to be visible to me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Well, is Nancy Pelosi happy with this radical party of hers and conspiracy theories? This party is now a disaster.
America better wake up because Democrats do not have your best interest in mind.
Now we turn out to our “Hannity” watch on our deep state tonight. We reported last night, John Solomon and the Justice Department official Bruce Ohr admitting in congressional testimony that he warned the FBI brass and DOJ brass that that dirty Trump dossier was, in fact, political opposition bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. And that the document was likely tainted with an anti-Trump bias because Christopher Steele had a personal animus towards Donald Trump.
But it was still submitted months later to the FISA court as the bulk of information despite never being verified or corroborated. So what does that mean? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Our own Gregg Jarrett explains it in a new column tonight. It means that Mueller's prosecutors knew that the Russian lies and the dossier was a product of bias and deception, and Gregg will join us later in the program. We'll talk more about it.
It also means that James Comey, Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein and all the others, well, they appeared to have made a conscious decision to make materially false statements and lie and commit a fraud on the FISA court. This must be investigated and handled. The rule of law must prevail.
And actively concealing pertinent information and failing to disclose those judges that any of this in the FISA application on Carter Page. They presented it as full and truthful and they knew the exact opposite. They abuse the FISA warrant process. That is in violation of America's constitutional rights. And it undermines a duly elected president.
Now, remember, James Comey told the president the document was unverified and salacious. Well, that was in January of 2017. He signed off on it as accurate in October of 2016.
And, William Barr, once you are confirmed as the attorney general, you must do your job. You must investigate this. And this two tiered justice system. We'll have more on that later in the program.
Joining us now, first, more on our top story, we start tonight with our radio talk show host, syndicated host, Larry Elder.
Friend, let me start with the shutdown and the president. The president has invited the Democrats day after day to come and negotiate, to talk about what is life and death at the border, and talk about the government shutdown. They never go. They don't want to negotiate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, I think the president acted in the right way today.
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL HOST/AM 870: I agree. Sean, this is what gets me of all things Nancy Pelosi of all people ought to understand the position Donald Trump is in. He made a campaign promise, not just a campaign promise but a promise he believes makes the country better.
Similarly, 2008, Barack Obama run, one of the signature policies what was healthcare reform which he called Obamacare. It was unpopular as he was prosecuting the case, and to the point where Massachusetts, a Democrats lost the so-called Ted Kennedy seat to Scott Brown. They were demoralized, Sean, they were crushed. Rahm Emanuel wanted to pull the whole thing.
The person that bucked Obama up that said go big or go home was Nancy Pelosi. She said, you made a signature promise, you need to fulfill it. And Donald Trump made a promise and he is trying to do the same thing to fulfill a campaign promise that he made that he also believes will improve the country's security and country better.
HANNITY: It's also life and death. It's 90 percent of the heroin coming across that border into this country.
ELDER: That's exactly right. So, why would Nancy Pelosi understand the pressure that Obama was under and encourage him to pursue Obamacare but expect Donald Trump to completely drop kick a plan, a promise he made repeatedly to his base? It doesn't even make any political sense. She understands that.
HANNITY: Larry, they've got -- we're talking about literally they all took their vacations for Christmas. They didn't stay and negotiate for the furloughed employees. Ten days in and then have you got other Democrats taking a lobbyist-paid junket to luxurious resort in Puerto Rico. It looks like they were having fun. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Then, you got Nancy going away and in that seven day period, that means those 800,000 furloughed employees would not get another check. She seemingly doesn't care about them although she claims to care. But we've got life and death.
Let me ask you this. We've got these new radicals in the Democratic Party, outspoken anti-Semites, associations with the Women's March, and those people that support Farrakhan. I don't hear any criticism amongst the Democratic leadership about any of this.
ELDER: And you won't and it gets each worse, Sean. Al Sharpton, who they associate of Farrakhan is being visited by many of these perspective presidential candidates -- Bloomberg, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Gillibrand have all met with them or planning on meeting with him. Al Sharpton has not renounced his friendship with Farrakhan, has not renounced the anti-Semitic comments that you just now played.
By the way, you mentioned Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, he also said that walls sometimes even work. So, not only has he broken away from Nancy Pelosi a little bit, here he is acknowledging that walls, quote: sometimes work.
I thought they didn't work. I thought they were inefficient. I thought they were waste of money.
HANNITY: I thought it was a manufactured crisis. Why wouldn't Nancy meet with Angel Moms and Dads? She was in his office. They were outside her door.
ELDER: You know why she wouldn't meet. What's she going to say? She even said -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: How about I'm sorry for your loss? I'm so sorry?
ELDER: She said about a police officer who was killed -- well, we don't live in a perfect world. Really? Whenever there is a mass shooting, the same people that say we don't live in a perfect world want to draft more laws to restrict the Second Amendment. In response, we don't live in a perfect world, that satisfied when there is a mass shooting.
When a people is killed by illegal alien -- hey, stuff happens. We don't live in a perfect world. It's outrageous.
HANNITY: I've got to run. Larry, thank you for being with us. We have a lot more on this coming up during the show.
Also directly ahead, the media goes absolutely apoplectic over the president shutting down Nancy's overseas trip. Dan Bongino and Kerry Picket are next. And we'll talk about that Women's March also straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So, the feigned liberal outrage machine is back at it. This time, the hate Trump media -- they're having meltdown over the president canceling Nancy Pelosi's trip life and death situation at our border, government shutdown.
Take a look, predictable media reaction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's using the U.S. military to get revenge on the speaker of the House.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, the nation's capitol has officially become a playground, Brooke, the president has responded in sort of a childish way is the only way to describe.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The only phrase that comes to mind is nanny nanny boo boo.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. Sand box, get out of the sand box.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is always a Russia threat to pull. She was going to stop by NATO, so that visit off.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The move seen to some quarters as an effort to try to divert attention from the Russia investigation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is not disconnected from the Russian story. The goal of the Russians, if you really -- if you read Malcolm Nance's book, "The Plot to Destroy Democracy", their goal was to destabilize the West and sow chaos in the American government. Anybody watching would agree that that is exactly what's happening.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. Joining us now with reaction, former Secret Service agent and the host of "The Dan Bongino Show" podcast, Dan Bongino, and former "Daily Caller", SiriusXM Patriot radio host, Kerry Picket.
Good to see you both.
You actually, Kerry, have interviewed Pelosi the last couple days and, you know, she made up whole cloth about the story about the State of the Union not being safe. She didn't ask the Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security.
But the reality is, she's been invited almost every day to meet with the President, and they refused to even talk to him.
KERRY PICKET, THE DAILY CALLER: Absolutely, Sean. And you know what, here's the thing, the Democrats really don't have any sort of incentive to stay in Washington. As far as they're concerned they can pretty much just delay this entire process as much as they want, because in a way they can sort of look at this as their sort of revenge for say the Republicans never seating Merrick Garland. They can say we're getting back at you.
We are officially in 2020 election cycle at this point. This is a political attack. And so, I don't see how the media can't expect for Donald Trump to not counterpunch. That is his signature. And frankly, when I heard from, say, House Majority Whip, Jim Clyburn saying, "Well, you know, there is precedent for Presidents to only submit in writing the State of the Union".
That's just nonsense, because the only time Presidents ever submitted in writing to State of the Union that was back when members of Congress were riding on horses and covered wagons to go to Congress. Now we are in the era of mass media and mass transit where Presidents can deliver their messages that way.
HANNITY: The one thing I would say, Dan, to the President is this. What he's standing up for here having met and interviewed way too many Angel Moms and Dads and Families and seeing 90% of the heroine in this country coming across the Southern border. Human trafficking, drug trafficking, cartels, gang seeing all of this, President stayed home for Christmas. They went on vacation.
They're going on luxurious, lobbyist paid junkets to resorts in Puerto Rico. The President stays and invites them to the White House. Same thing, she's going to be gone when the furloughed employee should be paid and they can't possibly have a deal when she's away.
So to me the President is right on all points here, and I just think he should hold the line, but I don't care which option he uses to fund the wall. But he needs to keep that promise.
DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Finally, Sean, we got a fighter. I'm all-in.
HANNITY: I'm all-in too.
BONGINO: I'm ready to sacrifice for this. This is the fight. This is it. This is the redline right now. This is - we cannot lose this fight. I heard someone earlier today on the network he was saying, well, "You know, maybe the President should try to take the high ground here". The high ground?
Are you serious? You think there's high ground left in Washington D.C.? This is a cesspool full of swamp rats and villains. This - the D.C. has no high ground left. What we need right now--
HANNITY: But, Dan actually--
BONGINO: --Sean, is a kidney puncture.
HANNITY: I disagree with you. Preventing homicides - again the 2% - preventing terrorists, criminals, cartels, gang members, drug and human trafficking, that's the high ground to me. He's got the high ground.
BONGINO: Sean, I get it. I am with you brother, 100 percent. I know we are morally on the right side of this. I'm simply suggesting to you in this fight, trying to talk reason and facts into - our liberal opponents on the other side is useless. Sean, you know as well as I do.
They don't care. This is meaningless to them. It doesn't matter how many people are killed by illegal immigrants. All they care about is beating Donald Trump, and we need to recognize that fight right now and start rabid punching below the belt.
The time for Robert's Rules of Order ended on the inauguration day with Donald Trump. And thank god, he gets that and understands the fight we are in. But I'm with you. We are on the right side of this. But the Democrats don't care at all.
HANNITY: And the thing is to watch Steny Hoyer and to watch this new radicalism emerge Kerry in the Democratic Party, which we'll get into in the next segment. I don't think Nancy could dare go against them, because they'll throw her out in two seconds.
PICKET: That is so true. And keep in mind by the, I think Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they're thinking about the last time they did a Democratic response to Donald Trump's Oval Office address. I don't think they want to see that going forward into the State of the Union.
HANNITY: All right. Good to see you both. Thank you both. All right when we come back, a report, the Democrats have a huge anti-Semitism scandal in their party. It involves the Women's March coming up on Saturday. Tammy Bruce, Sara Carter, they'll react to that and much more, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So as we told you in our opening monologue tonight the Women's March is coming up this weekend despite being roiled in scandal and battling well-founded accusations of anti-Semitism among its leadership. Washington Times reporting, "Women's March leaders deny anti-Semitism claims as DNC, Harris, Gillibrand abandoned the 2019 event".
This comes as one of the central leaders of the organization Tamika Mallory appeared on The View, refused to denounce notorious racist anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan who, she said, she admires. Take a look at who Tamika Mallory says, I had - that she - "that he's the greatest of all time".
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM: The powerful Jews are my enemies.
FARRAKHAN: Farrakhan, by god's grace, has pulled of the cover off of that Satanic Jew.
FARRAKHAN: Call me an anti-Semite, stop it. I'm anti-termite.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here now with reaction, Fox News Contributors, we have Sara Carter and Tammy Bruce. Let's start with the anti-Semitism that I outlined of the leadership. It's so transparent. But also now we got radicals in the Democratic Party that have said these anti-Semitic things, but no criticism from the leadership.
TAMMY BRUCE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this is classic of the far-left. This isn't liberalism, right? It's not about being a Democrat. It's the nature of the far-left. And, obviously, the comments of Mr. Farrakhan speak for themselves.
And if you want to embrace a work that helps the black community, the inner-city, but the Muslim community, there are so many other options than Louis Farrakhan. There are a lot of - there's a lot of good work going on.
But in this case also, and I experienced this when I was on the left. Is that there very often is of course a co-option of movements, of issues that are important to Americans. And in this case you see it with the Women's March. So a very good cause, obviously. Every American cares about the progress of women, their daughters, their sisters, their wives, their best friends.
HANNITY: Absolutely. Of course.
BRUCE: --so this - we get that. But what this is turned into, of course, it's - into the guise of women's, welfare of women's rights, moving a leftist agenda which clearly does, obviously with so many people withdrawing, is about racism, is about Jew hatred, is about dividing people. It's not about bringing all women together.
I do want to say as President of Independent Women's Voice, we are having a counter rally at 10:00 a.m. at Pershing Park in Washington D.C. for all women. The fact is, our issues elevate every woman, including women from the Jewish community, gay women, straight women. It doesn't matter your complexion or your race--
HANNITY: --that's going to be at the same, this Saturday.
BRUCE: That's real women's advocacy this Saturday, yes.
HANNITY: Mallory, Sara, calling Farrakhan the greatest of all time on twitter. But then go to Linda Sarsour for just a second here. I mean, you've got a woman - has known to pray Sharia Law that treats women horribly.
SARA CARTER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM VISITING FELLOW: That's right. Awful.
HANNITY: That also kills gays and lesbians, persecutes Christians and Jews. And Sarsour has not only praised Sharia Law, but you know ranting about so- called Zionists. The things that she said about Ayaan Hirsi Ali that she doesn't deserve to have her female anatomy. It should be taken away. She was a victim of genital mutilation.
CARTER: That's - yes.
HANNITY: And Gillibrand is on stage with this woman.
CARTER: It's horrific, Sean. The fact that Tamika Mallory wouldn't condemn Louis Farrakhan and his anti-Semitic statements, I mean, it's horrible, horrific statements, is just part of an endemic problem throughout the left now.
This - I agree completely with Tammy Bruce here. If you look at the past, this isn't about Democrats or Liberals or different ideas. This is about you don't agree with us, you don't belong in our march. And that's not what women in America are all about.
We have different ideas, different perceptions. We believe in different things and we should be heard - all of us should be heard. As you know, Sean, I traveled throughout much of the Middle East throughout my career and in South Asia.
And my heart just breaks when I think about how women in other parts of the world suffer, and don't have and you want to support them or don't have the law on their side. In fact, they're victims over and over again. We should be grateful and blessed that we live in such a fantastic nation and where we can go out in march.
BRUCE: If I can add. American women and the nature of what we say to - here at home translates around the world. When we stand up for every woman, all ideas, it does bring us together. It does not exclude any woman.
So when we do have the suffering that we have with women across the planet, American rhetoric from women matters, and that's our message on Saturday. It's great, because the silver lining is we're having this conversation now.
HANNITY: Last word Sara.
CARTER: Absolutely, Tammy. Well, I will be there on Saturday as well. I really look forward to it and that's something that we should think about. We should be standing up for women all over the world and for their rights and freedoms.
HANNITY: All right. Thank you both and we'll be watching this crazy fest on some of the leaders - at least, on Saturday. All right, when we come back, "Hannity Watch" on the Deep State.
And we had a big development yesterday, we now have new information tonight Mueller and his team, they knew like the FBI and the DOJ, that the dossier was dirty from day one and they still used it in the FISA warrant, Gregg Jarrett with new, explosive detail, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So last night on this program we had huge news with The Hills, John Solomon, breaking the story that the Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, under oath in Congressional Testimony, revealing two high-ranking DOJ, FBI officials that Christopher Steele and his dossier was, in fact, connected and paid for by Clinton and very well would be polluted politically biased.
Our own Gregg Jarrett now explores the major legal consequences of this in his new article entitled out on foxnews.com, "Mueller's team new dossier kicking off Trump investigation was biased and defective". Here to discuss the details, author of the number one bestseller, "Russia Hoax", the illicit scheme to clear Hillary Clinton, frame Donald Trump. Fox News Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett and the author of the bestseller, "Licensed to Lie", exposing corruption in the Justice Department, Former Federal Prosecutor Sidney Powell is back with us.
All right, Gregg, let's start with your column and let's now take a wee. So in August of 2016, Bruce Ohr warns everybody, all the people in the FBI, the upper echelon and DOJ--
GREGG JARRETT, "THE RUSSIA HOAX", AUTHOR: And DOJ--
HANNITY: --warns them, Hillary paid for this, biased and Christopher Steele hates Trump.
JARRETT: Right. So they knew it's paid for about Hillary Clinton. They knew that it's written by a guy who'd do anything to stop Donald Trump. They should have dropped it, therefore in the trash can. They didn't. They thought it was gold. We don't care if it's phony or not, we'll use it as a pretext of the frame Donald Trump.
HANNITY: Russian lies--
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: Paid for, OK.
JARRETT Right. So who does Bruce Ohr tell - we've now confirmed, I've been able to confirm as well, much of his deposition testimony. He implicates two top officials at the Department of Justice who were now on the special counsel's team of partisans and two others at the FBI who were on it who has since left.
So now - you often asked me, "Why isn't Mueller investigating the FBI and the DOJ for Hillary-Russian collusion?" I think we now know the answer. Four people on his own panel were implicated--
HANNITY: Including one, Andrew Weissmann, we talk about all the time.
JARRETT: Zainab Ahmad, Andrew Weissmann and of course, the infamous Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, all four--
HANNITY: Knew about this.
JARRETT: --were on. Yes, they all knew in the summer of 2016 that this thing was suspect.
HANNITY: OK. So if he's supposedly looking at Russian interference, Hillary pays for Russian lies about our opponent that they are peddling--
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: --even we have our own intel community peddling to the American people. So they do it to steal an election. Then they do it to get a FISA warrant. You know what everyone talk, why it doesn't - and why aren't any of these people are investigated? Where's the Grand Jury? When is somebody going to do their job?
JARRETT: Because you had the incompetent and feckless Jeff Sessions in charge and Rod Rosenstein who signed off on one of the FISA warrants improperly.
HANNITY: And he knew it was bought and paid for--
JARRETT: That's right. He's been--
HANNITY: --and not verified.
JARRETT: He's been obstructing ever since. So Sessions is gone, Rosenstein will soon be gone, William Barr will become the Attorney General, and I'm fairly confident, he will investigate.
HANNITY: IF he doesn't, then we're a banana republic. Sidney, let me go to you. You know a lot about Andrew Weissmann, because you wrote about him. He's Mueller's pit ball. Now he knew about this and they're looking into Russia collusion and they never touched this?
SIDNEY POWELL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Sean, I'm sure, Mr. Weissmann was very involved and he might have even helped draft the FISA applications. He would have known about it from the first conversation he had with Christopher Steele.
I mean, this kind of fabrication is right up Mr. Weissmann's alley as you know from reading "Licensed to Lie" yourself. He's very good at making up crimes and making up the factual narrative he wants to suit whatever crime he wants to charge, that's his standard operating procedure--
HANNITY: But Sidney it even gets worse--
POWELL: - while he has the evidence that shows people are innocent.
HANNITY: Because remember, Bruce Ohr after Steele's fired for lying and leaking by the FBI, they still wanted more contact with him. His contact was Bruce Ohr. And they're writing about - we have Christopher Steele who built this lying, phony dossier, that's debunked, now giving information to Bruce Ohr to funnel to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller himself. We have that evidence.
POWELL: Oh, yes, yes. And I think it goes back farther than that, Sean. I think it goes back to 2015 when Comey gave illegal access to the raw NSA data to three private contractors. I would bet that one of those is Fusion GPS and that they were mining that data to create this phony dossier with Christopher Steele in the first place.
HANNITY: So for two years though--
POWELL: And then recycled it through him.
HANNITY: Two years it's been Trump-Russia and they knew from the get-go that Hillary paid for Russian lies that were disseminated to the American people and then they use those lies, that they knew or lies, never verified it.
If they would have done their job, they sign off it as Gospel truth to get a warrant. Shred the constitution; shred the Fourth Amendment to spy on a Trump campaign associate. And they're the people in charge of looking into Russian collusion?
POWELL: Exactly. They lied to the FISA Court and Mr. Rosenstein signed the applications, Mr. Comey signed the applications. There are others who signed those applications as well, whose names have been redacted. We need to know who those people are.
The investigation that Mr. Mueller started should have been of those people and never of the Trump campaign at all. It's egregious government misconduct. The Mueller witch-hunt should be ended immediately and the entire team should be disbanded and they are the ones that should be investigated.
HANNITY: Is that - we got to have the law followed--
POWELL: I don't know, Sean. I mean, I'm still concerned about Mr. Barr's personal relationship with Mr. Mueller.
HANNITY: So am I, you're not?
JARRETT: No. Look, the bottom-line here is there was no Trump collusion, but there was Hillary, FBI, Department of Justice collusion, and four people on Mueller Special Counsel team involved.
HANNITY: And also we know that they literally lied to FISA Court and committed fraud. All right, when we come back Whoopi Goldberg going after comrade de Blasio.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. You've all heard the phrase "All politics is local". Well, New York - well, Mayor comrade Bill de Blasio found out the hard way during an appearance in New York on The View, yikes. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WHOOPI GOLDBERG, HOST, ABC'S "THE VIEW": You know what's really pissing off?
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-NY, NEW YORK CITY: What? I've never heard you pissed off before.
GOLDBERG: No, you actually haven't. You've built 83 miles of protected bike lanes, I don't think you understand the impact of taking something like 10th Avenue, which is six lanes down to two-and-a-half, particularly when you have a winter storm and you can't move - none of that is moveable so you can't get - nothing flows.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: He thinks he's going to be president. If he is, we are really screwed. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. This is not the hate Trump media, we are fair and balanced. Let not your heart be troubled, Laura Ingraham standing by for "The Ingraham Angle." Laura?
