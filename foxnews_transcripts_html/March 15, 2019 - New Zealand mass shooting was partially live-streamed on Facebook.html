NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, Shepard, thank you very much.
I am Neil Cavuto, and this is "Your World."

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

And the president doing something now that he's never done. He's got a veto, a first veto, at that. We're going to get the playback from that very shortly from the White House, where you will find our very busy John Roberts today. I think he's been on every hour throughout the day on every channel. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Anyway, John, it's always good to have you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What is your sense of what we're getting from the president today on this?
JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're getting a lot of what the president has been saying over the last few years now about border security and the need to build a wall to stop cross-border illegal traffic, whether it be in human beings who try to migrate to the United States, whether it be human trafficking, whether it be cross-border drug trafficking or other illegal activity. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The president believes that there is a crisis on the southern border. He had the attorney general, William Barr, next to him there in the Oval Office to give him backup on the legal front, and the president praising the 41 Republican senators who stood by him.
Now, don't forget the argument in the Senate, maybe it was for Democrats, but it wasn't for Republicans, wasn't about a border barrier and whether or not the president should build one. It was about how he gets to that point. The president wanted to make this emergency declaration so that he could reprogram $3.6 billion from the military construction budget over to the construction of a border barrier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That required an emergency declaration for him to do it. He's also got some other money that he got from Congress, $1.37 billion. He's got money from forfeiture funds and some other money that he can move around inside the drug interdiction program at the Pentagon to get to about $4 billion. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But he wanted more than that, which is why he wanted this emergency declaration. But the president using the attorney general, the vice president, secretary of homeland security, an Angel Mother whose child was killed by a person who was in this country illegally, as well as some law enforcement people, to say there is a crisis on the southern border, Democrats in Congress do not get it, and that is why I am issuing this veto, the very first veto of my administration, so that I can continue with my emergency declaration and use that $3.6 billion reprogrammed for military construction to build the barrier.
Now, it's very possible that because there are a number -- number of lawsuits, a number somewhere between seven and 10 that are pending against this, that the president's ability to move this money around may be short- lived.
He may be enjoyed by the courts very soon and fight that all the way up to the Supreme Court. But, again, Neil, don't forget he's got about another $4 billion that he can start to build new mileage of border wall with while this thing is making its way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now it's out of the political process, except for a show veto override vote scheduled for March the 26th. And then it will likely get into the courts, where it may take a number of months for it to make its way through.
CAVUTO: John Roberts, thank you, my friend.
To Tiana Lowe right now with The Washington Examiner. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Obviously, Democrats don't like this. A number of Republicans, Tiana, don't like this. What's going to happen? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Ultimately, it's up for the courts to decide, because, as we see, there are already a handful of lawsuits, and surely there will be dozens more.
But really this is sort of a staggering blow, the fact that you have Republicans like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio who were willing to take a stand against the president in something that is arguably legal, but probably not constitutional, as emergency powers are intended. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CAVUTO: So he pointed out the Republicans who voted with him, and he appreciates that. He did not those who did not. So how's that going to go down?
LOWE: So, I mean, those who voted against him did the right thing. I mean, really what has to be done is Senator Mike Lee's bill and that -- Mike Lee voted for -- to overturn this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Senator Mike Lee's bill to update the National Emergencies Act and make it so that way any national emergency must be approved by Congress within 30 days or else it expires. That's what really needs to happen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Right now, yes, this is political posturing from Nancy Pelosi. It is. But it is still setting an important precedent to limit the power of the president.
CAVUTO: So, real quickly, he has the votes to avoid an override for the time being, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LOWE: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, I mean, he would have required -- it would have been 67 votes in the Senate required in order to make it veto-proof. And it didn't look like it was going to come anywhere near that.
CAVUTO: All right.
LOWE: But I do think that voters will remember who stood for the Constitution come 2020, for those more vulnerable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CAVUTO: It depends on the voter, I guess. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tiana, thank you very much.
Now to the White House, the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: .... sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques. These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing. You've all been seeing what went on. It's a horrible, horrible thing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {

        }
      
I told the prime minister that the United States is with them all the way, a hundred percent. Whatever they need, we will be there. New Zealand has been a great friend and partner for many years. Our relationship has never been better. And what they're going through is absolutely terrible. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So our hearts are with them, and whatever we can do.
We're grateful to be joined today by the Vice President -- thank you very much, Mike, for being here -- members of my Cabinet, devoted public servants, and Angel parents -- very important people to me and to a lot of other people.
I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you so much for being here, and we appreciate it. Thank you. You've gone through a lot, as we take action to restore our national sovereignty and defend this nation from criminal cartels, human traffickers, and drug smugglers, crime of all kinds coming through our southern border and other places. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But this is the place. This is the place we have the biggest problem by far. And I want to also compliment the incredible people at Border Patrol and ICE and law enforcement for the job they have done. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They have apprehended so many thousands and thousands of people, that, if we had the proper protection, we wouldn't even have to apprehend. They wouldn't be coming in.
As president, the protection of the nation is my highest duty. Yesterday, Congress passed dangerous resolution that, if signed into law, would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Democrat-sponsored resolution would terminate vital border security operations by revoking the national emergency issued last month. It is definitely a national emergency. Rarely have we had such a national emergency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Therefore, to defend the safety and security of all of Americans, I will be signing and issuing a formal veto of this reckless resolution. And that's what it was.
And I have to in particular thank the Republicans, strong, wonderful people, the Republican senators that were on our side and on the side of border security and on the side of doing what they have to, to keep our nation safe. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They were very courageous yesterday. And I appreciate that very much. Congress' vote to deny the crisis on the southern border is a vote against reality. It's against reality. It is a tremendous national emergency. It is a tremendous crisis.
Last month, more than 76,000 illegal migrants arrived at our border. We're on track for a million illegal aliens to rush our borders. People hate the word invasion, but that's what it is. It's an invasion of drugs and criminals and people. We have no idea of who they are, but we capture them because border security is so good. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But they're put in a very bad position. And we're bursting at the seams, literally bursting at the seams. What Border Patrol is able to do is incredible. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I also, by the way, want to thank our military, because our military has been very much involved, as you know. And they're putting up walls, in some cases temporary. In some cases, they were supposed to be temporary. They're so good that they're better than the permanent, so we're leaving them.
We have really nowhere left to hold all of the people that we are capturing. And we're at a point where we're just going to have to say, with these horrible decisions that we have been handed by people that aren't living in reality that there's nothing we can do, there's absolutely nothing we can do. We're bursting at the seams. You can only do so much.
And the only option then is to release them. But you can't do that either, because, when you release them, they come into our society, and in many cases, they're stone-cold criminals. And in many cases and in some cases, you have killers coming in and murderers coming in. And we're not going to allow that to happen. Just not going to allow it to happen.

There's been nearly 2000 percent increase in border-related asylum claims over the last decade. Part of the reason is because our country is doing so well economically that people are coming up in droves. The vast majority are rejected, but smuggling organizations making a tremendous amount of money, like they have never made before, are using these people to crash the system.
Our immigration system is stretched beyond the breaking point. And, as I said, nothing much we can do. We can just do our job and do it well, but there's a point at which, if the Democrats would, would get in, we would be able to make a deal.
Literally, in 15 minutes, we could make a deal on changing catch and release, changing the horrible asylum laws that are so unfair, changing visa lottery, chain migration. These laws are just horrendous. I won't explain them, but everybody standing behind me knows exactly what they are.

The border crisis is driving the drug crisis; 70,000 Americans a year are killed by drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. And the 70,000 people is a number that's so low, that it probably shouldn't even be used anymore.
The mass incursion of illegal aliens, deadly drugs, dangerous weapons and criminal gang members across our borders has to end. We're bringing out thousands and thousands a year of MS-13 gang members and other gang members that are just as bad, where they come into our country, they're able to skirt the border, come to areas where we don't have proper wall, where we don't have any wall at all, and they get into the country.

And they do a lot of damage in many cases. But we get them out by the thousands and we bring them back or we incarcerate them.
The national emergency I declared last month was authorized by Congress under the 1976 National Emergencies Act. And there haven't been too many that are a bigger emergency than we have right at our own border.

Consistent with the law and the legislative process designed by our founders, today, I am vetoing this resolution. Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it. And I'm very proud to veto it. And I'm very proud, as I said, of a lot of Republican senators that were with me.

And I'm also very proud of the House. The Republicans in the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of a secure border. Since 1976, presidents have declared 59 national emergencies. They often involved protecting foreign citizens in far-off lands.

Yet Congress has not terminated any of them. Every single one of them is still in existence. And yet we don't worry about our land. We worry about other people's land. That's why I say America first, if that's OK, America first.
The only emergency Congress voted to revoke was the one to protect our own country. So, think of that. With all of the national emergencies, this was the one they don't want to do, and this is the one perhaps they should most do.

We're joined today by many brave law enforcement offices, including sheriffs and just people that have been just tremendous, tremendous backers of law and order, which we have to have.
We're also joined by friends of mine, Mary Ann Mendoza, Kent Terry, Laura Wilkerson, Sabine Durden, and Steve Ronnebeck. And I'm going to ask Steve to say a few words.
And I'm going to ask some of the folks behind me to say also a few words as to the importance of what we're doing. There's nothing more important. As I said, I was elected on a very -- by a very, very great group of American people, millions and millions of people, because they want security for our country.
And that's what we're going to have.

Secretary?
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Sir, I just want to thank you and the Vice President for your leadership and your constant support of the brave men and women not only represented behind you, on the very front lines of our country, but of CBP and ICE.
The fact that this is an emergency is undeniable. We have not seen this type of flow. As you know, it's predominantly families and children, which means that there's a very unique and dangerous humanitarian crisis at hand, in addition to the security that you just described in your remarks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So we have a duty to know who comes in our country, and we have a duty to ensure that the flow is safe and orderly. That's what you've attempted to do and that's what you've demanded that Congress do. And I just again ask Congress to please pay attention. We've given you the facts. The system is breaking. Security is at risk. And the very humanitarian protections that we hold dear in this country are at risk in terms of our ability to provide those to vulnerable populations.
So, Mr. President, thank you always for your leadership and great support.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you.
Bill?

WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Mr. President, your declaration of an emergency on the southern border was clearly authorized under the law and consistent with past precedent.
As you said, the National Emergencies Act directly authorizes the President, and gives broad discretionary authority to the President, to identify and respond to emergent circumstances that require a decisive response.
And the humanitarian and security crisis we have on the border right now is exactly the kind of emergency that Presidents are permitted to address under the National Emergencies Act.
TRUMP: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BARR: As you alluded to yourself, in the past 40 years, there have been 59 emergencies declared. And many of these have dealt with political conditions in countries like Burundi, Sierra Leone, Belarus. The crisis that we're dealing with today is right on our doorstep, and it presents a real clear and present danger to the American people.
So what you've done from a legal standpoint is solidly grounded in law. And from the standpoint of protecting the American people, it's imperative.
TRUMP: Thank you very much, Bill. That's great. So you'll be defending it...

BARR: Yes.
TRUMP: ... and you'll defend it well. I have no doubt about that.
Would anybody like to say something? Why don't we start with Mike?
MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I don't know that I have ever been more proud to be standing next to your desk than I am today, to be standing with these courageous Americans and with these extraordinary Angel parents.
We have a crisis on our southern border. The reality is it's not only a crisis of illegal immigration, but criminal elements are coming across our border; the flow of drugs. Now drug overdose is the number-one cause of death for Americans under the age of 55.
So the crisis on our southern border is a crisis all across this nation. Add in human trafficking and all that comes with this crisis; justify the President's declaration of a national emergency -- this is affecting all the people of the United States.
And today, Mr. President, with your strong support for the men and women of law enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security, and with, I know, what is your love in your heart for these Angel parents, you're keeping your word by vetoing this legislation, by finding the available resources to build the wall, address this emergency, and secure our border.

And I know I speak on behalf of all gathered here, people all across this country, when I say thank you for keeping your word, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Thank you, Mike. I appreciate that.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Sheriff, please.
ANDY LOUDERBACK, SHERIFF OF JACKSON COUNTY, TEXAS: Mr. President, thank you so much for a very necessary veto to support public safety in this country.
The sheriffs and men and women of law enforcement in this room and across this nation owe you a debt of gratitude for something that we've been waiting for, for decades. Our hats are off to you again, sir. It's an honor to be here. It's an honor for sheriffs to be involved in this, and it's an honor for law enforcement, as we fight the drug trade every day in this country, and all the things that go along in our business, in our profession, from an insecure border. So, again, sincerely, we thank you, sir.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you for being there with me all the way.

Sheriff, what would you like to say? Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, I can't thank you enough on behalf of America's sheriffs. As you well know, there are men and women in law enforcement across this country that are fighting a battle every single day. They are in the trenches.
While we Americans only make up about 7 percent of the world's total population, about 68 percent of the world's total drugs are consumed here in the United States every year. This is not political propaganda. We have a dire crisis on our southwest border, and America's sheriffs stand behind the President of the United States, 100 percent. He has had our back. He's had the Americans' back. And we stand behind you solidly for what you're doing here today.
This is unprecedented for a President to take this type of action. And we commend you, we applaud you, and I salute you, sir.
TRUMP: Thank you very much.

MARY ANN MENDOZA, MOTHER: My son was killed in 2014 by a repeat illegal alien criminal allowed to stay in this country. He was police officer in Mesa, Arizona.
And Angel Families come forward to tell their stories not because we've created a manufactured crisis but because we want to tell the American people and share with you our heartache and let you know what is happening on our doorsteps, what's happening to your neighbors, what's happening to your fellow Americans. And there is a way to prevent this, and it's not by continually lying to you and telling you that there isn't a problem. There is a problem. It's a national emergency.
And thank you...
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
MENDOZA: ... for following through on your promises.

TRUMP: Please. Go ahead. Please.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, I echo the sentiments. Thank you for all the support. This has been something we're not used to for the last several years, to have this kind of support.
This is -- what we say in Arizona is, this isn't about immigration anymore; this is about drug trafficking and human trafficking into this country. If you care about human rights, you should absolutely care about border security. Human beings are being -- their rights are being violated on that border every day.
And I know I speak on behalf of the Arizona border sheriffs that I challenge our congressmen and women and senators to come down and see firsthand what we're dealing with. See it for yourselves before you cast your vote. And you'll see that we do -- we are dealing with a crisis. And we're fighting every day alongside our federal partners, our local partners, sheriff's officers to take care of this.
So thank you, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Thank you.

Sheriff?
THOMAS HODGSON, BRISTOL COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS, SHERIFF: Mr. President, I have been a sheriff for 21 years, and I have been dealing with Congress for 21 years on this issue of immigration. A lot of people have listened over 21 years, but Mr. President, you are the first person who has taken action. And you have given us back our footing in law enforcement, but you've also given the American people back what they deserve, which is to be protected. 
And signing this today, I can't tell you how much it means to all of us in law enforcement. But, importantly, Mr. President, when I hear people say, "You know, this is all manufactured. It's all this and that" -- no, it's not.
In my county alone, one city, we have on average, on second shift at our hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, 15 to 20 overdoses on second shift every day. And this is going on -- that's one example. This is happening all over the country.
But, Mr. President, you have stood up and you've taken the action. And the American people are behind you and we're behind you. And thank you and God bless you for what you're doing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

TRUMP: Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Is Thomas Murphy here? Where's Tom? Tom Murphy. Tom? Where's Thomas? You had a horrible ordeal that you just went through with your son.
TOM MURPHY, FATHER: Mr. President, I would like to tell you and tell the public that if you don't think it can happen to you or your family, I have a quick story.
I have been with state police for over 30 years working narcotics and gang task forces, and supervised those for 22 years. My son grew up with depression issues and some mental health concerns. He self-medicated with marijuana. At 18 -- and his father, me, had him arrested a few times along the way.
When he turned 18, he moved out the day of his birthday, when he turned 18 years old, because he knew Dad had rules, and one was: no drugs in the house. He moved out, stayed with some friends, got a job. He had a work- related injury where he severed four fingers, and he was introduced to opioids. So he was battling two things, actually: mental illness and the opioid addiction.
Afterwards, he finally came to me and, for the first time in his life, he said he needed help. We sent him to a rehab facility for only 30 days because that's what our insurance would pay for at that time. He came out of rehab. Everything was fine for approximately three months. The craving was too much for him, got a hold of some heroin that was laced with fentanyl, and he died on December 13, 2017. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So I'm here to say: As far as stigma goes in narcotics and "It's not going to happen to me, it's not going to happen to my family" -- my father is a retired minister of 45 years. My sister is in the medical field. My brother is in law enforcement. No one even smokes in our family. No one has ever been arrested. It happened to me. It happened to our family. So, it can happen. That's how horrific and addictive this drug is.
So anything you can do to help us and families like us is greatly appreciated.
TRUMP: And it's coming through the southern border, folks. All through the southern border. Thank you very much.
CHUCK JENKINS, FREDERICK COUNTY, MARYLAND, SHERIFF: Mr. President, thank you very much, sir.
TRUMP: Yes, please.
JENKINS: This is the first real step in confronting the heroin drug crisis in this country. We're going to make real strides after this. I'm the sheriff of your home over at Camp David, Frederick County.
TRUMP: That's right.

        }
      
JENKINS: We suffer the same problems there. And I'm convinced, without what you're here doing today, every county becomes a border county. Thank you, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Thank you, Sheriff.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: So let's get this signed, right? On behalf of your great loved ones, right? I always said, "They will not have died in vain." Did I tell you that a long time ago? Three years ago.
SABINE DURDEN, MOTHER: Yes. You told me that four years ago.
TRUMP: Right? When we first met on the campaign.
DURDEN: Yes. Four years ago. Yes.
TRUMP: When they said, "Oh, Trump is not going to win." You said Trump was going to win, and I said, "And they will not have died in vain."
DURDEN: That's right. You told me that.
TRUMP: And that's true. I say it today with even more meaning. It was a big step.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
Thank you. That's a big -- a big step. We're building a lot of wall right now. It's started. A lot of people are saying, "Well, gee, you took down wall and you're building new." Well, we took down wall that almost didn't exist. It was like paper. And we're replacing it with, in many cases, 30- foot bollards. And, in many cases, we're replacing it with 18-foot wall.
But we have a lot of -- we have many miles under construction right now, and we're going to be signing contracts over the next couple of days for literally hundreds of miles of wall. And it's being built in the right places, and it's doing the job. It's doing the job.
And it's interesting -- it's like a little bit like water. As we do -- we did San Diego. You know, California is very interesting because they keep talking in California -- "We don't want wall." I see a new candidate who is in the mix; he wants to take down the walls. Try that sometime. You'll see what will happen. You'd have tens of millions of people coming in.
You see -- take a look at Tijuana. Take down that wall. You want to see a mess? Take down that wall; you'll see what will happen. Right now, we have thousands of people who are in Tijuana trying to get in. They're not getting in.
So as we build it, it gets better and better. But it gets really to a point, and they come through a point. But you can control that point. And this is serious stuff. This is -- we're able to do it cheaper, better. It's better wall. It's different from what you've been watching going up. We had to take the old plans. We didn't want to stop, so we took the old plans. We didn't like it.
This wall is a beautiful-looking structure. It's much stronger. And you can build it faster and cheaper. Other than that, what can I say, right?
It's a -- it's going to be great, and it's going to have a tremendous impact.
And on top of that, I have to thank the Secretary and all the people that have worked so hard, because what you do on the Border Patrol -- what you do, what those patrol agents and what the ICE folks do, and taking people out of the country that nobody wants to talk to. Even some of the sheriffs there -- you know, if you can get ICE to do it, you don't mind if they do it. Right, Sheriff? As tough as you are.
These are tough people and they're great people. These are people that -- the ICE folks take such abuse from Democrats and some others. They love our country as much as anybody loves our country.
So we're building a lot of wall and we're taking good care of our people. And we're doing, at point of entry, a tremendous amount of work. We're already in contract to buy -- they make pretty incredible new equipment for drug detection where you can find out what's in the wheel of a car, where it is, where it's in the engine, where it's in the hubcaps. I mean, we have some incredible stuff.
Plus, we have -- also, we're getting dogs. More dogs, believe it or not. I still say -- is that still true? There's nothing that replaces a good dog. Is that right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.
TRUMP: Buying this equipment for very expensive. But we haven't been able -- it's true. We haven't been able to match the dog.
I have seen out at Secret Service, where they showed me the dogs, certain types of German Shepherd -- very specific types of dog. But what they do is they'll run by 15 boxes, all empty except one. And they'll be very, very strongly sealed boxes. And they'll coming running full speed and stop like on a dime. They know the drugs are in that box. It's the most incredible thing.
So, we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on equipment, but I will say this: It's not as good as the dogs. (Laughter. ) But, as you know, we're getting you -- so you're going to have the best equipment, but we're getting a lot of dogs for the various entry points also.
So with that, I just want to thank everybody for being here. In particular, I want to thank you, folks, because you have been -- and please say "hello" to all of your friends that have been with us, really, from day one. What you've gone through is unthinkable, and I appreciate it.
And you're strong people. You're strong and you're proud. And your kids are, you know, looking down on you right now and they're -- they're very proud of their moms and their dads. You know that, right? They're very proud.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
And, again, to those Republican senators that did what they had to do yesterday, I want to thank them. They're very special friends and very special people. And they want to see borders that are strong, where we don't allow drugs and crime and all of the problems coming into our country.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
QUESTION: Do you see, today, white nationalism as a rising threat around the world?
TRUMP: I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet. They're just learning about the person and the people involved. But it's certainly a terrible thing. Terrible thing.
Yes?
QUESTION: Mr. President, some of the Republicans who voted for this resolution say they support border security but oppose executive overreach. Do you have sympathy for their position?
TRUMP: I do. Look, they were doing what they have to do. And I'm -- look, I did -- I put no pressure on anybody. I actually said -- I could've gotten some of them to come along. I said, "I want you to vote your heart. Do what you want to do." I'm not putting any pressure. I will let them know when there's pressure. OK? And I told them that.
I said, "When I need your vote, I'm going to let you know." I didn't need the vote because we all knew it was going to be a veto, and they're not going to be able to override. It's going to go very quickly.
And we have a great -- as your Attorney General just said, the case is a very strong case, a very powerful case. It was -- I think, actually, a national emergency was designed for a specific purpose like this. So we have a great -- we have a great case, and I think it's going very --
I mean, ideally, they shouldn't even sue in this case, if you want to know the truth. They shouldn't be suing on this case, but they will because they always do.
We want border security, we want safety, we want no drugs, we want no human trafficking. OK?
QUESTION: And on -- just one follow-up on New Zealand. The killer in this tragic incident wrote a manifesto apparently. Did you see that? Apparently, he mentioned your name.
TRUMP: I did not see it. I did not see it. But I think it's a horrible event. It's a horrible thing. I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening in New Zealand. I just spoke, as you know, to the prime minister. I think it's a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.
OK? Thank you all very much.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAVUTO: All right, there you have it, the president of the United States issuing his first veto more than two years into his administration.
The question is, will it survive on Capitol Hill? Right now, he is confident, he says, that he has the votes to avoid an override.
Who would know better than our Capitol Hill producer, Chad Pergram, who joins us now?
Chad, what do you think?
CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, the president seems to be right here, because, if you take the vote to overturn the national emergency in the House of Representatives -- and that's where this veto override will go back to first, is the House, because that's the house of origination. That's where this bill originated. And that's how you do it under the Constitution.
They would need 285 yeas. They came short by about 40. There were 245 yeses for that bill a couple of weeks ago. And so that veto override -- and this is confirmed here in just the past couple of moments -- Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, says, definitively, that the veto override attempt will be on the 26th of March.
Congress is out next week, so they will do that first order of business in about 10 days.
I'm going to read you part of a statement here that was just issued by the speaker here. And she says -- quote -- "House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oaths to support and defend the Constitution."
And, Neil, what Pelosi strong to do here is say, there were only 13 Republicans who broke -- broke ranks last time and voted to end the national emergency. Can they try to put pressure on more? Now, that's a far cry to get the 40-some odd votes. But can they make that an issue going into the election in 2020 and say, are you really going to stand with the president and vote with him on these things?
And they start to develop this compendium that they can turn around and weaponize these roll call votes against Republicans as we go into 2020.
That said, Neil, I should point out that there were only three Republicans in the House of Representatives right now who represent districts that were carried by Hillary Clinton.
CAVUTO: Is there any fear among those dozen or so Republicans in the Senate, for example, who voted against this?
The president had been praising those Republicans who did vote for him. And he said, I respect their decision not to.
But was there much arm-twisting going on?
PERGRAM: Yes, there certainly was, because they were trying to keep that vote under 60. They got 59. They switched Thom Tillis, Republican senator from North Carolina, which was rather extraordinary, because he had written an op-ed and The Washington Post saying that what the reasons were, saying, we have to have a separation of powers.
In an interview with Fox in the hallway a couple of days later, he said, unless I'm presented with other information.
Well, Senator Tillis must have been presented with some other information here, because he changed his vote right before. And I should remind folks that Thom Tillis has a very competitive reelection in 2020 in a swing state. The convention in 2020 will be held there.
And you can bet that the Democrats are going to really turn up the machine against him because he flipped and stood with the president. That's where someone like Cory Gardner -- you know, he voted also to sustain the national emergency. And he will get a lot of pressure too. That's a swing state as well.
CAVUTO: Chad Pergram, thank you very, very much.
PERGRAM: Thank you.
CAVUTO: Now let's go to Mark Morgan, former Border Patrol chief under President Barack Obama.
Mark, good to have you back.
What do you think of this?
MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF: Look, the president is absolutely right.
This is absolutely a national emergency, Neil. And this isn't based on some political ideology. Look, I have been working for this country for 30 years in military, law enforcement, lived on the border, worked on the border, worked the cartels, and the same thing.
He had over 200 years of law enforcement experience sitting behind him saying, this is a national emergency. He had Angel families sitting right there talking about the loved ones that have been killed at the hands of illegal aliens because of our broken laws and our open border.
He's absolutely right. I stand behind this president. He's doing his job to protect this country.
CAVUTO: Mark, I'm no lawyer, but I understand that a lot of lawyers are pouncing on this and planning to challenge this in any of the variety of courts, and that that will happen.
What I'm curious about is, when that is effectively challenged, or a judge or a circuit court says, you can't do this, does that mean that whatever building is going on has to stop? What is the strategy after that?
MORGAN: Well, it could be.
And I hearken back to my law school days. So they could -- again, we have seen a lot of judicial activism in this country, lower courts setting national policy. And we have seen that again and again.
And so they could win at a lower court an automatic stay that could prevent some things. That's very possible. But I also think you're going to see this fast tracked to the Supreme Court if it's necessary. And I hope so. And I hope the president stays strong.
CAVUTO: What do you think of those who did not vote for this, citing some of those constitutional reasons, and it's a slippery slope, that no matter what party you're on, you don't want to give this power willy-nilly to any president?
MORGAN: So, I reject them voting the way that they did, Neil.
And let's break that down really quickly. So they didn't do their job. They didn't listen to the experts. And they passed a spending bill that did not protect this country. And then, when the president goes to do the job they failed to do, what do they do? They try to block him from doing that. And they quote a constitutional reason to do so.
No, they failed to do their job. And the president is using -- is actually using his constitutional authority of the national emergency, as well as his veto party -- power to do exactly what we should ask Congress to do. They failed to do it. The president is.
CAVUTO: All right, Mark Morgan, former Border Patrol chief under President Barack Obama, thank you, Mark.
MORGAN: You bet.
CAVUTO: Now to the retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata.
General, good to have you.
What do you think of what the president just did?
BRIG. GEN. ANTHONY TATA (RET.), U.S. ARMY: I think it's a great move, that the president is doing exactly the right thing.
He's got a country to defend. His first duty is to protect America and its people. And he's -- he's taken that duty very seriously. And he's doing it by vetoing this resolution. And so, from a military point of view, Neil, what a wall does is, it funnels migrants to the ports of entry, and allows for a more efficient use of Border Patrol and other law enforcement officials, and allows you to put technology in other areas that can look for the things that -- you know, human trafficking and everything the president pointed out, the drugs and so forth.
And we're kidding ourselves if we don't think there's a terrorist nexus out. There is one in Venezuela right now, with Russia, Cuba, and Hezbollah in Iran. And they funnel up through Central America. And they're pressing on our border.
And we're kidding ourselves if we don't think that that's the case. And it's our five-yard line. And we're OK going overseas and fighting the enemy on their five-yard line. It's time that we defend our five-yard line, to use a football terminology.
CAVUTO: As a general who served this country very bravely, sir, I'm curious what your thoughts are on the power this emergency declaration would also give the president to sort of go within the defense budget and take moneys...
TATA: Sure.
CAVUTO: ... from there, for example, that might be reallocated here.
And how do you feel about that?
TATA: I feel that it's an appropriate use of defense funds to defend the border.
Our first priority is to defend America. And, frequently, that's done overseas in disrupting ungoverned spaces like Afghanistan and Syria and Iraq that -- where terrorists can plan and try to attack our country.
But, more importantly, now we have detected there is this enormous flow of migrants coming up. And in those flows are our enemies that are trying to do us harm. And so it makes sense to move money. And a few billion dollars -- the president has boosted the defense budget over $700 billion; 718, I think, was last year.
And so to take just a small fraction of that money and put it on the border makes complete sense to me. And the military will be able to figure out how to reallocate and make sure that the funding gets to where it needs to be when the gaps are opened as that money is moved.
CAVUTO: All right, General, thank you very, very much.
Again, and to the general's point, the president, in fact, has boosted defense spending, if he gets his way. And it's a tough time in this environment to get your budget through. But he's proposed to bring that defense budget up to around the $770 billion to $780 billion area.
The general was also just talking about terror.
We saw the latest example of that, in fact, live-streaming it, and why Facebook and other social media companies are really getting a lot of grief today for allowing their viewers to see it -- after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO: Just think about this, 17 minutes of terror in New Zealand live and online.
The suspect in that deadly attack actually live-streamed it on Facebook; 49 people were killed at two separate mosques there. Social media companies are reacting, saying they can only do so much.
FOX News Channel's Jonathan Hunt is with us now -- Jonathan.
JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT: Neil, it's a massacre that has left New Zealand and indeed the world stunned and on alert.
It was an attack aim deliberately at Muslims, a gunman live-streaming every moment via a camera mounted on his head. We're not showing any of that video at this point, but I have watched it for the sake of our reporting.
And it's important to describe the detail. The gunman drives calmly toward a mosque, playing music and talking to himself. He then takes weapons from his trunk, walks toward the mosque, which was filling up for Friday prayers, and opens fire, gunning down at least two men at the doorway.
Then he walks inside and shoots every single person he can see. He reloads several times, and at one point goes back into a room where two large groups are laying on the floor, many of them already dead, some wounded. And he walks calmly around, taking kill shots, finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body.
Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street, including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress. She's wounded. She lies on the street crying out for help. The gunman walks up to and once again delivers the final shot.
He then gets back in his car, drives over that woman's body, and continues to shoot other people from his car.
The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and around 236 shots fired, all of it streamed live.
On that point, Facebook told us today -- quote -- "New Zealand police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced, and we quickly removed the shooter's Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video. We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware."
Now, the man on the video also left behind what New Zealand authorities described as a manifesto online. In it, he describes himself as a 28-year- old Australian citizen. He talks about intimidating and repelling what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders.
He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization. And he says he supports President Trump as a symbol of -- quote -- "renewed white identity and common purpose," although not as a policy-maker or leader -- Neil, back to you.
CAVUTO: Jonathan Hunt, thank you very, very much.
Ed Davis is with us right now, the former Boston police commissioner.
And, Ed, if you don't mind, I want to go into this live-streaming thing, because when we were pursuing this on FOX Business earlier today, the companies involved said, while they could take it down, if you have sent a video or shared this video with someone, it's another story. That can't be taken down.
So it does sort of become viral on its own, even when the company does take it down. That raises an issue as to whether live-streaming itself is dangerous, because a lot of kids live-stream, a lot of folks live-stream, having nothing to do with incidents like this.
What do you think?
ED DAVIS, FORMER BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well, hi, Neil.
This is a terrible tragedy. I have had a chance to see the video as well. When people take new tools that are designed for good purposes, and they turn them towards evil, we have to rethink our use of these things.
And it's important to know that this is a tactic that was -- that was advised by ISIS, this live-streaming or videotaping of attacks, as well as the kind of brutality that you saw here and the ideology that's expressed in the manifesto. All of...
CAVUTO: Now, the irony here is that this was a guy who was raging against ISIS and extreme Islamic militants and the rest, but he did have that wherewithal to just show this.
For what end, and to what end?
DAVIS: Well, it's for massive shock. It's to intimidate people. It's to make sure that his actions are broadcast far and wide.
And you're right. This video right now is widely available on -- online. It's impossible to put that genie back in the bottle after something like this gets out here.
So, nobody wants to talk about censorship. Nobody wants to talk about limiting people's rights.
CAVUTO: Yes.
DAVIS: But something needs to be done in these situations.
CAVUTO: I don't know whether you think he had accomplices. I know a number of people were arrested.
But I do remember, Commissioner, how you handled the Tsarnaev brothers' attack in Boston. And you were helped by video and other -- that was everywhere that you could cull together and put two and two together.
Do you suspect there's something like that there?
DAVIS: There's no -- in my mind, there's no doubt that there will be video available to the officials, that they are downloading that right now and poring through it.
It -- that those pickups are so important to us as we look back on a case like this. So people will be able to piece together his actions beforehand.
But the truth of the matter is, this crime is on tape. It is from beginning to end...
CAVUTO: Yes.
DAVIS: ... easy for us to see, which is really chilling.
CAVUTO: Yes. It's amazing.
Commissioner, thank you very, very much. I do appreciate it.
DAVIS: Thank you, Neil.
CAVUTO: All right, the black boxes, they're now in French hands, going through the Ethiopian Air Flight 302 disaster, but now we're getting word that it could be a while before we get anything out of those boxes.
Now, keep in mind, all of this happened a week ago Sunday, and getting any information could be delayed days after that. What's going on?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO: All right, it's been five days now.
Last Sunday, all of this happened with Ethiopian Airlines' crash of a jet that had a tie-in with Lion Air back in Indonesia in the fall that has a lot of investigators wondering, once they retrieve that black box, to get some answers.
Here's the thing. It's been taken all around Europe, finally arrives in France. There are protocol problems in France trying to decide how to go about investigating this. Now word from Ethiopian Airlines that the French have told them, we will get to it, but it will be a few days.
So, if you're waiting for that to get a sort of a ticktock on this, you could be waiting a while.
But our Trace Gallagher has learned from a number of other sources where they do have information, what was going on in that plane that day last Sunday.
Hey, Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
And, Neil, it appears the reason the FAA grounded the 737 MAX 8's is because of the similarities between last Sunday's crash and the crash of Lion Air back in October.
For example, both flights had drastic speed fluctuations during the initial ascent. In fact, because of the wild acceleration, the Ethiopian air pilot radioed that he had a control problem -- quoting here -- "Break, break, request back to home. Request vector for landing," meaning, I need to turn around.
That was the last contact before the crash. And now reports say investigators in Africa have located the Ethiopian Air's horizontal stabilizer. That's the small wing on the tail section that controls the up-and-down movement of the nose.
It appears that stabilizer was in the same unusual position as the stabilizer on the Lion Air flight in October. Remember, the anti-stall system appears to be the primary focus in both of these crashes. And here's why.
When Boeing redesigned the 737 to create the MAX 8, the position of the engines changed, and that change, balance of the airplane also changed. So to make sure the plane's nose never got too high, which could lead to a stall, engineers added a system to automatically bring the nose down.
But, during a faulty sensor reading, which apparently happened aboard Lion Air, the system may have brought the nose down too much and put the plane into a dive. And the pilots didn't know how to correct the problem because Boeing didn't include the system or the fix in the operating manual.
As you said, the cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder, so-called black boxes are now being analyzed in Paris. No information so far -- Neil.
CAVUTO: All right, Trace, thank you very, very much.
That pilot in question, by the way, had over 8,000 hours of flying experience and was considered impeccable.
We will have more after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO: You know, markets did pretty well this week.
Susan Li here to tell you how well.
Hey, Susan.
SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT: Hey.
Yes, so we saw the best week in four for the Dow. But, today, the focus was on the social media stocks, like Facebook, the owner of YouTube is Google, and Twitter, because of that 17-minute distressing video of the mosques shooting.
So, regulators, this is exactly why we have a close eye on these type of names, because they either don't block it, they fail to block this type of distressing content, or they keep it up for way too long.
And that's exactly why investors are concerned as well who are expecting more regulatory oversight and possible breakup of these type of Silicon Valley names.
Facebook saw its worst day since December 21. And that's also because of a big executive shakeup. And we had the departure of the head of WhatsApp. His name is Chris Daniels. But, more importantly, the number three executive at Facebook behind Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, we have Chris Cox, head of products -- he oversees Instagram, WhatsApp and News Feed -- leaving the company.
He was floated as a successor possibly to Mark Zuckerberg as CEO in the future. But he's departing, according to reports and insiders, because he doesn't agree with Mark Zuckerberg's push and Facebook's push into private sharing and also merging the three platforms.
That's WhatsApp, Instagram and News Feed and Messenger all together in this end-to-end encryption. Also shows that Zuckerberg is probably taking back more control of the company that he founded.
But if it wasn't for Boeing this week, which is a stock of the week, we would have had a bigger gain for the Dow . The -- actually, Boeing saw gains today, because we're looking at 737 MAX upgrade sooner than expected -- Neil.
CAVUTO: Susan Li, you got a lot in there, young lady.
LI: I try.
(LAUGHTER)
CAVUTO: Thank you very, very much, Susan Li.
She has been busy. So have the markets.
And so will we, tomorrow 10:00 a.m. live, the crosscurrents of all of this, with a host of special guests, 10:00 to 12:00. We will be there.
"The Five" now.
