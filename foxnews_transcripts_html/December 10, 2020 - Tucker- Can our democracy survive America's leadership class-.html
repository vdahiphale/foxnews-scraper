TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. October surprise. You've heard that term. It's political slang fora damaging news story that appears in the final days of a campaign.This year, we had one. One of the biggest October surprises ever. "The NewYork Post" -- that's the oldest daily newspaper in this country --published a trove of documents showing that members of Joe Biden's familyhave been selling access to the former Vice President to a number offoreign governments including the communist government of China. Now that'sa blockbuster.But the rest of the media decided to kill it before you could read it.Social media companies banned their users from sharing "The New YorkPost's" reporting. Other news organizations simply ignored it.On October 22nd, that was 11 days before the presidential election,National Public Radio, an organization that is literally state media,funded against your will by your tax dollars, issued the followingstatement through its public editor. NPR explained that they would not sayanything negative about the Biden's and here's why, quote, "We don't wantto waste our time on stories that are not really stories and we don't wantto waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just puredistractions." End quote.You're probably thinking that is the single dumbest, most dishonest, high-handed infuriatingly, arrogant thing I have ever heard. But if you feelthat way, obviously, you don't watch CNN.On that same day, October 22nd, an R.N.C. spokeswoman called Liz Harringtonmade the mistake of submitting to an interview with Christiane Amanpour.Harrington hoped to talk about the Biden's business deals.Amanpour is, and we're quoting here, "CNN's chief international anchor."Here's how it went.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: As you know perfectlywell, I'm a journalist and a reporter and I follow the facts.LIZ HARRINGTON, R.N.C. SPOKESWOMAN: Yes, we know that.AMANPOUR: And there has never been any issues in terms of corruption. Now,let me ask you this. Yesterday, the F.B.I. --HARRINGTON: Wait, wait. How do you know that?AMANPOUR: I'm talking about reporting, and any evidence. I'm talking to younow to ask you a question about what the F.B.I.'s --HARRINGTON: Okay, I would love that you guys would start doing that diggingand start doing that verification.AMANPOUR: No, we are not going to do your work for you. I want to ask you aquestion. The F.B.I. --HARRINGTON: That's a journalist's job.AMANPOUR: Contrary --HARRINGTON: That's a journalist's job.AMANPOUR: Contrary to what President --HARRINGTON: It's a journalist's job to find out if this is verified.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "As you know perfectly well, I am a journalist and a reporter,"says Christiane Amanpour, who of course, is neither of those things, andnever has been.Christiane Amanpour is a celebrity script reader, a halfwit whose self-esteem far outpaces her accomplishments. She is also it turns out thepersonal flack for the Biden family international finance corporation.That's not in her Twitter bio, but it's pretty obvious.There have never been any issues of corruption with the Bidens, Amanpourannounced, as if she hadn't just been confronted with something. And so itwent just like that across the entire American news media until thepresidential election.Now, six weeks later, it is finally safe to speak freely, and so the truthis coming out.We now know "The New York Post" was right all along and so was poor LizHarrington of the R.N.C. Yesterday, millions of Americans learned, some forthe very first time that the Biden family has indeed been deeply enmeshedin a series of sleazy international business deals that undercut America'score interests.We learned that there's an active Federal criminal investigation into JoeBiden's son, Hunter, for that very reason. What's interesting is how wefound this out.The media didn't tell us, neither did the Justice Department. Hunter Bidenhas far better connections than say Roger Stone. Hunter Biden was allowedto tell his own story. He wasn't rousted from bed at 5:00 a.m. by dozens ofarmed paramilitaries, his arrest in his boxer shorts carried live on CNN.No, no, no. He is a prominent Democrat. So he is spared those humiliations.Instead, the Biden-Harris transition team broke the news in the form of abizarre press release that informed us with a straight face that Joe Bidenwas quote, "Deeply proud of his boy, Hunter," who by the way may have hadsome minor tax trouble that he will clear up soon the minute his accountreturns from Cabo, but no big deal. Happy Holidays.Okay, guys, thanks for the heads up.But actually, and you may have guessed this part, it turns out there'smore. A report in POLITICO today reveals that Joe Biden's younger brother,Jimmy, is involved, too. This was a family business, keep in mind.Jimmy Biden is also under Federal criminal investigation for corruption inthe hospital business. We don't know more than that, and we should stressthat fast Jimmy Biden is presumed innocent until proven otherwise in acourt of law by a jury of his peers.Jimmy is not a felon yet. We will keep you updated.For the few who are able to follow the details of the Biden's businessdeals back in October, who actually read "The New York Post" series orwatched the show, none of this comes as a complete surprise. At the time,we talked to Tony Bobulinski about what he saw.Bobulinski was a business partner of the Biden's as they tried to wheedlemoney from companies connected to Communist China. Tony Bobulinski bycontrast, was a legitimate international businessman. And at some point, hebegan to wonder what the hell is going on.In our interview, Bobulinski described one of his meetings with fast JimmyBiden. Bobulinski wanted to know why the Biden family was so brazen, soopen about peddling Joe's influence to oligarchs and enemies of the UnitedStates. That a risk? Here is how Jimmy Biden responded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER BUSINESS AFFILIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN: And I rememberlooking at Jim Biden and saying, "How are you guys getting away with this?Like, aren't you concerned?" And he certainly looked at me and he laughed alittle bit and said, "Plausible deniability."CARLSON: He said that out loud.BOBULINSKI: Yes, he said it directly to me, one-on-one in a cabana at thePeninsula Hotel.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "Plausible deniability." When your business partner tells you thatyour business strategy rests on plausible deniability, that's notreassuring. And it certainly wasn't reassuring to Tony Bobulinski. Whywould it be?An independent media wouldn't be fooled by plausible deniability either.They demand answers. What exactly were you doing? Let's see the documents.But they didn't.When "The New York Post" published the outlines of this story, the mediaraced to find its own plausible deniability, some reason, any reason not toreport the story.Any reporter who broke rank and decided to state the facts was quicklydisciplined and brought to heel. POLITICO's Jake Sherman, for example,apologized in public for the crime of discussing "The New York Post" storyafter Twitter suspended him for posting it, for posting facts, quote, "Itweeted a link to 'The New York Post' story right after it droppedyesterday morning. I immediately reached out to the Biden Campaign to seeif they had any answer. I wish I had given the story a closer read before Itweeted it."In other words, bless me, CNN for I have sinned.Over at CBS News, a kid called Bo Erickson didn't get the memo on theboundaries of this new journalism. So he tried to get Joe Biden himself torespond to the story and here's how it went.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BO ERICKSON, CBS NEWS REPORTER: Mr. Biden, what is your response to "TheNew York Post" story about your son, sir?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know you're thatgood. I have no response. It's another smear campaign. It's right up youralley. They are the questions you always ask.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, you're a smear merchant, says Joe Biden to a guy he has neverseen before and doesn't recognize. Everyone looks the same to Joe Biden.It's all kind of a blur.But he attacked Bo Erickson of CBS News as a liar and a propagandist, andwhat's so interesting is that none of Bo Erickson's colleagues in the newsmedia came to his defense.In fact, several former flaks for Barack Obama mocked him on social mediaand again, his colleagues stayed silent. Now, we're being told to pretendthat none of this ever happened. It's all down the memory hole.In an article published today in "The Daily Beast," probably the singleworst example of bad journalism on the internet, we learned that, quote,"Evidence of the larger Hunter Biden probe was apparent in the markings ona series of documents that were made public, but went largely unnoticed inthe days leading up to the November election."Largely unnoticed. Oh, of course, a middle of a presidential campaign,front page story about one of the candidates doing business with our mainglobal enemy, but somehow, nobody noticed. Just weird. Unaccountable. Howdid that happen?One group who did notice were the professional liars in our so-called Intelcommunity, the ones that work hand in glove with so-called journalists inour media.Shortly after "The New York Post" story, ran a number of these people, all-star propagandists like Jim Clapper and John Brennan, people who have liedin public under oath and never been punished for it, they denounced "TheNew York Post" series as Soviet style disinformation.The stories they said had, quote, "All the classic earmarks of a Russianinformation operation." They didn't explain what that meant, but theydidn't need to, the media class ate it up.Like the seals they are, they clapped and barked in unison, Russia, Russia,Russia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is receiving and is now regurgitating, repeating anddisseminating disinformation that he knows to be fabricated and supplied bya foreign intelligence service, and despite the warning, he is still doingit.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have said this entire thing is so obviously aRussian plot. It is to me and I was never even an Ambassador to the RussianFederation. Tell me why it's so obviously a Russian plot to you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rudy basically functioning as a Russian asset bypushing Russian disinformation.BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: CNN reported on Friday, theU.S. authorities are seeing if those e-mails we just talked about areconnected to an ongoing Russian disinformation effort.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, it's just obviously a Russian plot. Obviously. Obviously,none of these people should ever appear on television again, though,doubtless they will.Some are saying tonight we need to go farther to find out what actuallyhappened. There are calls tonight for a new special prosecutor toinvestigate what we have learned so far, about the Biden family's businessdealings abroad.Now, let's be honest, as much as we are anxious to find out the truth andwe think it's important, too, a special prosecutor is something that no onein this country should be eager to see, no matter what side you're on.We've seen over the past four years what a special prosecutor can due tothe normal functioning of a government. Open-ended investigations ofpoliticians are hallmarks of corrupt regimes and dictatorships. And mostAmericans are skeptical of those kinds of probes and rightly so.But unless our media start doing its job and telling us what ourpoliticians are up to, the Justice Department and Bill Barr may have nochoice, and if they do move forward with a special prosecutor, they willhave one unlikely supporter: Joe Biden himself.Last year, Joe Biden went on the record confirming that he would notinterfere with any Justice Department investigation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this Presidentdoes. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate whoshould be prosecuted or who should be exonerated.That's not the role of the President of the United States.Follow the law. Let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whetheror not someone should be prosecuted. Period.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: We'll see if he lives up to that. We should note, if the currentPresident was, quote, "Directing the Justice Department for politicalends," he didn't do a very effective job of it.Robert Mueller spent millions of dollars spent years, ruined many lives,purely as a favor to people who could not believe that Donald Trump reallybeat Hillary Clinton. This country might not survive another investigationlike that.On the other hand, you've got to wonder how long a democracy can survive aleadership class like the one we have now.Sean Davis has followed this story from the very first day. He is the co-founder of "The Federalist" and he joins us tonight with the latest. Sean,great to see you.SEAN DAVIS, CO-FOUNDER, "THE FEDERALIST:" Thanks for having me.CARLSON: I'll spare you the congratulations on how you've been vindicatedin your suspicions, some of us have, what do we know now? What has beenconfirmed that was written off just a few weeks ago as Russiandisinformation?DAVIS: Well, I think the most important thing that's been confirmed is thatthe Biden family is being criminally investigated by Federal authoritiesfor a whole host of issues: tax evasion, money laundering, potentiallyfraud, racketeering, back in October, when "The New York Post" and otheroutlets including the one I work for, published that.We were suppressed. We were censored. Big Tech tried to shut us down. And,you know, it's important that we've learned the truth about what's actuallygoing on with Hunter Biden, but we've actually learned a really importantlesson about how irreparably corrupt our media is.For the purposes of stealing the election, they censored news they didn'tlike to favor their preferred candidate, and now they're pretending like itall never happened. Like it's somehow news to them that Hunter Biden isunder Federal investigation.We've known this for weeks. We've known for months because we reported itback in May that James Biden had been accused of fraud and racketeering,that the F.B.I. had raided the offices of a company in which he is aninvestor back in January, and yet the corrupt media for the sole purpose ofgetting their guy elected, suppressed and censored that information formonths.And to me, that's almost as big a crime as whatever Hunter or Jimmy B did.CARLSON: Very little attention has been paid to Jimmy Biden, a formernightclub owner who has been drafting off his brother's success for 50years. They kind of dismissed it as attacks on the former Vice President'sdrug addicted son.But the Jimmy Biden piece of this seems significant as well, to me.DAVIS: It is because it was James Biden who was involved in these samedeals. Tony Bobulinski made clear that when they had their deal with, Ithink it was CEFC in China, he was taking his 10 percent or 20 percent.Now, I don't think James Biden is known as being a super successfulinternational businessman, and certainly nobody will accuse Hunter Biden ofthat. They were selling the Biden family name to the highest bidder. Andthat's one thing when the Vice President, your dad and your brother is outof office, but now, he is the incoming President, and they've made it knownto the entire world that the Biden family is for sale.That is a huge problem, especially after we spent four years being toldthat there was a Russian agent in the White House because Trump made a jokeabout Hillary's e-mails.CARLSON: Sean Davis of "The Federalist" great to see you tonight. Thankyou.DAVIS: Thank you.CARLSON: Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist. He left his formerjob over this story. He resigned in protest because he wasn't allowed toreport on it. He joins us tonight with reaction.Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. You could make the argument that thesecharges aren't a big deal and that we shouldn't care.I mean, people could make, I think, a legitimate argument. You can'tpretend this didn't happen, and yet, it was just last month that you wereattacked personally. A lot of people were attacked even for bringing it up.What's your reaction now that you've been vindicated?GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, I still think we need to recognize whata historic crime and disgrace this is, not only in journalism, but as soonas these documents became known.The operatives in the intelligence community, the C.I.A., John Brennan,James Clapper, Michael Hayden, all the standard professional liars, issueda letter claiming that this material was the hallmark of Russianinformation -- disinformation, actually, even though they had no basis forthinking that and that gave the media permission to lie to the publiccontinuously, and Silicon Valley to censor these materials.So not only did the public not become aware of them, they were lied to, notonly by claiming that Russia was involved, even though there's zeroevidence that they were and no one thinks that, but also by callingdisinformation.The implication was these documents were forgeries when now we know thatthe criminal investigation that's been ongoing, it is about the verytransactions that these documents covered.This is an incredible crime by the corporate media who lie to the publicand bury information before an election, but also again, domesticinterference on the part of intelligence agencies in order to manipulatethe outcome of our election.CARLSON: It was only 10 or 15 years ago that big news organizations like"The New York Times," NBC, and CNN reported on our own intelligenceservices with some level of skepticism because they are powerfulinstitutions and you need to keep them in check. That's our job.Why don't they anymore, do you think?GREENWALD: Well, I think that the intelligence services in the Trump erabecame one of the leading bulwarks against the Trump movement. And so themedia partnered with them based on the premise that the Trump presidencywas dangerous, which is fine if the media really wants to believe that theTrump presidency poses a danger. That's their prerogative.But what they don't have the right to do is to become disinformation agentsand the C.I.A. and all of those guys in the intelligence community wereopen about the fact that they wanted Donald Trump to lose and that theywanted to sabotage his presidency.Remember, Chuck Schumer told Rachel Maddow in early June 2017 that theC.I.A. was going to sabotage Trump's presidency if he continued tocriticize them. And that was the story of the last four years, a unionbetween the intelligence agencies that fed lies to the media thatmindlessly repeated it for their own interests.CARLSON: You tangled years ago with our intelligence agencies. You've beensaying this for a long time. A lot of people didn't believe you. Myapologies for that. You turned out to be right. Glenn Greenwald, great tosee you.GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: We're learning tonight that the Chinese government isn't simplytargeting little known politicians like Eric Swalwell early in theircareers and maybe sleeping with them against their will.They are also targeting countries, little known countries, places likeCanada, our largest trading partner, the nation with which we share thelongest border: Canada.We will tell you the result of our investigation into this after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, here's a story that's hard to believe, but it's real.Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau invited China's People's LiberationArmy to send its troops to Canada for a special cold weather training at abase in Ontario. That training was cancelled after China kidnapped two ofCanada's citizens and held them for years.A top aide to the Prime Minister then complained about the cancellation tothe Department of Defense in Canada, quote, "Canada does not want to be thepartner that is reducing normal bilateral interactions." In other words,it's immoral for us not to train Chinese soldiers, probably to kill us atsome point.Now, that's not the first time Justin Trudeau has sided with the communistgovernment of China. A few years back, he marveled at how the CentralCommittee managed to keep the trains running on time. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: There's a level of admiration Iactually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing themto actually turn the economy around on a dime.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Ezra Levant is the founder of Rebel News in Canada. He broke thisstory. It's an amazing story and he joins us tonight. Ezra, thanks so muchfor coming on.I read this and my first reaction was, this cannot be true. Your PrimeMinister offered to train Chinese troops in Canada. Why would he do that?EZRA LEVANT, FOUNDER, REBEL NEWS-CANADA: It's a shock to Canadians, too,that cold weather warfare that you're referring to was just one of 18different joint projects the Canadian Armed Forces had with the People'sLiberation Army in 2019 alone.Canada is training one and two-star Chinese generals in our war colleges.We are training lieutenants and majors, commanders. We are sendingCanadians over to China. We're bringing Chinese. I think they're not justsoldiers, I think they are spies as well, to Canada, and I don't know asingle person in this country who knew about it but it has been happeningand we found out about it really by accident when the government sent mefreedom of information documents and forgot to black them out. Or maybefrankly, someone inside the government wanted to blow the whistle on thisincredibly upside down relationship.In those same memos you're talking about, Trudeau's office was supportingChina and condemning the Trump administration. It was upside down. It wasinverted morality. It's seeping all the way into our bureaucracy, ourdiplomacy, and they're trying to get the military on side, too.CARLSON: I mean, with respect, we're Americans, so our concern is theUnited States. Canada is our biggest trading partner. We have the closestrelationship with Canada of any country, obviously, in the world. Thisseems like an obvious threat to American national security. Does the Trumpadministration believe that, do you think?LEVANT: Well, in fact, in these memos, you can see that the Trumpadministration warned Canada that this winter warfare training wouldtransfer knowledge to China that could be used. Now, they don't explainwould it be used to take on Uighurs in Xinjiang, Tibetans to fight India inthe Himalayas, or even to fight us?And when the military -- the Canadian military said our American allies, orour allies are concerned about this, Trudeau's staff pushed back and said,is it just the Trump administration? Or is anyone else worried about it?So there's an antipathy towards America that seeps through all these secretdocuments. And the overarching goal is to let China's President Xi Jinpingsave face.I want to tell you, though, Tucker, that is not the view shared bygrassroots Canadians. Ever since China kidnapped those two civilians twoyears ago today, actually, Canadian public opinion has hardened againstChina. And the last Pew poll I saw actually says that Canadians are morehostile to China than Americans are.CARLSON: You have every reason to be. Ezra, thank you so much, andcongratulations on Rebel News. I know you take a lot of abuse up in Canada,but you do a great job. We appreciate it. Thank you.LEVANT: Thank you.CARLSON: Well, the residents of new CHAZ, that's a new country withinPortland, Oregon have a big announcement. They made it tonight. Autonomouszones will never be the same again. We're going to go to our CHAZcorrespondent after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, we've got another new country tonight growing like a fattytumor within the body of the City of Portland, Oregon, an autonomous zone.It made a big announcement today. The people of this autonomous zone aresovereign citizens, they say, they're not going anywhere.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Tense small fires and messages written inthe street inside the blockade. Demonstrators inside are holding theirground for a second night in North Portland.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): All of this over a home that was foreclosedon, those living here evicted and not wanting to leave. According to courtdocuments, they were given notice of eviction in November of 2018 and askedto appear in court the following day. They remained at the property andseveral people have joined in an occupation in protest of the eviction.This week, it grew when deputies moved in to serve an eviction notice.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): But they were unsuccessful whendemonstrators there pushed police out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): The group has weapons, stockpiles andfirearms.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got to stop this gentrification and we are goingto reclaim the land.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, they've got weapons and borders. Not a big deal. Just anothernew country, sprouting up like a psilocybin mushroom.Jason Rantz is a radio show host in Seattle. He's our CHAZ correspondent.He joins us for an update on this new independent nation. Hey, Jason.JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Hello, Portland's best and brightestconverge. This is night number three on the Red House Autonomous Zoneselflessly sort of putting on hold their careers as amateur Instagrammodels and tattoo test dummies, getting arrested for people who apparentlydon't actually think they have to follow the law. And I don't mean thatliterally in the sense of the autonomous zone.Last week, you and I had the conversation about Sovereign Citizens. Theseare a fringe group of folks who believe that somehow they have divine rightto the land and they don't actually have to follow any of the laws of theU.S. government.Well, it turns out the Kinney family has a history that would indicate theymight subscribe to the exact same position. So they're in this positionwith the home being foreclosed because of William Kinney, when he was 17years old, the son, he got into some legal trouble. He got into a caraccident that ended up killing someone. He was hit with manslaughtercharges.And in all of the court documents since then, they seem to be claiming theyare Sovereign Citizens, and they don't actually have to follow any of thelaws.CARLSON: No one is trying to foist a mandatory gun buyback on thissovereign nation, I noticed, which tells you a lot. Jason Rantz, great tosee you.RANTZ: Chelsea Handler though is involved now, so let's be clear, thingscould change now.CARLSON: That's true. It's a dynamic country. Good to see you.RANTZ: Good to see you.CARLSON: Well, Democrats in Congress, well, not forming a new country didmake their own big announcement today. "Love is love," Nancy Pelosideclared, if you're in love with the Chinese spy, who are we to judge?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): But I don't have any concern about Mr. Swalwell.There are those in the Congress who believe, and I am among them that weshould be seeing what influenced the Chinese. I've been fighting them asyou know, for over 30 years.I think we should make sure that everybody knows what they are beingsubjected to. But I don't know that it means that we have to backgroundcheck every intern who comes into the Capitol.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, you can't do a background check on every Chinese spy you havesex with. If you did a full background on every one of your Chinese spymistresses, you wouldn't have time to subvert the Constitution. It's just aridiculous idea.But if you so much as look -- and these are the standards -- at a Russian,well, Nancy Pelosi's brain will start skipping like a record player.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: What do the Russians have on Donald Trump? Politically, personallyor financially?What is Putin blackmailing President Trump with? Personally politically orfinancially?So again, I ask the question, what do the Russians have on Donald Trumppolitically, personally, or financially?(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: We don't know what the Chinese government has on Congressman EricSwalwell politically, personally, or financially. He tells us it'sclassified. It's very weird.Claudia Tenney is a former Member of Congress. She worked with EricSwalwell there. She is running again in upstate New York. We're happy tohave her on tonight.Claudia Tenney, thanks so much for coming on. So it is nothing personal ...CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE OF NEW YORK: Thank you.CARLSON: ... but do you think that people who have sexual relationshipswith Chinese spies should retain their seats on the House Intel Committee?TENNEY: Well, not in the case of Eric Swalwell. Obviously, this is beyond apersonal mistake. You could say Katie Hill, famously resigned for apersonal reason, but not a national security threat, certainly not engagingin a thropple with or any other kind of relationship with Chinese spies orDianne Feinstein's driver who is a Chinese spy for over 20 years.So, you know, this situation without Eric Swalwell, I think isunforgivable. I think he should be removed from the Intelligence Committeeimmediately. I don't see how we can possibly justify keeping him on thereand Nancy Pelosi persists.CARLSON: It seems like a very clear call to me, and we just needed someonefrom the outside who had served on the inside for a little perspective ofit. Thank you for that.I have to ask you about your congressional race in New York. It's stillundecided more than a month after the election, how would you characterizethe state of play as of right now?TENNEY: Well, right now, we're -- the judge has ruled that we have to goback and to recount some of the disputed ballots and we're also going tocount ballots that were not put into the canvas because they were removedby the Boards of Election.This is probably going to favor us, I would say, but at the same time, it'snow what -- we're going into the sixth week and this should have been donea long time ago, and we should have looked at these, but these are mistakesby the Boards of Election, who by the way, have been overwhelmed,understaffed, under resourced to be able to take on 10 times more absenteeballots because we have an unsolicited online database where anyone, athird party, you know, all the Republican and the Democrat, and every otherparty has access to all these voters, and they can order these without therequest of a voter.So, you know, people want to say, well, that's not really happening, butwe've had numerous people come to us, call us, contest and say, geez, anabsentee ballot suddenly appeared in my mail, and I didn't order it and weare now trying to figure out how did that mysteriously appear in theirmail.And a lot of these people are regular voters. One gentleman who I don'teven know contacted me on Facebook and said, I voted myself in person myentire life and all of a sudden a ballot appeared. And so I think that thisis just not necessarily widespread, but we've certainly heard dozens ofcases.CARLSON: Boy, I cannot get over how restrained you are in the way youdescribe this race. It's admirable, I guess, but if anybody has cause tosay I got shafted. It seems like it's you, so we're definitely rooting foryou and hope the truth will come out.TENNEY: Yes, well yes, certainly we don't like to hear about ballots beingdiscovered in drawers months -- a month after Election Day and not knowingwhere they're going.I'm hoping that we prevail on this. I think the judge is going to, youknow, make a decision on our objections. Certainly, it seems that these arecoming up late.CARLSON: Yes, it ought to be the word. Claudia Tenney, good luck. Thankyou.TENNEY: Thank you.CARLSON: So here's a question you may not have considered, of all thecountries on the planet, which country is the least racist? Well, our nextguest looked at the data, approaches it as a question of social science andcame up with a definitive answer and beware, if you're a highly paiddiversity consultant, you might want to leave the room because she justundermined your reason for getting paid. That's straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, if you know anything about this show, it's said that we arebig fans, apostles really have the book, the tome, "White Fragility" and ofits deeply accomplished author, Ms. Robin DiAngelo.For example, when Robin DiAngelo told "The New York Times" in July thatcapitalism is quote, "dependent on inequality," we couldn't get enough ofit. And when she wrote in her book, quote, "Whiteness has psychologicaladvantages that translate into material returns." We thought, well, itsounds a little racist, but it's so well written.We took three steps back and asked ourselves, wait, why is this creepy oldwhite lady pretending to be the savior of African-Americans? We didn't knowthe answer, but we gave her a pass.Tonight, though, it's time to have one of those difficult conversationsthat Robin DiAngelo was always calling for, and here's why.Documents obtained by "The Washington Free Beacon" on Campus Reform showedthat this very same Robin DiAngelo made $12,750.00 to headline a diversityevent in October at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.Here's the thing, another speaker at the very same event, an actual blackperson called Austin Channing Brown, made just $7,500.00 for the very samejob. Ooh, systemic racism, anyone?Of course, and prepare yourself for a hot glass of irony here, the title ofthe event was, quote, "Exposing Racism and Inequities." It's so good. It'sgot to be a big misunderstanding. And if Robin DiAngelo wants to explainit, of course, she is welcome on this show, anytime.Again to use language she can understand, it is time for a difficultconversation. We're looking forward to it. We just hope for "WhiteFragility," it doesn't prevent her from accepting.Now the same people who tell us endlessly that the United States is racistare the same ones encouraging people from non-white countries to come hereas soon as possible. That's kind of weird. Why is that? Well, here's ourpossible future Ambassador to China, for example. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Do you think that people who support President Trump and hisimmigration policies are racist?PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), FORMER MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA: Anyone whosupports this is supporting racism.Our healthcare system is burdened by racism.We know that our housing is burdened by racism.Our schools are burdened by racism.Yes, the uniform is burdened by racism. But it goes far beyond that.It is a matter of concern for every American that we dismantle systemicracism before it ends the American project in our lifetime.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, so there's the former McKinsey consultant lecturing us abouthow our country which he has done nothing but degrade is a terrible placeand we are the reason it is, but it does raise the academic question. Howracist is America exactly? Can it be measured?Well, Kathleen Brush thought it could be measured. She tried to measure it.She's the author of "Racism and Anti-Racism in the World before and after1945." She joins us with the results of her study on this question.Kathleen Brush, thanks for coming on. So how racist is the United States?KATHLEEN BRUSH, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.CARLSON: Of course.BRUSH: America is one of the leading anti-racist nations. And you're right,it is the reason I wrote my book is because of people like Pete Buttigieg.I have been studying racism around the world for more than a decade,including visiting 114 nations. I know what systemic racism looks like. Itis opposite to the United States.Now, the year 1945 is actually pivotal to understanding discrimination.Because before it, people didn't see discrimination, they saw orderedsocieties.Well, in 1945, FDR parlayed American victory in World War II to get globalpowers to agree to end the colonial subjugation of Africans, Asians andEuropeans, and to get all nations to agree to abolish discrimination or toend discrimination.Well, come the early 1970s, America becomes the first nation to have ananti-racist system of government. Meanwhile, the rest of the nations, theydidn't honor their commitments, they just continued right on discriminatingas they had before.And so this is the reason in the 21st Century, you can see selectpopulations that still experience slavery, arbitrary detention,statelessness or just garden variety privileged and non-privileged people.Now, there's lots of examples in my book. But what I'd like to do is I'dlike to cement America's anti-racist bona fides because they are so strong.African-Americans are the most prosperous, educated black population in theworld.America's Latino GDP is the highest GDP of any Latin American nation. Andthat includes Brazil with three and a half times the population. Asian-Americans are the most educated and prosperous racial group in America.Their incomes are 25 percent higher than whites on average. For Indian-Americans, household income is 60 percent higher.Now there is no indigenous population that has been cordoned to ensure faircompensation for their land, in addition to receiving wealth transfers,protected freedoms and other concessions than Native Americans.The year 1964, the year of our Civil Rights Act of 1964, America'spopulation was 87 percent white. Today it is 60 percent non-Hispanic white.For one comparison point, let's look at Liberia which has a population thatis 100 percent black, because you can only be a citizen of Liberia if youare black.Now there was a global survey that answered the question: how many peopledo not want somebody of another race? Sorry. How many people of anotherrace do not want -- how many people do not want a person of another race astheir neighbor? The answer was in the United States, zero to five percent.In Iran and Nigeria, it was 30 to 40 percent. In France it was 20 to 30percent.CARLSON: Let me just summarize it, and you're dealing with facts and factsimmediately cause the systemic racism lie to evaporate into steam, and Ihope that our readers will arm themselves with the facts in your book,because again, they're true.Kathleen Brush, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you.Well, Democrats have finally admitted that one of their party's leaders andthis is sad, but is senile. It's not who you think it is. We'll tell youwho it is after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: "New Yorker" Magazine is out today with an article that claimsDianne Feinstein, that's the senior senator from California is senile. Noword yet on what the "New Yorker" thinks of Joe Biden.Marc Siegel is a FOX News medical contributor here to assess that claim.Doctor, thanks for coming on. A lot of older people in politics, DianneFeinstein is very old. Do you think it's fair to say she's senile?DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, she is 87, Tucker, andthis was a devastating piece in the "New Yorker." How old is it to be to bea pilot? To be a surgeon, right? To be a U.S. Senator? To be a President?How old?Well, Strom Thurmond went to the age of 100, didn't he, but he wasn't doingtoo well towards the end of 2003.Dianne Feinstein, there's a lot of things in this article deeplydisturbing. You know, when she was grilling Jack Dorsey at a JudicialCommittee meeting recently, she attacked him on this tweet, PresidentTrump's tweet, and she asked him about it. She heard his answer, thenrepeated it exactly the same over again, as though she didn't remember thatshe had even asked it.And she's had multiple conversations, according to this article with ChuckSchumer -- Senator Schumer, who's been telling her you're not reallywinning anymore, and apparently, she doesn't remember the conversations andhe has to come back and ask her all over again.Now, I'm not her doctor, and I liked her kindness at the judicial hearings,but they also sent an aide there to keep an eye on her.You know, the problem is that over the age of 85, the risk of dementia orcognitive impairment is about 40 percent, and over the age of 75, it'sabout 20 percent. Speaking of someone who is 78, Joe Biden this week,Tucker, this week, he announced his new choice for H.H.S. Secretary, right,except he called him Health and Education Secretary, Xavier Becerra, Healthand Education Secretary?Tucker, do you remember, of course, you'll remember that in 1979, theychanged Health and Education and Welfare over to Health and Human Servicesto spin out another Department of Education.So I'm wondering, did Joe Biden in that moment forget? I mean, he has ahistory of two aneurysms repaired, atrial fibrillation that can lead tosome cognitive decline. Are these just gaffes? Health and Education?I don't know Tucker, but you know, something. I think it bears thinkingabout an investigating. There's plenty of people over the age of 85, overthe age of 75 that are completely with it. But when you start to see signslike this, you have to pay attention whether it's a pilot or a senator oryou know what I mean, Tucker.CARLSON: I think that's right. I think for Biden, it's always 1979, hewants to get those hostages back from Iran. Dr. Siegel, thank you.Sean Hannity, next.
