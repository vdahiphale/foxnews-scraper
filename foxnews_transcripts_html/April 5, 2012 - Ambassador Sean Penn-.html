My Boys
Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has offered a solution to the diplomatic stand-off between his country and the U.S. that began when he rejected President Obama's choice to be ambassador to Caracas -- quote -- "I hope they name Oliver Stone.... I'll suggest a candidate Sean Penn or (linguist and philosopher Noam) Chomsky. We have a lot of friends there. Bill Clinton!" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Chavez also recounted his brief interaction with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Brazil's inauguration last weekend -- quote -- "I said to Senora Clinton 'How is your husband?' But I made a mistake because I speak very bad English and I said, 'How is your wife?' She laughed then I said husband." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Recruit 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And authorities in Saudi Arabia have detained what they say is a spy from Israel's Mossad agency -- a vulture tagged with the words "Tel Aviv University."
A front-page story in the Jerusalem Post references a Saudi newspaper report that the vulture was found in a rural area of the country wearing a leg bracelet and transmitter. The paper said the incident appeared to be a Zionist plot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You may remember it was just last month that an Egyptian governor suggested recent shark attacks in the Red Sea were also the work of Israel's spy agency.  </pre>
