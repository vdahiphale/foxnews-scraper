(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Our team is, of course, oureconomic team, including Secretary Yellen and others, are monitoring thesituation.It's a good reminder, though, that the stock market isn't the only measureof the health of our economic -- of our economy. It doesn't reflect howworking and middle-class families are doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, no fun and games at the corner ofWall and Broad, as a lot of people look at a big falloff today that puts usback in negative territory that have some wondering whether, ironically,some gaming stocks and some other lesser known names can all of a suddengain tens of billions of dollars in market value.I will tell you what's behind this. There are those big institutions andhedge funds that love to short stocks, in other words, to bet on theirprice collapsing. Now, normally, they have their run of the world.This go-round, though, there's been a change. There are numbers socialmedia investment sites that have popped up to challenge the guys who areshorting the stocks. And it's a battle royal, because some of the biggesthedge funds in the world are taking it on the chin.There was talk, suspicion that maybe some of them needed rescuing becauseit was getting that bad. But if you're an owner of the game stock, or ifyou're an owner of an AMC, or BlackBerry, or Express, or all these othernames that have benefited from this battle against those betting on theirprices going down, it was heaven for you, the frenzied buying the likes ofwhich we have never seen in these size issues that all of a sudden weredwarfing trading volume normally awarded to the Amazons or the Apples.Some of these guys at some points trading at 10 times the volume, in otherwords, people buying, selling, getting in and out, 10 times what they do ina name like Amazon. It's remarkable. And so far, it's already got theattention of Elizabeth Warren, who says, we need to look into this.First, what are we looking at?Kristina Partsinevelos on the surge in some names that used to get norespect -- Kristina, what's happening?KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, it is arebellion of sorts.You have got the little retail investors vs. those hedge funds that youmentioned who bet on stocks falling. And you have GameStop that is caughtright in the middle.GameStop share price has been declining since 2015. Kind of makes sense,because a lot of people are buying their video games online, instead ofgoing into the stores. Hedge funds saw this trend and said, hey, let's betthat the stock will fall even further. So, they short-sold GameStop.Then you had a bunch of retail investors that joined forces on an onlineforum on Reddit and noticed what the hedge fund guys are doing and said,hey, let's buy GameStop shares, pushing the price up. And that means all ofthose hedge fund guys that bet it would fall, lost billions of dollars.And that's exactly what happened. Just this month alone, you saw GameStop,the share price climbed well over 1200 percent. The market cap right now iswell above $23 billion. And two major hedge funds that did bet it wouldfall -- that would be Citron, as well as Melvin Capital -- both announcedthat they're closing their positions on GameStop.And now you have these retail investors that have gained so much confidenceright now in the online forums too that they're now going after some othercompanies that have been hard-hit by short sellers, like AMC Entertainmentand like retailer Express.AMC today, we saw that stock price climb 280 percent, and Express almost200 percent, definitely a strong ride, a lot of momentum for these stocks.But a lot of Wall Street veterans do argue these retail investors are new,inexperienced, and lack diversification.So, when those stock prices fall, they will lose big time. But, so far, ifyou look at those bank accounts of the smaller retail investors, they seemto be doing well -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Yes, very well. That's a good overview of that, Kristina.Thank you so much, Kristina Partsinevelos of FOX Business Network fame,which, if you don't get, you really got to demand, especially on a day likethis. Man, it was crazy.Now, to put this in perspective, you might be asking, after Kristina'sreport, all right, those stocks are going off to the races and just doingfine. So, why would the general market tumble in response?Well, the fear is that some of the big boys and the hedge funds and thelarge institutions that make a living buying and selling stock in the hopeof really tanking some of these issues or shorting them, getting theirmoney back on the profit difference, well, that they're going to need somehelp.We're already told that Citron and some of these others are on the hook forbillions of dollars in losses. And, already, we're getting signs that someinvestors are coming to their rescue. The fear is, though, that it couldfeed on itself and the big guys get stung, while little folks are buyinginto GameStop and AMC, BlackBerry, and all these others.So, good for them. But now here's the other fear, and I'm going to get intomy panelists, that, eventually, there comes a time when people want to taketheir profits and leave.Now, the experience of the late 1990s, the Internet bull market boom, wasthat they all were going to the door at the same time, and the door wasonly so big. So, that many people were pushing through, and not everyonegot through. That was then. Could it be happening right now?Let's get the read from Charlie Gasparino, Danielle DiMartino Booth  hereas well, Michele Schneider as well.Michele, following these type of markets, as you have, I'm just curiouswhether we do have something to worry about. Normally, when you hear bighedge funds and the rest could be in some trouble because of this, Iautomatically think, uh-oh, is this like a big bank in trouble deal?What do you think?MICHELE SCHNEIDER, MARKETGAUGE GROUP:  Well, I think the only time that Ican say that really reckons to this one is not just dot-com bubble that youmentioned, but also what happened in the commodities exchange back in itsheyday.From 1971 -- excuse me -- from 1979 to 1982, you had silver, which seemslike a joke now, go from $5 to $50. But at the time, that was a huge move,relative to just the percentage of performance.And, eventually, the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market there too.And it took years for the COMEX governance boards, and for the CFTC to tryto figure out how to control it. And they eventually did.So, we could be looking at a situation like that now. Of course,everything, in terms of time frame, is so much faster than it used to bethen. But at this point, I think they're...CAVUTO:  Yes, by far.SCHNEIDER:  Yes, right.And so they're scrambling to try to figure out. The SEC can look at short-selling. But there's really no rules being broken at this point, other thanthe fact that the kids are enraged because they feel like, for years, themarket was manipulated, and now it's their turn.CAVUTO:  Yes, and then they're trying it.Charlie Gasparino, the issue here is that it's a sign of frothiness. And alot of people have been talking to me today:  Well, that's certainly a signof the cap.Now, you could look at that from a variety of ways. If those betting onstocks collapsing are wrong, and they're paying for it, that's one thing.There's generally this feeling that it has that late '90s feel to it,because these are just rapid moves, multibillion-dollar exchanges of sharesthat change the entire equation.What do you think?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Right.And the stocks that are trading, I mean, GameStop is not worth $300 ashare. I mean, I think that's a reasonable thing. BlackBerry -- when wasthe last time you used your BlackBerry? Is that worth the run-up it had?And, by the way, this is -- all these -- as we have been reporting, firston FOX Business -- we were way ahead of the curve -- all these stocks havebeen -- this -- this is known as a bull raid. It's been going on for weeksnow. People are just now freaking out. But we have been talking about thisfor a while.A couple points to make. There's a more contemporary example of issuesinvolving stuff like this, other than the Hunt brothers. And that's Long-Term Capital Management, when that hedge fund blew up.CAVUTO:  Right.GASPARINO:  Now, what was problematic about that, what made it systemic,was that all of Wall Street and other hedge funds copied LTCM's trades,right, their bad -- their trades that were going down.So there was a systemic risk that the financial system could collapse. I'mnot saying it's going to happen here. But there is this issue. And that'swhy the markets are off of a systemic risk that other hedge funds couldcollapse, and they need bailouts or whatever.That's why the markets are up there, is that fear.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Yes. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. That is a risk.But it was raised by Elizabeth Warren, who wants to look into this. She'sconcerned about it.GASPARINO:  Oh, they're going to look into it.CAVUTO:  And, Danielle, when I hear that sort of thing, I mean, I begin towonder then, where does this go?Because the fear is that the little guy, the little investor is going toget stuck holding these gains, hang onto them, try to sell normally, andnot be able to, and then it's kablooey. And then you have that concern,coupled with these big institutions that are apparently losing a lot ofDough, and a lot of them tied to these very hedge funds that are taking iton the chin.Are you worried?DANIELLE DIMARTINO BOOTH, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE ADVISER:  Neil, if you'reasking me the question, I will say that there is definitely cause forconcern.The very first question that Federal Reserve chairman, Jay Powell, wasasked at the press conference at 2:30 Eastern was, what was his view onGameStop and what was happening? A subsequent reporter asked him thequestion, are you considering raising margin requirements?Neil, right now, we have margin debt at a record high, higher than it waswhen Alan Greenspan said irrational exuberance and stocks ended up bubblinginto 2000. And we also have hedge funds with net leverage that is also at arecord.So, to Charlie's point, the potential for systemic risk, the potential forthere to be interconnectivity between one investor to another, thatspillover risk is definitely apparent in the markets today.GASPARINO:  And isn't it ironic, Neil...CAVUTO:  We should just explain...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  ... those who use the leverage, leverage the money they have madeon their stocks to buy still more stock. When it's going your way, you'rein clover. When it's not, you're screwed.GASPARINO:  Yes.CAVUTO:  But, Charlie, are you worried about that?GASPARINO:  Yes, well, isn't it ironic that Powell is opining on this whenhe's one of the reasons why this is going on?I mean, it's -- listen, you can blame Robinhood, low-cost trading or zerocommission trading. You can blame people being locked in their apartmentsbecause of the lockdowns, and they have nothing to do but speculate inmarkets.But the reason why there's so much froth in the market, why it's so easy,why finance -- why leverage is so high, why margin debt is so -- is upthere so much is because we have zero  percent interest rates.When you have zero percent interest rates, people do risky things to make abuck, because they have to go out on the risk spectrum. And it's...CAVUTO:  So, are you saying, Charlie, we're going to see more of this, thismore risky stuff, more risky behavior?GASPARINO:  If -- by the way, the only way you change this is to change therisk dynamic.And the only way you do that is to raise interest rates, which he said he'snot doing.CAVUTO:  All right.So, Michele Schneider, let me ask you this. A lot of people are hearingthis and saying, I want in, because I'm looking at what's happening to AMC,and it's tripling and quadrupling, and BlackBerry, which I thought was deadand gone, is doubling and tripling. I want in. I want in.What do you tell them?SCHNEIDER:  Well, first of all, the fact is that it is transparent, whatthey're looking at. If you look at the Reddit site, it's right there.So, the fact that people want in, I think, is part of what the free marketis all about. And so I would say, to have some set of rules, we look atusing certain types of ranges. Like, we like to see where the market opens,give it about five minutes, let the dust settle. And if it breaks out fromthere, we might get in at that point.So, it doesn't matter exactly what rule you decide to use, but you shouldhave some kind of a risk adjustment, and some kind of place to take profitsalong the way.CAVUTO:  All right.SCHNEIDER:  And then decide, are you doing it as a day trade to join thefun, get out and go home? Or do you want to keep it overnight? Or do youjust want to keep rotating into the next thing and the next thing as thesenames keep popping up?CAVUTO:  All right, very good. Guys, thank you very, very much.There is such a thing as taking your profits or getting greedy and waitingto get still more. It's this delicate balancing act. And history showsthat, oftentimes, investors poorly execute that. So, we will be followingthis.We're also getting some musings from Ken Langone, who started Home Depot,knows a thing or two about, when you start a company, those who like topound the company and short the company. He lived through that.What he fears is repeating itself right now -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, not a good day for market averages that routinely wehave seen advancing into record territory day in day out.But for the 2.1 percent falloff in the Dow, the Nasdaq today a big hit, 355points. That amounts to that 2.5-plus percent, S&P also down, a lot of thison these concerns right now growing around all this frothiness with smallconcerns that suddenly have the value of General Motors and Apple. And, toa lot of people, it doesn't make sense.Ken Langone is among them, the Home Depot co-founder, who said, this is abubble, and it's a bubble right now bursting. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KEN LANGONE, CO-FOUNDER, HOME DEPOT:  What I think is going on right nowcould very well the beginning of bursting of the bubble.I mean, with all due respect, I look at what Tesla's market cap is, theguy's done a hell of a job, got a great -- everybody I know that owns aTesla loves it, great car. But let's face it. Audi and Mercedes and GM andFord are not going to just roll up and go away. They're going to be back.And to make an electric car is a lot cheaper than it is to make thecombustion engine car, because the transmissions and all the other thingsyou have to do. What I'm saying is, Neil, this could be the beginning ofsome sort of a sobering effect on the market in general.I mean, look, now you have got...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Do you think this is a rich market, then, Ken? Do you think it's a-- overall, that this is a rich market at these levels?LANGONE:  Oh, sure, of course. Of course it's a rich -- it's a very richmarket.And what all I'm saying is, if you have got great companies with greatbalance sheets, with good income statements, their stock will go down.What do they say one of the old-fashioned sayings was? When they raid --when they raid a house of ill repute, they also take the piano player?That's still valid.(LAUGHTER)LANGONE:  OK?I mean, what I'm saying, Neil, is, if you have got great companies, mycompanies, Lilly, Parker Hannifin, Home Depot, Choice -- no -- I'm sorry --Option Care. I'm giving you the names of the style -- Yum! Brands.These are great companies with great balance sheets, great management andsolid businesses. They're going to be fine. My net worth might be not fine.My net worth might be a lot lower after the bubble bursts.But that doesn't take away from the intrinsic value of these greatcompanies. What you have to worry about is when you're discounting thehereafter. And that's what's going on with a lot of these tech stocks, bigtime, big time.When somebody told me the other day the market cap of Tesla is more thanall the five major manufacturers of automobiles, Ford, General Motors,Mercedes, Volkswagen -- I forgot what the fifth one was.Now...CAVUTO:  Right.LANGONE:  ... what's the magic of making a car? The magic, I guess, is thebattery technology.But that isn't far away from -- hell, all of these people, they're allgoing to have electric cars, all of them. That's going to get down toprice.And, by the way, Elon Musk is a genius. What he's done, I think, is -- I'mnot taking anything away from the man. He's spectacular. But what I'msaying is, there's going to be a catchup here. Going to be a catchup.And when it happens, supply and demand will reign again.CAVUTO:  After the protests and the -- got violent in Washington in thelast couple of weeks of the Trump administration.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  You had said at the time that you felt betrayed by Donald Trump...LANGONE:  I do.CAVUTO:  ... and that you vowed to support Biden. You said as well thatthere should be no mitigation at all, that: "The storming of the Capitolwhich resulted in the death of five people was shockingly horrible andwrong."You said you would do everything you could to help make Joe Biden asuccessful president.Do you still feel that way?LANGONE:  You bet, because you know what? If he has a successfulpresidency, that means things are good?Herbert Hoover did not have a successful presidency, did he? I don't thinkhe did. Roosevelt did. Truman did. Reagan certainly did. Hell, when the --when a president has a successful term, it means the country's doing good.That's what I'm talking about.We all -- look, it's in my interest for this man to be the best presidentwe ever had, because...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Do you think they should impeach Donald Trump? Do you think theyshould impeach Donald Trump right now? They want to prevent him fromrunning from office again.(CROSSTALK)LANGONE:  One point. I have no opinion it, because it's meaningless. It'smeaningless. Leave the guy alone. Let him go.What I am saying is, I thought, after he went through the whole courtprocedure, he was in every court. Or -- I said -- not every, but he was ina lot of courts, and every court said the same thing. Where's the proof?Give us the facts. Didn't have them.I'm pleased he did that, because he held the electoral system accountable.But the courts said -- and, by the way, many of these judges with judges heappointed. The courts said, give us the facts. You haven't got the facts,no case. Goodbye.It was over. He should have gone -- after the last case that he lost, heshould have gone on television and said:  I still think that there's votingirregularities. I hope to God that, in the future, we will work out ways.Don't forget, one of the problems this year was, because of the pandemic, alot of people didn't vote in person. So, it was a unique situation.But what I'm saying is, where I felt betrayed, look, nobody likes to lose,but if you're going to lose, be gracious. And I felt, as president of theUnited States, he should be held to a higher standard. And whatever he saidor didn't say that got these people to Washington, the fact of the matteris, it was under his watch. He was still president of the United States.And it was ugly. And five people lost their lives.CAVUTO:  Seven out of 10 Republicans, Ken -- seven out of 10 Republicans,Ken, are still open to the idea of Donald Trump running again for thepresidency.Are you?LANGONE:  Four years in politics is a lifetime, OK? A lifetime.I know this, that with the redistricting that's going to go on as a resultof the 2020 census, think about this. The people are moving out of bluestates. They're moving out of California. They're moving out of Illinois.They're moving out of New York.Where are they going? They're going to Florida. They're going to Arizona.They're going to Texas, or other -- they're going to North Carolina. Now,if they are going to bring the problems that they are running away from tothe states they are going to, then I pity those people, because what thehell are they doing? It's irrational behavior.It seems to me, if they are going to leave where they are because of what'sgoing on, they're going to say, well, if I go here, I'm sure not going towant this to happen here.This notion that Texas is moving blue, I don't believe it. I don't believeit at all, because I happen to think...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  So, again -- again, I will ask you.Donald Trump, if he wants to run for president again -- and a good manyRepublicans support that notion. Do you?LANGONE:  Do I support it?CAVUTO:  Yes.LANGONE:  You're asking?Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I think Donald Trump did a -- by the way,he did a lot of great things. That's the tragedy of what happened here. He-- I think he did -- I think, dealing with China, he did the right thing.Look, we gave China, a mulligan 45 years ago, when we said we have got tohelp them get on their feet, a prosperous China is safer for America thanwith China with its back to the wall. So, we made a lot of concessions tohelp them along, as we did with the Europeans after we beat them in WorldWar II, the Germans, the Pole -- everybody else that was our enemy overthere, the Italians.We helped them get on their feet. That's the genius and that's the heart ofAmerica. We did those things. We did it with China. OK, China is now thesecond largest economy in the world. They don't need handouts. And this iswhat Trump -- what -- that's one thing.I think what he did in the Middle East with all these deals with Israel iswonderful. It's wonderful. I think saying to the NATO countries, hey, guys,we all signed a piece of paper, and we all said we're going to spend 2percent of our GDP. We're paying ours. Where's yours?That's a transaction. That's fair. He did a lot of good things.And, by the way, I don't think we should apologize for saying Americafirst. What do we go to war for? To protect our values and protect ourdemocracy. That's why we went to war in World War I and World -- especiallyin World War II. We had to be lured into World War II.And we did for one reason, because Roosevelt knew that our way of life, ourdemocracy, our values were -- were in peril.Look, four years is a forever. There's something, Neil. In 2016, DonaldTrump didn't win. Hillary Clinton lost. In 2020, Joe Biden didn't win.Donald Trump lost.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO:  It's a very good point, Ken Langone musing about what's happeningin the markets right now, and what's happening in Washington right now.He's optimistic longer-term we get through both.In the meantime, earnings are coming out from some of the companies hementioned, including Tesla, which didn't sell quite as many cars as maybethe markets had thought, missed its numbers a little bit. And the stock isselling about 4 percent in after-hours.Facebook just the opposite situation, much-better-than-expected numbers,but there's a bit of a pause in the buying here about concern that maybethere could be momentum issues. We're on that and a lot more -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, here's the good news on COVID vaccines. Up to 200million more could be on the way. Here's the bad news. You're going to haveto wait a while.We're on top of that -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY):  Climate change represents an existentialthreat to our country and our planet. Every tool in the toolbox should bebrought to bear.In my view, President Biden should consider the declaration of a nationalemergency on climate change.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, every tool in the toolbox.My next guest worries about that, because he says we don't have many tools,certainly when it comes to money, running up record deficits and debt, thatlimit how much we can do with President Biden's series of executive ordersto deal with climate change and to move the world to a cleaner world, atthat.Kevin Brady of Texas with us right now, the House Ways and Means Committeeranking member.Always good to see you, Congressman.What do you make of this -- of this front? Because it comes at the sametime the president canceled the Keystone pipeline and is already sendingthe signal no more new oil and related drilling on federal lands. ForTexas, a big energy state, you have got to be a tad concerned.REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX):  Yes, I think the first two days of the Bidenadministration, two attacks on our oil and gas workers, cancellation of theKeystone pipeline obviously devastating for a lot of blue-collar workers.Certainly makes us less energy-independent, less secure, makes no sense.And, of course, the suspension on the leasing on oil, federal lands andwaters, if that's made permanent, in Texas, we lose about 120,000 jobs,nationwide, about a million jobs just over the next couple years. Again,doesn't make us more energy-secure, so big -- big mistakes.I think addressing Senator Schumer, look, we have two priorities in Americaright now, defeating COVID and rebuilding this economy. That means a focuson mainstream businesses and the jobless.And in this COVID package, I don't see much help at all for the economy.And I think, Neil, the biggest outstanding question that I think we allneed to hear from the president and Treasury Secretary Yellen is, how manyjobs will this create?We're spending $1.9 trillion. How many jobs will this create for ourcountry? And I ask that because I look just at their proposal for fundingstate and local governments. They're proposing, if they rehire everyone,same old government that lost their job over the last year, they will bespending a million dollars per job. That seems very excessive.And it raises the question, so how many jobs are we looking at in thispackage? It's a fair question.CAVUTO:  What they have been arguing, as you know, Congressman, is that thejobs you gain in new energy will offset the jobs lost in traditional fossilfuels.Now, you have been a champion for quite some time to go all in on all typesof energy. If you like what we have, and we have plenty of it in thiscountry, pursue oil and all that, fracking, but if you like these othertechnologies, go knee-deep into them as well.But you were saying, I think, at one time we talked about this, don't pickand choose, endorse them all. But now what?BRADY:  Yes. Yes, it really is key.So, yes, so, my first job as Ways and Means chairman for Speaker Ryan wasto negotiate an end to the ban, 40-year ban on exporting crude oil allaround the United States, in return for a future for oil -- for solar andwind and renewables. We reached that agreement under an Obamaadministration, but, right now, obviously, a lot of reneging on thatbipartisan approach.And I still think, at the end of the day, that, for us to tackle greenhousegas emissions, that the answer is not higher costs on energy and killingoff oil and gas jobs in businesses. It is technology. We have the abilityto create affordable fuel. And we are developing the innovation that,frankly, we ought to export around the world tax-free and tariff-free thatallows us both to grow the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.I think the Paris accord is almost a Flat Earth type of thinking. If youlook today at the solution, it's innovation. It is not killing these blue-collar oil and gas jobs.CAVUTO:  Real quickly, the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan which we're gettinghints that the president and the leaders, Democratic leadership, is pushingfor just a reconciliation vote there, where it would be just a simplemajority, what do you think of that?BRADY:  Yes, pretty ironic, because I remember, as we were working on taxreform and working with our Democratic colleagues, they assailed us nightand day for making this a partisan one-party effort.Yet, a week or two after the president called for unity, they are takingthat same approach and looking to jam that through. I think it's a bigmistake. There is plenty of common ground, I think, on how we defeat COVIDand rebuilding this economy. They're starting next week on the budget inthe House without answering basic questions.The other thing too, Neil, if we're serious about the economy, first, weought to take any discussions of tax increases off the table until we haverecovered to pre-COVID levels. I mean, you wouldn't raise taxes in goodeconomic times. It's controversial. You certainly don't do it in therecovery.And Leader McConnell is right. We do need COVID-related protections thatreward companies that are doing the right thing to create a safeenvironment for the workers and customers. I think -- I think that needs tobe, both of those, key parts of this discussion.CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch very, very closely.Kevin Brady, always good catching up with you, my friend. Be well.BRADY:  Good to see you, Neil.CAVUTO:  Happy new year. Happy bumpy new year, I guess.BRADY:  And to you.CAVUTO:  Kevin Brady.As Kevin and I were wrapping up there, just want to alert you to twothings. Tesla, that is falling in after-hours trading, the stock down 7percent, just missing some key sales figures just a teeny bit. But that wasenough to hit this high flyer.But the big, big news is Apple just out with earnings that handily beatStreet estimates, and I think blew them away, when it came not only torevenues, but the quarter performance, the fact that it's making close to$58 billion of its iPhones alone, and it had $100 billion-plus quarter, thefirst American company to register sales north of $100 billion, let alone$112 billion, in a single quarter. That has never been done -- until now.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, you just heard that Apple had its most profitablequarter ever, revenue north of $111.4 billion. It was up from $91.82billion in the year-earlier quarter.Again, these numbers, whether you're talking earnings, or iPhone sales, orany of the other things in which it breaks out, including headphones andAirPods and all the rest, handily beating estimates, and all up doubledigits from a year ago.It was considered a safe pandemic play. Early indications are, coming outof the pandemic, it could play the same role. Tim Cook has been discussingthis with analysts. And we understand that he's not exactly providing aspecific guidance for the year going forward, but he is optimisticnevertheless.Gary Kaltbaum with us right now.Gary, it's interesting.On a day we are focused on all these companies that out of the blue seem toquickly attain the market value of Apple -- I exaggerate -- when I talkabout GameStop and some of these others, the real McCoy is showing how youdo it, huh?GARY KALTBAUM, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  A $2.4 trillion market cap.And, for me, the big story is, to be able to grow sales 20 percent-plus,when you're doing already $280 billion a year in sales, in a pandemic, witha bunch of your stores closed because of pandemic, is just magnificent.And I still remember when Tim Cook took over for Steve Jobs. I waswondering if this guy was up to it. And, man, oh, man, and it's simplyabout -- I just think about me. Every time they come out with a new phone,I get it. I had good earbuds. And guess what? My kids bought me the newerearbuds that are even better with noise cancellation. And they just gotgame.And they have created their own great ecosystem with their services, andthey are here to stay. And I wouldn't be surprised if it just keeps -- $3trillion, $4 trillion, which I would have never believed before.CAVUTO:  The stock is down a little bit in after-hours trading. I know thismight be a bit of selling after the fact.But, having said that, when I look at just smartphone sales, $65.6 billion,and we understand from Tim Cook a lot of those toward the priciest of allthe models, the I guess the 12 Pro Max. And they're not cheap. They're$1,200, $1,300 phones. That's a lot of phones and a lot of folks plunkingdown a lot of money for the privilege.What do you think?KALTBAUM:  Years ago, I believe, who's going to pay $500 for a phone? Butit's just not a phone anymore. It's everything to everybody. And that'swhat people consider.They use it for their health and their weight and their heart rate, and youname it. They have created this system that has your whole life in it. Youpay with it. And you do everything with it. And I suspect there will bemore applications as it moves forward.I think he mentioned there's a couple of million apps that they have onthere. So, that's some pretty big stuff. And the only reason the stockisn't moving in the aftermarket is, I think the market is a little bit softhere. I think you're seeing that right now.And it's already had a pretty good move up the last few weeks. So I thinkthat's a no biggie at this juncture.CAVUTO:  Yes, the stock has essentially doubled in the last year. And youwere on that before anyone else.All right, so we will follow this very, very closely.Gary, thank you, as always, Gary Kaltbaum following these developmentshere.So, this is the headwind these markets are going to face when you have thebig boys. Most of them are doing quite well, and technology, and Facebook,I would throw with that. Tesla is making a profit and doing all of that,just not as much as they thought it would. So they pounce on that.But watch these guys, because they could be market leaders.And, by the way, you might want to be watching China. It's had some shipssort of steamrolling through the South China Sea, an early challenge forJoe Biden.We are on that -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The relationship between the UnitedStates and China is arguably the most important relationship that we havein the world going forward.It's going to shape a lot of the future that we all live. And,increasingly, that relationship has some adversarial aspects to it. It hascompetitive ones. And it also still has cooperative ones.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  The new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, making it clear rightnow that China will be our biggest issue right now, and China confirmingthat by doing some military exercises in the South China Sea and elsewhere.Some have seen that as a provocative move.Gordon Chang, "The Coming Collapse of China," and so much more, author.What do you make, Gordon, of this China challenge? They might be relieved,that is, that Donald Trump isn't in the White House. But they are clearlydrawing some lines with the new president. What are they -- what are theytelling him?GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, "THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA":  I think what they'retrying to do is find out how tough Biden is.These aerial exercises in Taiwan on Saturday and Sunday are interpreted inthe region as a challenge to Biden, and many people in the U.S. are sayingthe same thing. China challenges new U.S. presidents. They did that withGeorge W. Bush and Barack Obama with military provocations that weredangerous.They didn't do it, surprisingly, with Donald Trump, because I think thatthey were afraid of him. But we know from comments from members of theChinese elite that they're not afraid of Biden. And so I think this is avery dangerous time, because you have got leaders in China who arearrogant, and they think they can push us around.CAVUTO:  Do you think they will return to the kind of provocative stuffthey used to do, where they're militarizing islands, and they're justgetting reckless, increasingly reckless, on the belief that we won'trespond?CHANG:  Yes, I think that that's part of it. And it's not just theexercises against Taiwan.Within the week, China has basically a new invasion of Indian-controlledterritory, this in Sikkim. So, China's pushing out around its borders allover the place. And this is really one of those points which could beconsequential, because Beijing is seeing who's going to push back.CAVUTO:  Now, the -- maybe the trade deals with Donald Trumpnotwithstanding, I mean, we do know that the world prefers investing inChina now more than they do our own country.And I'm just wondering whether China flouts that or leverages that. What doyou think?CHANG:  China leverages every point of contact it has with our society andwith others.So, the answer to that is definitely yes. And it's right. China had moreFDI last year than we did. But China's economy was much weaker than theyreported. And I think we're going to see that 2021 is not going to be theexcellent year that Beijing had in 2020.CAVUTO:  Gordon Chang, thank you very much, my friend, Gordon followingthese latest developments in China.The Chinese markets and economy have rebounded more than any other sinceall of this. And there's so much we don't know about how all this startedand whether they were telling us the truth about how it did. Probably amoot point at this point.When we come back, speaking of that virus, how to deal with all thesevariants. There are at least three. And there are some recommendationsdoctors are giving to address them -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, so many variants, so little time right now.The latest sort of odd mutation of the COVID-19 virus popping up inCalifornia.Dr. Eric Vail with us right now, Cedars-Sinai pathologist who's beenlooking into this.Doctor, what can you tell us?DR. ERIC VAIL, PATHOLOGIST, CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER:  Hey, Neil. Thanksfor having me on the show.CAVUTO:  Thank you.VAIL:  So, we discovered this variant right around New Year's, and it hasgrown from about less than 2 percent of the total tested samples inNovember to a little -- almost half of the samples that we have seen so farin January.Yes. And so...CAVUTO:  Can existing vaccines, Doctor, deal with it?VAIL:  What?So, right now, there's no evidence that the vaccine will have any reducedefficacy on this strain. There's no evidence that it has increasedvirulence. There's just some evidence that it may be more infectious.CAVUTO:  They have talked about getting more vaccines out, as you know,Doctor, but because of the delay, and maybe some of the problems justgetting to that final mile, I know a number of medical organizations aretalking about the possibility that building herd immunity, or whatever youwant to call it...VAIL:  Sure.CAVUTO:  ... could be more a 2022 phenomenon.Do you agree with that?VAIL:  At this time, I really can't comment on the vaccine rolloutstrategy.But I think that, as long as everyone can get a vaccine, that they shouldgo get one. It's really the way that we're going to get out of thispandemic. And, until then, just keep doing what we're doing.CAVUTO:  Doctor, you must be sick of being asked this question, but when doyou think we're out of this? When do you think we have it under control?I mean, we're looking at spring, some say. I know there's been hints comingout of the FDA that they think that might be the first likely...(CROSSTALK)VAIL:  Well...CAVUTO:  But what are your thoughts?VAIL:  What I have told my friends and what I think is that Thanksgivingwill be a normal Thanksgiving. That's the -- that's the best I can use.CAVUTO:  Huh. All right.So, if you like your relatives, that should be a goal.VAIL:  Yes.CAVUTO:  If you don't, maybe you should be a little worried.VAIL:  Yes.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But, having said that, what do you think of how the newadministration has come in to deal with this, to beef up more vaccines, andtry to get them out there faster?Apparently, it's a state-by-state type of issue. Some are very good at it,others not so much. What is the bottleneck issue, do you think?VAIL:  So, the -- sort of the way that the vaccines are being distributedright now isn't really a -- something that I don't have -- I don't have abig picture on that. And so I couldn't really comment on it.But I think that it's just important that we get as many people vaccinatedas quickly as possible.CAVUTO:  And when they do that, and they want to get the elderly first,they want to make sure, you're in a nursing home...VAIL:  Yes.CAVUTO:  ... in an assisted living, you get it first. Do you agree withthat strategy, obviously, health care workers, such as yourself....VAIL:  Yes. The...CAVUTO:  ... but that should be a unified approach?VAIL:  So, the reasoning behind that is that is that the -- is that elderlypeople and people in nursing homes, things like that, they're the ones thatget the worst disease from this, right? They're the ones that have thehighest risk.And so the general strategy from the beginning has been to get people thatwere as high as risk as possible. And I think that that's reasonable.CAVUTO:  All right. We will watch it very, very closely.Doctor, thank you very much for taking the time.And just to echo a little bit of what the doctor touched on, the Bidenadministration has already advanced-ordered 200 million doses of COVID-19vaccine, hoping to make it 1.5 million doses a day that can be distributed.The devil's in the details. And Pfizer, BioNTech are going to make 125million new doses for early availability global -- global-wide. That's whatthey hope. That's what they hope.
