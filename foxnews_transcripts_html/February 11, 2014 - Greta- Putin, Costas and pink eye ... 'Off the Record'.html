Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a second, just for a minute.
Since we launched ON THE RECORD in our new time slot, 7:00 p.m. eastern, I have been doing a nightly "Off the Record," just talking to you, telling you what I think about some very controversial, hot topics of the day. Today, I was having trouble coming up with a controversial topic to talk to you about. And that's when one of my producers -- whose name I won't tell you. I won't name him because his idea is ridiculous. He suggested I do an "Off the Record" about Bob Costas' double pink eye. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Pink eye? That's crazy. How is that a controversial topic? Isn't everyone against it? You aren't for it, are you? I certainly can't criticize Bob Costas for double pink eye. Yes, I know, last week, I slapped him around a bit for his ridiculous praise of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, which was grossly naive and just plain stupid. But I can't hold pink eye against him. Tonight, I actually feel sorry for him. So, I am now Team Costas pink eye. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue I you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
