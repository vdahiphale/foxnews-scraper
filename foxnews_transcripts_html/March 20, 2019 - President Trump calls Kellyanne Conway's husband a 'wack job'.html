Trump goes on the attack against George Conway; Raymon Arroyo has this week's edition of Seen and Unseen on 'The Ingraham Angle.' 
This is a rush transcript from "The Ingraham Angle," March 20, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from another busy Washington tonight. As Joe Biden looks more and more likely, he's going to jump into the 2020 field, I'll explain why global elites are pushing his candidacy and we're going to tell you how his family attempted to enrich themselves through China when he was in office.
Speaking of 2020, there's no shortage of Democrat oddities and rivalries already emerging. Bongino and Hahn will debate some of the incredible moments later in the hour and our own room Raymond Arroyo took to the streets of Washington to ask whether people are ready to embrace, are you ready, Unimoons. What the heck are those? Well, we're going to tell you in a hilarious seen and unseen ahead. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And be sure to stay until the end of tonight's show, it's very important. My message to President Trump about some of the stuff that's happened over the last two days and maybe you know what I'm talking about. But first, foreign powers draft Uncle Joe, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you find yourself up at night worried about what foreign policy elites think of President Trump? And do you really care if Angel and Merkel doesn't like Trump or any of his policies? I don't think so yet today's political headline was world leaders tell Biden, we need you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Hill picked up where Politico left off adding global leaders nudging Biden to enter 2020 race. My first thought about this was, wait a second, why are we celebrating foreign countries meddling in U.S. elections? I thought foreign powers using influence to affect our vote, choose our candidates was a bad thing.
But the pleas from officials urging Biden to run, they started at last month's Munich Security Conference.

INGRAHAM: They're getting ready for their old wine cellars of the EU again. Well, Biden has long passed himself off as a foreign policy maven and an expert and I guess, compared to Cory Booker and like Gillibrand and Beto, at least he does have some experience in international relations.

The only problem is he served eight years in an administration that was marked by one foreign policy failure after another. And this was summed up really well in a piece from foreign policy with this title, ‘Joe Biden's Foreign Policy Fantasy.' You see at the end of 2016, Biden had just written a piece in foreign affairs, claiming we are stronger and more secure today than when President Barack and I took office in January 2009." He said immodestly.
Well, of course hockey, it's a total delusion. Let's just do a quick review, shall we? Number one, Biden support for the hideous Iran deal.

BIDEN: If we take the nuclear bomb off the table, it's better to deal with those bad guys that to deal with the bad guys and the nuclear bombs on the table. This is a good deal for you, first and foremost for United States. It's a good deal for the world, the region and it's a good deal for Israel.

INGRAHAM: Who thought this could represent in nuclear weapon. Well, it was a horrible deal. Of course, but one that Europe loved because countries like France wanted to keep making money, doing business with the mullahs. It was shameful. And let's not forget the pallets of cash, $400 million that was also sent to Iran in the dead of night.

Number 2 failure, the rise of ISIS under Obama and Biden as Uncle Joe defended believe it or not, Obama's arming of those Syrian rebels.

BIDEN: We are working hand in glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes and he will go, there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an Al- Qaeda sponsored government that follows on.

INGRAHAM: One problem, the weapons were actually going to Islamic Jihadists. Gold star Joe. Number 3 failure, the rise of China accelerated under Obama and Biden. China's aggression, its threats in the South China Sea, its a brazen ceiling of U.S. intellectual property, it went virtually unchecked and unchallenged by the Obama and Biden administration.
And let's not forget Benghazi and the fall of Libya, a total disaster and a tragedy. We lost the U.S. ambassador, three fine Americans and then the Obama-Biden crew lied about the reason for the attack at the time Romney was nipping at their heels in 2012. Remember, that was September-October in 2012.

And finally, the failed Russian reset. Russia's annexation of Crimea, it's move into Eastern Ukraine which gave Putin, power, prestige and a much needed foreign policy win. I could go on and on and on. Obama and Biden fully embraced though this New World order and they were loved because they embraced agreements like the trans-Pacific partnership and the U.N. climate accord.
Trump comes in and he rejects both because he believes rightly, they seated too much American power and decision making to far flung foreign bureaucracies. But Biden, he would return things to the old status quo.

INGRAHAM: Or Trump actually goes to Brussels and he declares that the era of free riding from NATO is over. The American taxpayer is fed up. And the foreign policy elites gathered just bristled, can't do that, well, he did.
Our economy is the strongest in the G7, it's the envy of the world. Their economy is in many cases are faltering after decades of social welfare spending and high taxes. So of course, the old Euro elites, they want to return to the old status quo and they had all the power, none of those populists were challenging them.

        }
      
And let's face it, nothing says status quo more than Amtrak Joe. He is the foreign policy establishment. And even members of that club, they think Biden was a disaster like former Obama Defense Secretary Bob Gates who wrote in his memoir quote, " Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades." Ouch.

        }
      
Oh but none of that matters to council on foreign relations here or progressive European officials abroad. Spain's former Foreign Minister gave it all away in an interview with Politico noting that Biden is, "deeply committed to the trans-Atlantic community and the rules-based international order."
Here's the translation, okay? Committed to empowering the global elites and swollen global bureaucracies who make the rules and set the priorities for you, the American people. Yay? No. But with only 5%, with about 5% of American voters focused on foreign policy or national security issues, I would expect that the electorate will focus on pocketbook issues in 2020.

And as memory serves, Uncle Joe wasn't too hot on those either. And that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now. I'm delighted he's with us. Nigel for is the former Brexit leader from U.K. and Fox news contributor. A lot of news across the pond today.
I watch what happened with Corbyn verses May all morning long and Nigel will get into that but these same European elites that you fought over there are now trying to dictate candidates here in the United States, your response to the Angle.

NIGEL FARAGE, FORMER U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER: Well, of course, they are. I mean look, you know Biden is a darling, isn't he of the of the international community? He's a big supporter of the European Union and that's under threat with Brexit and rising populism right across Europe. And of course, NATO. I mean, America is one of the very few countries paying over the 2% membership fee of their annual budget every year on defense. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And so basically, they're welcoming Biden because if he gets to become President, everybody can free load off America so it's not a surprise to me that he's a darling of the international community but I have to say. I think as far as I'm concerned, some of his beliefs in the nation state and his fighting this great battle against these international bureaucracies, he'd be a disaster.
INGRAHAM: Yes, well, Biden speaks quite highly of himself as he did a few years ago and you know, how the world sees him as a true leader, let's watch.

BIDEN: World leaders look at me and say, can't you deliver? Those of you who travel around the world or are from other parts of the world, you know that the world looks at the city right now as dysfunctional. And that's a problem.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So that was in March of 2016, okay? So it's been eight years or almost eight years the time of Obama and Biden and he's like well, they look at us as dysfunctional, whose fault was that? Now it's still - now he wants to claim all the credit for what?

GARAGE: Yes and this comment that he made at Munich when he said America will be back. Well, unless you have noses Mr. Biden, it's Donald Trump who got the North Koreans to the table to start talking about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and it's Donald Trump that actually helped with a campaign that has defeated militarily ISIS on the ground in Syria.
And the truth of it is that Trump's foreign policy achievements are massively more than anything, Obama and Biden achieved in their eight years.

Trump didn't create a massive crush of refugees into Europe but the instability in the Middle East obviously from Bush keeping it going all the way through, we got millions of people - you know, new European citizens or residents because of that.

Assimilation proving to be a massive problem and the globally elites including Biden completely in denial that actually it's an endless series of wars that they launched that directly lead to this problem. I mean, Libya in 2012, you know, Gaddafi may not have been a good guy but getting rid of him has actually made the situation worse and not better.

THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: It's time for this House to determine that it will deliver on Brexit for the British people. They deserve better than this House has given them so far.
JEREMY CORBYN, OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY LEADER: Surely after two big rejections by the House, she must have noticed, there isn't much support for the deal that she negotiated. So who is damn right reckless here, Mr. Speaker? The Prime Minister plowing on with an unachievable, unsupported deal or other than this House who want to achieve something serious and sensible.

FARAGE: Yes, what's going on here is the British people voted to leave the European Union and we're due to leave it next Friday, March 29 at 11:00 PM. The Prime Minister has put forward what she calls a withdrawal agreement but it's actually a new international treaty with the European Union which takes us out in name but keeps us trapped inside EU rules.
The failure of Brexit should be laid at the Prime Minister's door. It's her that is betraying Brexit and it's her today who wrote a letter to the European Union, begging for an extension for a few months so that we don't leave on March 29th and frankly --
INGRAHAM: Yes, the elites don't want to give up power. It goes back to Biden, they don't -- they want to get power back and Brexit, disempowered the elites and it disempowered the international bureaucrats in Brussels. They hate that, they want to go back to the old status quo, that's why they like Joe Biden, they want the Obama New World order back in play and they want to get rid of all these populists who care about their sovereignty of their own countries.

This is really important that Biden's son, son Hunter who is allegedly tied to the Chinese government, well, what's that all about?
Author Peter Schweizer, first revealed this in a book last year that a private equity firm managed by the son of Former Vice President Biden struck a deal with China's state owned bank in 2013. At the same time, the Biden was in the country to meet with President Xi Jinping.
Here now is Peter Schweizer, author of the book, ‘Secret Empires' which comes out in paperback, March 26. Peter, now what do you believe the Chinese were trying to accomplish by doing business with Hunter Biden?
PETER SCHWEIZER, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE & AUTHOR, SECRET EMPIRES: Well, I think Laura, they accomplished what they set out to do and that was to get favor with Joe Biden, you talked about it in your introduction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Joe Biden was criticized in the latter parts of the Obama administration for going soft on Beijing, on the South China Sea, on trade, on human rights. Look, it's very simple. In December of 2013, Hunter Biden flies on Airforce Two to Beijing China with his father.
His father meets with Chinese officials, he's very soft on Beijing. The most important thing that happens, happens ten days after they returned and that's when Hunter Biden's small private equity firm called Rosemont Seneca Partners gets a $1 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government, not with the Chinese corporation, with the government.
And what people need to realize is Hunter Biden has no background in China. He has no background in private equity, the deal he got in the Shanghai free trade zone, nobody else had. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Blackstone, nobody had this deal. So it's very, very clear and that's the first of a series of deals that Hunter Biden strikes with the Chinese government. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So there's no question when you chart what Joe Biden is doing with China, the meetings he's having and the deals that his sign is procuring at the same time that they are buying off Biden through his son. I think it's crystal clear.
INGRAHAM: I'm like and they've spent the last two years trying to say, well, you had a hotel that you wanted to build in Moscow, nothing came of that and that makes such a big deal and this just gets buried. If you didn't write about this in your book and I wasn't - my memory wasn't jogged the other day when I was thinking the other day, wasn't there a Biden and I looked it back up.
People wouldn't even be talking about this. This, in and of itself is like a disqualifier.
SCHWEIZER: Yes, well look, and Laura this is the tip of the iceberg. There was a court case last year. Hunter Biden's business partner went on trial in an unrelated case. We got access to the financial records, the Morgan Stanley financial records of Rosemont Seneca Bohai which was a pass through going out of that account - to the most money going out of that account went to Hunter Biden.
The money going into the account, there's $3.1 million from corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs, there's $1 million from the Chinese, there's monies from a Kazakh oligarch, there's $1.2 million from some LLC from a Swiss bank that's been implicated in money laundering, you don't even know who is behind the mysterious LLC. Exactly, this is all going on while Joe Biden is Vice Presidents steering foreign policy.
INGRAHAM: Okay, there's a stunning lack of curiosity on the part of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS Washington Post, New York Times or I missed all that reporting. Peter, awesome.
SCHWEIZER: Yes, exactly.

SCHWEIZER: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: Okay Peter, thank you so much and next, an “Ingraham Angle” investigation into our lax illegal immigration policies and the deadly impact on your communities. We're not going to stop talking about the murder of Bambi Larson and other Americans despite the fact that several states and localities are trying to make it easier for these criminals to continue living in America.
I'll break it down next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: What's your message to those local officials tonight?
DIANE COLEMAN, BAMBI LARSON'S FRIEND: I'm happy to speak for Bambi. Shame on you, you have blood on your hands.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: The sanctuary policies that allow this kind of thing to continue in the state of California, should this be a lesson?
COLEMAN: Are you kidding? Of course, my message is, please President Trump, I beg of you, keep us safe, this is insane.
INGRAHAM: That was Diane Coleman, a friend of the California woman, Bambi Larson who was brutally stabbed to death allegedly at the hands of an illegal alien. “The Ingraham Angle” exposed the disgusting policies and the officials that allowed this man Carlos Carranza to roam free after he came into the country illegally claimed asylum and then went on to commit a host of other crimes.
Nine detainers were issued against him, none were honored. Bambi Larson's son deserves justice and we're not going to drop her case or any others like it around the country. In Maryland, police say a 16-year old was stabbed as many as 100 times and then his body was set on fire by five of his fellow MS-13 gang members.
Daniel Horowitz of the Conservative Review spoke to ICE and was told that three of the five suspects came into the country illegally as unaccompanied alien children and then they were treated as refugees and resettled around the country.
In North Carolina, Neri Cruz-Carmona, an illegal alien from Mexico pled guilty after hit and run. That decapitated Jamar Beach, the father of a 2- year old boy. He will reportedly be eligible for release in just 14 months.

INGRAHAM: And the state of New Mexico is becoming ground zero for human smuggling. The Albuquerque journalist reporting this week that ICE and Border Patrol identified several organized criminal groups that have been smuggling immigrants across the southern border to destinations in Alabama, New Jersey, Tennessee and elsewhere.
There are dozens of the stories that we at “The Ingraham Angle” come across each week. And yet despite all of this, we do this night after night, there are still politicians who care more about the plight of illegals than their own American citizens.
Again, we could highlight scores of these cases on a daily basis but we will just focus on a few tonight. In New Jersey, illegal immigrants are now getting literally a free pass. Seven new rules were just handed down, essentially handcuffing police from assisting ICE or even asking questions about immigration status.
In New York and Wisconsin, leftist politicians and advocates are pushing for illegal immigrants to have driver's licenses even though voters in those states overwhelmingly disapproved. And in Massachusetts, the town of Brockton, a battle is raging over its sanctuary law.
A local paper there is reporting that a new proposal would block police from cooperating with ICE. And in North Carolina, yet another Sheriff is saying his officers will no longer hold ICE detainees, leaving more dangerous criminals on the streets.

        }
      
It isn't all bad news though, there are folks fighting back like North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore, he and other Republicans are now trying to force these Sheriffs to cooperate with federal agents. Speaker Moore joins me now along with Former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan who's also a Fox news contributor.
Mr. Moore, I'm telling you, I'm reading these quotes tonight and we actually have a sound bite from Sheriff Quentin Miller, I got to play it for you, it drove me crazy and I want you to respond on the other side, let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUENTIN MILLER, SHERIFF, BUNCOMBE: We do not make or enforce immigration laws. That is not part of our law enforcement duties. That would be attacked for this policy directed, maybe even by ICE. However, a detainer request is not a valid warrant.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Mr. Moore, what do you say to that sheriff tonight?
TIM MOORE, R-N.C., STATE HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, respectfully I say that sheriff is wrong and that's why we filed the legislation that we have to mandate that sheriffs must honor these ICE detainees. You know, this isn't about illegal immigration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What it's about, is about criminals who happen to be here illegally and making sure that we honor those ICE detainer orders because it's about public safety and when law enforcement officers refuse to do so, we've seen real instances where folks are murdered and injured.
INGRAHAM: Tom, we had a situation in New York where an illegal alien released by Mayor De Blasio, his policies actually bit off the finger of an ICE agent. I think we have a picture of it, you have to blur it out that because it's so gross. That's when -- and he's out on the street apparently.
TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: Absolutely, I've been set up the saying for two years. Sanctuary policies put ICE officers at great risk. Rather than getting the bad guy the safety security of county jail where he doesn't have weapons and is surrounded by security, the ICE agents had to go on their turf to arrest where they have access to who knows what weapons.
That person shouldn't have been out of County jail, he shouldn't have got right out of jail. But New York, New York's a sanctuary city. Look, ICE agents were kicked out of Rikers Island. The city, the most heinous terrorist attacks in the world that were happening were on a illegal aliens, right?
We're not even on Rikers Island. Gang members, MS-13 members walk out of Rikers Island daily.
INGRAHAM: And they're just released?
HOMAN: Yes, released and ICE agents have to go -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Is there something that can be done right now by this administration that would help with this crush at the border because now people are coming in and we don't know who they are. They don't even have room to detain them.
HOMAN: I think we can definitely slow down the crush at the border if I think, ICE needs to go out and seek out those family members, that you see and those adults that enter this country illegally, had due process at great taxpayer expense, and were ordered removed by a federal judge. We need to execute those orders. If those orders don't mean anything, if we don't execute them, there's not integrity in our system.
INGRAHAM: How many of those orders approximately are outstanding?
HOMAN: It's 200,000 or 300,000.
INGRAHAM: Its' 200,000 or 300,000?
HOMAN: And I did that three years ago. I had a national operation, we went and looked for these family units, I had final orders. And guess what happened. Almost immediately the border numbers decreased because we show there is deterrence and a consequence if you come up committing immigration fraud. We have got to show the Central Americans that you can't commit fraud and expect to stay forever. Right now they're not seeing --
INGRAHAM: But no repercussions. Why shouldn't you stay? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HOMAN: They're going to keep coming because they don't see family units being returned. We've got to execute those orders.
INGRAHAM: But then they have kids in America, then the kids are American, then they can't separate the family. That's that whole narrative that comes.
HOMAN: That's what happens. They'll become fugitives. They'll stay for years, have U.S. citizen kids. Now everybody says, don't separate families.
INGRAHAM: Mr. Moore, North Carolina used to be a conservative state. Now it has changed a lot over the years for a lot of reasons, part of it is, I think there was a "Washington Post" piece not too long ago about the demographic changes in the country across the board. And it has changed a lot. And I love North Carolina, it is a beautiful state. But are the people really clamoring for sheriffs not to cooperate with ICE? Is that really a priority for the North Carolina voters? And if it is not, I would say Republicans and sane Democrats better get their houses in order here, or they're all going to be thrown out of office in North Carolina, and they should be. These sheriffs should never be elected again. They should be thrown out if they are elected officials.
MOORE: Fortunately, Republicans do control the state legislature. And I predict that this bill will pass overwhelmingly. And it's just irresponsible for any official, particularly a law enforcement official, to in any way advocate releasing someone who is a criminal, who has committed a crime, back out on the streets who should not even be here.
And this is having real results. I will give you an example. Some of the folks that we have seen already in North Carolina and these counties were some of these sheriffs have done this, are people who have assaulted law enforcement officers, have committed sex offenses.
INGRAHAM: We have a graphic. Let's put that up on so people know what you're talking about. Let's put that up the screen, please. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MOORE: And so these folks have been released.
INGRAHAM: And I'm going to narrate some of this. Yes, 22-year-old arrested for assault on a female, two assaults on government officials, a 19-year-old arrested -- Tom Homan is not surprised by this -- for manslaughter, 22-year-old arrested for drug smuggling, 20-year-old arrested for kidnapping and first-degree rape. These were people released by the sanctuary sheriffs, like the one that we just played.
MOORE: Exactly. And Laura, and on top of that, guess what? When they are released, they are very difficult to find. Imagine that.
INGRAHAM: Shocker.
MOORE: And so they go on down the road, and who knows what other crimes they committed before or will commit after.
INGRAHAM: This is radical. This is radical. We are being run by radicals. These are radicals in law enforcement positions, and they are just activists. These are not sheriffs, these are activists. I don't care what he said. It's not proper -- what does he mean by a warrant is not proper? What is he talking about?
HOMAN: First of all they stopped being law enforcement and became politicians, number one. Number two, some jurisdictions have said the detainers are unconstitutional. The sheriff doesn't need to read the detainer. You don't have to hold them for ICE. You can simply call ICE before releasing them. Don't hold them a minute passed you normally hold them. Call us. There's no liability there. There's nothing unconstitutional there. Call ICE, let us get our hands on the criminals, remove them from neighborhoods.
INGRAHAM: Just call to say I love you, just like the song goes.
MOORE: It's a very simple process.
INGRAHAM: We have to go. Thanks so much, panel.
And up next, a bizarre family feud at the White House, goofy crooks caught on camera, and would you take a honeymoon without your spouse? Raymond Arroyo here to break it all down, "Seen and Unseen," next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for our "Seen and Unseen" segment where we expose the big cultural stories of the day.
We have a very public family feud bubbled over at the White House, newlyweds honeymooning without of their spouses, and dumb criminal caught on camera, always fun. Joining us now, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, "New York Times" bestselling author of the "Will Wilder" series, "Amulet of Power." Raymond, President Trump, Kellyanne Conway versus George Conway, what is going on?
RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: For months, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's husband George, as you know, has been trolling President Trump on social media. Kellyanne and the president have so far remained mum, but that changed today when the president called Conway out on Twitter. He was later asked about the controversy at the White House.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, your tweet about George Conway, how do they fit the standard of the First Lady's "Be Best" campaign?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I don't know him. I don't know him. He is a whack job, there is no question about it. I think he is doing a tremendous disservice to a wonderful wife. Kellyanne is a wonderful woman.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: You note how the president pivoted there.
INGRAHAM: He didn't answer what about the "Be Best" campaign.
ARROYO: He kind of brushed that. He answers the question he wants to answer.
INGRAHAM: He want to answer, very good.
ARROYO: and Kellyanne Conway later had to come out and defend the president. But here's what is so awful. George Conway is putting his wife in a terrible position, and I feel for any spouse who is a public figure, and your spouse is basically attacking your boss or attacking your company.
INGRAHAM: Keep it in the family, what did the godfather say?
ARROYO: George Conway, he is not being best at all, and he should be called out for this, and that's what we're seeing.
And speaking of honeymoons being over, Laura, there is a new movement to do away with them all together. It is called uni-moons, and it's been getting a lot of coverage. Uni, one. One-moon. You just have your marriage, and the spouses separate. They go off with their friends for a vacay. I took to the streets of D.C. today to see what people thought of this new concept. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Uni-moons. Uni-moons. Uni-moons. Uni-moons. Uni-moons.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just read about this.
ARROYO: It is this new movement to do honeymoons alone. They are calling them uni-moons. Is that a good idea?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Isn't the point to stick together?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To each their own, I guess.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can tell you, that is not about me and my fiance are going to be doing.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If that's what you want, I feel like, yes, that would be cool.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On a case basis.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I see my honey?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does that allow for them to just go for it with other people, men and women?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know if it involves that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It depends on how much time I spent with him before then.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: Are you married?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
ARROYO: Would you like to be?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, of course.
ARROYO: Really? Together?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: This is what I like to hear. I love playing cupid.
There is a movement now to get rid of honeymoons and go on something called uni-moons.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love it. You can get that last thing out, you know, that last shakeout.
ARROYO: Yes, but that last shakeout is called a bachelor party.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, the honeymoon happened, right?
ARROYO: No, there is no honeymoon. There is no honeymoon.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a night.
ARROYO: No. You are leaving the night of the wedding to go with the guys.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In that case, I take that back that
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great idea.
ARROYO: How did this turned into a miniseries? I love you all.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, my God. They are the winners.
ARROYO: I love how they reversed their position. Laura, the idea of a uni-moon, this is called selfishness. It is called selfishness and a personal vacation. I don't like the idea. If you can't come to an agreement with your spouse on a destination for a vacation, and if you can't compromise on that, kids, dogs, and schools are going to kill you all. So get used to compromise, go on the darn honeymoon.
INGRAHAM: OK, that's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: All right, Raymond, tell us about the hapless criminals. These are my favorite segments, that you tracked down.
ARROYO: You thought that was the dumbest thing? No, no, no, no, you can't make this up. In Arkansas, two drunken patrons tried to steal a statue of Al Capone from Hot Springs bar. Two robbers, there they are, in full view of the other patrons, made off with the statue, eventually dropping the thing. Now, they broke Al's fedora, his arm, and his leg. They were apprehended by the bar owner and they have been charged. You see them carrying him off.
But the bumbling robber of the week award goes to this guy. He stole an atm machine and then tried to use New Jersey transit to make off with his loot. The problem is the bus driver would not open the door.
INGRAHAM: Wait a second.
ARROYO: He's dragging and turning it.
INGRAHAM: He's doing that rotation thing. That's what I do when I moving heavy furniture thing, the rotation.
ARROYO: The message here, really the lesson is if you are going to steal something, don't use public transit, not a good idea. Have a getaway car, or if the loot is bigger than a bread box, you're going to need --
INGRAHAM: I still like it when they go to rob a house and they sit and have a sandwich. And you guys don't have the mustard I like, they are complaining.
ARROYO: We have 30 seconds. Something serious I have to mention. After that Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, we are not hearing anything about a spate of church desecration's in France. In the last week, 12 churches have been decimated, altars destroyed. This was a burning.
INGRAHAM: Burned.
ARROYO: In Saint-Sulpice, it's one of the major churches in France. They burned it, hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. And this is going on all over the country. So there is an anti-Christian bias here. And guess what, the government and ecclesiastical officials, they don't know who is to blame.
INGRAHAM: Is the Pope talking about it?
ARROYO: No. We'll see.
INGRAHAM: OK. That's disturbing. Thank you for that report.
And the 2020 Democratic candidates are the gifts that keep on giving. We are going to take you through some of the most absurd moments just in the past 24 hours. You drop everything, Arroyo.
ARROYO: I know.
INGRAHAM: I'm going to push you off the thing again. Bongino and Hahn will debate the highs and lows, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for “The Ingraham Angle's” "20/20 On 2020." And the more we learn about these candidates the stranger they all become. Take Beto. After losing a Senate bid to incumbent Ted Cruz, "The Washington Post" writes, quote, "On one stop in New Mexico, he didn't write about in his blog -- by eating new Mexican dirt, said to have regenerative powers. He brought some home for the family to eat, too." Dirt eaters. My son did that when he was three.
It gets worse. "The Post" adding "One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant," do I have to say? "turd from one of their kids diapers and put it enable, telling his wife Amy that it was an avocado." He wouldn't confirm, but added it sounded like something he would do.
Here now is Dan Bongino, host of the Dan Bongino Show podcast and a FOX News contributor, and Chris Hahn, radio host, served as senior aide to Chuck Schumer. Dan, the more we hear about Beto, forget past, pretty recent stuff, the weirder it becomes.
DAN BONGINO, FORMER NYPD OFFICER: Yes. Laura, the most damaging political narratives in the world are those that change some preexisting notion of who the candidate was. So before, at least liberals, I didn't think he was so cool, but liberals thought he was this edgy, hip, cool guy, skateboards, whatever. Now we find out he slips a turd into an -- by the way, it's not often you can get the word turd on FOX News and not get complaints.
But then we find out he was playing the guitar in some kind of animal outfit or something, dressed up as a sheep. Then we find out that he is a third eater, like literally, not figurately. Listen, that's not cool, that is straight up weird. The guide is a weird dude, and people have figured it out.
INGRAHAM: Chris, look, there probably is regenerative powers in dirt if it is healthy dirt, I guess. I guess you can make that argument, but it is a little odd. But we've got to move on. We've got to move on to Democratic fanatic number two. This Senator Kirsten Gillibrand posted this video today on Twitter of her lifting weights wearing a shirt that says "Just trying to get some ranch." That's an homage to a woman who interrupted her at a campaign stop last month to get some ranch dressing.
Chris, what is this obsession with all of the candidates trying to outdo each other? They are trying to do the AOC in the kitchen routine. But it just, somehow when AOC does it, it is kind of fun, but when they do it, it just seems like an older person trying to be cool, which is never cool.
CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, AOC is great at it, and so are a couple of other people. But look, I remember laughing, laughing, laughing in 2020 at the candidate coming down an escalator. And boy, was I wrong. And boy was everybody else wrong. So we never know what outlandish candidate thing will catch onto people.
INGRAHAM: Why was that outlandish? Why was that outlandish? He was in a coat and tie.
HAHN: I thought it was hilarious watching a guy running for president come down an escalator.
INGRAHAM: It's classic.
HAHN: Now we are seeing people talk about eating dirt and working out and doing other things on Twitter and Instagram. God bless them. We don't know what is going to catch on, we don't know who is going to rise to the top.
INGRAHAM: OK. Well, speaking of Beto --
HAHN: No one ever looks good working out either.
BONGINO: We agree on that.
INGRAHAM: Speaking of Beto, he has been barnstorming in key primary states since he announced last week, and he was talking to voters and reporters, and he ended up getting the toughest question I think from a student. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When are we going to get an actual policy from you instead of just like platitudes and nice stories?
BETO O'ROURKE, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to try to be as specific as I can. The end of the prohibition on marijuana and the expungement of the arrest records of everyone who has been arrested for marijuana.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, Dan, so the big weed crowd, and probably John Boehner who works for big weed now is really happy about that. So what of that?
BONGINO: Beto is an interesting guy because you very rarely can pin him down. I call him the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Remember "Ghostbusters?" Gozer becomes anything you think he is, and Ray thinks of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man? Because the media refuses to define Beto, he becomes whatever you want him to be. You think he is a moderate? Beto is a moderate. You think he is a liberal? He is a liberal. And then remember the same thing happened with Obama. Obama ran as a moderate, people forget that, governed as a far left liberal.
INGRAHAM: And finally, guys, hold on, Joe Biden, Chris, hasn't announced he is running yet, even though we know it is just a matter of time. Now there is this headline from "New York Magazine," "Could Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams form in early dream ticket for 2020?" Chris, you've got a failed gubernatorial candidate as the right choice for Biden's running mate? What is the point of floating a running mate at this point? He is not even in the race yet.
HAHN: I think but for voter suppression in Georgia, she would be governor of Georgia right now. And I think she was a fantastic candidate. And there are a lot of failed candidates that have gone on to win, including Abraham Lincoln, so let's not count her out just yet.
INGRAHAM: You're going back a little way there, Chrissy. You're going back a little way.
HAHN: You got to go back, but it did happen, and it worked out OK for America. So look, I think Joe Biden, he has got to do something extraordinary, because Joe Biden might be yesterday's news for a lot of Democrats. He is going to have to excite the base and excite the party, so he might have to be thinking out of the box, and this is one way to do it.
INGRAHAM: All right, we've got to get out, guys. Fantastic segment. We're going to bring you back and do this a lot I have a feeling.
Up next, my message to President Trump about his feuds with George Conway and John McCain. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Finally tonight, a message to President Trump.
Sir, you are presiding over the strongest economy in the world due to policies and priorities that you campaigned on and are now implementing. Manufacturing is back. Wages and optimism are up. Opportunities are boundless. This is truly one of the best times ever to be an American. You are doing a great job on judges, and you are doing the right thing on trade.
But for the past few days, you've stepped on your own message and given needless fodder to your enemies by talking about John McCain and George Conway. On key issues I disagree substantively with both of them, as well, I get it. But there is just too much left to be done to waste a moment on score settling. You are the leader of the free world.
In his 1981 speech to CPAC, Ronald Reagan reflected on the treatment he received during the campaign from his critics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: We were the subject of much indifference and oftentimes intolerance. And that is why I hope our political victory will be remembered as a generous one, and our time in power will be recalled for the tolerance we showed for those with whom we disagree.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, that is a good reminder for all of us, myself included.
As Democrats embrace socialist policies, we've been talking about it for weeks now, you, Mr. President, have an opportunity to not only build on your record of amazing success, but expand the conservative movement to new generations of Americans and save the United States from the feed currently befalling Europe. The Mueller investigation is outrage and it has been an albatross, unfair, and the media horribly biased against you, I understand the frustration. But keep your eye on the prize.
Being unconventional is great. We love it, going around the traditional media and using Twitter to speak directly to the American people, that's terrific. Have fun with that. But keep the focus on the horizon, on what counts -- the American people, preserving our freedom, our traditions, and our way of life.
And that's all the time we have tonight. Don't forget, my new podcast drops today. You want to listen, it's hilarious. Culture, politics, everything in between. Go to podcastone.com or iTunes. Download it, subscribe.
Shannon Bream and the phenomenal "Fox News @ Night" team take it all from here.
