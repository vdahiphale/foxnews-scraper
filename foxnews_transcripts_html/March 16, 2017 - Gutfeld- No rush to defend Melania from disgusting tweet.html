     Video  Gutfeld: No rush to defend Melania from disgusting tweet 
Where's the outrage over rapper Bow Wow's sexual threat toward the first lady? 
In obscure loser news: Bow Wow is back. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bow Wow, previously known as Lil' Bow Wow, previously known as washed-up rapper, previously known as washed-up actor, currently known as dumb and desperate, came to Snoop Dogg's defense after Mr. Trump tweeted about Snoop's video in which he mock-shoots the president. Bow Wow, also known as Shad Moss, also known as Tiny Shaft, also known as Sad Little Bitch -- he is a dog, mind you -- tried to make a bigger name for himself by tweeting this: "Ayo, @RealDonaldTrump, shut your punk ass up, talking bleep about my uncle Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us."
So Lil Weenie just threatened the first lady with sexual enslavement. I'd say that's a crime and punishable by jail time, but given the career of Little Shad -- aka Kneepad Shad -- that would be a step up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's got to be hard 20 years on to change nothing but your name. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, don't hold your breath for any feminist or media outrage. It's not like he threatened Michelle Obama. Different rules apply. See, since Trump once said sexist stuff, Melania is open game. That's the argument from some feminists who are looking for any excuse to smear the woman. What cowards they are. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Oh, well, the washed-up rapper has since deleted the tweet. I guess that makes Bow Wow a big meow-meow.  </pre>
