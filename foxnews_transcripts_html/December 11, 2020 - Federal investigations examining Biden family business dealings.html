BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm BretBaier. "BREAKING TONIGHT", President-elect Joe Biden's first reaction tothe latest news on federal investigations into his son Hunter's taxes andoverseas business dealings. Also, President Trump calls it the big one.Many legal experts are highly skeptical, but his supporters see it asperhaps the last best chance to change the results of last month'selection. Either way, the paperwork in the Texas case is before the U.S.Supreme Court tonight. We could have a decision from the court aboutwhether the justices will hear that case at any moment.But first we begin with the latest on the coronavirus vaccine. The WhiteHouse is putting serious pressure on the head of the Food and DrugAdministration to give its final approval tonight, so the process ofgetting the shots to Americans can begin.Let's begin with Kristin Fisher at the White House. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Bret. Well, even thoughthis vaccine has been developed in record time, this emergencyauthorization process still is not moving fast enough for President Trump.That is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.And today, President Trump compared the agency to a turtle.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (voice-over): President Trump made it very clear how he feels aboutthe FDA commissioner in a tweet Friday morning. He told Dr. Stephen Hahn,"Get the damn vaccines out now" and "stop playing games and start savinglives."Then, a few hours later, The Washington Post was first to report that WhiteHouse chief of staff Mark Meadows gave Dr. Hahn an ultimatum. Authorize thePfizer vaccine today or resign. Fox is told that report is not entirelytrue, while Dr. Hahn is describing it as an untrue representation of thephone call with the chief of staff.He claims he was simply encouraged to continue working expeditiously onauthorizing a vaccine as the daily death toll in the United Statescontinues to top three thousand.ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: At the end of the day,what the American people needs to know is the FDA has and will only makedecisions based on their independent judgment of science, evidence, and thelaw.FISHER: Today, President Trump also pressured the Supreme Court to hear thecase from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which now has the support ofthe House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and 125 other Republican membersof Congress.KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS: But it's not some new thing thatstate versus state lawsuits have to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's theonly place we can go, we have no other place to go.FISHER: Paxton and 18 other Republican attorneys general are asking theSupreme Court to temporarily block next week's Electoral Collegecertification in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Democrats say the president and his allies are trying to invalidatemillions of votes in four battlegrounds that Joe Biden won. And even someRepublicans like Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander have a problem with it.SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN): Texas is a big state, but I don't know exactlywhy it has a right to tell four other states how to run their elections.So, I'm having a hard time figuring out the basis for that lawsuit.FISHER: This morning, President Trump asked the Supreme Court justices toshow great courage and wisdom and save the USA. But in the same tweet, healso referenced a Biden administration that the president says, "will be ascandal-plagued mess for years to come."When asked if that statement should be interpreted as a concession theWhite House deputy press secretary said this.BRIAN MORGENSTERN, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: He is stilllitigating his case in the courts and looks forward to that process playingout. So, I wouldn't read too much into that or characterize it the way thatyou did.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER: Now, the Supreme Court is under no hard deadline to issue an orderon this Texas lawsuit. But presumably, the justices are going to want toact facts -- fast. Because remember, Bret, the Electoral College meets onMonday, just a few days away.BAIER: Kristin Fisher, live on the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you.Coming up shortly, Mike Tobin in Kalamazoo, Michigan where the actualPfizer vaccine shots, the stockpile is right now to start rolling out toyour town very shortly.Also, David Spunt wraps up our week-long series on the vaccine by lookingat how Operation Warp Speed really did live up to its name.Also, tonight, President-elect Joe Biden's first reaction to the latestnews on federal investigations into his son Hunter's taxes and businessdealings. We'll also show you how Attorney General William Barr may be insome hot water with President Trump over Barr's actions concerning thismatter.We have "FOX TEAM COVERAGE" tonight. Mike Emanuel tells us where theinvestigations are headed. First up though, Peter Doocy, who was asking thequestions today that prompted Joe Biden's reply. Peter joins us as he oftendoes, from Wilmington, Delaware. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. President-elect'sprepared remarks didn't have anything about the Hunter Biden investigationin them and there is no formal Q&A set up. So, when he was ready to leave,I used my outside voice inside the theater to get his attention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (voice-over): Fox News just got the first direct response from thepresident-elect about the federal investigation into his son's tax affairs.Did Hunter Biden commit a crime? Have you spoken to your son, Mr.President-elect?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm proud of my son.DOOCY: Biden's brother, Jim is caught up in a separate federalinvestigation concerning a rural hospital business he's linked to,according to POLITICO, which reports, Jim Biden's name has come up inquestions with witnesses.The president-elect doesn't tell many detailed stories about his siblings,but they were influential enough on his upbringing to be a major part ofhis pitch.BIDEN: It's all about ordinary people like my mom and dad, like my brotherand sisters -- my sister and my brothers who I was raised with.DOOCY: As the Biden Cabinet takes shape, the Congressional Asian PacificAmerican Congress is concerned, putting out a statement today, "For thefirst time in over two decades, we are facing the possibility that theremight not be a single AAPI Cabinet secretary in a presidentialadministration. Let us be clear: that outcome is unacceptable."That kind of pressure doesn't seem to register with Biden, who recentlyspoke about civil rights groups lobbying him.BIDEN: Look, it's each one of these group's jobs to push, push theirleaders to make sure there's greater diversity.DOOCY: And the president-elect himself is highlighting his hiring ofKatherine Tai to be U.S. trade representative.BIDEN: If confirmed, she'd be the first Asian American and the first womanof color to serve in this position.DOOCY: Today, Biden also officially introduced Susan Rice as director ofthe Domestic Policy Council, a job that doesn't require SenateConfirmation.SUSAN RICE, FORMER UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We are here toget hard stuff done.DOOCY: As Obama's national security adviser, Rice infamously blamed thedeadly Benghazi terror attack on a YouTube video. Today, nobody mentionedthat.BIDEN: And she knows that I'm really thrilled, she was willing to comeback, be at my side in the White House.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Right before Biden spoke, the transition team hosted a briefing viaZoom. Five reporters were called on for questions, zero asked about theHunter Biden investigation. Fox News has still never been selected to ask aquestion at one of those zoom briefings or at the more formal Q&A pressconferences during the transition. But as we saw today, he still hears ourquestions. Bret.BAIER: So, you're saying there's a chance. All right, Peter. We'll keeptrying, thanks.Also breaking tonight, we take a look at just how much was known concerningthe investigation into Hunter Biden before last month's presidentialelection. And the report raises questions for the president's attorneygeneral. There's also new information about exactly what is beinginvestigated.Senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel has specifics tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): Sure, we'll hear more about it. I think HunterBiden will have to stand on the merits of his case.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At atime when many lawmakers are concerned about China's influence on the nextadministration.SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): What other connections do they have into China?You know, we may only just have really been looking at the tip of theiceberg.EMANUEL: Former Hunter Biden business partner, Tony Bobulinski, claims hehad two face-to-face meetings with Joe Biden in 2017 after his time as vicepresident.Bobulinski says Joe Biden was trying to convince him to go into business asCEO of a venture with a Chinese energy company.TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER ASSOCIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN: Why at 10:38 on thenight of May 2nd, would Joe Biden take time out of his schedule to sit downwith me to have a discussion about his family and my family, and businessat a very high level?EMANUEL: The Wall Street Journal reports, Attorney General Bill Barr, knewabout the numerous investigations looking into Hunter Biden's business andfinancial dealings since at least the spring, and worked to keep the probesout of public view during the election.A spokeswoman for the attorney general declined to comment, Barr signaledin May, he wanted the criminal justice system to stay out of partisanpolitics.WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: It is critical that wehave an election where the American people are allowed to make a decision.We cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum-up criminalinvestigations of either candidate.EMANUEL: A key ally, President Trump says that was unfair.REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): A.G. Barr -- I mean, the excuse will be, hey, look,we didn't want to influence the election. Well, you know, what you did, youinfluenced the election by suppressing very important investigations.EMANUEL: A Biden campaign surrogate says the attorney general actedproperly.SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): He was following the rules of the Department ofJustice. Did he follow the rules? That's a good thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL: Some Republicans are already calling for a special counsel toinvestigate these Biden family business dealings, expressing concern thenext president's attorney general won't be able to do it fairly, andworried that U.S. attorneys digging into these matters could be replaced.Bret.BAIER: All right, Mike, thank you. More on this with the panel.Coming up this weekend, Tucker Carlson talks with former associate, TonyBobulinski. You can see that special coverage, Saturday, 5:00 p.m. Easternand Sunday night, 10:00 p.m. Eastern.Republican lawmakers are calling for a closer examination of Chineseinfluence on members of Congress. This comes ahead revelations of tiesbetween a California Democrat and a woman accused of being a Chinese spy.Correspondent Gillian Turner has tonight's update. Good evening, Gillian.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret.Democrat Eric Swalwell is under fire tonight for allegations that he mayhave been compromised by a person who is suspected of being a Chinese spy.Someone who is known to target politicians and may have been a honey trapplanted by Chinese officials.This incident is highlighting just how ubiquitous Chinese spying operationsinside the U.S. have become in recent years. There are potentiallythousands, thousands of operations currently underway.Take a listen to former CIA station Chief Dan Hoffman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN HOFFMAN, FORMER CHIEF OF STATION, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: If youthink about Chinese intelligence officers, they're operating in Washington,D.C. and at the consulates in San Francisco, in New York, and Chicago, andLos Angeles. We call the Trump administration for good reason, closeChina's consulate in Houston. They are, you know, ruthlessly focused onconducting espionage in this country.TURNER: Tonight, GOP Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, filed a complaintwith the House Ethics Committee, urging the panel to immediately open aninvestigation into the Swalwell matter.The threat from China is one that lawmakers say is real and growing moredangerous.REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL): Look, this is the tip of the iceberg at thispoint. That's been a year on the China task force, and it is in ouruniversities' students, its research institutions. We really need to get ahandle on this.TURNER: Swalwell himself is maintaining innocence. He insists theaccusations about his ties to alleged spy Christine Fang are a politicalhit job.JIM SCIUTTO, CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Are you concernedthat you shared any information with this person before you were notifiedby the FBI?REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Well, I know that I didn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER: Chinese recruiting of U.S. lawmakers is a story really came back tolight back in 2018, when POLITICO broke that the Chinese intelligenceservices have recruited a staffer who worked at of Dianne Feinstein'soffices based in California. Bret?BAIER: All right, Gillian, thank you.The U.S. Senate has now cinched up with the House to approve the finalversion of the defense policy bill. The vote was 84 to 13, well above thetwo-thirds threshold needed to override a potential and threatened veto byPresident Trump.It will now have to be sent to the White House to get signed or vetoed.We're told tonight it's not there yet. The COVID relief talks are stalled.Tonight, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, says Democrats are pushingfor state and local government rescue money, instead of funding for aiddistribution networks. The negotiations have really fallen apart in recentdays.The Senate has passed a one-week government funding bill to avoid apossible shut down of some government services at midnight tonight. TheHouse passed that measure on Wednesday.Stocks were mixed today. The Dow gained 47. The S&P 500 dropped five. TheNASDAQ lost 28. For the week, the Dow was off a bit, more than a halfpercentage point. The S&P 500 was down almost a full point, the NASDAQ losttwo-thirds.Up next, we'll take you live to the center of the coronavirus universeright now. The place where all of the vaccine is being stored, at least oneof them, and prepared for distribution.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 12 in Portland, as a gentrification protest that hasblockaded several city blocks continues despite police orders to shut thatdown.The street behind the blockade in the neighborhood of homes, coffee shops,restaurants, laced with booby traps, including homemade spike strips, pilesof rocks, and thick bands of plastic wrap stretched at neck height acrossthe roadway there.Fox Five in New York as prosecutors and lawyers for movie producer HarveyWeinstein agree to postpone efforts to send him to California to facesexual assault charges there.

Instead, officers will bring the toys and clothes directly tothose kids.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. Wewill be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Almost 107,000 people in this country were hospitalized as ofyesterday with the coronavirus. That's up at least 18 percent in the pasttwo weeks. Another 2,900 deaths were reported Thursday. The U.S. fatalitycount now stands near the 300,000 mark, globally. It's approaching 1.6million.A top coronavirus adviser to President-elect Joe Biden says there should beno Christmas parties this year. Michael Osterholm, also says Americans arefacing a COVID siege for weeks to come despite the progress on a vaccine.Speaking of that right now, the center of the coronavirus universe when itcomes to the vaccine is Kalamazoo, Michigan. That's where Pfizer's giantmanufacturing plant is, and it's ready to roll out the first batches ofthat vaccine to the American public.Senior correspondent Mike Tobin is there tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Behind the walls ofPfizer's massive facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan could be the beginning ofthe end, millions of doses of a vaccine for COVID-19. Once the FDA approvesthe emergency use authorization, shipments can begin in 24 hours.AZAR: We could see vaccinations beginning on Monday or Tuesday, dependingon when FDA gets everything signed.TOBIN: The vaccine must be kept super cold, almost negative 100 degreesFahrenheit, requiring a sophisticated cold storage chain. Each shipmentwill have GPS enabled thermal sensors to report location and quality ofeach shipment. Shipping giant's UPS and FedEx are in charge of getting thevaccine to their points of use.JIM MAYER, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE: We've informed all of ourdrivers across the country what's in those boxes and how important it isand so our goal is to have 100 percent accuracy in delivering those.TOBIN: By air and ground, the vaccine is headed to 636 distribution pointsacross the nation. Kits with syringes and saline for administering thevaccine have already arrived at places like Methodist Medical Center andParkland hospitals in Dallas.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If we receive that vaccine that morning, we'replanning to begin vaccinating that afternoon.TOBIN: Priority for the initial vaccines will go to health care workers andat-risk populations like people in nursing homes. As approvals are expectedfor vaccines produced by companies like Moderna and Johnson and Johnson aswell, the White House testing czar says hundreds of millions of doses willbecome available in December and January.ADM. BRETT GIROIR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: We arevery confident by the May, June, time period that any American who wants avaccine will have a vaccine available. So, this is going to be extremelyrapid.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: One of the concerns with distribution of the vaccine is a potentialfor theft. U.S. marshals will accompany some shipments, six states areenlisting the help of the National Guard. Colorado, Kansas and SouthCarolina to name a few are keeping cold storage locations secret forsecurity reasons. Bret, back to you.BAIER: Mike Tobin and Kalamazoo. Mike, thanks.The development of the COVID vaccine, several of them, really was warpspeed compared to other development efforts. In tonight's final segment ofour special look at the vaccine, we examine how it was done so quickly, howit was achieved, and whether this sets a new standard for American sciencein the future.Here is correspondent David Spunt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's called Operation WarpSpeed.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Within one year,Americans learned of a pandemic and began receiving a vaccine for thatpandemic.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And a little feeling of pressure?DR. PETER HOTEZ, DEAN, NATIONAL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE: I'm not a bigfan of the term, Operation Warp Speed because it gives the impression thatthe safety trials are being rushed. They're not.SPUNT: Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine developer with Baylor College of Medicinebegan tracking a vaccine 11 months ago.HOTEZ: My first response was we got this. We can do this. Because it wassimilar enough to all the research and development we had done for othercoronavirus vaccines.SPUNT: The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines tout efficacy rates of 95 and 94.1percent respectively.CRAIG SHIRLEY, HISTORIAN: I think honest historians will look back at thistime with astonishment.SPUNT: Historian Craig Shirley, says this moment is our industrialrevolution of the late 1800s.SHIRLEY: America has always led the world in the development of new ideason human rights and new ideas in technologies, new ideas on (INAUDIBLE)research.SPUNT: The record pace of the vaccine according to experts will no questionup the ante for future vaccine development. But next time, Dr. Hotez wantsto see better communication to keep the public informed and confident.HOTEZ: Too much of the communication's been left to the pharma CEOs, andthat communication's not been as strong as I would like. So, I think wehave to pick that up.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT: Expect the communication strategy to change when President-elect JoeBiden takes the oath of office next month behind me. He's appointed Dr.Anthony Fauci as his chief medical advisor on COVID-19, as millions ofAmericans become inoculated in the coming months. Bret.BAIER: David, thank you. Good job this week. Still ahead, our "WHATEVERHAPPENED TO" segment on a very explosive event. We'll explain.But up next, charges that the mainstream media and big tech conspired tobury the Hunter Biden investigation story before the election. We'll take alook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNSON: I think it's very outrageous that the fourth estate would chooseto ignore facts when they are uncovered by Republicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The mainstream media and social media both playing catch-up tonighton the Hunter Biden federal investigation. Those institutions are beingcalled out for what appeared to be a censorship campaign in the waning daysof the presidential campaign. Details now from Fox News media analyst andhost of Fox's "MEDIA BUZZ", Howard Kurtz.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST (voice-over): When The New York Postbroke the story about a Hunter Biden's laptop, many news outlets eitherignored or played down the allegations.NPR's managing editor even said, "We don't want to waste our time onstories that are not really stories." Others dismissed it as medley byMoscow.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rudy basically functioning as a Russian asset bypushing Russian disinformation.TIFFANY CROSS, HOST MSNBC: You have said this entire thing is so obviouslya Russian plot. It is to me, and I was never even ambassador to the Russianfederation.KURTZ: Fox News took flack for following up including with an ex-Bidenbusiness partner on an attempted deal in China. Bobulinski spoke at greatlength with Fox's Tucker Carlson about his alleged face-to-faceinteractions with Joe Biden. And when a reporter asked candidate Bidenabout the story --BIDEN: Another smear campaign right up your alley.KURTZ: The tone was far different than the saturation coverage afterallegations involving Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, or Jared Kushner.Now, the press is taking Hunter Biden's foreign deal making more seriouslyafter he confirmed in a Biden transition statement that preempted aninquiry by CNN that the Justice Department is investigating his taxes. ThePresident-elect son says he acted legally even after some history of unpaidtaxes.But even now the story getting very limited air time on MSNBC and CNN. Somenews organizations are being more aggressive. The New York Times saidtoday, this is a no-win situation for Joe Biden that could range from adistraction to legally perilous.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: One important distinction to question during the campaign waswhether Joe Biden was involved in his son's business dealings. And The WallStreet Journal and Fox's News division found no evidence of that. But asthe probe intensifies, the media's challenge is to hold the Biden family tothe same journalist standard as with President Trump and his children.Bret?BAIER: We'll see. Howie, thanks.In tonight's "Whatever Happened To" segment, the New Zealand island volcanoeruption that happened a year ago, but, believe it or not, the effects arestill being felt tonight. Here is senior foreign affairs correspondent AmyKellogg.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)MATT UREY, SURVIVOR: I remember every single detail. I remember theburning, the blackness, the pain.AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Matt and LaurenUrey had been on a Honeymoon cruise when they took an excursion to NewZealand's White Island. They were among those horribly burned when thevolcano erupted a year ago this week. Lauren can't perform her labtechnician job anymore because her right hand has lost mobility. Matt hasburns over more than half-his-body.M. UREY: As tragic as this event was, we are 100 percent one of theluckiest -- two of the luckiest people on that island. We still have eachother.KELLOGG: Twenty-two people died from their injuries, remembered in a solemnceremony on Wednesday. The government safety regulator has laid charges on13 entities, including tour operators and the National GeologicalMonitoring Center, charging they should have known the danger given theseismic activity ahead of the eruption. Paul and Mary Singh from Georgiadied, leaving behind a 12-year-old and seven-year-old twins. Their familyand the Ureys are suing Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines for failing todiscourage or cancel the excursion to White Island, as the Ureys continueto search for silver lings.LAUREN UREY, SURVIVOR: And truly, as cheesy as this may sound, he and Ihave grown closer together because of this. Our love for each other, Ididn't think it could get like any stronger. But each day I fall more andmore in love with him, and he is truly my best friend.(END VIDEO TAPE)KELLOGG: And New Zealand's prime minister had a message this week to thoselost and grieving the tragedy on White Island, saying you are foreverlinked to this place and our nation, and we will hold you close. Bret?BAIER: Amy, thank you.We have breaking news right now out of the U.S. Supreme Court. The SupremeCourt has rejected the Texas led effort to toss out election results infour key states that Joe Biden won. Again, that is a rejection to take upthis case. The Supreme Court just issuing that statement. This was, asPresident Trump called it, the big one, the case that was going to wrap ineverything Trump supporters holding out hope that this could be the casethat the Supreme Court would take on its merits and actually argue beforethe court. That is not happening.FOX News chief legal correspondent, anchor of FOX NEWS AT NIGHT ShannonBream tells us what's the decision by the justices. Good evening, Shannon.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, Bret. We just have a coupleof paragraphs, and this is how they spell it out. They say "The state ofTexas' motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, this state-by-statecontroversy they wanted to bring to the court directly, it says it's deniedfor lack of standing. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizableinterest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections,saying Texas was claiming here the way that these four other statesconducted their elections and changed things at the last minute, they --Texas accused these states of exploiting the pandemic to change things likewitness verification, signatures, voter I.D., those kinds of things. Thecourt here basically is saying they don't have a cognizable interest, alegal challenge that we can weigh in on here.There's a statement by Justice Alito. Justice Thomas joins him in this andsays in my view we do not have the discretion to deny the filing of a billof complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. So veryfew of those cases that go straight to the Supreme Court, but state versusstate is one of those things that happen there. They say they grant themotion to file the bill of complaint but wouldn't grant other relief anddon't express their views on other issues.Essentially what it means here for Texas is that they don't get to moveforward. This case is done. You are don't have enough. You would haveneeded five justices to move this thing forward. So, Texas' last ditcheffort to go after those four states and nullify, which essentially wouldhave been I think about 39 million votes of other people in those fourother states, it's not going to happen. The states et all, said Texas hasno right to do it. And for now, the Supreme Court says this is the end.That case is going nowhere. We're not going to get involved. And Texasessentially does not have what they need here, which is a cognizableinterest. And they have a lack of standing. So, the case is done. This isit, Bret.BAIER: That was the big one.Let's bring in Jonathan Turley, professor at George Washington UniversityLaw School. Shannon, stand by, if you would. Jonathan, we talked earlierthis week about the Pennsylvania case that the Supreme Court did not takeup and decided to not move forward, to essentially hear that case,forecasting, perhaps, that they really were not in this on these cases.However, how it's written does not foreclose any other pending or futureelection case coming before them. There are a few more irons in the fire.But the electors vote on the 14th.JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Right. And so, we're righton the eve of that vote. This is very similar to what happened in thePennsylvania case. The White House was only able -- Texas was only able tosecure two justices. And that was primarily on technical grounds, that theyhad to really hear this case, not because of the merits but because of howit came before the court. Obviously, the other justices, seven of them,disagreed even on that point.And so, this is as dead as Dillinger. And the question is, can these otherremaining cases still have a chance to make a difference? Tonight, we alsohad word out of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that they will review achallenge in that state. But that is just one state. And we are now notonly running out of runway, we are running out of time.BAIER: Yes. Shannon, bring you back into this conversation as well. Runningout of time, but also, as Jonathan points out, you need to have multiplestates for the president to essentially take those electoral votes awayfrom Joe Biden, and they are going to vote on Monday, they are supposed to.BREAM: And that was the whole goal with Texas, going after big ones thatwould have really helped the president, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania,and Wisconsin. So, it was very targeted. It was very smart to go afterthose states, which all of those electoral votes, had they flipped toPresident Trump obviously would have changed everything.So now we do have these state level challenges. There is one in Georgiathat was filed in state court that folks think has some life to it. But,again, that takes a lot of time to proceed through the state court system.Wisconsin Supreme Court has announced that they are going to hear -- theyare skipping the appellate level there in Wisconsin. They will actuallyhear oral arguments tomorrow, noon local time there in Milwaukee, to moveforward with a case in Wisconsin. So those are two critical, key states.But as for Texas trying to go after four states at once, that math is notgoing to happen because this case, as Professor Turley has said, this isthe dead end for it. So now we're left with these collection of statecases. They're also running out of time and out of landing space, asProfessor Turley has said, but they are still active.BAIER: Yes, let's bring Kristin Fisher at the White House. Kristin, thepresident had put a lot of eggs in this Texas basket. He talked about it anumber of times, including at a Christmas party at the White House, sayingthis was the big one. Your thoughts about what is going to be the reactionout of the White House? He has tried the state legislatures. It has notworked. The cases seemed to have stopped. There's a few more, as wementioned, but this was one that he talked about a lot.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, as you just said, this is theone that he called the big one. Bret, I'm really watching the president'sTwitter feed right now, because he has tweeted at least twice today aboutthis case, really putting a lot of pressure on the Supreme Court, and,perhaps, particularly, those three Supreme Court justices that he appointedto the high court. He said, he tweeted to them today, to do the rightthing, to have courage, have wisdom. He even told them to save the UnitedStates of America.So President Trump has really made it no secret that he thought the SupremeCourt should take up this case, but now this is definitely another legalblow for the president, his legal team, his campaign, and his effort tooverturn the outcome of this election. And now you have the ElectoralCollege meeting on Monday.But, Bret, it really remains to be seen how much further President Trumpintends to go, because, as of today, he has tweeted multiple times aboutthis. So, we will see. But as of now, no response officially from the WhiteHouse, the president, or his legal team just yet. But we are watching it,Bret.BAIER: Yes. And obviously the politics of all this, as the Georgia runoffs,there's still the Senate control hanging in the balance on January 5th, andhow that plays, all of this, in that is very important.Last word, Jonathan Turley, on this. It seemed like these legal challenges,some of them constructed in a way that the judges, some of the judges atleast when they looked at them said I need more meat on the bone, as far asevidence that the votes were stolen or fraudulent.TURLEY: That's right. This Wisconsin appeal to the Supreme Court, which isskipping an appellate stage, does look at these concrete allegations, about221,000 ballots that are being challenged in two largely Democraticcounties. But with this decision it's hard to see if that was successfulthat it would make any difference, obviously, with the balloting coming.Part of the problem that I think that we are seeing is that many of thesecases are being thrown out on standing or procedural grounds. And there area lot of voters out there who believe that this election was not fairlydone. And they don't feel like the evidence has been scrutinized. So, Ithink the Supreme Court decision is going to fuel that objection, becausethis was made as a threshold procedural issue. Texas simply cannot sue toget other states to change their view of their own laws or practices.BAIER: Jonathan, the fact that they are not even moving forward to hear itsuggests that, does it not, that the Supreme Court is kind of laying down amarker, that you have to get over this certain point in order not just onstanding for Texas but on the Pennsylvania case as well?TURLEY: That's right. These were not close calls for the Supreme Court. ThePennsylvania case didn't have a single dissenting justice. It was dismissedhad 40 minutes after that last brief was filed.So, these are really troubling developments for the Trump legal team. Theyhave never if he would terra firma in any of these cases. They have neverbeen able to really move this litigation forward. But this is a huge blow,because the president obviously has been talking about it. There are sixconservatives on the Supreme Court, three Trump appointees. And they arenot -- they don't have animus towards the president. A majority, obviously,does not have that animus, the Republican appointees. Three of them wereappointed by him. They just don't see the law here. They don't see thecredible legal argument. And that's why this came out the way it did.BAIER: OK, stand by, if you would. Let's bring in our panel early. CharlesHurt is opinion editor for "The Washington Times," Jeff Mason, White Housecorrespondent for "Reuters," and Bill McGurn, columnist for "The WallStreet Journal,"Jeff, I want to start with you. Kristin mentioned it. We are obviouslywatching this Twitter feed very closely for reaction. You cover the WhiteHouse every day. You've heard the president talk about this election thathe won and saying, again, that this was the big one, the Texas lawsuit.It's not moving forward. Where do you think the president goes from here?JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: Well, it's a significantblow, for sure. And he did not win the election. It's important to clarifythat, but he has been fighting to overturn the election. And this was -- hehad put a lot of hope in this, and I think Kristin was right to emphasizethe fact that not only has he been putting legal resources into this, buthe has been verbally pressing the justices via Twitter and via his publicremarks to help him out.And three of the justices on the Supreme Court, it's also worth noting,have been appointed and nominated, I should say, and confirmed via thisWhite House and from President Trump. And I think he clearly thought thatmaybe that was going to help him, and it hasn't.BAIER: Yes. Charlie, there were 18 state attorneys general, 126 in the end,Republican House members who signed on to this effort with amicus briefs tothe court. That did not sway these justices.CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, "WASHINGTON TIMES": Yes, a couple things. Onething that I think is very important is that it cuts both ways. This alsoputs a lie to the charges that a lot of Democrats levied against PresidentTrump that he was trying to put people on the court who were just going torubber stamp whatever he wanted. And it proves that President Trump, whenhe selected the people that he put on the Supreme Court, he selected peoplewho were independent-minded and willing to look at things from a legalstandpoint and not from a political standpoint. So, I think that's a reallyimportant thing to remember at this moment.Certainly, this case was the best, biggest case that the president washolding out hope for. And it ends this legal wrangling of this case. But itdoesn't end the political wrangling of this case. And the president stillhas a lot of political -- a lot of political room, and he will continue tomake the argument that there were real problems with this election. Thepandemic -- exploiting the pandemic to start this mass mail-in votingdrive, which raises lots of concerns, and I think probably caused a lotmore opportunities for fraud in the election than in a regular election.All of that is going to continue. And we're going -- and that's a veryhealthy, important political fight to have. It's just that that is nowgoing to be in the political realm as opposed to the legal realm.BAIER: Right. I guess the question is where is the judge that said, yes, Iagree that all of this happened and, yes, I'm siding with the Trumpcampaign on everything that they're laying out here? He the legal battlesmet and end when they made it up to the top. Obviously, he's got, as wementioned, a few irons in the fire, but the Supreme Court has not taken upany of this as of yet.Bill McGurn, you are a former speech writer. You've -- if you're looking atthe situation now, and you're President Trump ahead of this January 20thinauguration that is moving forward, the electors meet on Monday, what areyou doing? And how are you phrasing this for, perhaps, the good of thecountry, even though a lot of your supporters believe they were somehowgypped?BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We don't know what President Trump isgoing to do. He has earlier suggested if the Electoral College went againsthim, he would accept that. So, the question is, is that what he is going todo? Or is he going to continue to complain that the election was stolen?Look, from the beginning, I didn't dismiss the allegations ofimproprieties. I think things like mail-in voting were a problem. I thinkthat states like Pennsylvania changing their ballot deadlines, I believeunconstitutionally, because it's supposed to be by the legislature, theyshould have been taken seriously and examined. But I also had believed fromthe beginning it wasn't going to affect the outcome, and that's what wehave now.And it is telling that a Supreme Court with six pretty orthodoxconservative justices on it didn't even take the case. You could make anargument maybe they should have taken the case and dismissed it forstanding, but the fact that they felt comfortable not doing that I thinktells you that they really didn't see any merits to the case.Charlie was right about these justices. One of the big differences, Ibelieve, between the more liberal and more conservative justices is that onthe conservative side, we take process arguments very, very seriously. Wedon't just go to what outcome we want and then find the reasoning. And Ithink this was dispositive for the justices in not taking this case.BAIER: I want to go back to Shannon Bream for a second. Shannon, we talkedabout the Pennsylvania case that was really dismissed -- wasn't taken up bythe Supreme Court. There was one element of Pennsylvania that was reallynever resolved, and that was the delay of the ballots after receipt, afterElection Day that Justice Alito wanted separated and counted separately. Weweren't sure whether all of the places actually did that. Where does thatstand tonight? Is that done?BREAM: As far as we know, that's still sitting at the Supreme Court. Thathas had filings from both sides. You rightly note that order that came outfrom Justice Alito a few weeks back after the election, because that casewas filed before the election because already the secretary of thecommonwealth there had said we're going to accept ballots that come inafter 8:00 on election night through Friday. She did that unilaterallywithout the state legislature, which the Constitution says they are theones to make the decision.Well, the state Supreme Court there in Pennsylvania actually signed off onwhat she did. They upheld that. So, it went to the Supreme Court. Along theway, they were supposed to be separating those ballots, keeping them secureand not counting them. Well, word got to Justice Alito that that wasn'thappening, and he sent out a blistering order, like, hey, we expect youguys to respect this while we still have not ruled on the merits of this.Now, a lot of folks think the Supreme Court again will eventually close upthat case and not get involved because there's probably not enough of ahigh enough number of ballots that fall into that category to actuallyaffect the outcome, the overall outcome in Pennsylvania. But it's stillsitting there at the Supreme Court at this hour.BAIER: Charlie, to your point, there are issues here that have to beresolved before the next election. This is one of them, mail-in ballots andhow they are dealt with. But whether there is enough to overturn enoughelectoral votes before Monday, boy, it's going by the wayside now.HURT: Without a doubt. The window has been closing for weeks now,obviously. And it's a tall order, without any doubt. But I do think it'sinteresting that the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on standing.That doesn't address the merits, necessarily. And, the other issue that Ithink you just brought up with Shannon about the way in which some of thesealterations were made to the different state elections, and the federalgovernment, the Supreme Court does have an interest in those cases wherestates changed the rules of the election in a way that disenfranchisescertain voters without disenfranchising other voters, and it becomes amatter of fairness, and whether or not the legislature itself made thosechanges or were those changes made my fiat, by governors, or by otheractors in the state government.And those are all very important issues. And as you point out, I think itis fertile ground for President Trump and Republicans to continue thisfight no matter what happens in the next couple of weeks.BAIER: Jonathan Turley, is it, though, is it, when you look at the good ofthe republic, where we are, you have Republican governors signingscertification. Doug Ducey in Arizona, a Trump ally, getting a lot of heat.Obviously, Brian Kemp in Georgia, the Republican governor taking a lot ofincoming down there, certifying that election after several recounts inGeorgia. At what point is -- there aren't that many avenues as you talkedabout. Your thoughts?TURLEY: Well, first of all, some of these officials have been treatedreally quite poorly and unfairly. They are trying to do their job. And theyhave been upheld by judges and now justices, including Republicanappointees. I think people need to understand that the political and legalconvergence here is obvious, that the president could well accept theresults, obviously, of the Electoral Colleges, as he said he would, andstill say that he believed that the election was stolen.Part of the problem is that many of these have been threshold decisions,like tonight, that you simply don't have the standing to bring the case.That's not going to relieve the concerns of millions of Americans who feltthat the election was unfair. And we're going to see it playing out in thefuture regardless of what happens. It seems exceptionally unlikely that anychange in this election is going to unfold in the next few days. There havebeen discussions of having a fight in Congress and getting theselegislatures to stop their certification. All of that is even less likelythan this case, which was exceptionally unlikely to succeed.But I think we should also keep in mind the heavy burden here. Judges didacknowledge that be they were legal orders. They did find votes that werenot counted. They did find problems in how this was done. The biggestproblem other than standing was the relief being sought. Some of thejudges, including the one in Pennsylvania, said these voters make alegitimate claim their vote should have been counted. I just can't get fromthere to the point of saying my relief will be not to count millions ofother votes. And that has been one of the biggest problems that they havefaced.The other problem has been something called laches, which is basicallysaying you waited too long, that as many of the complaints that are raisedin this last effort in front of the Supreme Court involved changes thatoccurred many months ago. And a lot of these judges have said, why now? Whyare you bringing this to us now after the election has occurred?BAIER: Jeff Mason, just trying to get into the mind of the president as helooks at this result. You have the electors voting on Monday. You haveJanuary 6th, accepted in the House and the Senate, the official, official,and then obviously January 20th. The word was that he's going to announce areelection bid possibly on Inauguration Day or somewhere around it. Do wehave any more granular details about next plans?MASON: I think they're still in flux, Bret. You laid it out well in termsof those dates, but I don't think, despite how big of a blow this will beand is to the president, that that means he is going to give up. And Ithink that's true with the Electoral College vote on Monday as well. He didsay he would leave the White House if the Electoral College votes forBiden, but he did not say he would concede. And there is a difference.So I think he will continue to keep up this challenge. As far as whether ornot he announces a reelection bid, I think they're still sort of figuringthat plan out. And it wouldn't surprise me. As someone who has coveredPresident Trump for four years, I think that he will certainly not leavethis White House saying that he feels like he lost -- that he lost theelection, and instead he'll say it was rigged and that he is going to wantto come back. But that decision hasn't been made, to my knowledge yet, andthat's is something that we will be watching closely.BAIER: Bill McGurn, for Trump supporters, obviously this is a majordisappointment. But they have seen several major disappointments. One thatthey didn't see the Durham investigation come to fruition before theelection. They didn't see it delivered. Now they're finding out moreinformation about Hunter Biden and all that we covered here ahead of theelection. However, it wasn't picked up by a lot of the media before theelection, and now there are questions about why the investigation didn'tmove forward before the election.So, where do you think that all stands as you get ready for this nextadministration, starting with an investigation of the president-elect'sson?MCGURN: I feel sorry for the poor soul who is named A.G., because that'sgoing to be a challenge, a Biden Justice Department investigating JoeBiden's son. That's a real problem for people going ahead. So we'll see howJoe Biden handles it.I hope it means that he'll finally be asked serious questions. Youmentioned earlier, this is not just people that missed the story. This waspeople that deliberately turned their backs on the story. We had, I think,50 will national security officials, former officials say this was Russiandisinformation. "The Post" ran their story and then it was suppressed onTwitter.I'm hoping some of them come around, because one of the reasons they do it-- Joe Biden just this week avoided a question, they stepped in front ofthe cameras and prevented her from having to answer a question aboutHunter. One reason they can do that is because they know the rest of thepress corps won't follow up. They'll let them get away with it. So we'llsee if that's going to be a luxury Joe Biden enjoys once he's sworn in.BAIER: Charlie, we had the transition team put out the statement of HunterBiden about acknowledging this federal investigation on transitionpaperwork. And, yet, there were zero questions besides Peter Doocy yellingfrom afar to Joe Biden today.HURT: Yes, that's got to be historic first. And all of the questions thatwe are talking -- the legal questions we are talking about today about whathappened during the election, none of that even touches on these veryimportant issues that you're talking about here, which is the months andmonths before the election, in terms of whether or not this was a free andfair election, it's kind of hard to, when you look at the behavior of themedia and the way they treated a lot of these stories, it's pretty hard tosay that the whole system was made for a free and fair election.One final point that I think is also important is, people talk aboutPresident Trump, whether President Trump will concede or not or whether hewill continue to claim that the election was stolen from him. And peoplegrasp their pearls and get all upset about it, and they say that it's badfor democracy. I could not disagree more. I think it's a very healthydebate. And if you look around and you listen to some of these affidavits,read some of the affidavits and listen to some of the accusations that havebeen made against election officials in these states, it's clear we have avery big problem.And granted it's probably not a problem that just started this time. We'vehad a problem for a long time with these elections. And for every vote,every illegal vote that gets counted, that disenfranchises another votersomewhere else who had a legal right to vote. And so I totally disagreethat somehow this is somehow a bad thing for our country, debate for ourcountry to be having. President Trump should be making this argument. Heshould be making it forcefully. And we should make real changes to the waywe do elections in response to this debate.BAIER: OK, Jonathan Turley, I just want to turn back and hear your thoughtsabout the Hunter Biden investigation and the challenges for the incomingA.G., whoever that may be. And obviously we don't have that will person'sname. We heard Doug Jones, former Alabama senator, was possibly one of thepeople, Merrick Garland, who was not put on the Supreme Court because ofthe Senate action. Your thoughts about the challenge there as this federalinvestigation plays out?TURLEY: Well, I think either Jones or Garland would be a wonderful choice.They bring stability. I think Sally Yates would actually make the case thatTrump is looking for for a self-pardon. That could trigger a self-pardon,at least an excuse for one.I had lunch with Bill Barr yesterday. And with all of the drama swirlingaround him, he remains the only immovable object in this swirling universe.He is quite resolute and confident about his position. I think history willbe very kind to him. I think it will vindicate the actions that he hastaken. It's notable there was no leak about the Durham special counsel.There is no leak about the Hunter Biden investigation. He did exactly --BAIER: But it also didn't come to fruition.TURLEY: Well, we now have an investigation, though, that's going forward,and he thus far has kept it out of the news.BAIER: Yes. Jonathan, thank you. Everyone, thank you, breaking newstonight.Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
