NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, Martha, thank you very much.Here's what we know right now. Tiger Woods is in the hospital. He's been inthe hospital for the better part of four-and-a-half-hours after a seriousrollover crash in Rancho Palos Verdes, this according to the Los AngelesSheriff's Department.We are going to be hearing more from that department very shortly. We aretold that Woods was the sole occupant in this SUV identified it as aGenesis GV80. It was traveling north on Hawthorne Boulevard at BlackhorseRoad, when he crashed just after 7:00 a.m. local time, 10:00 a.m. Easterntime.The vehicle, as you can see, sustained a great deal of damage. Woods had tobe taken out through the front windshield. No jaws of life were used. Therewas some confusion about that. But we just heard again that no jaws of lifeused. He was immediately taken to the hospital, where surgery is ongoing.Again, depending on the reports right now, we know, at the very least, he'sgot multiple leg injuries, that he's currently in surgery, and his managersays: "We thank you for respecting his privacy and support."This has gotten, obviously, a great deal of international attention here,given who we are talking about. Again, I should stress that Woods was thesole occupant in this vehicle. We just heard from a police official talkingto our own Martha MacCallum that a witness to this event, a neighbor, hadalerted police to this accident, not knowing at the time that it involvedTiger Woods himself.Trace Gallagher has been following all of his very closely, knows the areawell.Trace, what can you tell us?Trace Gallagher, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we -- that car, by the way,we can start with that, Neil.This Genesis SUV was on loan from the Riviera Country Club, where Tigerappeared at the golf tournament this weekend. He did not play at the golftournament because he's recovering from a recent back surgery.Breaking right now, Neil, The L.A. Times reporting that police sources aretelling them that Tiger Woods was driving this car northbound on HawthorneBoulevard coming out of Rancho Palos Verdes going toward the Rolling HillEstates and apparently was at a high rate of speed, their sources sayingthat Tiger Woods lost control of the vehicle before he got to that median.We have seen many times the pictures of the median where the sign, theRolling Hills Estate sign, was actually taken out, and that investigatorssaying the car rolled a few times before ending up where you see it rightthere now.Remember, there's a picture about maybe 50 yards down the road of thelicense plate. The license plate fell off. There is fluid from the car allover the road, an indicator that, when he hit that median, that, in fact,it did severe damage to the undercarriage of the vehicle, and then itrolled.And very luckily he did not hit some of these nearby telephone poles,though, he did as you can see, take out several small trees. There's beensome clarification, Neil. You pointed to it. There was no jaws of lifesystem used to pull Tiger Woods outside of the car.In fact, we're being told by the fire department, which has just released astatement -- quoting here -- "Because of the situation" -- it appears TigerWoods, they're saying, was conscious -- quoting -- "Because of thesituation and the way that you found the vehicle, he wasn't able to openthe door," meaning Tiger, "and come out."This is from the L.A. County Fire Department spokesman Henry Narvaez, whosays -- quote -- "We extricated him. We helped assist him out of thevehicle. In other words, Tiger couldn't get out on his own. So they went inand they actually pulled him out from the windshield and that he wasconscious during this time.We do not know if he was taken by stretcher to the ambulance. We do believehe was taken to UCLA Harbor Medical Center, where he was undergoing surgeryfor leg wounds.Now, Neil, it's fairly unclear right now as to his condition. But sourcesare also telling The Times that he is listed right now in seriouscondition. And we do not know if, in fact, the surgery has yet beencompleted. We do know that Tiger Woods was kind of playing around, he waschipping and putting and playing golf with the basketball player DwyaneWade, the actor/comedian David Spade.Both of them tweeted in the past 24 hours talking about how much fun theyhad, what good spirits Tiger was in, and his whole mental state, saying itwas quite good, and they joked around and had a great time out with TigerWoods.If you lifted this shot out, Neil, and you looked just over the hill,because there's been some good confusion as to where he was going, justover the hill is the Palos Verdes Country Club. It's a beautiful golfcourse. And it's unclear if that's where he was going, but just to kind ofgive you some context about where this happened in relation to the PalosVerdes Country Club, it literally, as you jump out from the helicoptershot, it's just over the hill.And to give you more context of the area, it's about five or six miles fromwhere I live, and you come down this road, Hawthorne Boulevard, and you'recoming down a hill, and you first make this gradual right-hand turn, andthen you make this left-hand turn back.At a high rate of speed, it's dangerous. In that time frame, 7:00 in themorning, you have also got cars from the neighboring subdivisions that arekind of moving on to the road there, Neil. Again, they're saying this was asingle car crash, no other cars involved.But there's reporting now that another car witnessed, stopped, trying toeither call in or help Tiger, and that he was actually struck in a minorcar accident by another car coming down the hill. So, it gives you an ideathat, when you come around some of these corners, they're a little bitblind, they're a little bit steep.And when we say Tiger was at a high rate of speed, that kind of happensnaturally. You're coming down these hills, and it tends to be -- that's agreat picture right there. And if you look to the right, you would see theRolling Hill -- I mean, the Palos Verdes Country Club.But that gives you an idea. You go up on that hill, and you're up. I mean,the spectacular views you see from Catalina Island all the way up to Malibuand further north, it gives you an idea of how high that area is, all thecliffs on the oceanside. He was coming away from the cliffs and then goingnorth.There's the Palos Verdes Golf Club that we talked about, Neil, Tiger comingdown that road at a high rate of speed, making that right-hand turn, andthen that left-hand turn. And, apparently, right before he got to thatmedian, he lost control, he hit the sign, and then he rolled at least acouple of times, ended up on the embankment and was conscious.And when the fire department got there, they said he couldn't get out onhis own. So they helped him get out. And they brought him to the hospital.Breaking news as it comes in -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Do we know, Trace, where he was going? I know he was at a golfevent. Do you know where he was headed from, from that event?GALLAGHER:  It's unclear.But you can see these pictures as they kind of zoom out here. They keepshowing the golf clubs. Don't know if that's an indication he was going toanother golf club. He was in town a couple of days because he was shootinga photo shoot and some interviews with Golf magazine, played golf, as Isaid -- not played golf, but was along as David Spade and Dwyane Wadeplayed some golf. They had a great time.He wasn't playing, Neil, because he just had back surgery. He was very muchhoping that in the first week of April at the Masters that he might be ableto kind of get ready. His back was feeling good, and he might be able toget ready. A lot of experts say probably a long shot. And that's why he waskind of out here, more promotional than actually playing.As for where he was going this morning, we don't know. But Tiger Woodsknows this area, Neil. He's been out here many, many times. He grew up inOrange County, which is 15 miles to the south, grew up in Orange County.He spent a great deal of time playing all these golf courses as a junior inSouthern California. So he knows the area. He knows the roads. He knows alot about this part of Southern California. And, look, you talk about ahigh rate of speed coming down the hill, it happens to everybody.When you're coming off these hills, and you're coming down, and you havethese winding roads, and it tends to be -- it's -- it can be a bit of apickle if you're not watching your speed coming down, Neil.CAVUTO:  Trace, thank you very much, my friend. Any other updates, pleasepass them along.Trace following this development, knows it well, lives only a few milesfrom the affected area.We should say that all we know about Tiger Woods' condition is, it's beendescribed as moderate to critical. He's at Harbor UCLA Medical Center.That's where you will find our Matt Finn.Matt, what can you tell us?MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, right now, obviously, there is agrowing media here and people driving by.But, of course, we are in the middle of this pandemic. So there is alsovery heavy security here. And there are also a lot of people spaced out,standing outside of this hospital in masks.A short while ago, a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Departmenttold me that these are visitors and family who are standing outside of thishospital in masks, abiding by all the precautions at a health carefacility.This hospital itself is not far from the location of the incident thatTrace has been reporting on. If you look at a map, it's perhaps one of theclosest hospitals or health care facilities that emergency officials andhealth care officials could have got Tiger Woods to.Golf magazine reporting that this is where Tiger Woods was brought. Wedon't have that confirmed right now on site. But there is a growing senseof awareness of who might be inside of this hospital, as there always iswhen a celebrity or a high-profile name is brought to a hospital -- Neil. CAVUTO:  Do you know -- I mean, obviously, the Sheriff's Department isexpected to give an update, maybe a full-blown presser, on this.But with the multiple leg fractures possible, that they have hinted of anyother issues that have come up, but anything like that?FINN:  No, you know, Neil, I don't have anything on Tiger Woods' conditionright now.And, of course, the officials that we spoke to this hospital are not evenconfirming that he's here, of course, abiding by all the regular HIPAArequirements.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, my friend very, very much.I want to go to Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider right now, California PacificMedical Center internal medicine physician.Doctor, thank you for taking the time. Obviously, they want to check a lotwhen they have got a patient coming in who is in a serious accident likethis. You're there, then, Doctor, what do you look for?DR. SHOSHANA UNGERLEIDER, CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER:  Well, Neil,that's a great question.Based on the images, this appears to be a very, very serious accident. I,myself, am an internal medicine physician. So I'm often not taking care oftraumas. But, typically, what happens when someone is brought in from anaccident like this is, they enter through the emergency department, they'rethoroughly evaluated by the emergency department team. Potentially, traumasurgeons are also on staff.And, basically, you're sort of assessing the extent of the damage, lookingat things like whether the person is conscious, their vital signs, are theyable to breathe on their own, and then determining immediately whether ornot this person, of course, needs something like intubation to help them --a tube down the windpipe to help them breathe.It's not clear at all exactly what happened in Mr. Woods' case. And thenalso evaluating the extent of the injuries and whether someone needs urgentor emergent, in this case, surgery, which it sounds as though Mr. Woods isstill in surgery. And, of course, we're all hoping for the best and sendingMr. Woods and his family are our thoughts.CAVUTO:  Yes, obviously. Doctor, thank you for that.As someone who looks at other risks that are less obvious, like internalbleeding and all of that sort of thing, and you look very, very carefullyfor that, given the fact that the vehicle he was in, this Genesis SUV, andit's -- it was tumbling a number of times before it came to a stop, and hewas extricated a little later, that involves, clearly, a lot of brokenbones, but a lot of other potential problems.What are you ascertaining or trying to sort of ascertain? Some might beobvious, like broken bones, others a little less so.UNGERLEIDER:  Yes, well, you're sort of looking emergently, right, at thewhole picture, right? So, it does tell you a little bit as to whether ornot the person is awake, responsive, breathing on their own.That sort of tells you sort of what's going on from a neurologicperspective. And then, from there, you're evaluating very quickly, based onlaboratory evidence and imaging, if that's available, how to best proceed.What we do know is that Mr. Woods is 45 years old, has had multipleinjuries and back surgeries in his long sports career.CAVUTO:  Right.UNGERLEIDER:  But my understanding is that he's otherwise healthy. And so,again, hoping the surgery goes well, he has a swift recovery, we have noreason to think that he would be high risk from a surgical perspective forother reasons.CAVUTO:  Doctor, thank you so much. Hopefully, everything works out here.And I had forgotten, as you said, about the back surgery that he had andhow vulnerable that was and why had virtually shelved him from playing inthe Masters again this year, or could have.Again, for those of you just joining us right now, Tiger Woods had been inCalifornia for a video shoot, attended the PGA Tour's Genesis Internationalover the weekend, this, of course, less than a year after undergoing backsurgery.He's had these problems back and forth for a number of years. Right now, itlooked like it was on the mend, certainly in 2019, when he won the Masters,bedeviling him again. Hopefully, it's not been complicated by this, but, atthe very least, it has been extended by this.Bill Melugin joins us right now of KTTV investigative reporter.Bill, thank you for taking the time. What can you tell us?BILL MELUGIN, KTTV INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER:  Hi, Neil.Just got off the phone with a Sheriff's Department store who told me thatTiger Woods was conscious and was talking to deputies when they got onscene of that crash. So, that's obviously a good sign.The same source also told me that, as it stands right now with theirinvestigation, there is nothing -- quote -- "salacious" that appears tohave happened with this crash. I know there's a lot of online speculation,given his history, that there was potentially drinking involved or anythinglike that.But the Sheriff's Department is pumping the brakes on that, telling methat, as it stands right now, this is just an investigation for a reallybad crash, a rollover, went off an embankment, rolled over.And the extent of the injuries appears to -- what we have been told is hislegs. Obviously, his agent put that statement out, but that he wasconscious and was talking to deputies when they first got on scene. Sothat's obviously great news to hear that.So, obviously, look, there's going to be toxicology results that are goingto come back in the future. That remains to be seen there, but as it standsright now with the investigation, nothing salacious, according to mysource.CAVUTO:  And we should stress that, I'm glad you did, because that's alwaysout there. In 2017, as you know, he was arrested on suspicion of drivingunder the influence of drugs or alcohol in Florida, after he was seenpassed out in his car back in 2009. He pled guilty to reckless driving.So, this sort of thing has popped up in the past. Doesn't look like it hasanything to do here. I only put that in context, as you did, Bill.But do we know -- if he was talking, all of that is very positive. Theydidn't have to use the jaws of life to extricate him, I think they said,from the windshield. But how much help did he need? I mean, to hear that hewas conversing with them, that's all very promising. But some of theseother reports that I can't validate are talking about injuries that gobeyond broken bones.Do you know anything about that?  MELUGIN:  So, right now, it appears there's a little bit of a discrepancybetween the L.A. County Fire Department and the Sheriff's Department.Initially, it was that the jaws of life were used. Now it sounds like theypotentially weren't used. It's unclear exactly how much help he needed. Butif he was conscious and talking, great news. Obviously, his agent put outthe statement that he has multiple leg injuries.So, I mean, just from my personal perspective, that would lead me tobelieve that he obviously wasn't going to be able to walk away on his own.So I'm assuming he had to be helped onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.And that what I'm told is, he's currently at UCLA Harbor Medical Centerright now. We have a crew there right now.CAVUTO:  Right.MELUGIN:  Yes, media is gathering there, obviously big national story.So, it's unclear exactly how much help he needed. But it's obviously greatnews to hear that he that he was conscious and was talking, especially whenyou take a look at those images from the helicopter. That's not a small --that's not a small crash right there. That's off an embankment and whatlooks like multiple rolls.And, hopefully, he had his seat belt on. It doesn't need to be said howviolent of a crash that would be.CAVUTO:  Yes, I'm assuming that was indeed the case.Bill, you know this area far better than -- certainly than I do. And ifyou're speeding through here, which is easy to do, it's a devil of a placeto be doing that.The fact that it looks like he was alone, he might have tried to avoidsomething on the road, or was simply going too fast, do we know anythingthat might have started this, beyond just maybe driving a little tooquickly?MELUGIN:  So, this is going to be obviously total speculation, but thatarea does have a lot of bicyclists.And it is more of a wildland area, where there could be coyotes, smallanimals that run across the road. Obviously, there's no information on anyof that yet. That's just the possibility. There's going to be a lot of --there's going to be a lengthy investigation to figure out what happenedhere.But you go online, there's a lot of hypothetical speculation about whatcould have happened, given his past. And that's why, when I talk to mysource in the department, they're saying -- they're kind of pumping thebrakes, saying, look, right now, nothing's salacious. This is just a reallybad crash.And, again, that area does have a lot of bicyclists. Early morning crash,who knows? Did he swerve to avoid something? Was he speeding? A lot ofquestions still out there, and we're just going to have to wait for them tobe answered.And -- oh, and I do want to mention...CAVUTO:  All right, Bill, thank -- go ahead.(CROSSTALK)MELUGIN:  The sheriff is -- the sheriff is going to have a press conferenceat 3:00 p.m. Pacific time at the Lomita Sheriff's Station, so in about anhour-and-a-half. So we should get more of our questions answered then.CAVUTO:  OK. We look forward to that.Bill, thank you very, very much.Should let you know that the PGA Tour has released a statement shortlyafter hearing of this news.And I'm quoting here: "We have been made aware of Tiger Woods' car accidenttoday. We're awaiting further information when he comes out of surgery. Onbehalf of the PGA Tour and our players, Tiger is in our prayers and willhave the full support as he recovers."Abby Hornacek with us right now, FOX Nation host, host of "GettingSchooled" podcast, much, much more, FOX News Radio.Abby, what can you tell us? What have you heard?ABBY HORNACEK, FOX NATION HOST:  Well, Neil, so far, you have had someexcellent reporting on this.Like everyone mentioned, this story still is unfolding. One thing that I doyou want to mention, following up on Bill's report from KTTV, about 40minutes ago, they were reporting, just based off technology that they haveused, that, from the moment that Tiger might have hit something or lostcontrol of the vehicle to where the car ended up was about 500 feet.So, granted, that's given with the technology used, it could be some error,but just to give context on how serious this car crash could have been.CAVUTO:  Do we know -- I know this whole event was a golf event in the bigpicture here.We do know that he was wrestling with these back issues that were likelygoing to take him out of this year's Masters tournament that he won back in2019. Do we know anything else about this or, for that matter, as I havebeen raising with other guests, Abby, where he was going?HORNACEK:  So far, it's -- no one really knows exactly where he was going.But, like you mentioned, he was playing a tournament. And I think the mostimportant thing out of all that knowledge to note is that he was trying tomake this comeback after yet another back surgery. He's had, I think, fiveback surgeries that we know of, and I'm sure other surgeries and injuriesalong the way.And right now, I think all we can do is focus on him recovering and gettingbetter. And I know everyone wants to go exactly to, all right, is he goingto return to the game of golf? Because, especially, right now, with all ofour country, what we're going through, we turn to sports, we turn to theseheroes that we have seen like Kobe Bryant.And I think we want something to cheer for. Right now, we're definitelycheering for Tiger Woods and his recovery. And if we were going to look atthe course of his career, he's really been a comeback player. You look backat 2008, and he won his last Masters. And then he had an 11-year drought.Then, in 2019, he won at Augusta, and it was just this huge moment. He'sbeen through so many ups and downs in his life. He's been through scandals,he's been through injuries, but he's come back stronger. And he's also beenthrough a lot of ups and downs in his career. So, he's resilient.His dad was a Green Beret. And we know that he's had some military trainingin that sense. So we hope that he can -- he can use that to get better,Neil. And our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family.CAVUTO:  You know, Abby, I'm so glad you said that. We're so -- will goback to playing golf? How about just getting through this, living anotherday to enjoy himself and his kids and what have you? You have got thepriorities right.We are hearing, Abby, that a number of other players, including fellow tourstar Justin Thomas, have been issuing statements on his behalf, on TigerWoods' behalf.When asked about the accident earlier today, he said: "I'm sick to mystomach. It hurts to see one of your closest friends get in an accident. Ijust hope he's all right. I'm just worried for his kids. I'm sure they arestruggling."The golf community, I think you have reported in the past, Abby, is a veryclose-knit one. It is a grueling schedule for those who are at itsuppermost tier. Tiger Woods certainly has been in that spot for decades.So, there's a camaraderie and an understanding, competitive as they arewith each other, to feel for each other, look out for each other. What haveyou heard from the golf world and those who now are shocked about thislatest...HORNACEK:  Yes.CAVUTO:  ... this tragedy for Tiger Woods, who's certainly known his share?HORNACEK:  Right.Well, I think, just like any sports community, like you said, it is --everyone is -- they are friends, I should say. And I think people arestarting to tweet. They don't want to tweet too soon, because they don'tknow the amount of details. And I'm sure other athletes are crafting theirresponses as we speak, since this did just happen this morning.But, again, if we could learn anything from the sports community, we canreally come together as one. And just because you're opponents doesn't meanyou're not friends off the court, off the field, off the golf course.And, sometimes, when you're an opponent and you're challenging anotherperson, that opponent then gains so much more respect for you. And I thinkTiger Woods was that way for so many people. And he's been in the game forso long, he's also a role model.So, I think we're going to see more people tweeting out, Neil, and reallythinking about Tiger during this time.CAVUTO:  Thank you, Abby, very, very much and for prioritizing what'simportant in these sort of events here.Again, for those of you just joining us here and wonder what all thecommotion and fuss is, Tiger Woods has been involved in a very serious autoaccident involving an SUV. He was riding it in California. The CaliforniaSheriff's Department described it as a single vehicle rollover trafficcollision.Now, this is coming from the department's Twitter account, saying that hisvehicle -- that is, Tiger Woods' Genesis vehicle -- suffered major damageand the accident. Took place around 7:12 a.m. Western time, 10:12 a.m.Eastern time. He was the only occupant in the car. There had been earlyreports that he was extricated from the car by the jaws of life.Turns out that he -- they were able to get him out of there through thefront windshield, but that he had a number of broken bones. He is still insurgery at the HARBOR UCLA Medical Center. That is all we know for the timebeing.Also another footnote here that we're learning from the Sheriff'sDepartment and others, as well as a reporter who has been sort of gleaningdevelopments on the scene, that he was conscious and talking to authoritiesas he was being taken out of that vehicle.Bret Baier has some more news for us to share, Bret, of course, well-versedin golf and a good golfer in his own right, but maybe can share a littlebit of what he's hearing -- Bret.Bret Baier, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Yes, Neil, good afternoon.First of all, the news from the Sheriff's Department that they believe theinjuries are non-life-threatening is the best news we have heard over thepast couple of hours. Waiting for more from the hospital.But I have some background, based on talking to people who were aware ofwhat was happening this morning there. Tiger had this contract withDiscovery Network to do a number of different kind of behind-the-scenesvideos and also lessons with stars.That's why you saw him on social media with David Spade and Dwyane Wade, hedid those Monday. This morning, he was scheduled to do another on-camerateaching lesson with Drew Brees, NFL quarterback, and Justin Herbert fromthe NFL at Rolling Hills Country Club, which is not far from this accidentscene.Told by people on the ground that he was waiting on his car on the valet,and he was running late. And he had to be there at 8:00 a.m., I guess, tostart the crew. His crew and handler went ahead with the television crew toget ready for what was going to be the filming of this lesson.And then this -- he didn't show up for an hour, two hours, and then theyfound out about this accident. Now, extrapolating, is he running late? Ishe speeding? Is he -- does he take the curve too hard? We don't know any ofthat. That's all speculation.But we do know that he wasn't playing golf. He had a long interview withJim Nantz on CBS at the tournament, in which he was a sponsor. And he waswatching. He talked about his foundation, but also his health and kind oflaughed about it.The question Jim Nantz asked was about whether he was going to get back intime for the Masters. He had just finished his fifth back surgery. And hewas trying to, but the -- it seemed from his answers that it seemed like along shot.And I'm told from people down there that he was hurting after a couple ofdays of standing up after that back surgery, and -- but was still going tothis next event for Discovery Network to do these playing lessons, if youwill, sitting in the cart, but giving lessons to Drew Brees and JustinHerbert.And it never happened. You see the crash right there. And, again, we'reawaiting word from the hospital about his status, a press conferenceexpected 6:00 p.m. Eastern time.CAVUTO:  And we forget, Bret, to your point, he's much bigger than the gameof golf, and doesn't necessarily depend on golf for his earnings.And all of these events and outside golf events are what has propelled hiscareer and made him one of the richest stars in any medium on the planet.I'm just wondering how hectic his schedule was, though, for these variouscommitments, because this is but one, right?BAIER:  Right.I mean, he has a lot of different sponsors, a lot of different events. ThisDiscovery Network contract was just the on-camera kind of fun behind-the-scenes things, but it was still an obligation and something that he wasdoing.You forget how big Tiger Woods is globally, I mean, as a name. He's won 82tournaments. He's tied with Sam Snead for the most tournaments ever won thePGA Tour. One more, and he's the solo leader in that category. He's won 15Majors. Jack Nicklaus has 18 Majors.But there's a thought, after Tiger Woods won the Masters in 2019, thatmaybe, just maybe, he's going to keep going. Obviously, we have to see whathappens after this surgery. But he's bigger than even the game of golf.He's a worldwide sports phenomenon. And that's why there's so muchattention of this.That's why there's so much thoughts and prayers coming from every corner,including the former president of the United States.CAVUTO:  Yes, that's true. The whole world is watching this, gets undueattention, bigger than his own sport. Much has been said of Muhammad Ali,much bigger certainly than boxing, and Kobe Bryant, of course, much biggerthan basketball.There are a few who -- half-a-handful could fill that definition.Bret Baier, thank you very, very much, my friend.I want to go to Jim Gray right now, sportscaster, FOX News contributor,bestselling author.And, Jim, it's always good to have you, I'm sorry under thesecircumstances, my friend.But, as Bret pointed out, I mean, just his accolades and winnings andaccomplishments in golf alone are the stuff of records. And I'm -- everyoneis wondering, will he get back to golf? Obviously, I think you hadmentioned this earlier too.You just want him to get back and out of that hospital. Your own thoughtsabout this crazy day?JIM GRAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it is crazy. And, obviously, all of us saw what happened to Kobe Bryant out here just alittle over a year ago. And so your mind tends to go to the worst, forwhatever the reason. And, thankfully, that's not the case, that it's notlife-threatening.I do want to read you a text that I just got from somebody who was in theknow. I won't identify them, but he's at Harbor UCLA. It's the countytrauma center. And they handle a lot of bad trauma, and that's why he wastaken there.He is in excellent hands, I am told. As soon as he is able to betransferred, they will try and get him to Reagan UCLA or to Cedars. I thenfollowed up and asked this person, who would know the condition of his legsand just how bad it was. And he says, at this point, he doesn't know.So, obviously, being near a trauma center, UCLA -- UCLA is the finesthospital out here. Reagan UCLA just up the road in Westwood is consideredto be one of the top hospitals in the entire country. So, he is in terrifichands right now.But when you speak from a sports perspective, Neil, this guy, to most ingolf, he is the GOAT. He doesn't have Jack Nicklaus' major record. But he'stied for the most wins in the history of the PGA Tour with 82. He has 15major championships. He has electrified the golf world since coming on thescene and winning that Masters at a very young age. He won three amateurs.We have known this young man virtually his entire life, since he wasintroduced to us on "The Mike Douglas Show" as just a toddler, all the wayup through those amateurs, and now these 15 majors and 82 championships.So, to many, he has surpassed the great Jack Nicklaus in terms of being thegolfing GOAT. I guess it is up for debate in those circles, and you'regoing to get a subjective answer and a criteria that can never really beestablished.But when you run through the names of those who are great, Tiger Woods isright up there with Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, and thoselikes, because that is what he has meant to the sport. And he has takenthis to a whole new level, Neil. The most popular golfer in the history ofgolf was Arnold Palmer, Arnie's Army.And what Tiger Woods has done in terms of his popularity, and in terms ofwhat he was able to do to climb up out of that valley, after all of thesurgeries, to not win a major from 2008 all the way up until 2019, to gothrough the personal trauma and scandal and the DUI, and to come out ofthat, and to have that happen at Augusta National, after having come back -- and he also won the PGA Tour Championship at East Lake just a few shortmonths before that.This is the greatest individual comeback that I have ever witnessed in allof sports. And I have been covering sports for almost 45 years now. And youmight say it's the greatest individual comeback ever. Sports historianswill tell you that. Probably the best team sport comeback was the SuperBowl, the 28-3 victory, that they were able to overcome, the New EnglandPatriots, against the Atlanta Falcons.But in terms of individuals, Tiger Woods has set the standard. And he hasset the standard going all the way back to those three amateurs. And he hasbeen just a constant in our lives on the golfing scene for more than aquarter of a century.So, the impact of this is just tremendous. And it's ironic, as Bill Hemmer,pointed out about an hour ago, the comparison to Ben Hogan in the car crashthat he suffered, and Tiger Woods.CAVUTO:  Yes.GRAY:  Hogan's Alley is known as Riviera Country Club. Well, that's wherethe Tiger Woods Invitational Now is. And that's why Tiger was out here, hisown tournament, the Genesis L.A. Open.And he wasn't able to participate. But he handed the trophy to Homa, whowon the tournament. And the irony of this, that, at Hogan's Alley, and hehad this horrible accident that Bill detailed, which is a legendary thing,and to come back from that, and now to have Tiger in a terrible car crash,having just left Riviera a couple of days ago, there's a whole lot ofparallels there that are, unfortunately, very frightening and terrificallysad.But let's hope for the same outcome that Ben Hogan had, that Tiger is ableto lead a full and successful life. And, hopefully, the golfing would bethe icing on the cake.CAVUTO:  Yes, that would be the icing on the cake.And to your point with that comeback at the Masters, it later so mesmerizedthe nation later that year. President Trump at the time had awarded him thePresidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, I think, in 2019 laterthis year.Former President Trump's tweeting out: "Get well soon, Tiger. You are atrue champion" -- a statement coming from Jason Miller, actually, speakingon behalf of the president.You mentioned at the outset there -- and I agree with you, Jim -- this --he had taken it to a new level. We talk about Arnie's Army, about ArnoldPalmer. But the Tiger army was a bigger army, a more diverse army. It'sopened up golf to a whole new, not only generation, but a generation ofminority kids and all sorts of kids, backgrounds and colors.And he changed, quite literally, the complexion of golf. And we forget, atthe time, how big a deal that was and remains, as a testament to him evennow, right?GRAY:  Absolutely.He has opened the doors for so many now to follow him. And I remember beingthere at Augusta National when he won in 1997. And I was there with my dad.And we were on the 18th tower doing the radio broadcast on Westwood One.And if you looked back to the clubhouse and down on the grounds, you couldsee all of the African-Americans, many of them who had worked there, workthere for years. And they were not allowed to play. Many of them had beenthere as employees for a long time. But they hadn't seen black people ableto play at that club.And then they admitted black members. And now to see Tiger Woods win, winthe Masters, there was terrific joy. And there were also a lot of tears.And it was just -- it was just a stunning, amazing scene andaccomplishment, and what he has been able to do to transcend that, and tobring all of the folks who had not been in the game now into this game.It had been an exclusive club, an exclusive place. And now he was puttinghis arm around all of these folks who now became welcome into the game. Andyou see it in all corners of the world now. And golf is a worldwide sport.And what Tiger did for the popularity of the sport, it's really -- it'sunmatched and unparalleled.And to see what he has been able to achieve through his foundation, and theeducation of all of these kids across the country and across the world, andhis father had big grandiose ideas about who Tiger would become, makingcomparisons to Gandhi and so forth.But Tiger really has been able to leave an impact, where he has left afootprint that has changed the world. And he's done that through his golf.And we have seen him at glorious times, and we have seen him at the bottomof the valley.And this time, when we saw him win, it was such a joyous occasion, Neil. Itwas something that we hadn't seen in Tiger, and it was like this legend hadbecome a human, because, like I said, instead of being standoffish andkeeping everybody away and being tortured by this constant pursuit ofperfection, here now he was allowing everybody to be involved with him, andto have that joy that he had.And he brought everybody along. And when he got to the end of it, he washugging competitors. And he had now become a mentor to so many of theseguys, to Justin Thomas and to Rory McIlroy and to so many of the greatyoung golfers, and Jordan Spieth.There was a time when Tiger Woods was just so competitive against theseguys that he might have been friendly, but it was at a huge, huge distance,and they were not friendly rivals. They were rivals.CAVUTO:  Yes.(LAUGHTER)GRAY:  And to have seen this entire change in not only the way that heapproached things, but to see the way that he was embraced by all of thesefolks, he had long been admired and respected, but now everybody was justso happy to see Tiger Woods back on top.And now, obviously, our shift turns to, let's hope that the guy is able torecover from these surgeries and lead a normal life and be able to be outthere with his kids and enjoy their activities.CAVUTO:  One of the things I always find interesting, Jim -- and you havereported this, and talking about great sports legends, is that they'rebigger than their sport.And the proof of that came in his earnings over his career that dwarfedwhatever he made in golf, even in his heyday, when he was winningtournaments left and right, to this day generating far more than mostathletes in their prime enjoying success on the field or on the fairway.You pick your sport.And this was an example of this. This was a Genesis event, the South Koreancarmaker. And I always wondered, was he -- his responsibilities andcommitments to all of these sponsors was overwhelming. I mean, just for thenormal person, taking aside the money involved and the prestige involved,these are very demanding commitments, aren't they?GRAY:  Well, they are. And it requires a lot of attention.And it's not easy to be Tiger Woods, because, look, nobody can live up tothe demands of what the public wants. Everybody wants a selfie. Everybodywants an autograph. Everybody would love to shake your hand and say hello.And everybody just wants five seconds or five minutes.Well, it's impossible to be able to meet up to that, because there's justnot enough time in the day. And there's just not an ability to meeteverybody in a personal fashion.CAVUTO:  Right.GRAY:  And so when you have as many commitments as he had -- and he lostsome of those sponsors after the scandal, but he had rebuilt that and wasstill gaining more sponsors now, particularly after those two victories,the one at East Lake and then the one at Augusta.And so, yes, he is a worldwide, multi-multi -- he's a billionaire now. Iwas going to say millionaire, but he's probably -- he is the first Americanbillionaire to have done it through his sport. There might have been aFormula 1 guy or somebody overseas who had done it before him, but he was abillionaire from his earnings and from his endorsements over here.And you cover money. And that was -- that was almost impossible to achieve,Neil. And he did it.CAVUTO:  Yes. And think of those roots.Jim Gray, thank you very, very much, great background information, just tosense the total man, as you always do, Jim. I appreciate that.By the way, we're learning a little bit more now about what was involved inthis accident.Jonathan Hunt has a little bit more on that, what we can learn.What are we hearing about what happened exactly, Jonathan?Jonathan Hunt, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  ... reporting that police sourcesare telling them the Woods' vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed.Now, those same law enforcement sources have said there is nothing, if youlike, salacious that they have found so far in terms of this terribleaccident. And that speaks to what you had mentioned before, the previousDUI incident involving Tiger Woods, of course.So, people's minds might go to that. But, at the moment, the indicationsthat we are getting from law enforcement is that they have not foundanything like that as part of this accident. But they are telling The L.A.Times that Woods' car was driving at a high rate of speed on what is awindy downhill part of the road that in Rancho Palos Verdes.It's an area as well, I can tell you, Neil, where you can, with the with acouple of lanes on either side, if there's not a lot of traffic around --and there isn't these days in L.A. because of the COVID pandemic -- it canbe very tempting to, if you like, be a little heavy on your acceleratorpedal.Now, we don't know that for sure. But that is what L.A. -- The L.A. Timesis reporting from its sources.A little bit of background on what Tiger Woods was doing here in the L.A.area as well, Neil. He was, as you had mentioned, at the GenesisInvitational. That wrapped up on Saturday. Now, as we -- as far as we cantell, piecing the timeline together here, he basically took the day offSunday and then was involved in this promotional shoot that startedyesterday, Monday.In that, it was arranged by Golf Digest and the Discovery Channel. He wasgiving lessons to celebrities. Yesterday, for instance, both the NBA greatDwyane Wade and the actor/comedian David Spade put photos and video ontheir social media.And, in particular, Neil, I want to draw your attention -- and if we canget it in, at some point, we will -- to the video that Dwyane Wade postedon the Instagram. On it, you see Dwyane Wade doing a -- doing a selfievideo with Tiger Woods right behind him.And Dwyane Wade is just saying it's great to have the GOAT here giving mesome lessons, Tiger sneaking up behind him, laughing, smiling. And, again,that speaks to the mood of Tiger Woods that Jim Gray was speaking soeloquently about, a guy whose life had changed, and seemed to be reallyembracing the pure joys of life right now.And, clearly, on that golf course, when you look at the Dwyane Wade video,he was having a great time with his celebrity buddies yesterday. Now, hewas due to complete that shoot, as we understand it, today.So, this is -- we're not a 100 percent certain of this as a fact right now,Neil, but it would appear that he was heading from wherever he was stayingin the Rancho Palos Verdes area to the Rolling Hills Country Club, where hewas shooting that Golf Digest promotional shoot with celebrities.And, as Bret Baier was reporting a little bit earlier, he was due to begiving some lessons to a couple of NFL players later today. But, sadly,obviously, he never showed up for that shoot -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Jonathan Hunt, excellent reporting, my friend. I appreciate that.I want to go to Eric Mitchell right now, sports agent, sports analyst.One of the best lines I have loved about Eric is -- and maybe this,unbeknownst to him, kind of typifies the attitude of a Tiger Woods, when hesays: "Stop watching your competition TV and start being on TV."Eric, I always loved that. And I think that Tiger Woods lives that. Hebreathes that. And that's the one thing we take away and why we're sorelieved that these are not hopefully life-threatening injuries, regardlessof whether he ever can resume a golf career, that he will be able,hopefully, to resume life, an incredible life, at that.You have been in contact with the Woods team. What can you tell us, Eric?ERIC MITCHELL, SPORTS TALENT MANAGER:  You know, basically, they're just asconcerned.I mean, we were all -- we all had that scare, right? Automatically, Neil,we thought of just a short year ago losing the GOAT Kobe Bryant in SouthernCalifornia. It all hit us real fast.And it was great to hear the stories. It is funny that TMZ is the onebreaking the story again. But they seem to be legends at this. But talkingto the team, everybody wants everybody to remain calm, know that Tiger isalive. He is going through his surgery. I think that's a big thing that weall need to remember. He is a father.And we have all watched him play with his son, how cute that was to watchat their last tournament, where we got to see Tiger the dad. And we sawthat after Kobe passed, how much him and his daughters mean something.And as a father of four beautiful children, one of them, my son, has hisbirthday today, we were just talking about Tiger. So, the team, we're justcaring about Tiger recovery. We don't care if he ever plays golf again.He's a legend. And he's changed the sports world.And I think everybody just sees that when you look around, even talkingabout President Trump, President Obama. All these presidents, they all lovehim. If you're a golfer, Tiger Woods is a guy, you're just like, I want tobe like Tiger. It's one of those guys you just love, no matter what sportyou follow, what sport you play.You're seeing it come in around the world. Twitter is just alive withthoughts and prayers going out to Tiger Woods. And his team loves it.They're being very tight-knit as they go.And as for the comments of people talking about him speeding, well, Ithink, if you have ever been in California, those folks don't move slow atall. Being a native California, we don't know how to go slow. So, Tigerprobably saw open space.(LAUGHTER)       MITCHELL:  And coming from -- I'm a Marine. Tiger was raised in a GreenBeret family. You don't show up late to things.So, it doesn't matter how much money you make. You show up on time.CAVUTO:  I hear you. There's so much we don't know.But, Eric, I was wondering. I remember when you were talking to a lot ofprofessional athletes -- I don't know if Tiger was among them -- on thosewho would play a role for social justice. And people forget that, in thecase of Tiger Woods, he wasn't loud about it. He was very quiet about it.But it was important to him. Could you explain that part of it?MITCHELL:  Absolutely.Tiger -- I mean, Tiger -- he was -- how do I put this in the way that itjust -- it's just the way -- if you remember, when Tiger started, we allwatched him. You broke it down perfect, Neil, earlier, when you weretalking about how he was one of the first to come to Augusta.And Bret Baier was talking about it also, right, changing the way we alllooked at sports. Tiger was this big divide in golf. We all saw a bunch ofall white golfers playing it everywhere. And Tiger came in and changed thegame. He was animated loud, almost John McEnroe of tennis you saw withTiger.And he brought social justice to bring it aware. So, people did it with acalm heart. We see so much in social justice is done loud or throughviolence. And Tiger had a very calm demeanor about himself, where he wasable to go sit and play with the great Dwyane Wade, at the same time getkudos and medals from President Trump that some people in the sports world,of course, didn't think the world of.CAVUTO:  Right. Right.MITCHELL:  Tiger was this mediator of unity. And that's what you have tolove about Tiger and his comeback. We all relate to it, because none of usare perfect.And Tiger was the guy who we watched publicly fail. And Tiger came back.And we showed that he's human. He's a father. He's a parent, like the restof us. He was able to come back, and zero fame, zero fortune changed howTiger Woods was. And that's what we love about Tiger. That's why we'rehappy that he's alive and well.And we hope he gets to the surgery and maybe he comes back to golfing. Butall I care about is that he gets to go home and be with his kids, becausethat's the most important thing as a father. That's all that matters, isgoing home. And Tiger has changed the way we all look at sports. Tiger isthis kind of mediary for everybody, right in the middle. Tiger is that guy.CAVUTO:  Yes, and a subtle sense of humor, Eric.I don't want to belabor this. And I'm probably screwing up the exactwording of it. But when he was first getting big in the sport, and a lot ofpeople would ask him, well, how do you feel about your unique position andwhat you offer, what is your contribution, clearly trying to say, allright, you're an African-American, you made it big, and he was sayingsomething to the effect, well, my mark will be I won't dress as loud as theother players.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  And if you think about it, he didn't.It was a subtle look on the golf course. And others then started copyinghis subtle look. Up until he came along, we were thinking of that -- almostthat "Caddyshack" look of players, where they would dress loudly.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  And he didn't do that.I'm probably not getting service to the exact way he put it. But he had avery dry, kind of almost Bob Newhart sense of humor approach about it thatpeople enjoyed, and at least certainly those like you who knew him verywell, huh?MITCHELL:  He's a humble hero.If you look at Tiger Woods, he's a humble hero that you just are gravitatedto. We all watched him wear that red shirt. You knew it was Sunday, and youknew he was in the running when the red shirt was on.CAVUTO:  Right. Right.MITCHELL:  And so seeing his son and Tiger go out and play in this lasttournament, they were together and watching their mannerisms together, youjust look at them, and you're like, I remember when Tiger was young, andyou were just glued to the TV going, is he really pulling off some trickshot at Augusta?Seriously, Tiger. And he does it. And he brought people into the sport,myself included, to enjoy watching golf because it wasn't boring. Tigermade it fun. And he's animated. And he acts like we do on the golf course.He says less words than most of us do that we're not supposed to say outloud. Tiger can get away with that on TV.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL:  But, I mean, he's human like the rest of us.And watching him slice a shot, Neil, it just makes you go, OK, well, atleast even -- it's like watching Jordan miss a shot. It was the same thing.So, he is a GOAT. He's the GOAT of almost all sports.I guess we have to give T.B. 12, since he has seven rings now, we have tocall him the GOAT of all GOATs. But Tiger is definitely in that realm withJordan, with Tom Brady, with Wayne Gretzky. When it comes to golf, Tigerhas changed everything. And he's friends with all those names I justmentioned.CAVUTO:  Yes, right.MITCHELL:  So he's a guy who's defined everything, politicians,celebrities, everybody. He -- again, he's just Tiger Woods.And he's like the comeback kid that you just -- you cheer for. He's theunderdog that's not really an underdog that you just want to see do good.CAVUTO:  I love that, Eric.And I -- just again, I love that. Stop watching your competition on TV.Start being on TV. And I know what you mean. I'm not a golfer. I'm aminiature golfer. And I always think that, Eric, when you get to that 18thhole and you got to get through the clown's nose, what would Tiger do?MITCHELL:  Right.CAVUTO:  But thank you, my friend. Very good having you, Eric Mitchell.MITCHELL:  No problem.CAVUTO:  Eric doesn't relate to the miniature golf thing. Very few do. Veryfew do.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  All right, what's the latest now we're getting on this? And we'rewaiting, of course, to hear from the Sheriff's Department.A little over an hour now, they're going to give us an update on what theylearned about the accident, maybe an update on Tiger Woods' condition.Matt Finn right now is at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center, where weunderstand, I think it's still the case, Matt, where Tiger is stillundergoing surgery, correct?FINN:  Our understanding, it's being reported that Tiger Woods is beingtreated inside of this hospital right now in Torrance, California, justnorth of Long Beach, but, more importantly, not far from Rancho PalosVerdes, where the accident was reported.So, this likely was one of the nearest emergency rooms or hospitals thatofficials and emergency crews could bring Tiger Woods for treatment.And outside right now, there is a growing awareness in the air of what islikely happening inside of this hospital right now, as there always is, orusually is, when a celebrity or a high-profile name is brought to ahospital. There's a growing sense of media here. There are people that arestopping and pulling up.And there is a strong sense of security. The L.A. County Sheriff's Officeis here, not only urging people to stay off the property if they don't needto be, but, more importantly, they are also reminding people of the COVID-19 precautions in place on this property right now.We were just in the parking lot area, and there were lots of people inmasks, separated, very long distances. And security told us that was likelyfamily and friends who are waiting to get inside of this hospital, but theycan't go in and see this family.So, two different scenarios happening here right now. Of course, we havenot -- we have not independently confirmed that Tiger is inside thishospital. It is being reported by The L.A. Times and Golf magazine. Agrowing sense of media here, and everyone kind of waiting to see what willhappen next -- Neil.CAVUTO:  I would imagine that quite an army of crews and photographers havegathered right around where you are, huh?FINN:  Yes, not far from here.We see local affiliates and likely some national crews here as well, butit's relatively under control. There's not a frenzy, not a lot of chaos.I think everyone is abiding by the rules right here. Right now, traffic isrunning smoothly, Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, that's good to hear.Matt, thank you very much, my friend, Matt Finn.Want to go to my buddy Jared Max, expert on all things sports, a walkingencyclopedia, I might point out.Jared, you had a chance to digest a lot of this. And we're breathing a sighof relief that, hopefully, these are non-life-threatening injuries here,but significant just the same. Your thoughts?JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, right off the bat, I think,in a whole career of highlights of Tiger Woods, whether it be his stormingonto the scene in the Masters in '97, or indiscretions in 2009, or thecomeback, or images of back surgeries, or what we see today, today's imageis one that gets put into that career highlight reel in our minds of seeingthis legend.Right now, we sit back and we hold our breath and say, is Tiger Woods OK?Is his health OK? Is he going to be fine to be a father for the rest of hislife for his kids? As a sports fan, the first question you have is, willTiger Woods ever be able to play golf again? Is this guy ever going tocompete again? Can Superman put on the cape and fly again?The question was, will Tiger play in the Masters? That's coming up April 5.We know now, obviously, that's not going to happen. But there's somethingspecial about Tiger Woods that Jim Gray touched on, comparing him to peoplelike Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth.Neil, growing up, as a young sports fan. I heard all the stories. Oh, thisone, you never got to see. You never saw DiMaggio. You never saw Gehrig orMantle or Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays or Bob -- you never saw BillRussell.And you start to almost feel cheated as a kid, like, hey, well, I'm tooyoung to be here. And, all of a sudden, this Tiger Woods comes onto thescene. And you know you're watching somebody who's going to become the bestever and already is.And whether or not Tiger Woods has the most Major wins -- he's still threebehind for the all-time lead. But he's tied Jack -- with Sam Snead for themost all-time wins. You know how super he was.And so any time, Neil, you hear somebody talking about the sports greats,the ones you got to see, Tiger Woods is exactly this. And so everybody'sgoing to sit and hold their breath and wait to see, can Superman do itagain?And we will think about other sports modern miracles of medicine. Thequarterback of the Washington Football Team, Alex Smith, has no businessbeing able to walk, let alone play football still. And if people havelooked and seen what his gruesome leg injuries were, and that he was ableto come back and play, we start to think, wow, well, if he could do it, andthe doctors could do with this for him, and Tiger Woods has the biggest andthe best around, maybe this will work out for him.But, again, as you point out right at the beginning, this is a -- this is alarge moment because of who Tiger Woods is, what he represents. And, again,to see images of a vehicle in Southern California that's been beaten upbadly that involved a sports legend, it scares you. It does.I mean, yes, Kobe Bryant just over a year ago. And, obviously, wish -- wecertainly wish him the best here for Tiger Woods. This is a lot to take in,Neil.CAVUTO:  It is.Jared, we do know that, obviously, becoming a star of his magnitude andbigger than just the game of golf, he was at this Genesis sports event.David Spade, Dwyane Wade were there. There are a number of pictures withhim there. There are reports that he was running a little bit delayed, TMZ,others reporting that that might have been behind his hurry here. Don'tknow where he was going.Have you heard anything of what his schedule was like later in the day,what was next? I mean, this is a guy who has a number of big endorsementdeals. And he has to meet with quite a few sponsors. He wants to give themall 100 percent, not just mail it in.But this was a pressure schedule, wasn't it?MAX:  Neil, I -- no -- to answer your question first, no, I don't knowexactly where he was going to be going or what may have been on his mind.But as you lay all this out and this question, all I'm thinking about isKobe Bryant. We just went through this on the one-year anniversary of thattragic helicopter accident.CAVUTO:  Yes.MAX:  And we all kept thinking, well, what was he doing that day? And thestory was that Kobe Bryant did not want to disappoint anybody, that ahelicopter pilot would not have wanted to disappoint his friend KobeBryant, and they flew when they weren't supposed to.And, sometimes, if you think about it, when we're in a rush, we do somestupid things. We do things that we normally wouldn't. And we say, whydon't I do that? And then you realize, oh, I wasn't really thinkingstraight.So, when we find out whatever it was, what Tiger Woods was doing, again, Ithink we're all hoping that there's nothing nefarious involved. You thinkback to what happened in 2009. Then there was a DUI and stuff. Tigerdoesn't seem like a person who would be involved in something like thatagain.You certainly hope it wasn't. You look for things to smile at. You made mesmile a few minutes ago, Neil, when you made the joke about the miniaturegolf and hitting it through the clown's nose.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Yes.MAX:  And I guess that makes me feel just how the level of seriousness thatthis is, when you see that he's in for surgeries, because, just like whensomebody -- when there's the starkest of moments, you're at a funeral, andsomebody cracks a joke, and you just want to laugh like there's no tomorrowbecause it feels good.And that -- I started to laugh out loud here waiting to talk to you whenyou made the comment about the clown, almost scared me into how seriousthis moment could be, or at least -- or at least the level of reverencethat we share for Tiger Woods.CAVUTO:  All right. And we do, indeed, my friend, as I do for you.Jared Max on all of this.I don't think that Tiger Woods was ever into miniature golf, although hewas a very good putter, so he might have been able to get through theclown's nose.We do know and do pray that he will be OK. But this has mesmerized anation. He is an iconic figure. We just hope he's going to be OK.
