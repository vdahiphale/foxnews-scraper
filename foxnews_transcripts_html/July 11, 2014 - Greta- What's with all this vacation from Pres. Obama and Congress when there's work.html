'Off the Record,' 7/11/14: President Obama is going on a 2-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard while members of Congress recess for 5 weeks - all Iraq burns and humanitarian crisis at the border continues. Real leaders do the work they promised.

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What is with all this vacation stuff? And not just any vacation, but paid vacations, paid by us?
President Obama is jetting off to Martha's Vineyard for two weeks and the House and the Senate go into recess for five weeks. Yes, I know some are doing some work during that time. But let's face it - there is a lot of plain old vacation in there and here's the rub: They haven't done their jobs, work that they have promised to do, but just have not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have a humanitarian crisis on our border and they are taking time off? We have no solution to that crisis. Not even a plan. President Obama threw out a number - $3.7 billion. Congress hasn't passed it. Even if it did, there is a bigger illegal immigration problem going on for years that they should be working on, not taking weeks of vacation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, I know the president says Congress won't be in town, so why should he stick around. Well, here is why: He's the president, the leader. It's his job, and Congress, same excuse. They say the president is not around to solve problems. So, that's their green light to likewise take off. I don't know about you, but where I grew up, you did your work first, kept your promises, then you go on vacation. Real leaders do the right thing. They did the work they promised. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Washington, D.C. really is the city of no consequences, and it's sad. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight  </pre>
