SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity."
This is a Fox News alert. Explosive news from the White House and all over the place tonight, the president has, in fact, now ordered the DOJ to immediately declassify the redacted sections of the Carter Page FISA documents. He's also ordered the immediate release of the FBI's interview notes with Carter Page, and this is huge news. All Russia related texts, and messages from Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Bruce Ohr, were also be released unredacted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, this might be the biggest development reported to date. We'll give you the details. It is truly a deep state house of cards collapsing as I have been predicting, right before our very eyes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Carter Page, Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, John Solomon with breaking news, all here with reaction. Also tonight, you were mourned right here on this program numerous times how Democrats will try to Bork Judge Kavanaugh, accusations of misconduct, of course, they must be taken seriously. But Democrats, they don't seem to be interested in getting to the truth, all they wanted from the beginning is to delay and ultimately derail Kavanaugh's confirmation. The president is fully standing by the nominee at this hour. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And coming up, we will expose the shameful dirty tactics from the left in America. We also have a bombshell develop it as it relates to Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. New transcripts from her congressional testimony just released tonight and page admitting they saw no proof at all of any Russian collusion.
This was nine months in. It's been a witch hunt and remains a witch hunt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Buckle up. We have a lot of news to cover in two nights breaking news opening monologue.

HANNITY: All right. For months, right here on this program, we have been asking for the unredacted FISA documents to be released. Now, the president has done it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Pages 10 through 12, 17 through 34, very specific, all FBI reports of Russia-related interviews with Bruce Ohr, all FBI reports of interviews in connection with all of Carter Page's FISA applications will be released to you, the American people, oh, like a Spartacus moment.
Now, we're talking about possible exculpatory information, things that they have hidden and lies that will be revealed. We have new revelations on Christopher Steele and his dirty dossier that Hillary paid for, new information on the deep states' attempt to take down the president both before and destroy him after the election.
Now, this is huge news. We are expecting these documents any time. We will update you as of course they become available. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also tonight, Catherine Herridge will join us with a full report right out of our monologue.
But, first, we must addressed and we begin tonight with the Democrats' blatant attempts to derail the Kavanaugh confirmation. Now, the first scheduled both in the Senate have now been delayed one week from tonight -- or today, actually, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold an open question. Judge Kavanaugh will be there in order to address what is a 36- year-old sexual misconduct allegations from his teenage years.
His accuser has also been asked to testify. No word as to a confirmation if she will be appearing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, this comes after Senator Dianne Feinstein out of the blue released a cryptic statement last week about an anonymous individual who is now accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, when they were both in high school, in like 1982, but they don't know the exact year. That's a charge he categorically denied. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, keep in mind, Dianne Feinstein, all her fellow Democrats, they have had this information since July. But she didn't ask Judge Kavanaugh about the allegations during any of the private meetings she had with him. She didn't ask the judge about it during any of the public testimony that they had, none. Not once. She didn't inform any of her Republican colleagues, she didn't report the event to authorities until just last week. We are asking the question, why?
Now as it appears to be unfair to all parties involved here, and more unfairly to you, the American people. Now, this was mentioned earlier today by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, questioning why Democrats purposely withheld this information from the public. Is it political? We'll let you decide. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: Last week, the Judiciary Committee staff informed me of this letter. I read the letter. At that point, we had no idea who had sent it. And I noticed the date of the letter and wondered why the information had not been released long ago.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I have ever known. He's an outstanding intellect and outstanding judge, respected by everybody, never had even a little blemish on his record. The FBI has, I think, gone through the process six times with him over the years where he went to a higher and higher position. He is somebody very special.
As I understand it, Judge Kavanaugh spent quite a bit of time with Senator Feinstein and it wasn't even brought up at that meeting. And she had this information. So you would have thought certainly that she would have brought that up at the meeting, not wait until everything is finished and then have to start the process all over again.
But with all of that being said, we want to go through the full process. I have great confidence in the U.S. Senate and of their procedures and what they are doing, and I think that's probably what they're going to do. It will go through the process and hear everybody out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'd like to see a complete process. I'd like everybody to be very happy. Most importantly, I want the American people to be happy because they're getting somebody that is great. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I want him to going at the absolute highest level. And I think to do that you have to go through this. If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay. It shouldn't certainly be very much.

HANNITY: He's talking about transparency. If it takes a little delay, it should take a little delay, but they had it back in July.
We've known from the beginning, the Democrats' goal from day one, their aim has always been to delay, derail, malign the character of Judge Kavanaugh. That is their history. Now, we saw it on display in the hearings, it was a disaster for the Democrats.

I reminded you at the time of the announcement that Judge Kavanaugh was picked to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. I reminded you of the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Chappaquiddick Ted Kennedy.
Remember, he's a guy responsible for literally wrecking the confirmation of Judge Robert Bork and, by the way, that's years after he drunkenly wrecked his car, dries it into the river and has a female passenger in the car. He gets up out of the water and he goes home and doesn't tell a soul. Mary Jo Kopechne died.
Still, that guy was impugning the character of somebody else, in this case, it was Judge Bork. Take a look.

SEN. TED KENNEDY, D-MASS.: Robert Bork's America is a land of which women would be forced into a back alley abortion, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizen stores in midnight raids, and school children could not be taught about evolution.

CLARENCE THOMAS, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: This is a circus. It's a national disgrace. And from my point, as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas. And it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured, by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.

And now, the ones anonymous Kavanaugh accuser has come forward. Her name is Professor Christine Ford. She's a clinical psychology professor in northern California.
She told "The Washington Post" that in the early ‘80s, Kavanaugh trapped her in a room as they were teenagers and groped her. This allegedly occurred at a high school party as they were both teenagers and she was in a swimsuit and other clothes and he was grabbing her.
And Professor Ford's account, I would argue, has to be taken seriously as the president said. Both Kavanaugh and Ford will rightly have their opportunity to speak under oath, something Judge Kavanaugh has been pushing for as today he released a statement.

Quote: This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone because this never happened. I had no idea who is making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I'm willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation from 36 years ago and defend my integrity.
There's also a group of 65 women who knew Kavanaugh at the time back in high school and they are releasing a letter and backing him up. There letter praised his friendship, his character and his integrity. And now, some of those women are also speaking out. Watch this.

MONICA MASTAL: There are plenty of people testified with him who were on both sides of the fence, whether they were other law firms or, you know, other attorneys in other ways that appeared before Judge Kavanaugh.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's just so polar office opposite of the Brett Kavanaugh I've known for the last 35 years. I was confused, surprised and shocked.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I never saw him out of control drunk. He always retained his comic composure. He was a responsible guy and he was someone who would have a beer but he was never out of control and he never became someone different after drinking.

Now, tonight, many are rushing to his defense. New developments are casting serious doubt on the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh. According to Senator Orrin Hatch, Kavanaugh is even denying his presence at the party described by his accuser. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Dr. Ford, or Professor Ford herself is foggy on the important facts about the allegations. She told The Washington Post that, quote, she doesn't remember some of the key details in the incident. She's also not only unclear about the exact date but the exact year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
A man who Ford listed as a witness to the alleged assault that she says was in the room named Mark Judge, he's also flatly rejecting her claims. He told The Weekly Standard that is absolutely nuts. I never saw Brett ever act that way.
And meanwhile, Professor Ford hired a high profile attorney. That attorney's name is Debra Katz. That's a person who has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. There's no evidence that this is political, but it is background in the story. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

According to a townhall.com piece, she trashed Trump and his advisors on social media. She once stood up and defended Senator Al Franken when he was facing misconduct allegations. She repeatedly cast out on the credibility of the Paula Jones accusations against Bill Clinton, that is what I would say is not exactly a consistent record of supporting victims of sexual misconduct.
Now, by the way, based on the history of the Democratic Party, what I'm telling America tonight, we are a nation of laws, we believe in the presumption of innocence in the country. And we also look at facts. I think the American people should have an opportunity to hear from the 65 women, Judge Kavanaugh, they should be able to hear from the professor, be able to hear from her attorney, be able to hear from people who clerked for Judge Kavanaugh, people that went to law school and high school with him and then let the American people decide.
I believe the American people are fair-minded people. Sadly, it's a serious matter and we welcome testimony from everybody involved. Professor Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, any of the women who have known Judge Kavanaugh during his 36 plus years since. And by the way, that would include the mothers from the girls he coached on his daughter's team. By the way, his daughters are paying very close attention tonight, sadly, I'm sure. And any of the women that worked with him in the White House on the Bush administration.
Now, today, ahead of his upcoming hearing, Kavanaugh participated in a conference call with senators and he responded to the charges and Democrats did not participate. Why not? Don't they want to get both sides? Don't they want to get both sides? Don't they want to at least hear his side of it? Have they prejudged this case? Do they not believe in the presumption of innocence, or do they just care about politics? Is this just another opportunity?

        }
      
Now, let me be very clear here -- I don't know, I wasn't there. But I do believe in the presumption of innocence. All Americans should have an open mind, all side should be heard.
But I will say this, it's a preview of what Democrats will do if they take control of Congress in 51 days. We have midterm elections. We know that the left has no plan to make this country better for the forgotten men and women in this country. We've seen their actions in the past. We know what their agenda is. Not only obstructing and smearing and slandering the president on a minute-by-minute basis, preventing him if they could from doing anything.
We also know they want open borders. We also know that they want to keep Obamacare and they want their crumbs back and they don't want constitutionalists qualifying judges with a track record like Judge Kavanaugh on any court, never mind the Supreme Court. We know the Democrat detest the president and his agenda, and even the Americans who support them.

Listen to Crazy Uncle Joe and what he had to say.

JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces have of intolerance remained to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made. This time, they, not you, have an ally in the White House. This time, they have an ally. There are small percentages of American people, virulent people. Some of them, the dregs of society.

HANNITY: Let me get that, if you support Trump, think you are the dregs of society.
Make no mistake, Democrats will also end important investigations into the deep state, we are on the verge of breaking it wide open, including the ongoing inquiry into Strzok and Page. And, of course, we have so much new information tonight to uncover.
Just today, we learned that Lisa Page testified under oath that the FBI had no evidence linking Trump to Russian collusion before Robert Mueller was ever appointed. In July, she told lawmakers behind close doors that months and months of series investigations turned up empty. She said, quote, it's a reflection of us still not knowing and it still existed in the scope of possibility that there would be literally nothing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember, one day after Mueller was appointed, Strzok texted Page, you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely I'd be there. No question. I hesitated in part because of my gut sense and concern that there is no big there there.
But they still appointed, which would explain why they were all leaking, which we have disclosed in recent weeks. This is why Mueller's investigation into so-called collusion has been and remains a total witch hunt. There never was any Russian collusion. Everyone in the DOJ and FBI knew it, and Lisa Page testified to that fact, and that's why all the leaking took place. They were leaking in the hopes they would get an investigation just to get Trump the insurance policy.
This is why Strzok texted Page: Sitting with Bill watching CNN, a ton more out. Hey, let me know when you can talk. We're discussing whether now that this is out, we use it as a pretext to go interview some people. A pretext? To use the power of your office to go after people in the FBI? No evidence, they want a special prosecutor so they leak to get it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Now, we're going to have a lot of deep state coverage throughout the show, but first, we have new information on the president's decision to classify a series of important documents.
Our own Catherine Herridge has that report tonight -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Sean.
There is no official timeline, though a source familiar with the declassification told Fox News they expect the surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page first, as well as FBI interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. The source said the Justice Department is a compressed timeline and records could come in days, not weeks.
Bruce Ohr matters to the Russia case because of his connection to the Trump dossier. After the former British spy behind the dossier was fired by the FBI in November 2016, documents show that the British spy, Christopher Steele, maintained contact with the FBI and other government officials by using Bruce Ohr as a back channel.
The release also calls for the unprecedented, publicly available records. The text messages related to Russia, clean copies without sections blacked out. Former FBI Director James Comey, his deputy Andrew McCabe or as well as former FBI agent Peter Strzok, and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page.
The source said that process may take longer because of the sheer volume of messages. This comes as Fox News confirms new details about the Russia probes' findings. During her July closed door testimony, a transcript reviewed by Fox News shows that Page said the FBI investigation had not yielded hard evidence of Russian collusion nine months into the case. Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May 2017. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tonight, a Justice Department spokesperson told Fox they are already working on the president's request. The Office for the Director of National Intelligence that oversees the 15 agencies used the word expeditiously. Meantime, the House Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, called the president's move, quote, an abuse of power, not about transparency -- Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Catherine Herridge, reporting in Washington, thank you.
Joining us now is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.
Senator, why if --
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Yes.
HANNITY: -- why if the Democratic Party had this in July, why did they hold it? I agree with Senator Collins. I thought she was very, very --
GRAHAM: She was. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Very smart in her comments, it's not fair to anybody here.
GRAHAM: Right. Well, here's what I would say. If I believe the person in front of me had committed a serious offense that would disqualify them from being on the Supreme Court, I would bring it up to them, I would not let that go unchallenged.
So, here's what I'm going to do. This is not that complicated. It's a 36- year-old allegation. It's a serious allegation. Everybody needs to be heard but also people need to defend themselves.
I'm going to look at what she said about Brett Kavanaugh in high school and compare that to everything else I know about Brett Kavanaugh, including his denial and I'll make the decision.
And here's what I want your audience to know. If Ms. Ford really did not want to come forward, never intended to come forward, never planned to come forward, why did she pay for a polygraph in August and why did she hire a lawyer in August if she never intended to do what she is doing?
HANNITY: Nobody else has made that point, Senator. It's poignant point and an interesting question.
GRAHAM: And who paid for it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Has she agreed to be interviewed or go before the Senate committee?
GRAHAM: I don't know.
HANNITY: I'm sorry?
GRAHAM: She's welcome to come. We're going to have a hearing Monday, she can come if she likes, if she doesn't want to she doesn't have to. Kavanaugh can come if he would like, I think he will. We're going to vote on Wednesday.
All I can say is that I've been a prosecutor, a judge and a defense counsel all of my life before I got into politics. This case could not go before a criminal court because it's too old and no lawyer would bring it as a civil suit because it's just too hard to prove.
The question for the Senate, is there really enough evidence here given the nature of the allegation, how old it is in the uncertain nature of it, to deny this man who has lived an incredible life of a promotion to the Supreme Court? And if it was this bad why did not the Democrats challenged Judge Kavanaugh when he was sitting right there in front of them?
HANNITY: Why is your speculate -- what is the answer to that? Why didn't they bring it forward? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: I think it's part of a pattern. They can't beat him on the law so they are trying to destroy his life. If the conservative had added a tape of a liberal nominee to the court where that they take the words and turn them upside down, they try to suggest that Judge Kavanaugh used the term abortion inducing drugs when it was the plaintiff, the Priests for Life.
Remember what Kamala Harris did to Judge Kavanaugh, try to put words in his mouth? Remember what they tried to say that he had some stolen documents when he did not.
So, there's been a pattern of Democrats in this committee to take the words out of context and try to accuse him of things he had nothing to do with. And the last straw here is this allegation that came about last Thursday, and again. Why did they ask him on it before?
HANNITY: The president made a decision tonight on redacting information, FISA, 302s, other information. But we also learned about the FBI and DOJ and other intelligence officials at the highest level leaking information to the media and Lisa Page saying they didn't have any evidence. Did they leak to get the special counsel like Comey admitted he did?
GRAHAM: All I can say is this is the most corrupt thing I've ever in my life. If the shoe were on the other foot, if the FBI agent liked Trump and hated Clinton and they got a dossier paid for by the Republican Party, it would be front page news everywhere. I'm glad the president let this information out to the public to show how corrupt it was.
As to Kavanaugh, he's going to get his day in court as well as Ms. Ford, and I'm going to look at everything in Judge Kavanaugh's life, not just this one accusation.
HANNITY: But you and I agree -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: And I feel good about it.
HANNITY: Let everybody testify. Everybody that he's known all throughout his career, and let the professor testify and let the judge testify. I think the American people.
Thank you, Senator.
GRAHAM: Thank you.
HANNITY: When we come back, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, John Solomon. Important breaking news on the deep state, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Here now with reaction to tonight's explosive breaking news, the author of the number one "New York Times" bestseller "The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump," Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter, "The Hill's" John Solomon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
John, we'll start with you. You broke the story. Lisa Page, how revealing, especially now that we look at the media leak strategy and the timeline of all of this, what she sent to Congress?
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: What you're really end up seeing with these text messages and the rest of the body of evidence that has now come forward is that these FBI agents, the Justice Department has allowed themselves to become part of a political attack machine, instead of being neutral following the evidence, they imposed the presumption of guilt and the absence of evidence. And it's terrible corrupting of what's supposed to be a very neutral counterintelligence process.
They knew when Mueller was being appointed there was no evidence yet and instead, the Justice Department embarked on a licking strategy to try to create the presumption that there was guilt and a reason to continue with this investigation. I think it's shameful.
HANNITY: No evidence, Sara, for nine long months and, just like Comey, it's very similar, this is the upper echelon, they have a media leak strategy. The purpose was to, what, literally set up so that a special counsel will be put in place, so they maybe can get Trump? Is this the insurance policy? Because it's all the same players?
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's all the same players, Sean, and it was also a pretext. I mean, think about this, they leak information to the media out of an unverified dossier and other information that had not been verified, and then they use that information to then expand their own investigation without ever saying anything to the courts. I think what we're going to find in these declassified documents, and I don't think it's going to take long for the president to get his hands on these and for Congress to get their hands on this.
I think what we're going to find is extraordinary, exculpatory evidence that should have been handed over to the intelligence surveillance court.
HANNITY: Like what? In other words, in the 302s we're going to find this? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARTER: That's right. I think we're not and not just in the 302s, Sean, but in all of the other evidence and documents, remember, not just the FISA application, we're going to see the truth there. We're going to find out what Bruce Ohr told the FBI and we're also going to get all the notes that were part of the gang of eight documents.
These are all important and they all going to reveal that this exculpatory evidence that should have been turned over to the courts.
And let me tell you this. According to the sources that I've spoken with that know what's in there would say that, once that goes public, you are going to see that the courts were lied to. That this was the biggest abuse of power in modern political history and the biggest abuse of power against a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court.
HANNITY: "The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump," that's the book that is number one on the New York Times and you wrote it. Is this it?
JARRETT: This is it. Every day seems to bring new evidence that proves the thesis of my book, that this was an elicit scheme the FBI and the Department of Justice know there was no evidence of collusion.
They violated the law when they launched their investigation in July of 2016, and now we find out today to the text message that when the special counsel was appointed, they didn't have any evidence of collusion.
HANNITY: For nine months.

JARRETT: -- to damage Trump and as a pretext to begin questioning people. They thought it would snowball and that this would undo the Trump presidency.
So many crimes have been committed here, not only deceiving the FISA court judges by concealing evidence but then here we find out through these text messages that they are looking highly classified information. That is a violation of the law, several different statutes.
HANNITY: What do you think, what do you think -- what are your sources saying, John, that we are going to see when this unredact -- when the unredaction take place the declassification obviously taking place now?
JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL: I suspect that we are going to find out that the FBI is monitoring an intrusion on the campaign in the political process and the transition, and the early president was much more intrusive than has been acknowledged publicly. Maybe not wiretapping but other surveillance techniques.
And I think we are going to be surprised by the amount, like Sara said, I think Sara has on the money. My sources are saying exactly the same thing. A lot of exculpatory information, a lot of derogatory information about the credibility of the witnesses ever using before the court that the court did not know about. And this is an honor system. Remember, there is no advocate for the accused--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: That's a fraud on the court, isn't it, John?
SOLOMON: It's a fraud on the court.
HANNITY: And it's a fraud to spy on a campaign in an election and post- election. It seems like all the leaking before all the leaking after President Trump was elected, it was all designed to destroy the president. Sara, is that your belief, the American people will see clearly?
CARTER: The American people will see it clearly. And, Sean, this was a fraud on the American citizen. On Carter Page. Imagine--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: He's going to join us tonight. Yes.
CARTER: Yes. Imagine if this happen to other American citizens? Now, we don't know how far the abuse has gone. With this -- is this just about Carter Page or are there going to be other cases that we don't know about where they went beyond and violated the law?
I mean, this is up to 10 years for the king classified information, it's what people could serve in prison time if they are charged.
HANNITY: Let me get and refer that to our lawyer. What is -- who are the people that you think, if there is justice, equal justice under the law and equal application of our laws, who gets indicted in this?
JARRETT: Anyone who signed on the FISA application because they didn't have the evidence and they never verified it. And every renewal it's supposed to have a new evidence and they didn't have it.
And the leaking of this information classified to the media.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Ten years.
JARRETT: Yes, 10 years. So, I mean, this is, Sean, the arrogance of power becomes addictive and intoxicating. Trump was a threat to their power, so they sought to bring him down.
HANNITY: Scary that this can happen in the United States of America. Sara, you used my words earlier and they came out of your mouth. The biggest abuse of power scandal in American history and it's unfolding. All three of you played a big part in it. You'll never get the Pulitzer that you deserve.
But truth matters, thank you all. When we come back, President Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, he's be here with reaction on all today's breaking news. And Ed Henry, a live report tonight from our nation's capital. Busy news night. Glad you're with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: So one week from today, the Senate judiciary committee will have another open hearing with Judge Brett Kavanaugh and also Professor Ford has been invited to testify as well.
Joining us live in Washington with more is our chief national correspondent, Ed Henry tonight. Ed, big news tonight.
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sean. Breaking tonight, Judge Kavanaugh as well as Professor Ford have both been invaded to testify in public next Monday by the Senate judiciary committee.
What's interesting the White House is saying tonight Kavanaugh is going to testify tomorrow if they want because he is so eager to deny the allegation and clear his name. His accuser, Dr. Ford, has allege that at a party in Maryland back in the 80's he pinned her to the bed, groped her through her clothes and when she tried to scream he put his hand on her mouth, and then after his friend Mark judge jumped on the bed and all three tumbled and she ran away.
But that friend has called the story nuts, he says he never Kavanaugh act that way and has no recollection of this ever happening.
And after a phone call with Kavanaugh today Republican Orrin Hatch's office said, quote, "He told Senator Hatch that he was not a party like the one she describes and that Dr. Ford who acknowledged to the Washington Post over the weekend that she did not remember key details about the incident may be mistaking him for someone else." That's Kavanaugh's version as told to Republican Orrin Hatch.
Now remember, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has known about an anonymous allegation along these lines since July and had not said anything until late last week which is something President Trump jumped on today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: He's an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge respected by everybody, never had even a little blemish on his record.
The FBI has I think gone through the process six times with him over the years where he went to higher and higher positions. Judge Kavanaugh spent quite a bit of time with Senator Feinstein and it wasn't even brought up at that meeting and she had this information.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Now a key Republican swing vote on all of this, Susan Collins also said she's wondering why the original anonymous letter from Dr. Ford was not dealt with sooner. But she and other Republicans like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker say they want a thorough investigation of facts before they will move forward on this process, Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Ed Henry in Washington. And here now with reaction is President Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow. Full disclosure he has done work for me, legal work for me in the past.
So I think Lindsey Graham actually has the right approach. And I think the president had the right approach. If there is going to be a slight delay, I want everybody to be certain. The American people have the right to understand.
The person that Professor Ford describes in the room has denied it. Then we have law clerks, then we have 65 people that knew him at the time. Then we have other students in high school and in college and in law school and law clerks and people that won't work with him in the Bush administration and all the time he has been a judge, there's not one other person that only says glowing things about him in including his former girlfriends at the time.
JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM: Well, look, Sean, Judge Kavanaugh has stated that he will testify before the Senate. he said we would be willing to do it tomorrow. Dr. Ford has been offered the opportunity to appear as well. I think what Lindsey Graham said says it all, you evaluate the situation and, there will be a voting.
And look, I mean, no one can question whether Judge Kavanaugh has the intellect to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. And if you are looking at the judicial philosophy he has over 300 published opinions.
So I think from that standpoint -- but you got to look at this. Look, in this day and a time, and I understand this. An allegation has been made, Judge Kavanaugh is going to respond and that's the appropriate way. The accuser is going to have her time as well and that should be an orderly and appropriate process. I think what the president has said is right, I think what Senator Graham has said is correct.
HANNITY: But I think when you look at the history this is why I think Americans, I think, I believe in the presumption of innocence. I want everybody to testify including Professor Ford.
But if you look at the history of Robert Bork and then Clarence Thomas, I think it gives people more reason to pause. And I don't think -- nobody was there. Nobody knows.
What if it's only resolved that this woman makes this allegation, the person that was supposedly also in the room says no and the judge says no, there's nothing else in his career that marks a blemish on his character, and he is the perfect gentleman, that's the words that so many people used that even dated them.
SEKULOW: Yes.
HANNITY: What then happens?
SEKULOW: That's why the Constitution, Sean, that's why the Constitution has this process. The president nominates and it's with the advice and consent of the senate that the nominee is confirmed or not confirmed to the position.
So what Senator Graham said what Senator Grassley has stated is they are going through a process pursuant to the Constitution and that's the appropriate way to respond to this.
HANNITY: Let me ask you about the declassification and redactions.
SEKULOW: Yes.
HANNITY: And someone said that might be a long process and others have said it could be done fairly expeditiously. Thoughts?
SEKULOW: Well, look, the president issued an order and the president has that authority under article two and he exercised it. He has the authority and he exercises that authority.
And now the question is, you are asking the length of time for the process where it will come out unredacted, that's intergovernmental. The government works on that. You know, I would assume it's going to move expeditiously.
But I think what's most important here is the American people are going to have a look finally at what actually was the beginning. What was it that started this inquiry in the first place?
And if John Solomon and Sara Carter are correct in their reporting, and the information is going to show some type of potential surveillance inside the Trump campaign, this would be an eye-opener. This would be shocking, this would create a situation where you have to look at the legitimacy of the beginning of the inquiry.
I mean, we all focus on the fact that the inquiry, it looks like started with the Christopher Steele dossier.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: But Lisa Page testifies as we now know.
SEKULOW: Yes.
HANNITY: That they had nothing nine months-
(CROSSTALK)
SEKULOW: She said after nine months nothing. But Sean, that's two years now.
HANNITY: But we now know also that there was a media leak strategy in the lead up to the appointment of the special counsel.
SEKULOW: Yes. Right. And that by the way, the media leak strategy in and of itself can be a violation of the law. So there is a host of problems from the top to bottom on this and we -- I've said that for a year and a half on this broadcast.
But you do have to point out that this inquiry started well before the appointment of the office of the special counsel before Bob Mueller's appointment and Lisa Page testified under oath that there was no evidence of collusion and, let me take it a step further here, Sean.
Peter Strzok and those messages back and forth said there was no there, there and that's why he was reluctant to go over initially to go over to the special counsel's office.
HANNITY: And interesting Bob Woodward said he looked hard and he found nothing.
SEKULOW: Yes, right.
HANNITY: Senator Burroughs said they found nothing in the Senate committee.
SEKULOW: Yes.
HANNITY: None of that ever gets reported. And it has been a non-stop never ending nearly two years of this crap--
(CROSSTALK)
SEKULOW: The thing speaks for itself, that's what we say in the law. The thing speaks for itself. The evidence is clear.
HANNITY: All right. Jay Sekulow, thank you for being with us. When we come back, the man at the middle of all of this, Carter Page weighs in on the president classifying the FISA documents and sending them out unredacted. A lot of that has to do with him. Him and attorney David Schoen, next. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Here with more reaction tonight's breaking news, Civil rights and criminal defense attorney David Schoen, and former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page.
Carter, apparently a lot of this has to do with you and how perhaps exculpatory evidence was withheld. But really, we know that FISA applications were all based, we're told by the Grassley-Graham memo and by the Nunes memo.
The bulk of information came from Hillary's bought and paid for phony debunked Russian dossier. You are at the center of this because they were spying on you. By the way, why have you never been indicted if you were such a horrible person that needed a year's worth of surveillance?
CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER: Sean, not only have I never been indicted, I've never been asked any question, which was a credible question as to anything I had possibly done wrong. So, it's just so incredibly stupid to begin with, that where do you even begin to start unraveling this? So we are starting to see this come out a little bit, yes.
HANNITY: What, and this gets to the nature of what you plan to do. I mean, I know Ray Donovan infamously or famously once said, where do I go to get my good name back? Where do you go to get your good name back and what are your plans legally?
PAGE: Sea, you know, the biggest question to me is fixing the disaster that this created for a democratic processes in the United States. You know, I've done it in Washington for a couple of days, talking to a number of people about potential legal strategies to work on that.
My biggest concern is all the damage that the stated to the U.S. government, and the mockery had made out of the Constitution. And you know, all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice and the FBI--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: But this is a great point.
PAGE: -- and the DNC. Yes.
HANNITY: How did this Hillary Clinton, David, bought and paid for unverified uncorroborated Russian dossier become the foundational materials or bulk of information to get a FISA warrant? How did they withhold that information to the judge?
Does that mean they committed fraud on the judge and on the FISA court? Never mind that the evidence was overwhelming in the beginning, and they fix an investigation into Hillary Clinton and they tried to go after that guy right in the middle of our screen here?
DAVID SCHOEN, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Absolutely. Any material omission or withholding of information from the FISA court violated that court's rule and the constitutional rights are the subject of it.
I think now we're headed toward the first step in writing these wrongs to the American people. Declassification is key, and let's be very clear because it's shameful that we are hearing protest station for members of Congress about the declassification.
Every American should demand full transparency and that is what the president is providing and this is his Spartacus moment, to use another reference.
Listen, the president has full authority under article two, section two, but more than that. President Obama in 2009, 2010 signed executive order 13526 that again affirmed the president has full authority as the final arbiter of what's classified and what's declassified.
More than that, the FISA court itself has rule 62 that puts that into effect and the FISA court presiding judge specifically wrote to two members of Congress earlier this year is saying the court has no objection to disclosure of these documents and it's for the executive branch to decide because the executive branch has an interest in that the court recognizes and maintain the integrity of ongoing law enforcement investigations and that is the court's words.
HANNITY: I would like to hear from the judges in this case. Carter Page, considering it's about you I would assume you would want to hear from them?
PAGE: I would love to. I actually sent a letter to the chief judge of the FISA court and, you know, I never got a response. What's even worse is that when the FBI declassified things, they sent it to the New York Times first which is in violation of the privacy act.
You know, they are supposed to -- if the documents are about yourself, you know, they should be the individual that it's about which should see it before they publish the entire world.
HANNITY: The New York Times.
PAGE: Exactly.
HANNITY: Last word, Mr. Schoen.
SCHOEN: Listen, declassification is absolutely the right move now. The president is serving the American people in the role for which he was elected. When he was elected, the American people gave him this power to declassify and determine what should declassified.
HANNITY: Yes.
SCHOEN: He's operating in the interest of full transparency and that's what every American should demand.
HANNITY: It's interesting that the only people freaking out tonight are people like shifty Schiff, Adam Schiff. The 400 -- Carter is listening, you know why? Because he is going to be proven a liar and that's my prediction tonight. Thank you all for being with us.
PAGE: Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: Carter, we'll have you back when this is redacted and released. Unredacted and released.
Colonel Oliver North and NRA with a new ad about people who kneel for the anthem, that's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Time for the video of the day. You'll going to love this. Colonel Oliver North and the NRA, they put out a new video over fellow Americans who decide to kneel during the national anthem. Take a look at what they put out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OLIVER NORTH, FOX NEWS HOST: When you take a knee during our national anthem, you disrespect the men and women who lost their limbs so you could spend your Sunday's playing games.
When you dishonor our flag, you turn your back on the families of heroes serving on the front lines, whose sacrifices make it possible for cameras to focus on your disgraceful protests.
When we teach children that police are the enemy, you've turned your back on the very law enforcement that keeps your stadium safe. We fight for the First Amendment as much as the second, but while you use it disgracefully, we use it to tell the truth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Powerful ad. We'll have more on that later in the week. That is all the time we have left this evening. We're always fair and balance. We're not the destroy-Trump media, we never will be. News you won't get anywhere else. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham standing by on our nation's capital. Laura?
