Let's go "Off the Record." Early Sunday, I began posting on GretaWire and Facebook that President Obama was not going to the march in Paris. I was scandalized - 40 world leaders marching arm-in-arm, but our president snubbing the French and other nations' leaders and didn't go. The president sent a terrible message: This was not important enough for him to go.
He is wrong. It was important. He should have gone. He could have gone. And today, Secretary of State John Kerry, perhaps trying to provide cover for the president, insulted those of us who think President Obama should have been there. Secretary Kerry calling the criticism of the president "quibbling," as though it's petty to want our president representing our nation, like other citizens of other nations had their presidents representing them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also today, Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitting the White House messed up, saying the White House should have sent high-profile official, but not conceding that the president himself should have gone. But as annoyed as I am, it's time to move on. We have bigger fish to fry, like Islamic extremists. Even if the Obama administration won't use that term, I will. How about you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
