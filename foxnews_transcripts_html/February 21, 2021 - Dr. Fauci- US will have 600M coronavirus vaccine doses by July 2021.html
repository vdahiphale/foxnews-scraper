CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.Deadly winter storms cripple Texas and devastate that state's power grid,prompting a wake-up call in the energy capital of the world.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R), TEXAS:  What happened this week to our fellow Texansis absolutely unacceptable.WALLACE (voice-over):  Billions of people struggling to recover from daysof power overages and now facing a shortage of drinking water. The crisispitting clean energy advocates against supporters of the oil and gasindustry.RICK PERRY (R), FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR:  If this Green New Deal goesforward, then we'll have more events like we've had in Texas, all acrossthe country.WALLACE:  We'll get the latest on the situation in Texas and sit down withBill Gates, who's invested billions in the development of cleantechnologies.Then --JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  That was a mistake in thecommunication. I said opening the majority of schools in K through 8thgrade because they are the easiest to open.WALLACE:  Mixed messages about when more students will return to theclassroom and where do we stand on the distribution of vaccines and theireffectiveness against new variants.We'll ask Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergyand Infectious Diseases.Plus --SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  In hindsight, I wouldn't have done it.WALLACE:  Critics slam Senator Ted Cruz for fleeing taxes in the midst ofits electrical power frees up for a sunny vacation in Mexico.We'll ask our Sunday panel how big a price Cruz will pay.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(MUSIC)(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.A deadly winter storm that first knocked out power has now created a wateremergency for 13 million Texans, half that state's population. PresidentBiden has approved a major disaster declaration and is considering a tripto the state to see the damage and the response.Meanwhile, the breakdown in the electrical grid has sparked a debate overthe state's energy policy.In a moment, we'll talk with Bill Gates about what happened in Texas andhis ideas for dramatically reshaping how we produce and consume energy.But, first, Casey Stegall has the latest on the fallout from this week'sdeep freeze in the Lone Star State.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This one is full of ice.CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A struggle to survivein Texas this week.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Without water and without like -- like electricityand all that, it's just bad.STEGALL:  For millions, the power outages lasted for days, days of no heatleft people shivering in their homes.Then bad problems got worse.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We actually noticed a water pipe broke more down thatway near the gym.STEGALL:  So many pipes froze and burst, infrastructure became compromised,leading to unsafe drinking water for millions with communities issuing boilwater advisories.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've been to several different stores and no one haswater.STEGALL:  Lines quickly began forming outside stores that were open butbasic supplies were hard to find.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.STEGALL:  Which sent thousands to food banks and water distributioncenters.MARK HENRY, GALVESTON COUNTY JUDGE:  We would have ordered evacuations. Wewarned the vulnerable people that they needed to make other plans.STEGALL:  Many are angry and demanding answers from ERCOT, the privateagency responsible for running the Texas power grid, which is independentfrom the rest of the country and not subject to federal regulation.ABBOTT:  I'm taking responsibility for the current status of ERCOT. Again,I find what's happened acceptable.STEGALL:  Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered an emergency investigationinto what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again.(END VIDEOTAPE)STEGALL (on camera):  All of Texas' 254 counties have been impacted. Thestorm is already to be expected to be more costly than Hurricane Harvey's$19 billion worth of insurance claims -- Chris.WALLACE:  Casey Stegall reporting from Dallas. Casey, thanks for that.The deep freeze in Texas and the breakdown in the state's power grid haverenewed questions about climate change and how we produce the energy weneed.I sat down earlier with Bill Gates, who is out with a new book, "How toAvoid a Climate Disaster," and we began with the troubles in Texas theselast few days.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Bill, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday". BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT:  Great to talk to you. WALLACE:  Millions of people were affected by the power outages in Texasthis week, and the governor, Greg Abbott, blamed it on alternative energysources.Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX):  Well, this shows how the Green New Deal would bea deadly deal for the United States of America. If the Biden administration is going to try to eradicate fossil fuels inthe United States, every state is going to constantly have challenges likewhat America has seen take place in Texas right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  The governor says that wind turbines, especially, failed andcreated this crisis. Your response? GATES:  Well, it's not at all true. The failure to weatherize some of thenuclear sensors (ph), the natural gas plants, and even some of the wind areresponsible for their power shortages. And the wind is a tiny part of it.It was mostly the thermal generators that went offline, because theyhaven't been weatherized. Obviously, wind works in North Dakota, it works in Alaska. We know how toweatherize wind turbines. The wind does come and go, but what was shut down, the vast majority, isthermal plants here. So, you know, there is a reliability issue that we'll have to design thesystem, including more transmission. You know, Texas over time, will want to connect up, so that when it doesget shortages, it's able to draw on other parts of the country. WALLACE:  As you know, a lot of people here at FOX News that watch the --watch us question whether climate change is real and how much of it ismanmade, and they also question that -- whether it's heat or freezing cold,whether it's floods or drought, that it's all climate change. So, make your best case to the folks who, this past week, have beenfreezing in Texas. GATES:  Well, the change in the wind patterns is allowing those cold frontsto come down from Canada more often. There's a pattern of wind that, as you-- as it gets warmer, that breaks down. There's no doubt that we're putting CO2 into the atmosphere. There's nodoubt that that increases temperatures and that affects the weather. And so, the ill effects, whether it's, you know, farming in Texas beingchanged or wildfires or coral reefs dying off, there's super hard evidenceof the ocean rising. I do think it's fair that people have different views on the tactics todeal with climate change. In fact, you know, having both parties thinkingabout that is going to be very important as we go forward. But this is a real challenge, and it's great to see that particularly youngRepublicans are joining in and saying that this is something they careabout, beyond their own individual success, morally preserving theseecosystems, allowing a livable planet, they care about that. WALLACE:  But critics say, you know, it's easy to talk about getting offfossil fuel, it's easy to talk about going to a plant-based diet, but thereality is that hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs --that the coalminers in West Virginia or the livestock ranchers in Nebraskawill be wiped out. GATES:  Well, it's very important, as we solve this problem, that we notcause those community dislocations. We have a 30-year transition period. The skill sets involved, whether it'smaking clean hydrogen, sequestering CO2, the engineering skill sets, thethings that those workers do will be important. In fact, we're going to have to almost triple the size of the electric gridand build all that transmission. And so, it's not like there's going to bea shortage of jobs overall, it's just balancing to make sure that eachcommunity gets into the plan. WALLACE:  Let's talk about your book. You say that we have to go from the51 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions that we generate in thiscountry every year -- from 51 billion tons to zero -- zero by the year2050, and that anything less than that will precipitate a catastrophe. GATES:  Well, yes. The CO2 stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years,and that's what forces the temperatures to go up.And so, it's really the sum of all those emissions starting in theindustrial age that's causing this temperature forcing with all of its illeffects. You know, there's no magic date that, it's all great until then, and it'sterrible once you cross that threshold. It's pretty linear as far as weknow. 2050 happens to be the soonest realistic date for the world to change allof these source emissions -- which are actually quite broader than mostpeople are aware of, because it's got things like steel and cement, notjust cars and electricity. WALLACE:  I want to pick up on that because you say in your book, don'tfool yourselves, this is going to be hard. And you have a chart that I wantto put up in your book of how much greenhouse gas is emitted by what we do. Making things - cement, steel, plastic 31 percent of all emissions,plugging in electricity 27 percent, growing things 19 percent, gettingaround transportation 16 percent, and keeping warm and cool 7 percent. You say a lot of the things that we're focused on now like electricvehicles are important, but that's the easy part. GATES:  Exactly. If all you had to do was a 30 percent reduction, then youshould take the easiest 30 percent. Because the goal is to get to zero, you've got to work in parallel, notjust on the easy stuff, but also on the very hard stuff. You've got toincrease R&D budgets. You've got to have lots of risk capital to make theseproducts in a new way, and hopefully create companies that not only buildjobs but export these green approaches to the entire world. WALLACE:  You admit at the very start of your book in the opening pagesthat you are an imperfect messenger though all this -- you admit, youacknowledge you live in big houses, you fly around in private jets and havea big carbon footprint. So, how do you answer people who say, well, who's Bill Gates to preach tous? GATES:  That's absolutely right.I am offsetting my carbon emissions by buying clean aviation fuel andfunding carbon capture and funding low-cost housing projects to useelectricity instead of a natural gas. And so, I've -- I have been able to eliminate it, and it was amazing to mehow expensive that was. We've -- that cost of being green, the greenpremium, we've got to drive that down. But, to me, my experience in innovation and thinking about the rightmetrics, I felt like, if we have this idealistic generation and thiswonderful goal, we need a plan and that my experience could help contributeto that plan. WALLACE:  Then there are the critics on the left who say you are behind thecurve, and that, in fact, you should be supporting the Green New Deal andgoing for zero net emissions, not in 2050, but in 2030. GATES:  Yes, it's completely unrealistic to think we could eliminateemissions by 2030. And not seeing that this problem is hard is -- will be part of thedifficulty of getting engaged into it. So, where I come out, and I'll try to have great debates with people, isthat it's very hard. We're going to have to use all 30 years, but it's notimpossible. WALLACE:  And what happens if we don't make it, if we don't get to zero netemissions by 2050? What -- how will our daily lives be different? GATES:  Well, the migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war,which was somewhat (ph) weather dependent, we're going to have 10 times asmuch migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable. Youwon't be able to farm or go outside during the summer. The wildfires, the -- even the farming productivity in the south of theU.S., the droughts will reduce productivity very dramatically. And, you know, it's all a matter of degree. If we wait 10 more years, it'snot as bad as if we wait 20 or you wait 30, because the temperature justkeeps going up, and it's going up more rapidly than it has in naturalhistory. But the instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peakof the pandemic and going up every year. WALLACE:  In the time we have left, I want to ask you about a couple ofother subjects. You have come on "FOX News Sunday" a couple of times in the last year totalk about the pandemic. How do you think we're doing right now, in termsof vaccine manufacturing and distributing, in terms of reopening schoolsand our general economy? GATES:  We'll have the five vaccines that all work very well. Somewhat lessagainst the variants, and so we may need a third shot for some people. Butthis is giving us light at the end of the tunnel. We do need to get the logistics right, and then we'll be limited by thedemand. You know, in minority communities, had (ph) people who are trustedspoken out about the benefits of getting the vaccine. But I am hopeful that, you know, we're going to get more schools reopened,we'll -- by the time we get to the fall, we should avoid a wave therebecause the level of vaccination will be very high. WALLACE:  Finally, Twitter has banned Donald Trump permanently, andFacebook is considering doing to the same. What do you think of that? GATES:  Well, I'm, you know, just one citizen on this issue. The -- I thinkhe said a lot of things about the illegitimacy of the election that arecorrosive, but the idea that that's -- you end up with a lifetime ban, youknow, that -- it seems like we should discuss, you know -- we don't topartition and have, you know, a social network for one party and anothersocial network. We want to have a common base where we're exchanging ideasand thoughts. So, I think these are early days on how we keep the good parts of socialmedia, and yet not spread violence or, you know, vaccine denial, Holocaustdenial. There's got to be some way that, between the government and the well-meaning actors, we draw the line so we keep the open debate without thecorrosive parts. WALLACE:  Bill Gates, the name of the book, "How to Avoid a ClimateDisaster". Thanks so much for talking with us again.GATES:  Thank you, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Up next, vaccines, variants and continuing questions aboutreopening America's schools.Dr. Anthony Fauci returns to "FOX News Sunday" when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Cases are down, vaccinations are up. But there is still no end insight for the COVID pandemic.Joining us now to answer some questions we all have, Dr. Anthony Fauci, theWhite House chief medical adviser.  And, Doctor, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday."  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  Thank you, Chris. It's good to be with you.  WALLACE:  We have seen a five-week decline in the number of COVID cases,down 69 percent over that time period. Between vaccines and measures likemask-wearing, does that mean that we're beating the virus or is there stilla chance that we're going to have yet another wave?  FAUCI:  Well, we -- great question, and I'm glad you gave me theopportunity to answer that. We really need to keep our guard up because wehave variants out there that are circulating that have a greater degree ofcapability of transmitting from person to person. I refer specifically tothe U.K. variant, the 117 that we talk about.  The slope of downward trajectory, Chris, is really very good and veryimpressive. It's very sharp if you look at it. The one thing we don't wantto do is to get complacent that it's coming down so sharply that now we'reout of the woods, because we are still at a baseline of daily infectionsthat's quite troublesome.  We're not at that very high level of 300,000 to 400,000 cases per day, butwe are at a level that's still, if you look at the big picture of things,is a lot of cases per day. Because we want that baseline to get very, verylow. We had the same problem months and months ago when we had peaked incertain areas of the country and were coming down, and then all of a suddenwe got to a baseline that was unacceptably high. And then, bingo, it wentright back up as soon as things happened like people got a little bit loosewith their mitigation measures.  So bottom line message, I want to keep going on with the -- (CROSSTALK) FAUCI:  Yes, sorry, go ahead.  WALLACE:  No, no, I'm sorry. Don't -- people want to hear you more than me.Let me ask you a couple of questions about vaccines. The country is nowvaccinating an average of 1.7 million people a day. Will that number keepgoing higher? And the question that we all keep asking, which is, when willwe have enough supply so that anyone who wants the vaccine can get it? FAUCI:  Yes, when you start seeing, well, we have enough supply to have it,how many vaccines would you have? The president said that and it'sabsolutely correct. By July we will have enough. We will have the 600million doses that we contracted for from two companies.  It is very likely that before then we are going to start vaccinating peoplewho are outside of the priority groups and essentially represent anyone andeveryone. But the number that the president gave, or the month that thepresident gave was absolutely correct. By July, we will have in-hand enoughvaccine to be able to vaccinate virtually anybody and everybody. It will be600 million doses for 300 million people. WALLACE:  Meanwhile, as you pointed out, the virus keeps mutating andthere's been some recent troublesome, worrisome news that the vaccines, thePfizer and the Moderna, are considerably less effective against the 351South African variant. What are the chances that, even if you getvaccinated, that you have the two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, that at somepoint, you're going to need -- they're going to have to develop and we'regoing to have to get a booster shot to deal with this or other mutations? FAUCI:  Chris, that's going to depend completely on what the penetrance andthe prevalence of this mutation is. Let me give you some examples that Ithink could explain it. Right now, the 117 variant, namely the one from the U.K., is reallybecoming more prevalent in this country. And the modelists predict that bythe time you get to the end of March, it might be the dominant one in thiscountry. The good news about that, despite the fact that that isconcerning, the good news is that both vaccines, the Pfizer and theModerna, that we are distributing now are very good in protecting againstthat particular variant. But as you suggest correctly, the situation is not the case with the SouthAfrican variant. Fortunately, that's not dominant at all in this country.However, the fact is that it does not protect -- the vaccines do notprotect as well against the acquisition of clinically apparent disease withthe South African. It looks like it will be pretty good in preventing severe disease leadingto hospitalization and death, but it's only approximately about 50 percenteffective in getting the prevention from any disease at all. But the right answer to your question, if in fact this becomes moredominant, we may have to get a version of the vaccine that is directedspecifically against the South African isolate. And in fact, we are alreadydoing preliminary and early experiments to develop such a variant of thevaccine to address that particular mutation. WALLACE:  President Biden came in saying that they were going to run thingsmore smoothly, that they were going to follow the science. But in the lastcouple of weeks there have been some garbled messages coming out of thisadministration and I want to ask you about that. Last Sunday, on this program, the CDC director said that teachers do nothave to have -- it's preferable, but they do not have to have the vaccinein order for schools to reopen. But this week, we got a somewhat differentmessage from Vice President Harris. Take a look, sir. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Teachers should be apriority. In terms of vaccination -- (CROSSTALK) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR:  But if they're not vaccinated, is itsafe for them? HARRIS:  Well, I think that we have to decide if we can put in place safemeasures. GUTHRIE:  The CDC has said they don't have to be vaccinated to go back toschool. Of course, it's a priority. HARRIS:  We think this they should be the priority.  We think they should -- we think they should be a priority. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  That sounds like Vice-President Harris was following the teachersunions, not the science.FAUCI:  No, I -- Chris, I mean, if you want to parse words, I was listeningvery carefully. What Vice President Harris said it should be a priority.She did not say it's a sine qua non that unless you get vaccinated youcannot come into the school and teach. So what we're saying -- and let me state it clearly because I believestrongly that it is completely compatible with both -- with what Dr.Walensky said and what the vice president said is that clearly we want tomake the vaccination of teachers a high priority. They all within theessential personnel in society and we want that priority to be high. What I have said and I'll say it again today, it should not be sine quanon. In other words, you cannot go into the school unless you'revaccinated. We're not saying that. We're saying we're doing whatever we canto protect the safety of the children and the teachers, but it is not arequirement. It's a priority, but it's not a requirement for the teachersto get back into school. WALLACE:  I think the only point I was making is she refused to say it'snot a requirement when she was asked by Savannah several times. Let me ask you about another one. There's been some confusion about whenschools will be fully reopened five days a week, and look at thiscontradiction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Teaching at least one day a weekin the majority of schools by day 100. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No, that's not true. That'swhat was reported, that's not true. And it was a mistake in thecommunication. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  The president there was contradicting his own press secretary.Is it a mistake frankly for politicians and even for public health expertslike yourself to do too much projective? FAUCI:  Well, you know, it's very interesting that you say that, because atthe very end of the president's press briefing following his visit toMichigan, to the Pfizer plant, he said exactly that, that we've got to becareful that when you get asked to make a projection, you have to respond,but you've got to make sure that people understand that it's merely aprojection. And a lot of mitigating circumstances can occur that wouldmodify that. So, I mean, the president himself has said exactly that when he was askedabout the precision of these types of projections. We've just been through,Chris, a similar situation when an unexpected, you know, phenomenon ofnature, a very terrible ice storm, delayed 6 million doses of the vaccinegetting out. Now, we're going to overcome that by working double time to get back towhere we should be by the middle of the week, but that was a completelyunanticipated glitch. That is going to continue to occur as we go on andon.So, that's what the president was talking about. You make a projection, butyou've got to be careful because those things can change. CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: And, of course, we reporters keep asking youto make the projections. I got about two minutes, I want to squeeze two questions in, Doctor. The administration talks a lot about getting kids in grades K-8 back toschool, but does much less talk about kids in high school. And I want toask you about them. Take a look at these numbers. Forty-seven percent of students in K-8 arenow going to school full time, but only 33 percent of students in grades 9-12 are going to school full time. Doctor, we're talking about the kids that are more at risk of getting thedisease and also spreading the disease. But at the same time, they're notable to get the vaccines. The lowest cutoff age is 16 for Pfizer, I thinkit's 18 for Moderna. So what happens to these kids? They seem like they're kind of caught in atrap. FAUCI: Well, you know, in some respects, they're in that zone. That's thereason why we are hoping that we will be able to -- in fact, all of thestudies right now from at least two companies are trying to get thoseindividuals, those youngsters who are in that high school group, thathopefully by the time we get to the full term, that they will bevaccinated. And that's why we're pushing on those studies to get themvaccinated. That will likely occur in the fall. I can't say it's going to be on day oneof when the school starts in the fall term. On the other hand, when youhave younger children, it likely will not be before the beginning of thefirst quarter of 2022. WALLACE: Finally, and I've got about a minute left, Vice President Harristalked recently about how this administration basically had to start fromscratch when it came to vaccine distribution. And on Friday President Bidensaid this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My predecessor, as my motherwould say, God love him, failed to order enough vaccines, failed tomobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccinecenters. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Doctor, is that true? FAUCI: Well, again, a lot of things were said just there. The one thingthat we can say is that the -- the -- the infrastructure and the capabilityand the planning of getting the vaccines distributed into the arms ofpeople was really quite vague, as I've said before. I mean, obviously, there's -- it wasn't that nothing was done because wedeveloped a vaccine, we got them manufactured, and they were shipped. But,you know, as I've said before, you know, you have to give the vicepresident a break. She didn't mean from scratch that nothing. I mean,obviously, we had vaccines that we were giving to people even before theend of the year. So what she was referring to, and I -- and I'm sure you can ask her againand she'll say it, was the process of smoothly getting it into people'sarms, which was a difficulty very -- very early on. We're just getting overthat right now. And that's what the president is doing with regard togetting community vaccine centers, getting the vaccine into pharmacy,getting mobile units --WALLACE: Right.FAUCI: And getting vaccinators, as the president says, people who areactually putting it into people's arms. I believe the vice president was referring to the fact that if you'retalking about those things that I just mentioned, they were not in placewhen the president came in as -- following the inauguration. WALLACE: Dr. Fauci, thank you. Thanks for your time this weekend. It'salways good to talk with you, sir. FAUCI: Same here. Thank you very much, sir. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the furor overTed Cruz and his decision to head to sunny Cancun while folks back in hishome state of Texas were shivering.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Senator Ted Cruz gets blistered for skipping townduring his state's power outages.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): I certainly regret that this has become a distractionat a time when so many Texans are hurting and frustrated and mad.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what it means for the senator'spolitical future, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Yesterday my daughters asked if they could take atrip with some friends. And Heidi and I agreed. So I flew down with themlast night. I dropped them off here and then I'm headed back to Texas.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Well, that was Ted Cruz's original story as he headed back homeafter the world learned he'd left freezing Texas this week for a trip tosunny, 80-degree Mexico. But that was not the end of it.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Senator Mitch McConnell's formerchief of staff, Josh Holmes, pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson and MoElleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and PublicService.So, Josh, part of the problem -- I guess the biggest part of the problemwas the fact that Ted Cruz thought he should go down to Mexico in themiddle of this freeze up in the first place, but compounding that was thefact that his story kept changing.As we say, first he was just dropping his family often and coming back thenext day. Then it turned out that his wife Heidi was inviting friends tocome join them through the weekend.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): I was trying to be a dad. And -- and all of us havemade decisions. When you've got two girls who have been cold for two -- twodays and haven't had heat or power --And I'd initially planned to stay through the weekend and to work remotelythere.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Josh, how damaging -- and -- and why is it that -- that Cruz, whoonce called your former boss Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor,why is he so unpopular with senators of both parties?JOSH HOLMES, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDING PARTNER, CAVALRY, AND FORMER CHIEF OFSTAFF TO SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, look, I think Senator Cruz made amistake. It's as -- it's as simple as that. And I actually found a lot ofhumanity in his response. Obviously, this was all unfolding while he was inthe air on the way to Cancun and -- and -- and trying to get his family outof Texas, which, you know, as a senator, was a mistake. He should not havedone it. He apologized. He was right to do so.But I think the other piece of this, and the reason it's ultimately notgoing to hurt him politically is, the media distortion of how Republicansare treated versus how Democrats are treated. There have been 35 -- 35separate news stories in "The Washington Post" alone on Senator Cruz andCancun. Noting, by the way, there is no actual difference that has happenedhere as a result of his trip. Nothing had been done or not done as a resultof his trip."Nightly News" broadcast dedicated two and three times the amount ofcoverage to Senator Cruz than they did Andrew Cuomo and the nursing homescandal.So, I mean, the message that that sends to -- to conservatives across thecountry is, you know -- and if you're putting -- if you're a Democrat andyou put nursing home policies in place that contribute to the deaths ofperhaps thousands of people, you get an Emmy. But if you take an ill-timedbeach vacation, like Senator Cruz did, you -- you're run out of house andhome.Ultimately, until we start grappling with the differences of how thesethings are -- are covered by the national media, I think we're going to bereally disappointed by what motivates voters across this country.WALLACE: Well, let me say, that we're going to cover Andrew Cuomo in amoment, but I just want to ask you, Kristen, about this.I think part of the problem also is that this is exactly the kind of thingthat Ted Cruz -- the kind of mistake that Ted Cruz would jump on if ithappened to somebody else. And it has happened to some other people.In December, Cruz attacked the mayor of Austin for going to Mexico duringthe pandemic with this, hypocrites, complete and utter hypocrites. And healso takes on his own party. In 2017 he attacked Republican Governor ChrisChristie for visiting a closed beach when the New Jersey state governmentwas shut down.Kristen, is this the kind of thing that voters will remember?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, ECHELON INSIGHTS AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I thinkvoters will remember how you make them feel. And if you make them feel likeyou don't care about them, they do or member that sort of thing. That's whysome politicians thrive. They -- they persuade voters that they understandwhat they're going through. I think for a lot of voters they didn't havethe opportunity to fly to Cancun to escape the cold from Texas.But I think the thing that is even more frustrating about the -- the wholediscourse around Texas, as you mentioned earlier in the show, fights overthings like, well, do we need any wind farms, do we need any clean energy,there's a lot of really important conversations to be had about the need tomake our infrastructure in this country more resilient. And I just worrythat we've spent more time worrying about Ted Cruz trying to get amargarita than what I think is the most important thing, which is makingsure that our country can be more resilient against all kinds of threats,including more extreme weather.WALLACE: All right, let's turn to New York Governor -- Democratic GovernorAndrew Cuomo, who's in much more serious problem for his handling of -- ofCOVID deaths inside nursing homes.Mo, the FBI is investigating and it looks like the Democratic-controlledlegislature will vote this week to strip Cuomo of his emergency powers tohandle the pandemic.Here was the governor this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I was not aggressive enough in knocking down thefalsity. We were busy. We were doing our job. We were trying to save lives.No excuses.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Mo, can Andrew Cuomo tough this one out?MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE, FORMERDNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, AndrewCuomo has shown his ability to be pretty resilient in New York politics.But this is -- this is a pretty serious moment for him. And I think he'sgot to recalibrate a little bit how -- how he deals with things movingforward.You know, there's two underlying issues here. There's the policy of how hehandled the nursing homes in the early days of the pandemic, and thenthere's the -- the reporting of the data. I think the second one is what'sreally catching up with him right now.Now, I do think -- I agree with the governor that there is a lot of badinformation that's out there about what was reported and what wasn't. But,at the end of the day, I do think, and he even admitted, they did not do agood job of reporting the data. They did not do a good job of reporting thenumber of deaths. They made some unfortunate comments about that and peopleare freaked out. People in New York are freaked out. Too many people died.And I don't know how he's going to turn the corner on this when there doesseem to be a tremendous amount of bipartisan anger towards him right now.WALLACE: Josh, I just want to finish this up -- this segment, with you.You know, it isn't just the reporting and it isn't just the communication.There was also the original decision to say that people who were sick,elderly people who were sick and -- at a time when there was concernhospitals were overwhelmed, should go back to nursing homes. And that,obviously, seems to have been a bad decision and everything else flowedfrom that.But to go to Mo's point, this is bipartisan. The most damning report so farhas come from the Democratic attorney general of New York and you'regetting an awful lot of criticism from Democratic members of the statelegislature who are now calling for stripping Governor Cuomo of hisemergency powers.HOLMES: Yes, no, that's absolutely right. And hats off to thebipartisanship in that regard.I think the -- the most disappointing part about an awful lot of this isthese decisions were made at the outset, right? The nursing home decisionsthat ultimately cost thousands of lives potentially were made at the outsetand available and everyone knew about it for months and months and monthsand yet everybody was sort of obsessive with his daily press conferences,the jokes, the candor, his daughters, all of that, and now it's allbeginning to catch up to him.I think in some ways he's going to begin to get a worse political situationbecause of the levity that he had during the crisis itself. I'm not surethat Andrew Cuomo is going to survive this one.WALLACE: Survive meaning that he will have to resign and not serve his fullterm?HOLMES: Yes. Politically speaking, this is extremely damaging. Now, whetherhe can hold out, we'll see. But they're already talking about taking awayhis emergency powers in regards to COVID and -- and basically rendering himimpotent as governor of New York, which, you know, of course is an amazingthing to consider when you consider his -- his -- where he was three monthsago.WALLACE: Right.Politics is a tough business. I'm glad we're all in TV news. It's a -- it'sa cakewalk by comparison.Panel, we have to take a break here, but up next, the Trump-McConnell feudand the growing divide inside the GOP.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): There's no question done (ph) that PresidentTrump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events ofthe day.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: That was Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on the dayDonald Trump was acquitted by the Senate.But the former president wasted no time firing back with this statement.Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republicansenators are going to stay with him, they will not win again.And we're back now with the panel.Kristen, where is the Republican Party right now? How much sway does formerPresident Trump still have with Republican voters and thus with Republicanofficials?ANDERSON: Right now this is a party that is very divided. About half of theparty is with Donald Trump. They want him to run for president again, theywould choose him in a primary and think of themselves more as Trumpsupporter's then as Republicans first.But then there's the other half of the party. They're interested in lookingat folks from Ted Cruz to Ron DeSantis down in Florida, to Nikki Haley,even Mike Pence. And they're interested in seeing the party do what's next.I think until a leader really emerges that can both satisfy the desires ofTrump voters to have someone whose going to be a fighter for them with apopulist agenda, but who can also be someone to speak to those moredisaffected Republicans who is different than Donald Trump in that way,until you have a leader that can unify the party, I think things are goingto be pretty tough for the GOP.WALLACE: Josh, your former boss, Mitch McConnell, set off quite a battlewith Donald Trump this week. Is McConnell going to wrestle Donald Trump forcontrol of the party? And what happens if Trump, and he says he's going todo this, starts putting up his own candidates to take on Republicanincumbents in GOP primaries in 2022?HOLMES: Well, look, Chris, this isn't a binary choice between Trump andsomething else. I mean basically the disagreement here is about the formerpresident not appreciating the fact that Senator McConnell spoke out andspoke the truth about January 6th. That's it. It's nothing to do withpolicy, it has nothing to do with candidates, it has nothing to do withanything beyond that.You know, I noticed that letter that you read, the statement or whateveryou call it, you know, is pretty rife with inaccuracies. But the -- the --the most glaring to me was that somehow the former president was teachingSenator McConnell how to win. I mean this is somebody who I think even hiscritics regard as the most significant Senate leader since LBJ. He's wonre-election seven times and eight times as -- as leader of his conference.So he's leading the party.The party is actually in a pretty strong place. President Trump and hissupporters have a massive, massive part of that going forward. But we'retalking about a very even divided Congress. Not anything like where theyfound themselves ten years ago when they were out of power and at the -- atthe brink of irrelevance.WALLACE: Mo, are Democrats just sitting back and enjoying the fight insidethe GOP?ELLEITHEE: Yes. I mean, look, it is not -- this is not the heyday of theRepublican Party.Look, I think there's something that Senator Lindsey Graham said the otherday that I -- that I thought was really telling, where he said something tothe effect of, Donald Trump was -- was really good for conservative ideals.I don't think we can get done what we want to get done. I don't think wecan accomplish our goals without him.And I think that speaks to a real danger within the Republican Party thatif this whole party gets wrapped around him, gets wrapped around anysingular person, that's a problem for them. It's not about the ideals, it'snot about the ideology, it's about the singular person.So I think what Kristen said a few minutes ago was really important.Someone else needs to step up, or multiple people need to step up and startto try to make the -- what the conservative argument to Republicans that --that appreciated some of Trump's populism but also believe in that -- inthat center-right ideology that's defined the party for so long. Someoneelse needs to make that compelling case because right now it feels like toomany Republican leaders are just kind of falling into that Lindsey Grahamspace of, we just got to wrap her hopes around this one guy and -- andcater to him and his supporters or else we're done.WALLACE: All right.Then there's President Biden, who emerged on the virtual world stage thisweek with this declaration.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is back. TheTransatlantic Alliance is back. And we are not looking backward. We arelooking forward together.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Kristen, the president talked about re-engaging with our allies,he talked about confronting China especially, but also Russia, and hetalked about re-engaging with Iran on the nuclear deal.How effective do you think as policy and how effective as politics?ANDERSON: Well, politics is -- is an easier thing to answer because formany voters they're much more focused at this point on domestic concerns,things like the economy and the handling of COVID-19.But in terms of the policy itself, I think, you know, tackling the threatof China has to be the major focus of this administration. And being ableto demonstrate that they're willing to be -- to be tough. That's a bigthing that former President Trump did that sort of rallied his supportersand was in some ways a very correct diagnosis of the way that our politicsinternationally have been shifting as China has emerged stronger andstronger, posing a greater and greater threat. So it will -- it will beimportant to see what kinds of actions this administration tries to putbehind talking tough about China. But that's certainly a good direction ifit's really where they go.WALLACE: Josh, 30 seconds, do you see any Republican buy-in to the Bidenforeign policy?HOLMES: It -- it feels exactly the same as the Obama foreign policy, Chris.And -- and the thing is, you're already seeing the repercussions of some ofthat. You saw Iran now discussing ejecting some of -- some of themonitoring of nuclear sites, it beginning to sort of try to push thebuttons of the Biden administration again to see how far that they can go.Look, politically-speaking, this is not very popular and I think from apolicy standpoint it's even worse.WALLACE: All right, thank you, panel, see you next Sunday.And we'll be right back with a final word.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Before we go, we want to tell you about this program note.Be sure to tune in to Fox News Channel tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern for aninteresting special, "Rush Limbaugh: His Words."
