BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Dana. Thank you. Good evening.I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, President Donald J. Trump is in the history books todayas the only American president to be impeached twice. The House ofRepresentatives in the historic bipartisan vote impeaching the presidentthis time on a single charge of incitement of insurrection. Ten Republicansvoted with Democrats to impeach. It's the latest sign of collapse of apresidency that will forever now be marred by last week's deadly riot onCapitol Hill. The case now goes to the Senate, but the Senate majorityleader is already saying there will be no trial before President Trumpleaves office.And just moments ago, a video from the president, we expect to have thathere. We'll play it for you on SPECIAL REPORT.Meantime, the nation's capital is starting to lock down. There are moreNational Guard troops in Washington D.C. tonight than there are in Iraq andAfghanistan combined. Many of them armed as security threats are on therise.We have Fox team coverage. Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the nextsteps. John Roberts at the White House with that new reaction fromPresident Trump, but we begin with Chief Congressional Correspondent MikeEmanuel with an historic day one week after the riot on Capitol Hill. Goodevening, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Bret, good evening to you. In this historic day of debate overimpeachment, some Republicans were critical of President Trump saying heshould have taken action to call off the mob rushing the Capitol one weekago. A week after that attack, the president was impeached by Congress.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The resolution is adopted --EMANUEL (voice over): Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to impeachPresident Trump for the second time.PELOSI: He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that weall love.EMANUEL: That House Republican leaders said President Trump bearsresponsibility for last week's attack but offered an alternative toimpeachment.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I think a fact-finding commission and a censureresolution would be prudent. Unfortunately, that is not where we are today.EMANUEL: Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan countered the impeachmentargument by saying this will only further divide the country.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): We should be focused on bringing the nationtogether. Instead, Democrats are going to impeach the president for asecond time, one week -- one week before he leaves office, why?EMANUEL: The vote against President Trump comes exactly one week after theriot at the Capitol. The charge, incitement of insurrection, in oneDemocrats suggesting the mob had inside help.REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND (D-LA): Some of my colleagues, some of which may wellbe co-conspirators suggests that we shouldn't punish Trump for his actionsin order to unify the country. That is the climax of foolishness.EMANUEL: California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock says the timingis mean spirited.REP. TOM MCCLINTOCK (R-CA): I cannot think of a more petty, vindictive andgratuitous act than to impeach and already defeated president a week beforehe has to leave office.EMANUEL: The biggest name to break ranks was House Republican ConferenceChair Liz Cheney, who said the president could have immediately andforcefully intervened to stop the violence and said "There has never been agreater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and hisoath to the Constitution."Today, several other Republicans announced they were also in favor.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My vote to impeach our sitting president is not a fearbased decision.EMANUEL: Now, Jim Jordan, Matt Rosendale of Montana, Marjorie Taylor Greeneof Georgia and Andy Biggs of Arizona, are saying Cheney should resign fromher leadership post.REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): The reality is she's not representing theconference. She's not representing the Republican ideals. And I think thatthat's a problem and she should not be our conference chair anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): Cheney says she's not going anywhere. Democrats jumpedon Cheney scathing critique of the president, using the words to urgeRepublican colleagues to join with her and vote to impeach, Bret.BAIER: Mike Emanuel on the Hill. Mike, thanks.As mentioned, President Trump has responded. He has just released a video.This is a White House video from the Oval Office, this was not in the pool.There were not reporters in the room. This is a White House video, but itis in response to the impeachment vote and we want to play it for you onSPECIAL REPORT.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My fellow Americans, I wantto speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week.As I have said, the incursion of the U.S. Capitol, struck at the very heartof our republic, it angered and appalled millions of Americans across thepolitical spectrum.I want to be very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we sawlast week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country,and no place in our movement.Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation'smost sacred traditions and values.Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything ourmovement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse politicalviolence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement,or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threatenor harass their fellow Americans.If you do any of these things, you're not supporting our movement, you'reattacking it, and you're attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it.Tragically over the course of the past year, made so difficult because ofCOVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We haveseen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation anddestruction. It must stop.Whether you are on the right or on the left, a Democrat or Republican,there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions.America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last weekwill be brought to justice.Now, I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda, to bethinking of ways to ease tensions, calm, tampers, and help to promote peacein our country.There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being plannedin the coming days, both here in Washington and across the country. I havebeen briefed by the U.S. Secret Service on the potential threats.Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasizethat there must be no violence, no law breaking, and no vandalism of anykind. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of lawenforcement.I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintainorder. In Washington D.C. we are bringing in thousands of National Guardmembers to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safelyand without incident.Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at theCapitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredibleAmerican citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderationand grace. We will get through this challenge, just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on freespeech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times.The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrongand they are dangerous.What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence oneanother. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor, andfind common ground and shared purpose.We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation delivering themiracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy,protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the momentand join together as one American people.Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, ourcommunities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God blessAmerica.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: President Donald Trump in the Oval Office with a message. Again, aWhite House video we just received playing for you here on SPECIAL REPORT.White House -- Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts live in theNorth Lawn with reaction.Good evening, John. It's the longest response we've heard. And obviously,the message the president wanted to get out tonight.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):It was about five minutes and 13 seconds long. This was something that wasput together after the impeachment vote came down in the House, but notablethat the president did not talk at all about impeachment, something that hejust yesterday referred to as a continuation of the years long witch hunt.But the president talking about the violence, saying that no supporter ofhis would ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans that heunequivocally condemns the violence and that he is authorized to all forcenecessary to prevent any further violence, imploring his supporters to goforward in peace and that there be no violence, that there be no vandalism,nothing like that between now and the inauguration and beyond.The question now is Bret, where do we go in terms of impeachment? Willthere be a trial in the Senate? As was pointed out earlier, Senator MitchMcConnell has said that there's no time to do it before the inauguration ofJoe Biden.I do know that the president's aides have reached out to outside counsel tosee who might be available. Should a trial occur in the -- in the Senate?I am told that the president's last impeachment team Pat Cipollone, PatrickPhilbin, Jay Sekulow, and Pam Bondi would not be signing up for anotherdrink at the well. Other outside counsel I'm told has politely declined aswell.It is possible that Rudy Giuliani, maybe a constitutional expert named JohnEastman, and potentially Alan Dershowitz could be involved if this one goesto trial in the Senate.But the big question is, whether it ever gets there because the White Houseaides told me today that if this doesn't happen quickly, then the momentumfor a trial becomes less and less. And that this gets pushed out, too asCongressman James Clyburn of South Carolina suggested, after Joe Biden'sfirst 100 days, they believe that the potential for a conviction in theSenate would be greatly diminished, Bret.BAIER: John, it's pretty stark the difference between the speech hedelivered last Wednesday on the mall and that message that we heardtonight, and obviously a lot has transpired in between, but it's notable.ROBERTS: Yes, I mean, there's even a difference between what we heardtonight and what we heard yesterday. Yesterday, as he was at Joint BaseAndrews. He's about to board Air Force One. The president said that hisspeech on the ellipse a week ago has been analyzed and was found to betotally appropriate. I don't think you'd find many people who would agreewith that assessment.But the resident, he didn't seem quite contrite today, he didn'tacknowledge that he had any responsibility for it as the Minority LeaderKevin McCarthy said on the floor of the House. He said that the presidentdoes bear some responsibility for it.But the president going I think further than it has before saying that hewas shocked and saddened by the calamity. But there are a lot of people inAmerica who would say that he is at least partly responsible for thatcalamity.BAIER: John, thank you. John Roberts on the North Lawn.Let's bring in our panel early Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at TheFederalist. Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of NationalPublic Radio and Bill McGurn columnist for The Wall Street Journal.Mara, your reaction to the president's comments and the history moments ofthe day?MARA LIASSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, I was actually-- I found his comments today really kind of stunning. I kept on thinking,what if he had said this last week? I mean, maybe things would have beendifferent.The fact that he repudiated his supporters last week. He said, we love you,you're very special. This time he said, anyone, no true supporter of minecould ever commit violence. You're not supporting our movement if you'reattacking our country. You know, he said that several times. You know,there's no -- we are for defending the rule of law.He didn't talk about impeachment. He didn't insist that the election hadbeen stolen from him. He just issued a very simple, comprehensiverepudiation of the violence at the Capitol.And I think for a lot of his supporters, it came kind of too late becauseyou had Kevin McCarthy up on the Hill saying that he bore responsibilityfor what happened last Wednesday, maybe he wouldn't have said that if thepresident had been a little more forthcoming earlier.BAIER: And Bill, today in that impeachment vote, you had 10 Republicansvoting to impeach the president. A different vote count than happened thefirst time he was impeached.BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yeah, I agree with Mara. I wasstruck by if this had been said a week ago, things might be very different.Now he's a twice impeached president and so forth.And I also agree with Mara, I was struck that there were no qualifiers. Inother words, he didn't talk about a stolen election or so forth.I think he recognizes that those people who rampaged, and I think thatthey're a minority, the people who came out for him that day. But thosepeople did -- his supporters, in other words, people looked him as leaderdid more harm to Donald Trump than the left had ever been able to do overthese years.That said, I do look at this impeachment effort with some shock and a lotof sadness, because I think that if you're trying to correct behavior on apresident, and you're doing it in the name of the constitution, this is nota serious effort.To do it in a week, I mean, if you're arrested, if you throw a rock througha window and 10 people see you, you get more rights, and, you know, moretime to consider it.We've now made impeachment sort of a regular thing. I mean, Mrs. Pelosi'spresided over half the impeachments, you know, the successful impeachmentsin the -- in the country. And I, I just think this is a terrible thing. Ithink it's going to come back to bite us in ways that we can't foresee, andit's further cheap in the process. I think it was cheapened by the firstimpeachment, and especially the procedural irregularities starting theimpeachment without even a votes of the House. I don't think this bodeswell for us.And one final thing, I mentioned Donald Trump, and I don't know when thiswill get to the Senate for trial. I can't believe it is in Joe Biden'sinterest to have this come up three weeks from now. God knows what he'll bein the middle of. But I just do not believe it will be in his interest tohave this come up -- come up then, especially for his agenda.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Yes. (INAUDIBLE) trial after he leaves office, right.MCGURN: Right.BAIER: And the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mollie has said, heis not expediting this. It's not going to come up before the January 19threconvening in the Senate.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: You know, this is not avery serious impeachment effort. Donald Trump just met a bar that few otherpeople have been able to meet in this last week, which is saying something.He condemned the political violence done by his purported supporters. Hehas condemned the political violence done by people in the left throughoutthe summer of rage that destroyed so many cities, and, you know, governmentbuildings, and dragged police officers through the street.We actually have a rare moment for potential unity here of people on allsides condemning political violence regardless of who commits it, and veryfew people have been able to meet that, and that's unfortunate.Few people in Congress are actually thinking calmly or rationally rightnow. That's kind of understandable they had this horrible attack on themlast week, and they are infuriated, they are enraged. That's, you know,again, understandable.But at times like this when the health and -- of the republic is at stake,we really need people to take, take some time to think clearly and calmlynot about their own feelings of terror, but about the health of therepublic. And that's something that we didn't see too much today.BAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll see you later on the show.Up next, images you don't see every day. The National Guard in the Capitolbuilding, resting in between shifts while they protect one of the nation'smost revered structures. We will have an update on the massive securitypresence in Washington, D.C. when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Stocks were mixed today. The Dow lost eight, the S&P 500 gainednine. The NASDAQ was up 57 today.Tonight, as we mentioned, the District of Columbia more closely resembled -- resembles an army base than it has in decades. Thousands of NationalGuard troops have joined police and federal agents in a show of forcedesigned to prevent a repeat of last week's rioting in reaction to theimpeachment proceeding today, and ahead of next week's inauguration. Also,with rising threats that are being picked up.National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has a status reporttonight from Capitol Hill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need six people.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Scenes across the Capitol looked more like the green zone in Baghdadthan the nation's capitol.There are now more U.S. troops on Capitol Hill than currently serving ineither Iraq or Afghanistan, with more on the way. Soon, that will includemore than three times the number of combat troops in Iraq and Afghanistancombined.MURIEL BOWSER, MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.: We have asked Americans not tocome to the Washington, D.C. event, but instead, to participate virtually.And we know that is the right choice and the best way to keep everyonesafe.ROBERT CONTEE, POLICE CHIEF, METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT: There's amajor security threat and we are working to mitigate those threats. We arejust very intently focused on the job that's at hand.GRIFFIN: The scene at the U.S. Capitol very different than one week ago.National Guard began pouring in overnight. Some sleeping inside the Capitoldome with their weapons by their side.In response to requests from the Capitol police, army officials authorizedanother 5,000 troops, bringing the total number mobilized between now andthe inauguration to 20,000 National Guard. 6,700 are in the city now. Thatnumber expected to rise by the weekend.The Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller delegated authorities to the ArmySecretary Ryan McCarthy, to command and control the National Guardmobilized for Washington, D.C., a senior defense official tells Fox.Another change from last week, Secretary McCarthy authorized the troops tobe armed.In a rare statement sent to the entire U.S. military, all eight members ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff signed a letter to the force, condemning theCapitol insurrection, and warned service members not to do anything toimpede President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration."The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the rightto resort to violence, sedition, and insurrection."Airbnb announced it is canceling reservations in D.C. and not allowing anynew reservations to be made between now and January 20th. "We haveidentified numerous individuals who are either associated with known hategroups or otherwise involved in the criminal activity at the CapitolBuilding, and they have been banned from Airbnb's platform."(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN (on camera): The National Guard deploying to the Capitol beingbriefed as though, they are entering a war zone. The threat level, I'mtold, from senior national security officials is high, and armed protestersare threatening to bring explosives, including vehicle-borne IEDs or truckbombs to the Capitol to disrupt the inauguration. Bret.BAIER: Jennifer, very quickly, do we know what percentage of the NationalGuard are armed, and what -- and which ones aren't?GRIFFIN: We're not being told the percentage, but I would say many. We haveseen many with M4 rifles around the Capitol, but not all. Some arepatrolling without weapons. It depends on the assignments, theirassignments here in the Capitol.BAIER: All right, Jennifer Griffin, live on Capitol Hill. Jennifer, thankyou very much. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy today, telling fellowRepublicans to stop blaming Antifa anarchists for last week's Capitol riot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCCARTHY: Some say the riots were caused by Antifa. There is absolutely noevidence of that. And Conservatives should be the first to say so.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: McCarthy, saying President Trump should, "accept" his share ofresponsibility for the violence.The lectern for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was wheeled through statuaryhall in the Capitol today. It's the same lectern seen carried by a rioterlast week through that hall.We're getting new information tonight about suspects being caught orpursued from that riot. Correspondent David Spunt has the latest tonightfrom the Justice Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): One week sincethousands of rioters stormed the symbol of American democracy, and everyday, more are heading to jail.This morning, authorities in Newport News, Virginia arrested Robert KeithPacker, identified last week wearing a sweatshirt with the phrase, CampAuschwitz on the front. He's out tonight on bail for criminal trespassing.Cleveland Meredith appeared briefly before a Washington, D.C. judge today,authorities say, he stormed the Capitol with the intention to shoot andkill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on live television. The judge rescheduledhis hearing for tomorrow.Authorities' also unsealed photographs of a truck filled with firearms, acrossbow, smoke bombs, and Molotov cocktails. Police arrested the suspecteddriver Lonnie Coffman, an Alabama man seen among the Capitol chaos lastweek.Then, there's this accused suspect, the son of a New York judge. 34-year-old Aaron Mustafsky is out on bail awaiting trial. Authorities haveidentified around 170 people with thousands to go.MICHAEL SHERWIN, ACTING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY: This is not going to besolved overnight. It's not going to be solved within the coming weeks, it'snot going to be solved within the coming months.SPUNT: One of the priorities for law enforcement, find the name of theperson or people who hit officer Brian Sicknick with a fire extinguisherand eventually killed him.Facial recognition technology deployed in the capitol will speed things upfor investigators, though old-fashioned tips are welcome.MAUREEN O'CONNELL, FORMER, AGENT, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: Tips andleads are the lifeblood of many investigations. If you have anyinformation, any information at all that can help the Capitol Police, theFBI, or any of us, we're all in this together. And we need to work togetherand bring everyone that broke the law to justice.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): And just in, Bret, authorities have identified Olympicswimmer Klete Keller at someone being in the Capitol last week. Authoritiesalso suspended two Capitol police officers, another 10 to 15 we're told bysources on the Hill, are under investigation. Bret.BAIER: David Spunt at the Justice Department. David, thanks.Up next, star-studded plans for the Biden inauguration party. Althoughdigital ones, they'll come right into your home. We'll show you.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight.Fox 59 in Indianapolis, as a Kansas woman is executed for strangling anexpected mother in Missouri and cutting the baby from her womb. The lethalinjection administered to Lisa Montgomery is the first time in nearly sevendecades that the federal government has put to death a female inmate.Fox 10 in Phoenix says police investigate the interruption of a virtualfuneral for a community and civil rights leader by hackers yelling racistslurs.

One of the big storiesthere tonight and across the country, lots of big money at stake in twolotteries. Tonight's Powerball drawing is for $550 million jackpot. AndFriday's mega millions prize is expected to rise to 750 million dollarsafter no one won last night. That would be the fifth-largest jackpot inU.S. history.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  President-elect Joe Biden has not reacted publicly to the secondTrump impeachment, but correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight fromWilmington, Delaware, the action could have a significant impact on theincoming administration, at least the agenda upfront. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret. If the president-elect was watching today's impeachment proceedings, he kept his thoughts tohimself. We did not see him today or hear from him. He's been home, andover the last couple of days, the president-elect has not taken an officialposition for or against Trump's impeachment, instead just repeating a linethat dates back to the earliest days of his campaign, that he doesn't thinkTrump is fit for office and that's why he ran in the first place.I just talked to a transition source who told me they are going to leave itup to the soon to be Democratic-controlled Senate to decide whether or notthey will do what Biden wants and split legislative days in half, half thetime working on an impeachment trial, half the time confirming Bidennominees and passing the COVID-19 relief package he wants, which is goingto be formally outlined in rare primetime remarks tomorrow night.One week from today the press secretary, Jen Psaki, says the Bidenadministration is going to host their first press briefing, and sherevealed many cabinet nominees and senior staffers already got their firstdose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, on Inauguration Day in one week, amostly virtual celebration is going to be hosted by Tom Hanks. It'sreportedly also going to feature performances by Justin Timberlake and BonJovi and be produced by Ricky Kirshner, the same producer who coordinatedthe mostly virtual Democratic Convention, which included a lot of livefeeds coming in from across the country as organizers want people tocelebrate Joe Biden where they are and not in Washington, D.C.The transition team is also telling us tonight that the president-electreceived a briefing today from the FBI and the Secret Service about threatsof violence to the in-person parts of his inauguration. Bret?BAIER:  Peter Doocy in Wilmington, Delaware. We should say Peter,congratulations, named our White House correspondent for the Bidenadministration. It should be interesting.DOOCY:  It's going to be quite a ride, thank you very much, Bret.BAIER:  You bet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Americans that are willing to stand up and fight fortheir rights, and that makes me proud to be an American.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody was misled, and I think we're smarter thanthat. And we need to face reality, and Trump should concede, and it's over.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That's a focus group. Let's bring in pollster Frank Luntz, whospoke to this group of people after the deadly riots at the U.S. capitallast week. Good evening, Frank. So what did you hear?FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  So we heard a lot at passion, a lot of frustration.And I want to begin with two numbers that to me are shocking -- 50 percentof Trump voters want him to pursue the 2020 election. They don't want himto give up. They don't want him to give in. They want to push this to thevery last day. And 51 percent believe that Donald Trump should be apresidential candidate in 2024.Bret, this is not over for an awful lot of Trump people. It may be over forthe president, it may be over for Congress, but for those people who votedfor him, they want him to push on, and they're going to stand behind him.BAIER:  Frank, a lot of people trying to analyze of the 74 million votersthe president had in the election, how many of those looked back atWednesday and have a change of heart, or think that the Trump power and thepolitical power has been devastated by last week's events? Obviously, hespoke tonight in a much different tone. But if you were to make anassessment, where would you put that?LUNTZ:  I can give you the exact numbers -- 91 percent of those who votedfor Donald Trump on Election Day would vote for him again. And this was apoll that was done on Montana, just 48 hours ago. And it's astounding, andonly five percent would switch their vote from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.And I've got two more numbers for you -- 67 percent believe that if thevotes were counted accurately and fairly, Donald Trump would've won. Andthe most staggering of all, 78 percent believe that the election was riggedand stolen. So you've got a segment of the American people, a largesegment, that do not trust our electoral process, and are just so angrythat they feel like the country is drifting away from them. It's going tobe very difficult for Republicans going forward.BAIER:  You're a words guy, a phrases guy. Last Wednesday in his speech onthe mall has been condemned by the right and the left as far as inciting,and obviously we have the fallout, the second impeachment tonight. Hiswords tonight, very measured, specific. Your thoughts on that addressedtonight from the Oval Office?LUNTZ:  I saw them, and they were actually impressive. They were exactlywhat he should have said 24 hours ago. He did not need to be impeached. Hedoes not need to be removed from office. If he would just be contrite, ifhe would just say I'm sorry, all of this would not be happening. And it isdestroying his business. It is destroying his image. It is destroying hispresidency. He's going to leave office the most unpopular president inmodern times. If he had just done these words 24 hours ago, none of thiswould be happening. And I hope that he is listening right now, because whathe said tonight he should have said just a day ago.BAIER:  Last thing, and when you asked these focus groups, you often askthem for words, what they're thinking about the situation. Did "sad" comeup for these Trump supporters?LUNTZ:  Yes, but you know what came up even more? "Proud." They're proudthat he continues to fight, and they want to fight with him. And also whatcomes up is "embarrassed," because what happened is what nobody wanted tosee happen, and they are embarrassed for themselves, for the president, andfor the country.BAIER:  Frank Luntz, as always, very interesting. We appreciate it.LUNTZ:  Thank you.BAIER:  Up next, stunning new death figures and predictions for COVID-19.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- so that we can get the shots in the arms.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Coronavirus deaths have hit another single day high as the overalldeath toll in the U.S. is racing toward the 400,000 mark. Nationalcorrespondent William La Jeunesse has our COVID-19 update tonight from LosAngeles.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAROLINE BRANDENBURGER, NURSE:  They fight every day, and they struggled tobreathe every day, even with tons of oxygen. And then, we just see themdie. They just die, and they fight dying. And it's so sad.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Tuesday, anotherrecord -- 4,400 fatalities, three Americans dying of COVID every minute.DONNA ROTTSCHAFER, NURSE:  They want to die. They're telling us they wantto die, but their families don't want to let them go because they can't behere to understand what they're going through.LA JEUNESSE:  And while the infection rate appears to slow in some areasexperts say the worst is yet to come.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The next wave is the next week is when those people nowpeak and need to be intubated. And then a few days after that,unfortunately, either you get better or you don't.LA JEUNESSE:  Nationally, the University of Washington says infections willpeak January 28th with daily fatalities cresting February 10th.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was less painful than the flu shot that I got at adrugstore.LA JEUNESSE:  After holding vaccines back for weeks, states are relaxingrules, but confusion reigns.

And the hope is that long lines there willalleviate them here. Bret?BAIER:  William, thank you.The leader of the Roman Catholic Church is reportedly the latest high-profile figure to get a coronavirus vaccine. Media outlets are saying PopeFrancis received an injection of the Pfizer vaccine today. The Vatican,though, has not yet confirmed that.When we come back, the panel returns with the security blanket inWashington, metal detectors at the capitol, and the crackdown on socialmedia.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFFREY ROSEN, ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We will have no tolerancewhatsoever for any attempts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power onJanuary 20th that our Constitution calls for. We will have no tolerance forany attempts to forcefully occupy government buildings.MURIEL BOWSER, (D) MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.:  We have asked Americans notto come to the Washington, D.C. event, but instead to participatevirtually. And we know that is the right choice and the best way to keepeveryone safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The acting attorney general, the mayor of Washington, D.C., thesecurity is unprecedented this week and ahead of the inauguration nextweek.What about all of that? Let's bring back our panel, Mollie Hemingway,senior editor at "The Federalist," Mara Liasson, national politicalcorrespondent for National Public Radio, and Bill McGurn, columnist for"The Wall Street Journal."Bill, I've covered Washington for a long time, never seen anything close tothis.BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right. Well, it's said, right. It's sadthat we have to have that, but it's better than the alternative. The lastthing we want is for violence going forward. And I think Donald Trump mostof all, the person who would be hurt most by any violence going forwardwould be him or his supporters.So I would never tell an American citizen you cannot exercise your FirstAmendment rights, but I think the reality and the situation we're in inwatching what happened last Wednesday and the aftermath, I would warnpeople that if you go and you're peaceful, you may be lumped in with peopledoing bad things if they're there. So I hope it doesn't come about.But I do think that prevention is a big part of it. What you saw at thecapital partly was just not enough bodies to stop people from trying tooverwhelm the force. And I hope they don't repeat that mistake this time.BAIER:  Mara, the Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy put in charge of deployingthe National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. As you heard from JenniferGriffin, many of them armed now, and you're talking about a sizable force.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, a sizable force. There could be more of them there than any protesterswho show up, maybe more of them than the ones who came last Wednesday.I remember Washington and the capital, I live on Capitol Hill, before 9/11.You could walk around the capital on all the terraces. But then there wasan attempted attack on the capital, because of some brave civilians onFlight 93 the plane didn't crash into the capital. But a lot of the capitalwas curtailed, access to the capital was curtailed after that. Now this isgoing to be maybe, we don't know yet, maybe another permanent constrictionof where the public is allowed to go. It's really sad, but it's necessary.We also don't really know everything yet. Liz Cheney said we're going tofind out a lot more in the days and weeks ahead about what was involved inthat attack, the armaments that were brought, who was involved, how muchplanning there was.BAIER:  There is a lot we don't know. Here is a congresswoman who istalking about what she thinks some of her fellow members did.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MIKIE SHERRILL, (D-NJ):  Someone had to see that those members ofCongress who embedded him, those members of Congress who had groups comingthrough the capital that I saw on January 5th, reconnaissance for the nextday. Those members of Congress that incited this violent crowd, I'm goingto see that they are held accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That's Representative Mikie Sherrill, who believes that there wasreconnaissance the day before. There's all kinds of allegations out there,but the federal authorities are going after people one by one, Mollie.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  I don't know if that'sa new member of Congress, because when she described the situation ofmembers of Congress taking constituents through the capital, that'sactually a pretty common scene. If you've gone to see your member ofcongress, it is not uncommon that you will be given a tour of the capitaleither by the member himself or herself or their staff. So I think membersshould be very careful about making allegations without substantiation.And in general, the country needs to be careful. Mara brings up whathappened after 9/11, and people were terrified again, and that resulted inthe very big constriction of civil liberties that was not always in thecountry's best interest, and not always constitutional. And again, we'reseeing this reaction to an attack that, again, is very scary on the capitalof restricting people's liberties, of violating their speech rights. You'rehaving very powerful people, tech oligarchs and other people, working withDemocrats and people in the media to suppress all political opposition.That's a very real dangerous that needs to be taken seriously by ourleaders.BAIER:  In this environment they've set up metal detectors, Bill, at theHouse floor. The House Administration Committee Ranking Member Rodney Davisfrom Illinois said this, "This is political correctness run amok. Thethreat is not outside, not inside. Every resource used inside is one thatcan't be used outside." In this environment, though, these Congressmen andwomen go through metal detectors at the airport, don't they?MCGURN:  Yes. Look, I have a very simple solution. My view is anyone whodid anything bad, they should be punished and brought to justice for whatthey did, but I think we ought to avoid wholescale, sweepinggeneralizations about what people did. Let's see the evidence of who didwhat and hold them accountable that way instead of, say, tarring a wholegroup of people as white supremacists or something.BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much, appreciate it.When we come back, supporting the troops and law enforcement.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a show of support. After seeing Washington policeofficer Daniel Hodges injured at the capital last week, Emma Jablonski senthim a heartwarming letter. The 10-year-old wrote she hopes he's healing,and that his family is nice and healthy. The D.C. Metropolitan PoliceDepartment says Officer Hodges is, in fact, recovering and doing well.And Florida Congressman Brian Mast, a U.S. Army veteran who lost both legsin Afghanistan, met with National Guard troops in the capital today. TheCongressman showed off his favorite room, Statutory Hall, and said he wasproud to see them always doing what they're asked to do, as are we.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIALREPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid. "THE STORY" hosted by MarthaMacCallum starts right now.
