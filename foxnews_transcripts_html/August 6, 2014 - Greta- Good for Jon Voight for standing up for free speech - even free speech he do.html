'Off the Record,' 8/6/14: Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem allege blacklisting in Hollywood after they accused Israel of genocide in conflict with Hamas. Good for Jon Voight for standing up for free speech he doesn't like

Let's go "Off the Record." Hollywood upheaval - two stars, husband and wife, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz stepping out, no, not on each other, but in world of politics. Putting pen to paper, accusing Israel of genocide. Yes, genocide.
The two stars took it even further. They rallied other actors to sign on to their bombshell letter and then they fired it off, and kaboom! Needless to say, accusing Israel of genocide, disgusting many, including Jon Voight. Voight blasted the couple right back from their genocide accusation. Cruz and Bardem retreated fast, Penelope Cruz even confessing on the topic of Israel that she's not an expert. That was obvious, at least to Jon Voight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But then another problem erupted, one Hollywood never thought it would see again. As a result of that genocide accusation, Bardem and Cruz are allegedly being blacklisted by some in Hollywood. But that's where Jon Voigt stepped back in. As much as he hates what Cruz and Bardem said - and he does - he said about blacklisting, don't go there, don't try to create a blacklist. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So good for him, Jon Voigt. He stands up for free speech, even speech he doesn't like. And that's big. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
