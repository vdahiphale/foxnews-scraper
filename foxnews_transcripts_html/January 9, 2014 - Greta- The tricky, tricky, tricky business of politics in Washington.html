'Off the Record', 1/9/14: Everybody is trying to game each other in Washington 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute and what is my thought tonight? It's tricky, tricky, tricky. That's what politics is all about. Everyone is trying to game everyone. Perfect example: President Obama's proposed promise zones. Unlike other proposed economic zones, which are only tax relief ideas to encourage business, President Obama's promise zones have a price tag in addition to tax breaks.
They are going to cost $750 million. Don't get me wrong, I want to help poor communities with good ideas. That's not the point of this "Off the Record." It's the tricky, tricky, tricky politics of it. Think about it. President Obama chose five locations to make eligible for his promise zones. One is south eastern Kentucky. There are lots of poor communities in the nation, but why Kentucky? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, that is because that's Senator Mitch McConnell's state, and he is in a very tough primary race with a Tea Party opponent. Here is Senator McConnell's choice now. Can he vote for President Obama's plan, which means more spending, $750 million worth, which Republicans - especially the Tea Party - hate, or vote against it in which his general election will run ads that he turned down a chance to help poor people in Kentucky who he represent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What do you think? President Obama said to Senator McConnell in private today at the White House, my guess, "Gotcha!" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
