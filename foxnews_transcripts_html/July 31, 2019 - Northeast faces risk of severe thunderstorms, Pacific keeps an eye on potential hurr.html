     Video  National forecast for Wednesday, July 31 
Janice Dean has your FoxCast. 
A cold front pushing across the Northeast today will bring the risk for strong to severe thunderstorms.  Some of these storms could produce heavy rain and localized flooding.  
  
   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Flooding potential is also increasing across the Southwest with the arrival of monsoon season for this region.  
  
In the tropics, the Pacific is active with major hurricane Erick and hurricane Flossie.  
   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Hawaii needs to keep an eye on both of these storms, however, the forecast calls for weakening of both systems over the next few days and Erick will move well south of the islands.
