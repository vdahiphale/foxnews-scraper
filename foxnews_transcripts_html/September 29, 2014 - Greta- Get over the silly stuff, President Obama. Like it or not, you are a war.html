Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. OK, this is weird. President Obama is so hung up on not being the war president that he sounds, well, silly.
He won't admit the obvious. President Obama refusing to say we are at war with ISIS. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

STEVE KROFT, CO-ANCHOR, "60 MINUTES": Are you saying that this is not really a war? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I'm saying is that we are assisting Iraq in a very real battle that's taking place on their soil, with their troops, but we are providing air support.
This is not America against ISIL. This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

OK. He wouldn't answer that simple question. He heard it. And he knows exactly what the question is. But he deliberately dodged answering it. That's weird. You know, actually silly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He could not possibly think we are not at war with ISIS. He is lobbing hundreds of Tomahawk missiles to blow up the people who are killing others, including Americans. That's called war. Does President Obama think the American people are so naive that if he says it isn't war or dodges the question that we will think we are not at war? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Think about it. If someone were lobbing hundreds of Tomahawk missiles into the United States, or dropping bombs from the fighter jets on the U.S. capitol, we would say it is war, because it is war. You just can't sugarcoat it.
So, Mr. President, whether you like it or not, you are a war president. So now let's get over the silly stuff to the important stuff. Let's win. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
