LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, this is "The Ingraham Angle" from Washington. AOC versus President Reagan? The biographer of the 40th President is here to take a Ocasio-Cortez to school after her claims that Reagan was a racist.
More on that plus when we told you that last fall's caravan might include folks with unknown diseases, we meaning I was attacked for fear mongering. Well, well, well, tonight we'll show you, how a new report demonstrates "The Ingraham Angle" was ahead of a curve and you want to stick around for this.

INGRAHAM: Not well as Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept said today in a tweet, "If Trump is literally controlled by Putin to the point where Trump is forced to act in the best interest of Russia at the expense of the U.S. which has been the prevailing claim not of Dem fringes but its mainstream - how can it be morally justified not to impeach him?
INGRAHAM: Well Nancy, well, today Pelosi said in a new interview, no to impeachment adding, he's not worth it. No wait a second, is Nancy talking about Trump there or Mueller because now it looks like the Special Counsel may come up empty on this collusion deal so Nancy just wants to move on from that to just plain old regular demonizing Trump 24/7.

INGRAHAM: And to think I didn't know that the words sucks could be used as a noun. Learn something new every day. Well, to think that they actually lined up around the block to hear that searing intellect.
Well with such gratuitous meanness about one of the most beloved presidents of the past 50 years, the South By Southwest Festival should be renamed, I don't know, The Mouth and Mouth Worst Festival. And as we've documented, here in THE ANGLE, week after week, month after month, there is a concerted across the board, effort in the Democrat party to demonize the entire American experience and the American tradition.
By degrading anyone and anything that doesn't pass their own radical muster. Now remember, the ‘IT' kids at the moment, they could be the leaders of tomorrow, God help us so it's important that we not merely dismiss these episodes. In fact, anyone interested in preserving our freedom and our free market, not to mention the historical record, must use these moments to teach a new generation the truth about the country, we love.

Our triumphs and the tragedies that we should learn from. But in the vicious landscape of the social media world, untrues become trues, if they go uncorrected. I have a question, do we really even have free speech in America, today, if millions of you feel afraid to speak your mind.

        }
      
For fear of being demonized at work. At school, at your universities, even in the military. On the Left, the impulse today is to control speech, not to encourage more of it. CNN President Jeff Zucker was also what that South by Southwest Festival justifying the DNC's decision to deny Fox, a chance to host a Democrat debate.
He basically said, no one has the right to you know, get a debate and then he went on to say, well, let's keep scrolling guys. He said, well, look, Fox is basically state-run TV. So they don't have an obligation to give one to Fox so now I think the question should be, is Fox state-run TV or Blah blah blah? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

INGRAHAM: This is CNN. Well, where does James Earl Jones go to get his voice over back after that thing. Is it any wonder that CNN's facing a $250 million lawsuit for defaming the reputations of those Covington Catholic students?
The network routinely allows its ideology to eclipse facts and then the demonization game soon begins. A few weeks ago, CNN actually hired Sarah Isgur Flores, she is a Harvard law grad and a former Jeff Sessions spokeswoman at that Department of Justice. She was hired and was surprised and amazed as the CNN political editor, I mean what was CNN thinking hiring a conservative? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, the announcement sent out shockwaves through leftist circles. Liberal journalists went bananas, started writing pieces maligning her. So my question is, did she lack any more journalistic experience than these people. You can see them on the screen who were granted network purchase after their political stance. No. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yet the DNC was quick to register its displeasure with Isgur in the role of political editor at that network. A Democratic campaign committee aide told the Daily Beast, "Chairman Tom Perez and the DNC expressed to CNN that they have serious concerns with the hire. They continue to talk to the network about how this impacts 2020 and as of Wednesday, they got assurances that Isgur would not be involved in debates."
Not only that, Jeff Zucker demoted Isgur to a mere Political Contributor where she'll have zero role in shaping the coverage of the Democrats or their debates. Well, the good news is no one 's watching CNN so doesn't really matter. So well, I've got a question, will some crack liberal journal write a long, tedious magazine piece about how CNN is a mouthpiece with a direct line in the DNC and vice versa. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No, don't hold your breath. But it's important to note the tactic here. The left is committed to distorting history and destroying the past while demonizing anyone and everyone who stands up for American values and traditions. What started as the removal of historical monuments has now become a full on assault on presidential legacies and the movements, namely the conservative movement that was created.
And by the way, if a conservative does manage to secure a post inside one of these old dinosaur bastions, here she will be vilified, condemned without cause and driven out because the fanatical left well, it's no longer about winning in the arena of ideas for them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's no longer a debate and may the best person win. No, no, no, no. Instead, they just work to take players off the field with blind side hits. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But just not that funny. If Democrats want to make a difference, I have a suggestion. Why not start engaging instead of demonizing. You're welcome on this show anytime. How's that for openness? Meanwhile, Democrats don't really have any defense, do they? For what's happening let's say, on the border nor are they going to try to convince voters that they'd do a better job at leveling the playing field with China, enforcing fairness in trade.
Or maybe how to raise your standard of living or have a stronger economy than Trump's. You know, why they're going to not make that argument? Because they can't. All they really have left is some iteration of you're a racist if you don't agree with us. That's not woke. That's just a sad joke and that's THE ANGLE.
All right, joining me now with reaction, conservative author, filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza and David Burstein, CEO and Founder of Run for America. Dinesh, as we discussed with you last week, you expect this on a college campus but for the head of CNN to be pushing for more restrictions on speech, not fewer reveals kind of the game here, doesn't it?

Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author And Filmmaker: It's hard for me to see whether there is just a complete lack of self-consciousness here that CNN has no comprehension of the fact that they are dug in on one side of the political debate and that makes it impossible for them to be a forum of debate.
They're ultimately like a battering ram against Trump. If they have a panel, every panelist is echoing the same side. If they ever have a conservative on once in a while, it's going to be a never Trump conservative and so this is not really what a network is about.
A network is about having arguments, discussions, forums so that we can consider the larger issues of our day. We really haven't had a serious political debate on any subject, not immigration, not taxes, not the court since Trump's election and CNN is largely responsible for that.

BURSTEIN: Look, I think it is a mistake and right now what's happening inside the Democratic Party is that there are multiple, different camps and I think to be fair you know, you represented in the piece that you just ran, a certain viewpoint which is represented by people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
It is at the moment the loudest viewpoint in the Democratic Party but it's not the biggest. You know, there are far more institutional senators down the totem pole, the people like the Mark Warners, the Chris Coons, who are working on a bipartisan basis every day, who are actually institutionalists, who have been there for a long time or older, who have a more state approach to this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
And I think frankly, it's harder for a lot of those Democrats to actually get their voice heard because saying, let's talk, let's be calm doesn't get as much headlines as people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
INGRAHAM: Right, you're right, you're right. I think, that is a good point but Dinesh, there's something else going on here, it's not just - you know, she's the new thing. You know, there'll be someone else that comes along and replaces her sure enough. I mean, right now, she's the ‘it' girl of the moment but and I mean, girl in the best of ways, by the way.
Brian Stelter at CNN again kind of revealed unwittingly, what's really going on, let's watch.

BRIAN STELTER, CNN NEWS REPORTER: Yes, they have a news division, it's relatively small compared to the huge opinion division which has all the highest rated shows, both exist. But it's getting really uncomfortable for both to exist in that same body so Tara, why would Democrats even consider going on Fox in the first place?

INGRAHAM: Now the DNC is actually in direct communication, picking staffers at CNN, vetoing staffers and Fox is the problem, Dinesh?
D'SOUZA: I mean, obviously the point here is that the Fox opinion hosts, wear the opinion badge very clearly on their sleeve. As a result of people can say, I agree or I disagree, the problem with CNN is that guys like Stelter and Jim Acosta pose as reporters, they pretend like they're after the truth whereas in fact, they're propagandists. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
So the problem is actually here with the truth in advertising. Now turning to Ocasio-Cortez for a second if I may, you know, there was a grain of truth, there was a lot of truth in fact about what she said about the racism of FDR and it's instructive in this respect to compare FDR with Reagan.
Reagan didn't have a racist bone in his body. Reagan was all about patriotism and anti-communism and free markets and pro-life and privatization whereas FDR has said publicly, I have no problems with the Ku Klux Klan.
FDR was cutting deals with the racists in the Democratic Party so Ocasio- Cortez was on to something, she just didn't carry it through, she was trying to demonize Reagan whereas she was right about her own party.
INGRAHAM: Yes, well, David, do you agree that the new deal, setting aside the personal views of Democrats and Dinesh is right at that time, I mean, the KKK was dominated by Democrats as Dinesh exposed in his film but what about that idea though of the new deal itself being racist that's I mean, I've got to say, I haven't heard that one before.

        }
      
BURSTEIN: You know, I think we have to be very careful about going back in history and redoing things based on what things are going on at the time. We - you know, this country has racism ingrained in its bones, it's the original sin of this country, it's slavery that started from the beginning of our - beginning of our DNA.
So you know, one could say that many things in this country have been - have been racist but I think that dismisses the important impact of the new deal which gave us a lot of the foundation of what we have here today and so to simply just right off the most important piece of progressive legislation by just saying, it's racist, I think is not - it is symptomatic of that element of the party which I - which I do not think if it becomes the dominant one will be positive for them.
INGRAHAM: Maybe not quite yet. All right panel, thank you and AOC's comments on Reagan that we played on tonight's ANGLE caught the attention our next guest who ended up getting in a Twitter war of words with AOC. Joining me now is esteemed Reagan biographer, Craig Shirley and Craig, what upset you most about AOC's Reagan claims?
CRAIG SHIRLEY, RONALD REAGAN BIOGRAPHER: Well, I don't know where to start, Laura. I guess, it would be that her comment that Reagan somehow invented the Welfare queen issue and use that as a smear against African-American women of the country which was just complete lie and truth be told, is that both The Washington Post and The New York Times did extensive stories on the Welfare queen of Chicago and they did those stores 1979, long before Reagan even raised. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But it was a panoply of so many just wrongheaded things that she said about Reagan on you know, pitting white working class people against black and Hispanics and so many other issues, is that you know, is that Reagan going back to his childhood, you know, his father wouldn't let him see Birth of a Nation because of the racist comment even though Woodrow Wilson was his favorite movie Democratic--
INGRAHAM: I want to read the tweet that she responded to you with. So Craig, you could see all of his fact check on AOC. But she tweeted back at you, "Okay, great, now talk about Reagan and Iran-Contra, the gutting of our mental health system, the explosion of homelessness under his watch, the crack epidemic. Maybe instead of insinuating I've never read a book, be open to the idea that we've read different ones."
That's kind of the point, she maybe was it - is it Zen's people's history, I mean, what is she reading? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SHIRLEY: Well, I - well, first of all, Iran-Contra was a problem and guess who appointed the commission to root out the problem of Iran-Contra? It was Ronald Reagan and he went before the American people and he took the responsibility for it.
As far as the homelessness, that was caused by the ACLU going to supreme court and charging that thousands of the people held in mental institutions were being held against their will. The court agreed, the mental institutions were opened up.
So because of the liberal American Conservative Union is that thousands of people were let go on the streets and--
INGRAHAM: Yes, civil liberties union.
SHIRLEY: Yes, CLU, exactly the problem we have today.
INGRAHAM: Yes, correct, but the point I made in THE ANGLE, I think, point by point refuting her, that's kind of easier do but what the real point is to knock off conservative heroes, right?
SHIRLEY: Sure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
INGRAHAM: I mean, they got the John Wayne deal a couple weeks ago and it's part of the tradition, the DNA of conservatism, correct? So when you want to remake a country, remake a history, rip down statutes, look at everything in today's context.
SHIRLEY: Rewrite history.
INGRAHAM: Right. Then where - what - who - what statute is going to survive?
SHIRLEY: None of them if the Left has its way. Look, the left understands that, for them to win, they need to destroy American conservatism and that means destroying Ronald Reagan's legacy so she knows what she's doing. This is having me for, other Democrats have said and written awful things about Ronald Reagan.
INGRAHAM: In the 80s when in fact, you and I were working for Reagan, they were - I mean, this is the same stuff that led to his winning. I think we have a graphic of 1984 landslide victory. But this is what they are attacked him--
SHIRLEY: Combining his two elections in 1980-84, he won 1019 electoral votes to Carter/ Mondale who won 62 electoral votes. In many places in the country, he got split 25 if not 30% of the Democratic vote, if that's not unifying, I don't know what is.
INGRAHAM: Yes, that's just a - that's a bizarre. I mean, you look at that map. That was before Simpson was only two, right Craig? So that was a different world back then but you cannot deny, these were historical landslide definitely in 84.

INGRAHAM: We got to go, we got to go - we got to go, I'm sorry Craig but we'll check back with you. Thank you so much for coming on. Back in October, ‘Yours Truly' was attacked for pointing out that some members of the caravans at our borders might have unknown diseases because we don't know how they're screened and so forth.
Why those critics are eating crow tonight? Next stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: A pathetic Congress is expected to reject the President's emergency declaration at the border, this Thursday. A stunning and reckless move considering the news coming from the border. The U.S. government projects that nearly a 180,000 more migrants travelling as families are expected to cross the border by May.
Yes, that figure is correct. Officials told Fox News that they think, the total numbers for this fiscal year could exceed the combined numbers for the last three years. No crisis, no emergency, right?
Here now on whether Trump's emergency declaration passes constitutional muster is John Yoo, former Deputy AG under President George W. Bush and someone on the front lines of this fight.

Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb from Arizona, he's with us as well. Now John, as a constitutional matter because I've got my ear chewed off from people on Capitol Hill. What do you say to those Senate Republicans and here are their names, I want to put it up on the screen.
Marco Rubio, he's focused on Venezuela. Tom Tillis, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Rand Paul, thank you very much and Lamar Alexander, Mike Lee is apparently someone to watch, that's disturbing.
What about that? What do you say to them?
JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Laura, I think what they want is a different kind of law to apply to President Trump then has been applied to all previous Presidents because what they're doing is trying to claim that a statute, not a constitutional power.
President Trump's exercising power under a statute to declare an emergency and then to transfer money from military construction projects to the wall. Congress gave that power to the President and Congress can always take it back but what Congress really shouldn't be doing is second guessing a President's decision that the national emergency is there in the first place.
And just the facts you provided Laura. We're going to see a tripling of border crossings and border arrests in just one year. I think that's a sign that the President has access to information intelligence that maybe we didn't know about and that justify a declaration of a national emergency but if I was--
INGRAHAM: Yes, the video - the video is from I guess, that's from - is that from November, guys? I can't see, yes, it's November, that's November video, okay? The caravan, the numbers are much worse, groups, large groups of 100 and more are becoming more and more prevalent.

We brought all this to you last week, we don't have to recreate the you know the wheel, here. Sheriff, you're not far from the border where you are but you're feeling the effects of this border crisis and I'm telling you, this is - this is disgraceful, what's happening about 500 yards from where I'm sitting right now. It's absolutely disgraceful.
SHERIFF MARK LAMB, PINAL COUNTY, ARIZONA: It's disgraceful for us too because you know, we're sitting down here fighting this fight on the front line and listen to these politicians attack our President.
You know, whether you agree with them or don't, at least we have a President who's supporting law enforcement, who is fighting for border security, something that we've been clamoring for, for a while.
I know my border sheriffs. I'm 70 miles off the border but I can go out in the desert every night and I can wrangle up probably 5 to 10 bodies and 300 to 500 pounds of marijuana so it's definitely an issue we're dealing with.
And you know, the cartel rule, they don't have rules they are playing by. The other day we had a traffic stop and there was a lady in the front seat dressed as a nun with a Bible on her lap. We ended up finding 8 pounds of fentanyl in her undergarments so when you say there's not a problem, there's absolutely a problem.
And the cartel has no problem cross in any of those lines.
INGRAHAM: She was dressed as a nun? That's a new.

LAMB: Dresses as a nun.
INGRAHAM: How many people does that kill?
LAMB: Oh, fentanyl kills a lot, I mean a little tiny grain like a grain of sugar would kill a person so this would kill a lot of people and it's killing our youth every day.
INGRAHAM: No, no, no, I got to get back to John here because John, again, the conservatives, they say you're not a conservative, Laura. You don't believe in Article 1 power, you're all for the primary executive, for the unitary executive, all-important executive. It was back in the '70s they granted the president this right, correct?
YOO: Yes. Look, I can't believe these Republican senators are trying to do what liberals basically usually do. They want courts to step in and substitute their judgment about what's an emergency or what's necessary to protect the border for the president's. Under the Constitution, under these laws, that's the president's job. That's why the Constitution creates a presidents, so someone can back up the sheriffs of our country, people on the border. Someone can act quickly and swiftly to protect our country from unforeseen events, like a tripling in border crossings.
INGRAHAM: And by the way, one judge, remember, halted the presidents desired policy of only allowing asylees to come through ports of entry.  Remember, that happened a couple months ago. That one federal district court judge changed immigration. Right now we are seeing this immigration, they would all be able to be sent back. They would not be able to claim asylum. But because of that one judge, that's the situation we're in right now. So that's why people are crossing at non ports of entry.
Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight.

And last October, by the way, as those caravans were approaching the U.S. border, on this show, I warned of something that was being lost in the greater debate. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: This is a national security issue, an economic issue, costs taxpayers billions of dollars to take all his people in, public schools, health care, all of it, we know. It's a health issue, too, because we don't know what people have coming in here. We have diseases in this country we haven't had for decades.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The backlash I received was swift. I was immediately vilified for saying such a thing. How dare I? "Business Insider" called it a conspiracy theory. "The Washington Post" said it was dehumanizing. Well, wouldn't you know it. Today "Reuters" reported, or yesterday, excuse me, that outbreaks of infectious diseases among migrants, including cases of the mumps, measles, et cetera, have forced over 2,000 of them into quarantine at various detention centers across the country. So my question, will those critics now go after "Reuters"? Is it all dehumanizing?
Joining me now to discuss it, it's way beyond mumps, is Marc Siegel. Dr. Siegel, I was flayed for warning about this. But this is a real health risk to American citizens, especially American schoolchildren, is it not?
DR. MARC SIEGEL, NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER PROFESSOR: Absolutely right, Laura. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement has their hands full, 50,000 in detention centers, and as you just pointed out, over 2,000 known quarantine. Mumps travels through the air. Mumps, you may not have symptoms and you are spreading it. Measles as well. Also, chicken pox.  Also, there's cases of tuberculosis being found.

You know the biggest issue is that the Centers for Disease Control will screen legal immigrants. You're not allowed into this country legally unless they check your measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, you have to prove that you have received the vaccine and that it's working.
CDC told me tonight that they are playing catch up now. ICE is going to have to call them in to the quarantine people and to revaccinate them to check to see if their immune status is there. You're absolutely right calling this a public health emergency. That's part of the problem here, it's a big part of the problem, and it ties in with national security.  Multiple diseases are coming in with the migrants.
INGRAHAM: Dr. Siegel, also when someone comes in, and you say have you been vaccinated? How are you ever going to check that? You can't really - - there is no legitimate way to check, like call Honduras. Has x, y, or z gotten the various tetanus shot? You can't really check that, right? We have enough problems I think with people in the country not being vaccinated, that big controversy. But now this? We are overwhelmed. And they are going to vilified Alex Azar at HHS, and secretary of HHS? What is he supposed to do? The Democrats don't want to deal with this issue. He's left to pick up the pieces.
SIEGEL: By the way, Laura, you not only can't check it. You can't take someone's word for it because of course they're going to say yes, ma'am, yes, sir. But also, it wears off. This vaccine wears off, especially with mumps. And mumps can cause infertility, it can cause brain swelling. So these are not just minor childhood diseases we are talking about. We are seeing a measles resurgence mainly across the border. And then people that don't get vaccinated, like you said, people that refuse to get vaccinated, it spreads like wildfire to the unvaccinated population. This is threat, a public health threat. Also, mosquito borne diseases, there's 400,000 cases of malaria coming in, tuberculosis. So I don't know why the left doesn't want to talk about it. It's an actual issue.
INGRAHAM: But again, back to the point I made on THE ANGLE. They do not want to have a debate on these issues because they can't debate it. All they can say is you're racist. You're xenophobic. You're dehumanizing.  You're cruel. You're mean. That's all they have, because if you get down to the facts, they are putting Americans at risk, and Trump and his policies are actually geared, Dr. Siegel, toward keeping our people safe.  That's his first and most solemn obligation, to keep the American people safe, and he's trying to do that. He's not perfect. None of us are. But he's trying to do that.
SIEGEL: Laura, the CDC, who is really nonpartisan, calls this playing catch up. They are in the country, and then we've got to figure out what diseases they may carry. That says it all. That says at all.
INGRAHAM: Dr. Siegel, thank you so much.

And by the way, I'm not going to hold my breath for an apology from "The Washington Post."
Up next, new poll revealing that voters think Democrats have a growing anti-Semitism problem. Dershowitz reacts.
And later, America's first non-binary person says it was all a sham. Do you know what non-binary is? Some of you might not know what that means.  You're going to want to stick around to find out. Join me coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: The Democrats have a growing problem with anti-Semitism, and the voters can tell. A new Rasmussen poll found that 42 percent of likely voters think anti-Semitism is a growing problem in the Democratic Party, with just 35 percent disagreeing. After the Democratic caucus watered down their anti-Semitism declaration last week to protect Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, it's no wonder Americans believe the party is having a major blind spot on this issue.
Joining me now, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, and Raheel Raza, a Muslim professor and reformist. Professor, the media seem to care more about the president's claims that the Democrats are anti-Jewish rather than the glaring evidence that they might be so. So are you worried about the direction of your party, Professor Dershowitz?
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: I'm very worried. I don't think the Democratic Party is anti-Semitic, but I'm afraid that the Corbyn elements that could turn the Labour Party in Britain into a party that tolerates anti-Semitism could happen in the United States. The party is not anti-Semitic, but they refuse to confront the anti-Semitism of a few extremists on the left.
An example, when Black Lives Matter started, some people said, why black lives matter? All lives matter. People were accused of racism for saying that. If it's about black lives because blacks are being discriminated against, we have to say only black lives matter. We can't say all lives matter. But when it comes to Jews and there's anti-Semitism, you can't say anti-Semitism is bad. You have to say all isms are bad. And that's just wrong.
INGRAHAM: I agree. This is also a congresswoman, a sitting congresswoman.  It wasn't just some group somewhere more protesting. That's what made it different. And Raheel, I want to get you on this, because as a reformer, as a Muslim reformer, you take issue with this direction of a lot of these newbie congresswomen and their cohorts. I want to play something from another prominent newcomer, which is Rashida Tlaib and what she said about a Islamophobia. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why do you think your own party reacted so strongly against what she said?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH. I'm trying to figure it out. It's just this past week, I feel, and I know this would be somewhat shocking for some, but I think Islamophobia is very much among the Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you think Democrats have some Islamophobia, and that's at the root of some of this consternation?
TLAIB: I think our country is struggling with it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Raheel your thoughts.
RAHEEL RAZA, MUSLIM PROFESSOR AND REFORMIST: What the country is struggling with is a person like Ilhan Omar who was proven herself to be blatantly anti-Semitic. She is a disgrace to the United States. She is a liability for the Democrats, and she's an embarrassment for Muslims.
And then when she is caught out time and again making horrific anti-Semitic remarks, she falls back on the victim ideology, which is the Islamophobia card that has played so well by Islamists all over the world. And I am surprised that the Democrats can't see the through that. The victim card is that I'm the one being stigmatized. Rather, she has held back no words in her hatred for Jews and for Israel.
And this is absolutely appalling. I'm a Muslim woman. I want to distance myself from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, although it would have been so exciting for the first two Muslim congresswoman to have been elected. But what comes out of their mouths is appalling and vile and full of hate.
INGRAHAM: This is so interesting. Professor Dershowitz, I am so into the Muslim reform movement because I think it is so needed and it's so refreshing. I had an incredible guest on Friday, the former "Wall Street Journal" reporter has been focusing on Linda Sarsour and her radicalization. And now we hear from Raheel, and there are many like them.  But they don't -- and I'm going to give them a platform on the show. I think it is awesome. Raheel, I think you're awesome. I'm so glad you came on tonight. Honestly.
RAZA: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: I have got hair up on my arms because it's so exciting.
DERSHOWITZ: The best proof that we don't suffer from Islamophobia is that we welcome reformist Muslims. We want to hear from them. What we are opposed to as Americans are terrorism in the name of religion, no matter who the terrorists are, whether they are Christian fundamentalists who want to blow up on abortion clinic or Muslim terrorists who want to kill Jews.  We are opposed to the extremists on the terrorists. We are not opposed to Islam. And the best evidence of that is we will welcome Muslim reformers.  They are wonderful. They contribute so much in America. I was so thrilled when I heard the two Muslim women were elected to Congress for the first time, and then when they started spewing their hatred, it became very difficult because it will make it harder for Muslims --
INGRAHAM: Raheel.
RAZA: You are so right.
INGRAHAM: People have to understand what's really going on, and you have made a point that part of what they are doing is numbing the public to any differences in Muslim ideology and thought. Is that what's partly what's going on?
RAZA: This is a ploy of the Islamists since a long time, is to conflate anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, which are two entirely different things.  We know that anti-Semitism is institutionalized hatred of Jews. It's genocidal. And Ilhan Omar can't say that she didn't know. She's not naive. She got elected to Congress. She's in a position of power and she has a responsibility to actually speak out and support the Jewish community that is facing such appalling pushback all over the world, especially in Europe. Here I am and my organization and we support the Jewish -- and the Democratic Party, I agree with you, they have their head stuck in the sand.  They have an obligation.
INGRAHAM: Hey, Alan, we are almost out of time. Alan, really, really quickly, what does the Democrat Party do here? If what Raheel is saying is true, they've got a big problem on their hands.
DERSHOWITZ: They do, and they have to make sure they don't become the Labour Party because the Labour Party is losing good and decent people in England because of Corbyn. And you can't let extremists hijack the party.  And the best thing to do is marginalize them. Take them off committees the way the Republicans took off a committee somebody who expressed bigoted views. That's what the Democrats have to do. They have to respond in a very vigorous way, zero tolerance for anti-Semitism.
INGRAHAM: What they are doing now ain't working. Alan, Raheel, fantastic.  Great to have you both on.
And with the aid of liberal groups and judges, he became the first American to legally identify as neither a man or a woman. But now he says it was all a sham. Jamie Shupe is here to share why the rush to normalize transgenderism in his view is a dangerous game, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: In 2015, he became an outspoken voice for the transgender community. A year later he was praised for being the first American to be legally recognized as what they call non-binary. Jamie Shupe was the darling of the LGBTQ world. Instead of recognizing, though, a desperate cry for help, doctors, judges, and activists used him to advance their cause, he says. They took advantage of his vulnerability as an Army veteran suffering from PTSD to break barriers. Shupe will never be the same.
Joining me now to tell his story, and it's shocking, is Jamie Shupe himself. Jamie, thank you for being here. It takes a lot of courage to be here. You say that the transgender community has not only turned their backs on you, but are now attacking you? What happened?
JAMIE SHUPE, FIRST "NON-BINARY" AMERICAN: That's correct, Laura. The minute you denounce anything transgenderism-wise, you're automatically an outcast. For example, I support President Trump's ban on transgender military service. I do not agree with transitioning children or transgender surgeries. I'm against all of this.
INGRAHAM: Now, did you take the hormones and start doing all that? You didn't obviously do surgery, I guess, but you did start taking estrogen and progesterone? What did you do?
SHUPE: Yes, I took estrogen and progesterone. I now have irreversible breast growth. I had a number of health complications from this. I have now bone density problems, I've had kidney problems. And at one point my mental health was so destabilized by the hormones that I had two stays in a psychiatric ward because of it.
INGRAHAM: Do you think this kind of push is being used broadly, more broadly? I hear from a lot of people, you see a lot of examples. Heritage Foundation did a big panel of feminists who are actually really upset by this because they think people are being kind of pushed into this kind of view of life and transgenderism him before they really kind of know they are. Or is that wrong?
SHUPE: No, that's completely correct. My hat is off to the Heritage Foundation because it's really the only place that people such as myself and these radical feminists are getting a voice. We've been completely silenced by the left. As you said, I was previously a transgender media darling, and now the "New York Times" doesn't want to talk about me anymore or even acknowledge that I exist because I no longer support this stuff.  The conservatives are to be commended for what they are doing to help us, to help children.
INGRAHAM: Have you talked to other people who began transitioning and maybe even did transition? Have they reached out to you, if they have regrets? Do they look to for advice or just to share a story?
SHUPE: Yes, Laura. Regret, unfortunately, is very common. But again the media doesn't want to talk about the surgeries that go wrong and the host of health complications. And it's really wrong to even call this transition because gender identity is, essentially it's legal fiction.  First they claimed that I was a woman, and then they claimed that I was a combination of male and female, and everybody went along with this. But as I said, it's nothing but legal fiction.
INGRAHAM: Sergeant, we wish you the best. I know it's incredible -- it sounds incredibly traumatic and difficult, and I hope you'll stay in touch with us, and we'll certainly stay in touch with you. Thank you so much.
SHUPE: Thank you, too, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Absolutely.
Coming up, we have a close out, and it's a Twitter smackdown that, well, I think you'll like. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for tonight's Twitter smackdown.
My guests earlier tonight, Craig Shirley, called out AOC over her swipe at Reagan, noting there is no evidence AOC ever picked up a book on President Reagan. AOC responded to Craig, "OK, great, now talk about Reagan and Iran Contra and gutting of our mental health system, the explosion of homelessness under his watch, the crack epidemic. Maybe instead of insinuating that I've never read a book, be open to the idea that we've read different ones."
Well, here's my advice for AOC. Here's my tweet. "Talk about Obama and Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRS scandal, Hillary private server, the gutting of welfare reform, the explosion of racial division, the opioid epidemic," et cetera, et cetera. We have read different books.
That's all the time we have tonight. A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com. Shannon Bream and the "Fox News @ Night" team take it from here. I'll be in New York tomorrow night.
