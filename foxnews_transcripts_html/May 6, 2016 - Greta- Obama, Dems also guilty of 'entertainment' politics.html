Let's all go "Off the Record." President Obama said this today about the 2016 presidential race.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

BARRACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States and what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {

Not entertainment? Not reality TV? Well, that's a thinly-veiled reference to Republican candidate Donald Trump. And I realize this is politics, and both parties can't resist getting their digs in, making cracks. some use crass language, some use a calm voice, but I do agree with president Obama. Running for president is not about entertainment.
It's a very serious job, but let's be honest: It isn't just one party in the entertainment business. Remember President Obama's appearance on "Between Two Ferns"? Or what about being interviewed by a woman who is known for eating cereal out of a bathtub? That's not exactly hard-hitting news. It's showbiz, and yet they all do it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, of course, each denies it. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
