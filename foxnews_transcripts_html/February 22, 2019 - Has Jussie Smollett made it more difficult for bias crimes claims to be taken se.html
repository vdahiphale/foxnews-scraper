DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
This is a Fox News alert, big breaking news on several fronts, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitution, the billionaire denying the allegations but police say there's video. And R&B singer R. Kelly indicted on ten counts of aggravated sex abuse involving four victims, much more on those two stories ahead. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, new developments in the Jussie Smollett case, the producers of Empire say they're removing his character from the final two episodes of the current season. The actor met with the cast and crew yesterday, he reportedly apologized and maintains his innocence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Smollett's lawyers also firing back at Chicago authorities saying, quote, Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity, and fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meantime, Chicago leaders continue to criticize Smollett, Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying he put the city at risk.

MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL, D-CHICAGO: You have put all of those real stories at risk for your fake story. That is not right. That is not right for Chicago. That is not right for what kind of city we are. That is the city I know. That is the city that actually loves people because they love the city, they care in our common humanity. And he put that all at risk. You want to get paid more? Get an agent, but don't use your sexual orientation. Don't use your race and have everybody's sympathy come to you. And it turns out it was none of that was true.

GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Yeah. That's a -- I haven't seen him that mad since chick-fil-a.
PERINO: What do you think about Smollett's lawyer blaming the system?
GUTFELD: I wrote that down, it's the system. And again, they're using the terms that they're hoping ingratiate with the media. It's like blame the system, I am oppressed. This guy wasn't oppressed. He was making 60 to $100,000 an episode and still only paid the two Nigerians $3500. So he's worse than a liar.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And not even in cash.
GUTFELD: He's a cheap bastard, seriously. I have, you know -- I have a theory on why a lot of people fell for this. I don't think anybody here thought this was real. But I think a lot of students who went to college in the last decade or so are now employed in media, entertainment human resources, and they went to college when the victimhood virus began, right?
And so they graduated and they've moved on, and they're in newspapers, they're on -- they're working in television. They fall for this. They don't have the immune system to see that these stories -- I'm trying to be -- I'm trying to be forgiving here. But they don't have to immune system to see what a bunch of baloney this is.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if you've been around -- if you've been around for -- in the real world, you would have smelled this and you wouldn't have given it all the attention, unfortunately at CNN they have a lot of people that fell for it.

PERINO: I have this guy on the 2 o'clock show, The Daily Briefing today, Jesse, his name is Eric Dezenhall and he's involved in crisis management and has done a lot of big cases, celebrity cases and things like that. And he said that it is often the case that somebody who's a perpetrator of such a thing doesn't even realize, that truly doesn't realize how much trouble they are in. And do we have this -- oh, we have -- let's play that.

ERIC DEZENHALL, CRISIS MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT: In almost every case I've ever seen, they generally believed themselves the victim. Even if they did the thing they're accused of, the rationale is I have a reason that people like you just don't understand.

WATTERS: I will not forgive, though, Smollett's legal team because I think they're being totally asinine. They have now victimized the Chicago Police Department and the city twice. Smollett sandbagged the police department, sent them all on these wild-goose chases after they gave him the benefit of the doubt, made them waste all this time and money, and now the legal team is coming out and saying, they're corrupt, this is a political prosecution, and there is an injustice taking place?
That is the dumbest possible strategy I could ever imagine him taking. If I were them, I would say innocent until proven guilty. My client will wait until all the facts come out. Maybe there's some more things that no one knows about. And then, I would hunker down and go dark. What they're doing to him is a betrayal of what they should be doing as attorneys because they're landing him in more trouble because now the police hate him even more.
PERINO: Because they're trying to make him a double victim, Juan --

And they are calling attention to the wrong aspect, to the wrong angle, and you are right that they should have been behind the scenes doing all that they can to mitigate what is, frankly, a personal offense being taken by the city of Chicago, right? We've seen the mayor, we've seen the superintendent, that that city is not forgiving anyone anytime soon.
And interestingly, you know, I see this kind of digging in and refusing to admit anything. Often times, when the weight of the government comes and it's going to turn its eyes to you, but here it could literally be some type of case of narcissism where you were saying earlier, when you honestly believe that you are in the right, and that no matter what, even if you acknowledge the physical execution of something that you're not actually guilty, that's what --

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: This is a Fox News alert, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft charged with soliciting sex at a Florida spa, the allegations steaming from a widespread investigation into an international human trafficking ring, he billionaire denying the charges. Trace Gallagher standing by with the latest developments, Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: And, Juan, police say there's videotape to back up their claims, the 77-year-old Kraft is accuse of paying for sexual acts at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida, which is about 90 miles north of Miami.
That spot and nine others around the state have now been shut down following a month-long human trafficking investigations that investigators say showed that numerous women were involved in, quote, sexual servitude, even alleging that some of the women were not allowed to leave the premises.
We should note Kraft is not being accused in any way of being involved in human trafficking, but police say they have video of Kraft and others receiving the sexual acts and that he participated two separate times.
The Jupiter police chief said he was equally shocked to learn that Kraft who's worth $6 billion was paying for sex in a strip mall massage parlor. A spokesperson from the New England Patriots says, quoting, we categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.

The NFL also weighed in, quoting again, the NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor development. And earlier, President Trump responded to the allegations, watch.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Well, it's very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He's proclaimed his innocence totally, and -- but I'm very surprised to see it.

GALLAGHER: Bob Kraft's wife of 48 years died of ovarian cancer back in 2011. He, reportedly, is now dating a 39-year-old woman. And, of course, just a few weeks ago, his Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl title. These are misdemeanor charges meaning they don't normally carry jail time. Juan
WILLIAMS: Trace, thanks so much. Emily, ESPN Adam Schefter said Robert Kraft is not even the biggest name on this list. Oh, let's listen -- oh, here's the (INAUDIBLE).

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are people down there in that area, I'm told, who say that this story is going to heat up and get a lot worse. And I don't mean involving Robert Kraft. I'm talking about with all these human trafficking that has gone on down there. I'm also told that Robert Kraft is not the biggest name involved down there in South Florida, and we'll see what police turn up in court.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: When Adam Schefter says see what police turn up, part of the urgency of this is the video, apparently, police had cameras inside the Orchid of Asia Spa and actually have video of these sex acts taking place. What does that mean in a legal sense to you?
COMPAGNO: Yes. You've said a couple of things. So number one, the surveillance video that was used to answer your last question first. What it means there's pretty much, you know, that could be slam-dunk evidence, right? And these charges of engaging in an act with prostitution, that kind of lower level crime and that slam-dunk.
But I would have the larger picture fleshed out for viewers for a moment which is this is a multi-county, multi-country, human trafficking investigation. And the reason why Florida is particularly ripe for this, last year they did a similar investigation, they arrested 277 individuals for the same kind of thing, prostitution on the low-end up to human trafficking.
These -- the sheriff of one of those counties in Florida, he said this is the tip of the tip of the iceberg. And he anticipates hundreds of arrests as well, one hundred in terms of engaging in the acts because that particular spa had up to 20 men a day staying there for 30 to 60 minutes, but up to larger charges. And so, I think -- and the federal government -- we just slammed five Mexican nationals for participating in a human sex trafficking ring sentencing them to 25 years in prison.
So this is something that the DOJ and particularly the State of Florida have invested a tremendous amount of resources too, and it's not just that spa. So, I think it's important to make sure that we keep that global view on it because, yes, to come are hundreds of arrests coming out of the sheriff's mouth

WILLIAMS: Well, we saw in Atlanta at the Super Bowl, there were lot of arrests last year in Minneapolis at the Super Bowl. But people say it's not just the Super Bowl, this is an ongoing issue such as that strip mall, Jesse.
WATTERS: Well, I mean, he's a billionaire and he's never going to serve any jail time. It's just an embarrassment for him. He's innocent until proven guilty. I have no idea what happened. Listen, people, you know, make jokes about it. They all think it's a big deal. They say everybody, you know, does it. But at the same time, if women are being traffic and held against their will then, obviously, those are the people that you need to look out for, and it's not a victimless crime. So, you know, he'll fight the charges and he'll probably get off.
WILLIAMS: But you're not happy about it.
WATTERS: No, I'm not happy, why would you think I'm happy?
(CROSSTALK) PERINO: I think he doesn't have to have an emotion about it.
WATTERS: I'm an Eagles fan, Juan.

        }
      
PERINO: Well, I would say -- the other thing that has changed is that there has been an increased focus on human trafficking because it has gone up. The American people, actually -- unfortunately we're the number one consumers of human trafficking and sex slaves.
And so, that -- there has been a concerted effort by the Justice Department under Obama and continued under President Trump, and advanced under President Trump to try to crack down on people who are trafficking -- and it's not just women, sometimes this happens to men as well.
It's not always sex slaves. It could sometimes be slavery. Like you get told, oh, you know, we're going to get you this piece, you will get to come to America and we're going to send you to college, but you find out, oh, in order to go to college you actually have to clean this hotel for pennies until you can get out of debt. Like the trick is, right, you never get out of debt.
So I'm interested in the fact it is an international one. It is multi- county. But I also think that it's multi month. If you go back, I think this has a lot of tentacles, and the Justice Department should be praised for trying to figure out who the real perpetrators are.
WILLIAMS: Greg, unless you have something immediate to -- I just want to switch a little bit --
GUTFELD: Sure.

GUTFELD: Yes.
GUTFELD: And ask you, R. Kelly, 52 now, indicted. I don't know if you saw this documentary surviving R. Kelly. But I think this has prompted not only law enforcement to focus on him but additional people to come forward to.
GUTFELD: Two-point, the R. Kelly scandals have been going on for so long that they're officially older than his victims. And what's interesting to me is that Avenatti is back. He handed over a videotape of him -- R. Kelly engaging with sex with an underage girl to the Chicago police. Avenatti has more life than Super Mario.
COMPAGNO: Yeah.
GUTFELD: I almost have to hand it to him that it's like he just pops up again, there he is. He's the Super Mario of crazy lawyers.
WILLIAMS: You know, but -- I've read then had a press conference this week, she brought up two women. So, is it like -- you think the documentary did this? Would they have done anything if it wasn't for public pressure?
GUTFELD: I have no idea come. I don't know. I'd tell you what? He's selling tickets in Germany.

GUTFELD: You know what's funny? No matter how bad you are you always got fans. I mean, look at O.J. There're people who still think O.J. is innocent, right? I mean, R. Kelly still has -- R. Kelly had women showing up at the court case that he ended up hooking up with.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: If you make more than $10 million in one year, which is a pretty good year, you're 10 million and $1 gets taxed at 70 percent. Which, by the way, we used to have marginal tax rates under Republican presidents of 90 percent. It really comes down to the question of isn't $10 million enough? Like, when does it stop?
(END VIDEO CLIP)

COMPAGNO: Ocasio-Cortez and he controversial colleagues also downplaying Rashida Tlaib profane call to impeach President Trump.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: Rashida (INAUDIBLE) for saying a bobo word.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, they say a word we see every 5 minutes --
(CROSSTALK)
OCASIO-CORTEZ: And I ended up -- Rashida, I sent her a text and I was like, don't worry about it. Like -- I mean, who cares? And she was like, yeah, I mean, I'm from Detroit. Like, back then that's just what we call - -
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: no, honestly, that same deck gone. Like, the double standard in that guy never gets in trouble with all of the bobo words.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: That's right.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we have a beef with almost everyone here because there's a lack of courage.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And it seems like we're all radical because we care about the people that we represent and we want to throw down for them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COMPAGNO: Question for you, Juan, how is it that there's a pride in being radical because they want to throw down for their constituents, but yet they have also said why they don't want to fund ICE, for example, is because of ICE's radical agenda. How can they pick and choose what is a good kind of radical?
WILLIAMS: It's not hard, you can pick the right side of history is to use a cliche. But, I mean, what they're worried about si their constituents, and I think they have every right to do that. They say they want to throw down for their constituents, boy, it sounds like a politician out there looking for votes. I think the problem would be, for example, you know, the accusations, and I think in this case legitimate accusations of anti- Semitic rhetoric, when you're talking about the Benjamins and the Israeli influence.
But when it comes to things like, you know, social security, Medicare, and the like, and even the high tax rate in this era of income inequality, I don't think they're that radical because most Americans according to the Post agree with them.
GUTFELD: Until they read.
COMPAGNO: Jesse, at what point is that going to catch up with them?
WATTERS: Well, I mean, I'm not that irritated by them. I don't like what they say, kind of like how they say it, it's fresh. They probably get along with President Trump if they put politics aside, you know. They go down to Mar-a-Lago and probably whoop it up. I want to talk about taxes --
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I want to talk about taxes -- no, they seem fun. They seem, you know, young and exciting, and, you know, they seem normal. But, with a 70 percent tax rate deal, OK, over $10 million, all right? It's enough money.
Tell Floyd Mayweather he can't have another car who's worked his way up from nothing, who worked his butt off. Tell Serena Williams to her face, you know, Serena, I'm going to tell you, you can't have that vacation home. Tell LeBron James who donates a lot of money to charity, you know what, enough. You don't get to take home any more.
If you look at Beyonce, I'd love her to look Beyonce in the face who made $60 million last year under her plan, she gets to take home $20 million, not 30, so $10 million Beyonce has to give to the feds and let AOC play around with it?
It's Beyonce's money. She -- that's money for her kids, her grandkids. She spends it at the local economy. What's really going to happen here is this rich people are just going to put these millions or whatever in this sophisticated instruments that hides the taxes and shelter it from the IRS. And they aren't going to have to pony it up anyway.
WILLIAMS: Don't you think there's a rage in the country at the too big to fail crowd?
WATTERS: I don't have any rage. I'm a love, Juan.
WILLIAMS: I believe that.
WATTERS: OK.
COMPAGNO: Dana, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, you know, for once we're not fighting over what's getting done, we're fighting over how it's getting done, but hasn't that been politics this entire time?
PERINO: Yeah, I think that's maybe getting a little ahead of ourselves. It's going to be amazing when AOC is a multimillionaire, but it's going to happen.
WATTERS: It's going to happen quick.
PERINO: She will do it. She will sell a book. She might be a public servant for a long time. But, as you know, almost every of these leaders of state and Congress for a long time do become millionaires. It will happen to her. I also would like to have a talk to Carty B. Remember we had that video from the other day where she was like, wait, what? You are going to take this money from me, I don't think so.
So I think these new freshmen congressmen, they have an audience. It is a small and energized sort of audience and they believe that the government can do everything better. And they're just - the rest of the country does not think that's true but it will - there will be an interesting debate going forward.
There is - it's not just a little bit of things on 70%. It's a big debate coming up and I'm looking forward to it.
COMPAGNO: Greg, at what point is that experience going to catch up with them and are they going to see reality ever that the government can't press?
GUTFELD: As long as they're protected from reality, they never do. So you can be Bernie Sanders, protected from reality, it's the socialist with three homes. It's frustrating because I don't understand how people can buy this crap because they're not talking about creating anything.
It's only about taking, there's never any innovation, it's confiscation. How do you want to be part of something that doesn't create or doesn't innovate or build things. Instead all you do is you look at a successful person and say I want 70% of what you did.
This is the first thing a hard leftist does, when they are elected because they have no creative ideas. The first thing they think is take. It's - it's - to me, it's evil. Right now their power is limited so they can only talk about it but once they have real power, what are they going to do?
And the only way they can exist in this society - in order to be a leftist in which you can take things, you have to have a free market of capitalists to make the things. So without capitalism, you can't have leftism. Basically capitalism the free market is the boat, they are the barnacles. So they're
WILLIAMS: Let me argue with you just a second.
GUTFELD: I'm sorry, I'm done Juan.
WILLIAMS: If I'm Gordan Gecko and I say to you greed is good and bail me out, I'm Wall Street, the other companies will feel, I'm going to take over companies, fire people, send jobs to China and these guys say, well that's capitalism.
GUTFELD: Well, sooner or later--
WATTERS: That wasn't capitalism though. Too big to fail and all that cash we sent to Wall Street, lot of people didn't think we should have done that.
WILLIAMS: No, that's what this is about.
GUTFELD: No, it's not actually about--
PERINO: It's the right idea.
GUTFELD: It's not about that. It's about punishing the people who make the world work. Sooner or later, they're going to kill the goose. AOC was rejoicing that Amazon left New York City. 25,000 jobs, imagine the huge tax base, all that stuff gone. They were going to - the more you do, that you're going to destroy the city you belong to.
That's your constituency that you just screwed. Anyway, sorry.
COMPAGNO: All right you guys. We got to go but coming up.
GUTFELD: Sheez, that is a total set up. This happened last time, she was reading off the teleprompter.
PERINO: You're right I did cheat.
COMPAGNO: I know why things got testy between Greg and Dana during Tucker's final exam in the Fastest 7, coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest 7. First up, college hoops superstars Zion Williamson is not the only one feeling pain over this freak injury.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANNOUNCER: Zion Williamson is down. He blew through his shoe. Look at his left shoe. He blew completely through the shoe and then he started holding his right knee.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Look at that right there if you could see that and boom, shoe explodes. So he had a little knee sprain, it's not that bad. Nike's stock dropped by over $1 billion though before bouncing back a little bit today. Company's still trying to figure out what happened.
I mean, Greg, that must happen to you all the time on the court?
GUTFELD: Well, it actually happened - it happened to me in the eighties which is why I retired.
WATTERS: Oh, that's why you retired.
GUTFELD: If you realize, if you remembered.
WATTERS: What were you, the center?
GUTFELD: I was a forward for the Pistons.
WILLIAMS: He was 6.7 - 280 at that time.
GUTFELD: Yes exactly and a horrible, horrible workplace accident after that and I'm only on the side.
WATTERS: All right, those are the Duke Blue Devils, Dana and that is basketball.
PERINO: Yes, my friend GD Mamo-
WATTERS: Oh, he mansplained.
PERINO: Yes, how dare you? GD Mamo went to UNC, she told me go heal, so she was very happy but she felt bad for him. Tyrus was on the daily briefing. He, I think has me convinced that these players should be allowed to go straight to pro.
WATTERS: Well, I don't want to see that, I want to see him least one year so I can watch some great college basketball in March, right Juan?
WILLIAMS: Yes, sure but they should be paid. You see, that's the thing because look, Nike's making money. Right? They've got a deal with the Blue Devils in terms of supplying the sneakers and all the equipment. The coach is getting paid hugely.
WATTERS: That's true.
WILLIAMS: I mean everybody's getting paid except the people who are performing and that's crazy.
PERINO: And they just have to go to class.
WATTERS: That's true, oh, you convinced me.
WILLIAMS: No, they don't have to go to class because they're not going to graduate.
WATTERS: Well, at Duke, they maybe make you go to one class.
GUTFELD: Hey, do you know why the Devils are blue?
WATTERS: Why is that?
GUTFELD: Sad.
WILLIAMS: What about the Demon Deacons?
WATTERS: Do you have any more college masks? Oh, what do you think?
COMPAGNO: Just that you know, Nike lost a $1 billion but they spent $11 billion every year on endorsements and contracts so the smartest thing they could do is give Zion another pair of shoes and he will sign.
WATTERS: I'm fine with Adidas after that explosion.
COMPAGNO: But that's what I'm saying. The best thing for Nike would be if he was like, it's all good, here's a new pair and it works this time.
WATTERS: All right, it's all good. Up next, the force is strong in France. The countries fencing federation, do we have one of those, is not recognizing a Lightsaber duels as an official sport. Now don't worry, these high tech swords can't cut anybody in half but they do make these cool sound effects. I don't know. Whoosh, is that what it's supposed to sound like? Whoosh. There it is, can we hear it?
COMPAGNO: That doesn't sound like that.
WATTERS: You know, another reason, that I hate France Emily. I mean this is pathetic. This is why they lose every World War.
COMPAGNO: My mom fenced in high school which I think is really cool but of that I mean, I don't know.
WATTERS: Would you not date - you wouldn't date one of the men from the fencing federation for us.
COMPAGNO: Without knocking people who enjoy that, no, thank you.
WATTERS: Okay, Juan, what do you think?
WILLIAMS: So I was reading today that break dancing may now be an Olympic sport. I was fascinated by this, I mean, it's like a new generation of sports. It's like they have people who go out on the stake boards now, that's going to be in the Olympics.
WATTERS: That's called skateboarding Juan.
WILLIAMS: I think--
GUTFELD: Didn't they get on the Twitter.
WILLIAMS: Yes, exactly. I'm an old man Gregory. It's okay, so what should I have said.
PERINO: Can I mention something though. If you are a parent and you really want your child to go to an Ivy League school and you're looking to get a scholarship, do you know the best sport? Fencing.
WATTERS: Really?
PERINO: Yes. And Sydney Person who was our college associate, remember her? She was here a few summers. She fences for UNC.
WATTERS: I mean I have to get my twins fencing lessons.
PERINO: Yep.
WATTERS: All right, because there's no way they're getting into an Ivy league school.
GUTFELD: You who is also into fencing? Our President Donald Trump, down at the border. Fencing should be a sport which is go down to the border and make fences.
WATTERS: All right, here we go, this is the best part. Things got a little heated during Dana and Greg's final exam rematch on Tucker's show, last night and apparently, it's one for the record books, watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: If elected in November of 2020, Bernie Sanders would be the oldest President in American history. How old would he be on inauguration day?
GUTFELD: It came in early.
PERINO: 77. You're right, I did cheat.
CARLSON: Wrong, it goes to Greg.
GUTFELD: Pow.
CARLSON: Dana, obviously I'm rooting for you.
PERINO: Do you know the answer?
GUTFELD: I would say 80 but I already won.
PERINO: 77.
CARLSON: So you're saying 80, Greg.
GUTFELD: No, I already won, I'm not answering. I'm taking the fifth, I'm taking the fifth.
CARLSON: No, you have to answer the question.
GUTFELD: Talk to my lawyer. She - I already won.
PERINO: You say the answer.
GUTFELD: All right, 77.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He'll be 79.
GUTFELD: Oh no, you. No, no, no, we're not doing this anymore. She cheats. So I won with the score of 0.
CARLSON: I'm not even sure what to say. My mouth is open. This is the lowest score ever recorded.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: 0 to -1, Dana. I mean I actually probably have but yes, I did not - I did not do well last night. I might just had the giggles.
WATTERS: Yes, very controversial too Greg.
GUTFELD: I think we found a game that is actually has lower scoring than soccer. I mean the fact that I won with 0 is pretty amazing.
WATTERS: That's pretty good.
WILLIAMS: But I'm sure Bernie Sanders was watching. I'm sure he's proud of you, right?
WATTERS: Yes, that's right, I don't know, what do you think about that?
COMPAGNO: I loved it.
WATTERS: Did they represent “The Five” well?
COMPAGNO: Yes, I thought it was hilarious. I saw it like or whatever. I thought you guys were so funny and it was cute when you were like I'm so embarrassed but you said it super deadpanned. You were like I'm so embarrassed.
PERINO: Yes.
COMPAGNO: And it was relatable. Honestly, it was relatable to see--
PERINO: Relatable to who? You?
COMPAGNO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Hey, take it easy.
WATTERS: You know, Greg's on fire. You won yesterday's quiz on Five and Tucker.
GUTFELD: I'm too--
WATTERS: They'll play the ponies Gutfeld. Stay right there. Fan mail Friday is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Holy smoke.
GUTFELD: All right, David Lee Ross, the greatest singer. All right, Fan Mail Friday. From Rick Denton, if you received a box with everything you ever lost in it, what would you look for first? Jesse.
WATTERS: Well, my grandmother gave me this very, very special brass fishermen mold and I put in my locker and someone jacked it in middle school. I'd look for that first. It's a big shiny object. I'll probably see it.
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: Let me - you know, there's things like baseball cards and jerseys when I was a high school kid but I think picking up on what Jesse said, my dad gave me like a gold ornament that hangs off a chain.
WATTERS: A medallion?
WILLIAMS: It wasn't a medallion, it was like a cross.
WATTERS: I think I took that.
WILLIAMS: It was in Jesse's locker.
PERINO: So these - essentially because we are talking about sentimental things, I don't know if I've actually lost this item.
GUTFELD: All right.
PERINO: But I worry that I have but I have--
GUTFELD: Your soul?
PERINO: No, my great grandmother's gold wedding band, it's what I got married in and I didn't have like big white fancy wedding - then I had - and I wore it for a long time and then I put it in a very special safe place.
GUTFELD: But you can't remember?
PERINO: No.
GUTFELD: That's great.
PERINO: Yes, so I'd look for that.
COMPAGNO: Literally that exact same thing happened to my mom and I feel like I haven't really lost anything but she tucked away her mother's wedding ring and we all helped her look for it and so I would borrow.
PERINO: It drives you crazy. You think about it all the time.
COMPAGNO: Yes, I would find that fir her.
GUTFELD: It's either the Joe DiMaggio baseball card, who was with the Seals, that was stolen from my wallet or my brother Steve. Yes, I lost Steve in the mall.
WATTERS: Don't forget about your pride, Greg.
GUTFELD: Yep. My pride was gone a long time. You know, I don't miss my pride.
WILLIAMS: What about your dignity?
GUTFELD: Dignity? Those things are a burden. Ooh, this is great. Angiebaby330, wait a minute I think she worked well. No anyway. Do you have nightmares/dreams about this show? I know Dana does, right?
PERINO: Yes, I have them a lot right so in fact, I just had one last week and it involves Juan that I haven't told anybody about. So I had this dream that I was sitting here and you three weren't here yet and Juan and I were sitting there and he said Dana, I need to talk to you. We need to have more conflict on this show.
Like you need to have more arguments, like we need to get in more fights and I said but I just say, what I think, I don't really want to fight and you said, well, the management told me that I needed to tell you--
GUTFELD: Are you sure, this was a dream?
PERINO: Yes. Well, the problem with work dreams is you wake up and you think, was that a dream?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Yes, so I had that work dream.
GUTFELD: That's an interesting dream.
WATTERS: Well, you know my policy Greg. I don't share my dreams. I think its weak. So I will not be sharing them.
GUTFELD: Jesse gets a pass. All right Emily.
COMPAGNO: So odd. You know, I have the like unprepared and then I wake up or leave like, oh thank God, that was just a dream.
PERINO: Yes, I can't imagine you being unprepared.
COMPAGNO: Thanks.
GUTFELD: What about you Juan?
WATTERS: Well, doing the show is Juan's nightmare.
WILLIAMS: That's pretty good. No, I think for me, it's calming down so I actually will replay things because that's the kind of person I am. I replay things in my head. I should have said this.
WATTERS: I should have said this to Jesse.
WILLIAMS: To Jesse, yes. I should have said, Jesse, you're brilliant.
GUTFELD: I always dreamed that I show up naked.
WILLIAMS: Well, thank you.
GUTFELD: And I'm sure a few other people dream that too.
PERINO: Your dream, our nightmare.
GUTFELD: All right, I don't know if I like that one. I don't like that one. And all right, you are the last question on who wants to be a millionaire and only one call to somebody left, who would you call, Emily and why?
COMPAGNO: What's the topic?
GUTFELD: I don't know, I don't watch the show.
COMPAGNO: Well, I mean meaning it would have to - it would depend on the question, obviously.
GUTFELD: Does it? No, no. The person is chosen beforehand, right?
COMPAGNO: No, you have three choices.
GUTFELD: Oh really?
PERINO: No, you can phone a friend, it's open ended.
GUTFELD: Oh really, it's open ended. Okay, so you have no friends. Jesse.
WATTERS: See, I would know the answer and then I'd call my dad and I'd say, hey day, I'm about to win $1 million.
GUTFELD: Dana?
PERINO: I'll call Peter. He's like - he's the personal Google.
WATTERS: I might call Peter too,
GUTFELD: Juan?
WILLIAMS: Well, I guess, I'd Google it.
GUTFELD: Yes, you can't call Google I would - you know, who I would call? I would call the person who writes the question who wants to be a millionaire.
WILLIAMS: What if you called Alexa?
GUTFELD: Oh, there you go. All right, one more thing is up next. Isn't that fun?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right, you've seen the weather forecast. All around the world, it's been cold and some kind hearted Estonian workers rescue a dog.
He was in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday. Unware of the fact that they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf in their car.
WATTERS: A wolf?
PERINO: They were working on a dam in the Parnu river, they spotted the animal, they took it to the vet and lo and behold, it was a wolf. But he was taken care of, they put a GPS tracker on him and this group, the Estonian union for the protection of animals is going to make sure he's okay, going forward.
That's really nice, I mean animals are great.
GUTFELD: You know that dogs are wolfs, right?
PERINO: Well, but wild wolfs and domestic--
GUTFELD: They are all wolfs. Dogs actually think they're wolves, just so you know.
WATTERS: This is not a quiz, guys.
PERINO: I'm going to get it wrong anyway. Juan, go.
WILLIAMS: All right, so as Dana was saying we're deep in winter here in the USA. Daylight savings time, still a few weeks away but there's some light to be seen right now. Take a look at this.
Yes, that's this week's super snow moon in all its glory. It's the biggest and brightest moon of the year. It appears so are just so bright because the moon is at its closest point to earth for the year.
GUTFELD: It's still the same size on TV. Look at that.
WILLIAMS: Look at that, you're right. And check this out. Here's another spectacular show of natural light, this time of year, this one from Yosemite National Park. What looks like fire or a lava flowing down the mountain, is actually water reflecting sunlight. The fire falls as they're called, a rear visual effect that occurs when the light hits and reflects horsetail falls, just the right angle in late February.
And don't forget, Punxsutawney Phil said, we're going to get a lot of light very soon due to an early spring so that's something to look forward to.
PERINO: That is something to look forward to. Also something to look forward to Greg tomorrow night.
GUTFELD: Greg Gutfeld show, 10:00 PM, Saturday night. It's a barn burner. We got Dr. Drew Pinsky, we got the dude who killed Bin Laden, our buddy Rob O'Neil, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, February 23, be there, be there, be there. All right, let's go to this.
ANNOUNCER: Animals are great. Stick it in your ads are great. It'll never go away.
GUTFELD: You know what? Whenever I need a feather and I do need a feather, I'll go call my pal, Bill. Let's go to Bill, huh.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: It's a shoebill stork and whenever you need a feather, this little guy, he'll always look under it and give you one.
Isn't that adorable? I have seven of these at home. I have feathers all over the apartment, Dana.
PERINO: I don't really want to know why do you have feathers all over your apartment.
GUTFELD: I think you'd be more concerned that I have shoebill storks.
PERINO: Animals are great.
WATTERS: I always thought storks were imaginary creatures.
ANNOUNCER: Animals are great.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Storks are real animals. You got to see it to believe it. Okay, the latest addition of Jesse's hair news. Okay, this stylist in San Antonio. Rob, the original turned this lady's dome into a work of art.
GUTFELD: Wow.
WATTERS: She's riding a horse, not a stork, a horse and if you guys treated me enough, I will get that in my head.
GUTFELD: No, don't do that.
WATTERS: I'm lying.
PERINO: Shameless attempt to get followers.
WATTERS: Masterpiece. Also order world, speaking of masterpieces, 8 PM. They're having an exclusive with a guy who had a gun pulled to his head for wearing a MAGA hat. Also the Watter's world award.
Okay, I'm supposed to have a black tie in that picture, whoever made that is getting fired. All right so tune in.
COMPAGNO: Awards for guests? Am I up for an award?
WATTERS: Tune in, you could be nominated.
COMPAGNO: I think as guest on your show, I should.
PERINO: All right, Emily, your turn.
COMPAGNO: All right, sorry, so you guys, talk about clever cat.
COMPAGNO: This woman, she couldn't figure out how her roommates kept getting out of the closed bathroom and so she set up hidden camera and then this is what emerged, which is hilarious and an awesome Houdini cat.
PERINO: Wow.
GUTFELD: Great lower third guys. I thought it was good.
PERINO: That's pretty impressive for a cat to figure that out.
COMPAGNO: I usually go on Twitter because the reply videos are all of everyone is replying like yes, this is what I caught my cat doing or my dog doing and everyone is, they're all getting out of doors and closets. I mean--
PERINO: Of course, cats have no rights about their privacy.
(UNIDENTIFIED MALE): Yes.
PERINO: Maybe we should talk about that on Monday.
(UNIDENTIFIED MALE): Oh, lead with it, Dana. That's great.
PERINO: That's it for us. We'll see you back here on Monday. We clearly need a break. "Special Report" is up next. Here's Bret.
