DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Lawrence Jones, Donna Brazile, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
This is a Fox News alert. You are looking live at a massive fire engulfing the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France. The spire of the over 850 year old landmark collapsing, the city's mayor ordering those living close to the burning cathedral to evacuate in case of a possible collapse. Crews working to put out the flames which have been raging for the past several hours, and it appears the fire was caused by ongoing construction, but authorities have not yet determined an official cause. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
French President Emmanuel Macron is threatening -- I'm sorry, treating the situation as a national emergency. We brought in Trace Gallagher to get us up to speed with the latest. Trace? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Dana. Just after 6 PM, Paris time, witnesses say a very small amount of smoke was visible from the Notre Dame Cathedral coming from right around the spire that was in the process of being renovated. But within minutes, the smoke got blackened, the flames were visible. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Firefighters said they were on scene very quickly and were helping to get some of the workers out of the building, but in the early minutes, witnesses say the resources did not appear very strong, including a noticeable lack of water which is odd, considering Notre Dame sits on an island and a river runs right alongside the property.
But it's also notable that the fuel feeding this fire is extraordinary, 800-plus years ago, the cathedral was built using 52 acres of timber, so much wood that the inside of the cathedral was nicknamed the forest. And over the centuries, the wood, of course, became tinderbox dry. The loss of the cathedral itself is devastating but the inside was filled with priceless artwork and artifacts, including architectural drawings of not just the cathedral but of the city of Paris, itself. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it's unclear if those documents were damaged or destroyed in the fire or may be destroyed in the fire. If there is any glimmer of hope in all this it's that 16 copper statues, including the statue of St. Andrew were taken away before the renovation. So those have been spared. Notre Dame is the cathedral of the Paris archdiocese, and it was expecting maybe 100, 100-plus thousand Catholics to celebrate Easter services this Sunday.
But the building has long been a symbol of beauty, peace, love, and faith for more than just Catholics. And that was evident as people of all faiths gathered outside the burning cathedral and sang songs like the Hail Mary. Notre Dame has more visitors each year than the Eiffel Tower, and firefighters in France say they're not sure right now if they can put this fire out. It took almost a century and a half to build. It is unclear how long and how much it would cost to rebuild. Dana.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Trace Gallagher, thank you for that. We'll take it around the table now. Three of us, I think, have already been -- have been to visit. Donna Brazile, I know that you had the most recent visit of all of us, a Catholic. Obviously, this is a world-renowned site but there's also a lot of religious experiences that are held there.

        }
      
DONNA BRAZILE, GUEST CO-HOST: It's a sacred place. It's a place that many Catholics and others go to -- to not just pay their respects to a very historic and endearing place, but when you walk through that building, you get a sense that millions have gone before you to kneel, to pray, and to bear witness to the cross that's in the cathedral itself. I'm shocked. I'm saddened, especially now because this is holy week.
PERINO: Fire is the enemy of these buildings, Jesse.
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yes, I guess there was a lot of wood that was behind the external structure that was unable to been put out, unfortunately, and just sad going into Good Friday and Easter Sunday. And you have tens of millions of Catholics all over the world watching this unfold, such an iconic building. Everybody in the world knows it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it's just -- something like this, when you see it, and the spire collapses in real time, and that images is beamed out to everybody in the world, it's sad but it's also a time to reflect on, you know, what brings us together, and that's religion, the Catholic faith.
And I think if you're a Catholic, if you're Episcopalian, or Buddhist, whatever, you look at this and you can recognize the historic importance of it, and hopefully not focus on what divides us and instead what brings us together.
PERINO: Yeah, Greg, it was a -- we all know that matter like stuff is not permanent, but the human achievement, the monument to that, and the fact that -- not just that it was religious but there's also the sciences and math and also literature. And Victor Hugo, of course, immortalizing the Notre Dame Cathedral when he wrote the Hunchbacks of Notre Dame.

PERINO: I read the book.
GUTFELD: You know what? It's -- the upside here is no one's dead. When you're looking at this, you know, we think -- it brings back memories of 2001 when you saw the structure go down, and you remembered and you thought about all the people dying. Thank God here you don't have that association. You don't think of that. As just -- this is a matter, I think.
If this is an accident, imagine being the person that destroyed an 800 years structure. I mean, I've knocked over vases but, I mean, this is something, like, how do you -- it's like, imagine being that person is got to be -- pretty soon they're going to have to find out was if -- it was a construction worker, if it was a blowtorch --

PERINO: Lawrence, let's get your thoughts.
LAWRENCE JONES, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah, Greg alluded to the there's a loss of life, but there's also been no reports of a suspected terrorism, you know. And I think that's where -- when we see these tragedies, especially in this day and age, we immediately jump to that conclusion. Who was the perpetrator -- something like this. So there was no loss of life, and no suspect of terrorism.
Also, the thing that makes me sad the most is that I never got to visit the building. It's just one of those things, because it's so historic. Although they say some of the copper statues -- you can't replace that history, so it's pretty sad.

PERINO: In my ear just now we had a little bit of good news that the Paris police chief is saying that the structure -- that the fire is not going to spread from where it is now. So that is, at least, a little bit of a silver lining on this report. So as we've told you, the Cathedral of Notre Dame is no more. And we've been watching this unfold all day with some incredible breaking news coverage.
We will continue our show as scheduled from here on out. We've got a big show for you, all sorts of things. We're following, of course, this breaking news about the fire, but we also will be switching gears to politics. Let's go to Nancy Pelosi dismissing outspoken new members of Congress.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Medicare for all, it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus, but also some of the presidential candidates. And it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Did you know when we did -- when Medicare was done by the Congress at the time under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan said Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship. This is an ongoing theme of the Republicans. However, I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party.

And -- from what I know about AOC, she's going to come for the throne, because this is not the first time this happened. Remember, Nancy Pelosi mocked her Green New Deal, said green dream or whatever you call it. And so it's more important to have more votes than twitter followers. So at this point it looks like Nancy didn't really have to handle it that way.
She could have said, you know what, I'm a Democrat, I'm a progressive, and we have moderates, and we have young up-and-coming Democratic socialists, but we all want health care and we all hate Trump. But she didn't do that. She was cold on purpose. And that tells me a few things. It tells me there's a lot of bad blood between AOC and Nancy.
It tells me the civil war is real. And it also says that Nancy knows that AOC and her merry band of socialist, they need to be contained, not mainstream.

PERINO: I think Nancy Pelosi is trying to lead a party where you have the voters, maybe -- sorry, the candidates moving a little-bit farther left than where mainstream voters are in America. So Pelosi is looking at this saying, OK, so I've got this new firebrand and she's got a megaphone and everyone listens to everything she says.
But, I also have 31 House districts that -- where Trump won but Democrats won in 2018, and she's got to try to protect those in 2020 so I think she's trying to do her best. From what I can see, AOC has kept her -- held her fire against Pelosi, but that might not last forever.
And pretty soon if you see President Trump taunting them, right, driving a wedge between the two of them and suggesting, hey, AOC, why can't Pelosi get anything done? Don't you want to like turn the fire inwards? Or as President Obama explained to us last week, a circular firing squad, remember that Greg.

GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah. You know what it is? It's like being the headlining band. You don't want to hear anybody tell you how great the opening band is. It drives you crazy. And that's what -- to me it just like going I don't really want to hear about these people, OK? They're nothing. I've been around forever. These are just some little -- this is a cool kid phenomenon, you know? The loudest kids they come in, they make the noise, but will they be around like Nancy? Who knows?
I actually for once sympathize with her because she's not battling her party or even Republicans. She's battling a consensus activist media who falsely enlarge the footprint of three newcomers, the young upstarts if you will. So they've mistaken -- the media -- they've mistaken the bluster on twitter and the twitter exchange for impact when you know that the real work is being done somewhere else.
So there's an illusion of influence based on twitter footprint and intersectionality that Nancy is like going, you know what, that's not what this party is. And they've got to listen to Nancy because if they do chase the beliefs of the upstarts, you might get -- if you get a candidate who's running against Trump on reparations and socialized health care and the new green deal, you're going to lose.
JONES: Yeah. But it's just not a handful from the college campuses --
GUTFELD: Yeah.

BRAZILE: Fox News alert, a catastrophic fire is still raging in Paris, France, at the Notre Dame Cathedral. We're getting new information. Paris prosecutors think the fire was started accidentally based on their preliminary investigation. We'll keep you updated as we get more information throughout the hour.
In the meantime, President Trump is not backing away from his threat to send illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities. The president tweeting, quote, those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held, Congress must fix the laws and loopholes, will be subject to homeland security, given to sanctuary cities and states. But Democrats are not too happy about it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president has no right to spend money appropriated by Congress for the purposes to ship immigrants all over the country. He shouldn't use them as what he imagines as retribution to political opponents in various areas. It's another misuse of presidential power against the law.

GUTFELD: I don't know. I haven't thought of that. Maybe he could do that. But I live this because this is forcing people to take an idea out of the abstraction and put into real life. So take Cher for instance. You know, Cher could embrace the idea of a sanctuary city until it's in the real practical moment of her life. And that's what you're --
PERINO: And he said it out loud.
GUTFELD: Yeah. And she said -- she goes, wait a second, we can't do this. So what Trump did was he succeeded in cracking a bubble. She saw a rip in her own movie screen. It's like when you hear another movie going on, that's what just happened. And she's going, whoa, we can't do that.

BRAZILE: But it also -- But, Dana, it also forces ICE to become bus drivers or travel agents to go -- they would have to transport them.
GUTFELD: Aren't they already?
PERINO: But I don't think -- one, like this is not happening. Like this is actually not practically going to happen, but it was the idea of it that change the topic and gets Cher and other people saying, well, wait, wait, I don't want them.

BRAZILE: We say you guys --

The problem is Lindsey Graham, the chair of the judiciary committee says that he believes that we can come up with a --

JONES: It is the law. But you guys have made it very clear that Trump don't respect the law on this issue because it's all about hearts and minds, not about what the legal document is telling us just do.
BRAZILE: That's not true because every time you've seen immigration reform come up as a topic, a political topic over the last 15 years, it's a bipartisan --
JONES: But again, you're talking about the reform, not the current law. That's another debate. But what the current law says if you're here illegally you get deported.
BRAZILE: But don't you think that this should be in the context of some type of immigration reform?
JONES: That's after the fact. But until reforms are done, we have laws in place. For examples, I'm a libertarian. I love criminal justice reform. But until those laws are reformed, you can't smoke weed.

You guys are so welcoming to refugees with your sanctuary cities? Here, take them. And you know what you guys said? Instead of saying, sure, we'll have them. You said -- they said, oh, no. Oh, we don't want them because they drive up crime and they increased poverty.
BRAZILE: You know what this is?
WATTERS: And you guys fell for it and were exposed as hypocrites. And Greg made a great point the other day.
BRAZILE: This is just --
WATTERS: Brilliant point. And he said Nancy Pelosi, when she was addressing this issue, she goes, you know what, why would the president tried to perpetuate fear? What do you have to be afraid of, Nancy? I thought these refugees were these innocent, hardworking families that want to come and contribute to your San Francisco sanctuary city. Instead, everyone is saying, oh, they're pawns, they're pawns. You know what? That's right, maybe they are pawns.
BRAZILE: Jesse --
WATTERS: Politics and chess. And you know what? The Democrats --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Can I ask one thing?
BRAZILE: Political retribution, that's all it is.
WATTERS: Why is it retribution if you guys want --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: You should thank Donald Trump for saying, oh, you know what, thank you for not deporting them. Thank you for bringing that up.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: It's a -- like I've said, practically it is not happening.
GREG GUTFELD, HOST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: You know what's funny though.
PERINO: I maintain one other thing that all of this discussion like for the last four days talking about this does nothing to alleviate the flow of migrants at the border.
GUTFELD: But the thing is, we have not seen any progress. And so, what he did was introduced an idea that force people to address, this is again I call the Cher effect to address their own hypocrisy. That's the important thing here.
PERINO: Oh my God!
GUTFELD: And the other thing too, this is I would use a little Scott Adams math on you, OK.
PERINO: Got it.
GUTFELD: Chicago Mayor is smart embracing the migrants coming here may lower the crime rate because if the city gets larger the crime rate may go down. Well, if you do believe that immigrants commit fewer crimes that would actually - that's a good thing for Chicago.
DONNA BRAZILE, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: There is a reason why the legal department and I said no. Coming up, Tiger Woods roars back with an amazing win for the record books at the Masters.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
JESSE WATTERS, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: An epic comeback at the Masters this weekend. Tiger Woods is back on top after winning once again at the Masters. It's Tiger's first victory there since 2005 and his first major title in 11 years.
After making history, cameras capturing a powerful moment when Woods hugged his 10-year-old son Charlie in the exact same spot he embraced his own dad 22-years-ago after winning his first Masters championship. So, I was watching this with my daughters, and they had no idea who Tiger Woods was. I had to explain it to them and how historic it was that he won after that crazy comeback. It's like you know Michael Jordan during the 80s, you have to witness what was happening. How do you think it went down?
LAWRENCE JONES, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: Well, everybody loves Tiger. The majority of us love Tiger. The thing that made it, so gratifying was I looked at the clips of all the people counting him out. They said, he's dried up. He's done, this is the end for Tiger. Despite the car wrecks and all that. But there were some of us that still had faith in Tiger that he was going to turn it around that he was going to and he did it. And to see them all now want to get on the train, I know exactly who you are. All the commentator during the sport, don't get on the train now, stay off. I know Tiger remembers, but he probably gives him a big hug because that's just his personality.
WATTERS: Yes, I mean you mentioned the car accident and he had the public humiliation, but he also had multiple back surgeries. He's been in a lot of pain for many, many years and he finally found the right doctor and you can just let it rip out there again.
BRAZILE: What a great story during Easter week to see someone come back from literally the dead. I mean he fought back surgeries, a broken leg, a splintered knee. This guy could hardly walk. I followed golf a little bit. Not a lot. My friend Condoleezza Rice was ...
WATTERS: I saw her in the back seat.
BRAZILE: She follows this, and she was so happy. She's known Tiger since he was a student at Stanford. So, we both shared in his celebration. So, I'm not a hate on Tiger, especially with a name like Tiger being the LSU graduate. OK. Go, Tiger Go Tigress.
WATTERS: The whole world watching it yesterday.
PERINO: I saw about an hour before he won. My sister texted me and said, are you watching this. I'm like no I'm reading. She said, get to the television and watch this. So, thank you Angie. Peter and I watched the last hour and it were amazing. I won't repeat anything that you said. I would add one other thing though. There is another entity that stood by him from the beginning that was Nike.
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: And that if you think back to or think about even just recently how corporate sponsors or advertisers take a - they can't be a part of that anymore and they walk away. But Nike stuck with him from - through all of that. And I'm not saying it just paid off, but I think that because it does obviously for them. But it shows something about being committed and devoted to the people that you invest in and that means that Tiger was able to do the hard work that he needed to do and focus on the game and it comes back to win.
WATTERS: And a lot of the younger golfers benefited from Tiger's success and got a lot of money from these endorsement deals because you know he brought in a whole new generation of golfers.
GUTFELD: Well, as you know, I'm a professional golfer, Jesse.
BRAZILE: Really?
GUTFELD: Yes, I am. I have a two handicap. I don't know what I'm talking about. I didn't even know this happened. I had no idea until I was watching ...
WATTERS: You were reading that.
GUTFELD: No, I wasn't reading, I was floating on a lake on different things. But anyway, I agree with you. I watched the response and I was going to like how many of these people were kind of like indulging in the humiliating circus a decade ago who are now lauding him. It shows how fickle the media is and how shallow they are that one minute they could just - I'm sure that we did the segments on The Five.
PERINO: Definitely.
GUTFELD: And then we're doing this segment. I would like to compare the two and see how we worked to him before and how we are now. I liked it when he hugged his mom. I always think that's great when a mom is there to support her child. I thought that was good.
JONES: I think it shows something else too. It shows who your real friends and family as well, because there are a lot of people that turned their back on him during that period of time. I agree with Dana. Nike stood with Tiger, but they stood with him because of the money. All right. He was still a valuable brand at the time, because he is the GOAT.
WATTERS: Right.
JONES: But the friends and the family members stood by him while he was getting drug treatment because he got addicted to pain pills in the middle of being healed. That was a serious issue and I think Tiger in return has brought a lot of light to that issue as well. Some people just aren't drug addicts. But when they get addicted because they do have an issue, it becomes a bigger problem for him.
BRAZILE: He brings excitement to the game and much the same way that Michael Jordan brought excitement to basketball. He brings it to the ...
GUTFELD: It needs it though. I mean ...
BRAZILE: It's golf.
GUTFELD: Golf, I mean I challenge anybody who is interested in this story to name any other golfer.
JONES: No, it's hard. Exactly.
GUTFELD: It's very hard. There are some great golfers, but I just I mean like most of America.
PERINO: Like Koepka.
GUTFELD: Justin somebody.
PERINO: Was that right?
BRAZILE: Donald Trump.
GUTFELD: Donald Trump. He's going to make golf great again.
WATTERS: And that's funny because Tiger won major championships during George W. Bush, not under Barack Obama. And then back again Donald Trump.
GUTFELD: What are you concluding?
WATTERS: There is a big cold streak there for a while.
GUTFELD: What are you concluding.
BRAZILE: Both President Trump as well as former President Obama tweeted about it yesterday.
WATTERS: OK.
BRAZILE: Both parties in love.
PERINO: America.
WATTERS: Bernie Sanders gearing up for his Fox News town hall tonight. Don't miss Greg Gutfeld monologue up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Tonight, FNC is hosting a town hall with Bernie Sanders. I wasn't invited, so I guess I'm out of town. But if I had an hour with our leading pre-eminent socialist here's what I'd ask him. Number one, if you had to teach a course on Marxism or Leninism, how would you address the 100 million plus dead that they left behind. What caused it beyond administrative error? Number two, socialist bring up small successes in Europe without mentioning that economic growth is miserable compared with the United States. Why hide that? Number three, you live in the greatest economic system in history, yet you see in socialism a system rejected by nearly every nation that has tried it is somehow better given the previous questions I just asked why. Four, do you see equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as the same thing.
Should there been a cap on the book royalties which made you a millionaire. Should you only have one home instead of three. Also, can you give me an example of economic inequality that exists after you factor in age experience and education. Older people tend to have higher incomes and more wealth. You are older and richer than most. Aren't you proof of economic mobility, not inequality?
Five, since you became a millionaire, you've trained your sights on billionaires. There are 585 of them in the United States. If we took all their money would our problems be solved. It's been said that if you aren't a liberal when you're young you have no heart, but if you aren't a conservative when you're old, you have no brain. What's your excuse?
Joining us now are Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. They're moderating tonight's town hall with Bernie Sanders. I think it went pretty soft on Bernie, what do you think?
BRET BAIER, HOST, SPECIAL REPORT, FOX NEWS: Well, listen Greg we'd really like to have you here because obviously 1 through 5.
MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Exactly.
BAIER: Sounds good to us.
MACCALLUM: I think there are some versions of those that you're going to hear tonight.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BAIER: Something like that.
GUTFELD: All right. Let's go around the horn. You guys want to talk to the pair.
PERINO: Yes, I have a question just about the location because I think it's super interesting that this - where you are that there was a 13-point swing. These were Obama voters in 2012, but by 13 points Trump voters in 2016. And just curious and I'm sure you're going to ask him if Bernie Sanders thinks that districts like those, states like those that he thinks he can flip back.
BAIER: I think it's one of the reasons he's doing this. I mean Pennsylvania is one of the swing states at this particular region even more so as you point to the points. There are many Trump voters who switched over. They were Democratic voters for a long time, and they went to Trump in 2016. And I think that that's one of the reasons he's here.
MACCALLUM: It's also very interesting if you look at the voters who were Bernie supporters in the primary process. 11 or 12 percent of them ended up voting not for Hillary Clinton but for Donald Trump. Now President Trump. So, these are the areas that he needs to come to. I think it's very politically astute of him to know that this is where he needs to be if he wants to start to flip those voters in places like Pennsylvania.
BRAZILE: Hey Bret. As you know Senator Sanders ran on trade in 2016 and he is called the President's trade policies weak on labor protections. Will you ask him tonight why the President's trade policies are weaker than the policies that he is pushing inside the Democratic primary.
BAIER: Trades definitely a topic that will come up, Donna. It is key to this region. We are in the shadow of Bethlehem Steel, a plant that closed down in 1995. This area was devastated when it did. It's a key issue for voters here and throughout really this entire region. You look at those states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio. I think that's really the battleground for 2020 as you look at the map now.
MACCALLUM: Yes, a lot of those people are the category that we're looked upon as the forgotten voters. And both Bernie Sanders and President Trump tried to tap into that. And what we've heard from Bernie Sanders in recent weeks is that he believes that the President has failed those forgotten voters. Now did the voters feel that way. That's going to be the big question as we move forward.
GUTFELD: You know if you're staying at the Bethlehem Hotel, there is a picture of me in the bar. I can't tell you why it's there, but I think you should stop by and just you know have a drink. Jesse?
MACCALLUM: Afterwards.
BAIER: Figure that out.
WATTERS: Yes, I'm sure they're going to do that, Greg. I just have a lot of respect for Bernie Sanders. I think the fact that he's doing this Fox News town hall this early in the race and while he's a top, many of the polls shows a lot of political intelligence because he's signaling to his competitors in the Democratic primary that I'm not here to hit softballs. And he's also showing that he's got a general election mindset. He's going to look for his many voters wherever they are and to a wide his audience as possible. You're not going to listen to any of my questions because you've probably all got them nailed down.
But are you going to have a moment question? You know like the boxers or briefs question or something like that like ask him about Tiger Woods or Game of Thrones or something like that.
MACCALLUM: Should we ask Bernie Sanders the boxers or briefs question.
BAIER: You really want to know the answer to that question?
WATTERS: Not Bernie. Maybe that was more apt for Bill but is there going to be a moment question where it goes, you know everybody wants to know about a pop culture scenario.
MACCALLUM: Well, I think if we shared it with you now that it might ruin the moment.
WATTERS: True.
MACCALLUM: So, I don't think that would likely to do that.
BAIER: Moment before the moment.
MACCALLUM: Exactly. Stick around and watch.
WATTERS: Well, thanks for answering my questions.
JONES: Hey, Bret and Martha, there is a new poll that's out that says Bernie is now taking the lead. Will you guys press him on that. Is there growing support for him? And why?
BAIER: Yes, I think that you know almost every poll has him in the lead as a declared candidate. We know that Vice President Biden is not yet in here and he leads many polls. But you're right, he is. He went from Think of the evolution here from the outsider who was pressing Hillary Clinton and came very close to now the front runner who has the most money in the Democratic field is getting the biggest crowds and now in some polls is leading and is leading as a declared candidate.
MACCALLUM: And I don't think that the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is of the world right now would exist or be as accepted as they are if it weren't for the ground that Bernie Sanders laid down. So, his story really is extraordinary because he's forced a conversation in America that I never thought I would live to see whether or not we should be a capitalist or a socialist nation. And that's a question that is you know very fundamental to where we are in this race right now, which is an interesting place to be in this country.
BAIER: We should also point out that we're probably minutes away from getting Bernie Sanders tax returns for 10 years. So, I don't know why they put it out 30 minutes before the town hall. But we'll have it.
MACCALLUM: We're going to get our eye shades on it, start looking at over as soon as we get it.
GUTFELD: All right. Well, Bret and Martha have fun. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tonight at 6:30 PM Eastern for the Bernie Sanders Town Hall. One More Thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for One More Thing. I'm going to kick it off tomorrow. You're not going to want to miss The Five. We are headed to Nashville. We'll be at the Wild Horse Saloon. It's going to be a great show. We're going to have live music; John Rich will join us for the entire hour. He'll be a guest host. And we'll have a special appearance by the one and only Kathie Lee Gifford. John Rich is going to give us a one of a kind tours of Nashville but that's going to be full of surprises if you want to come. No tickets are necessary. The doors open at 11 AM. Remember it's 4 PM in that time zone. OK. But 5 PM Eastern if you want to watch us on the show.
Jesse and I are also going to take place in the 18th Annual Waiting for Wishes Benefit. This is the Kevin Carter Foundation and Make A Wish Middle Tennessee. Last year we did this. I think they raised $125,000 and this year we'll be there with Little Big Town. OK. I'm excited. Tito Ortiz, I love that guy. And Scotty McCreery dozens more. We're actually considered celebrities Jesse which I think is funny.
WATTERS: It's not funny for me, Dana.
PERINO: Not funny, but it's exciting. All right. Greg go.
GUTFELD: Even though there are no tickets for the event, I will be selling VIP passes in the parking lot. Cash only. OK. Meet me by the bathroom. You've never participated. I'm going to show you three cat videos. You guys jumped the gun. Come on. And you guys vote on. OK, the first one cat stopping a soccer ball. That's video one. Try to be slow on the trigger finger people. Second one. This is called The Cat Black Hole where is the cat? It's in there. It's very, very scary. Look at that again. And here we have another great cat video. This is a dog trying to get a cat off his own little bed, but the cat won't go.
JONES: see, how mean. He is a bully.
GUTFELD: Look at this. This goes on for hours and hours. All right, let's vote Lawrence which cat video is your favorite?
JONES: The first one.
GUTFELD: All right. Donna, first one?
BRAZILE: First one.
WATTERS: First one.
PERINO: I'm going to go with the third one, because I sent it to you.
WATTERS: I'm going to go with the third one and I get three votes.
BRAZILE: No.
GUTFELD: That's just like Tucker's stupid contest challenge, where he changes the rule.
WATTERS: He gave me that vote and I still lost too.
GUTFELD: Yes. I pick it to show, I don't do the show anymore.
WATTERS: OK.
BRAZILE: Jesse?
WATTERS: Tucker, I'll still do it if you want me. All right. So, not only is it Tax Day, it's also National Take a Wild Guess Day. So, we want to have a little fun here. We put this I guess a bunch of Starbursts all in this glass or vase. Is it the vase or a vase?
PERINO: I'm going to call it jar.
WATTERS: Everybody around the table - wow, you're so down to earth. Everybody around the table is going to take a guess how many Starbursts are in this glass. And then the winner gets a prize. Greg?
GUTFELD: I'm going to go with 350.
WATTERS: 350.
PERINO: I already wrote 360 down on my paper.
WATTERS: 360.
GUTFELD: Crap.
BRAZILE: 317.
WATTERS: 317.
GUTFELD: I lose.
JONES: 361.
WATTERS: 361. Lawrence is the winner.
GUTFELD: That's so unfair.
PERINO: How many is it?
WATTERS: There were 550.
GUTFELD: You just purposely - you're terrible.
WATTERS: That was the price. It was like $1.
PERINO: All right.
WATTERS: Wait a second.
JONES: I'm a winner.
PERINO: Wow. Much better than final exam.
WATTERS: There it is.
PERINO: Donna, we have time for yours.
BRAZILE: OK. Are you planning your funeral? I hope not right now. No longer worry about tissue and crime. Instead come to party. There is a new organization. Final, bow production that allows you to go out in style. So, get your dance groove on, Jesse.
WATTERS: All right. I want to go.
PERINO: Sorry, we don't have time for you Lawrence, but I'm sure your One More Thing was excellent.
JONES: Yes, it was fun.
PERINO: And thank you for being here on "The Five." We'd love to have you. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode. Yes, you go home with a trophy. We've all got to do that. All right. "Special Report" is up next.
