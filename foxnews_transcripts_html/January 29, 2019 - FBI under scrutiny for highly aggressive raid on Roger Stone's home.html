Welcome to “Hannity.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

We begin tonight with our “Hannity Watch” and the rise of socialism right here in the United States of America. And what is a new radical and extreme, and frankly dangerous to socialist Democratic Party, that is pretty much declaring war on the American Dream and freedom. They are vilifying wealth and success, and penalizing innovation, stopping all over the principles that made this the greatest place on earth, the envy of the free world. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Their goals are simple. They want the government to control your property, your businesses, your health care, your money, your self-defense -- scary. Don't be fooled by broad, lofty promises of security and emotional appeals. This new radical Democratic Socialist Party, they want the government to pretty much supervise your entire life.
And that's why tonight, we begin with analysis on this radical crop of left-wing candidates, vying to take over the White House, and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. Pretty scary picture, but let not your heart be troubled, we're going to be exposing them nightly on this program as they try to out- liberal each other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, for months, we've warned that any Democrat that is competing for the party's nomination, they've got to prove their radical, socialist ideals, and know what we are watching is this all play out in real time.
Look at California Senator Kamala Harris, likely Democratic front runner, starting to echo the policies of the socialist freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Last night, Senator Harris even through her support behind a government takeover of energy. That's the lifeblood of our economy and end of oil, so called a new green deal, a "Green New Deal". Whatever that means.

HANNITY: Hold on, the nationalization of energy, oh, that worked out so well for Venezuela. Why not try it here?
Now, that means millions and millions. We are now the biggest oil producer in the world, surpassing the evil regime of Russia, and the Saudis. Think of all of the high-paying jobs, careers of people in the energy industry, think of energy independence gone. We will be dependent again on foreign oil. Efficient, affordable sources of energy to heat your home, to fill up your car, to turn on your lights -- gone. The lifeblood of the economy -- gone.
The same left-wing geniuses, you know, that were scaring people in the '70 is to believe -- look at that, the big freeze, the next Ice Age is coming. That's what they told us in the '70s. That then evolved into, uh-oh, the world has a fever, as Al Gore said and scaring people. Gore even once predicted, Al Gore, that the world ice caps could be completely melted by 2014. That was five years ago.

        }
      
Now, it's just generic climate change. So they are covered. Whatever the temperature, cold, hot, snow, no snow, ice, no ice, doesn't matter, the extreme radical left wing socialist Democratic Party -- they are willing to literally forfeit what is the lifeblood of every economy on the planet in the hopes that big mother huge socialist government is going to save the planet, but we'll do it alone?

And it gets worse, Harris calling for the complete government takeover of the health care industry. And the 175 million of you, the American people, we the people that have private health care insurance, you would no longer legally be allowed to keep it. She said that last night.
So much for liberals being so pro-choice. Let's take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You support the Medicare for all bill, initially cosponsored by Bernie Sanders, you are also a cosponsor. I believe that it will totally eliminate private insurance. So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it.

        }
      
HARRIS: Well, listen, the idea is that everybody gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give your approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that they may required, who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on.

So, naturally, kamala Harris also wants open borders. You know, with 90 percent of the heroin that comes into this country, crosses that southern border that she is promising never to secure. She will never vote for a wall -- oh, and the fentanyl that crosses that border and the cartels and the gang members, and the human and drug trafficking and the death and destruction. Oh, and those Angel Moms and Dads, don't they deserve better than this? Take a look.

HARRIS: OK, well, maybe we will let the kids stay but not their parents. So yet again, we have an example of this administration willing to separate children from their parents, which is inhumane, and contrary to who we are in the values that we hold as Americans. Let me be very clear: I'm not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances.

HANNITY: What about the permanent separation, Senator Harris? You know, maybe you can meet with Angel Moms and Dads that because of states like yours, in California, you know, that allow literally the protection of even criminal illegal aliens and you let them go free, and you don't turn them over to ICE because you have sanctuary protections, you're going to meet with those parents? That is permanent separation.

HANNITY: All right. So, let's keep track of Kamala's radical socialist checklist. Government takeover of a huge profitable efficient private industry in the name of climate change when we are finally no energy into independent -- check. Government takeover of health care, you cannot have your own insurance, thereby ending all free market competition -- check. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Taking health insurance from 177 million Americans, you will no longer be allowed to have your private plan, you know what? They've got to spread the wealth around, check. $32 trillion in ten years of your hard-earned money, that is $3.2 trillion a year, almost every penny that the government takes in every year -- oh, check.
Open borders, that too. And unfettered immigration, check. A society where only the government is allowed to have weapons, check.
And like any radical movement, the left is trying to erase what has been, what, our Judeo-Christian principles, oh, yes, we are endowed by our Creator. Somebody wrote that once. In at least one House Committee, Democrats are actually moving to strike the words "So Help You God" from the oath.

And, of course, Ocasio-Cortez might have a hard decision coming up. Will she vote for Senator Harris who literally supports all of her ideas, or maybe Elizabeth Warren who took a step forward and unveiled the pretty new scary tax plan of her own? By the way, a tax on wealth.

If you are unfamiliar with Warren's new tax streams, she essentially wants to legalize government stealing of your money. Now, let's say that you have accumulated and save some money over the years or have anything really of value, Warren wants the government to be able to take a cut of that. Now, wait a minute, that's after you have already paid your federal taxes, your state taxes, your property taxes, your sale taxes, that whatever you save after that, she wants to go back again and legalize taking more.

And then, again, when you die, guess what? They want another bite at the apple. As a matter of fact, 40 percent. In other words, a tax on money that has already been taxed, and then you die, you pay more taxes. You will take the gold out of your teeth.
And keep in mind, the top 20 percent of wage earners in America -- yes, they already pay 90 percent of all income taxes. The bottom 50 percent, 2 percent. They pay 2 percent.

Now, have we not learned a lesson here? Look at your screen. Now, that was the economy under Obama. We talked about it a lot, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. Those homeownership rate in 51 years, took on more debt than all 43 presidents before him combined.
And what today's Democrats are proposing? Actually worse than Obama. Now, thankfully tonight, we are not the only ones terrified by the hard left, and this turn of the Democratic Party, and all our political civil war is now brewing beneath the surface as you have two liberal billionaires and potential presidential candidates -- they are now speaking out against their party's radical turn. They want to keep their money.

And that includes former liberal New York City "you cannot have a big gulp" mayor, Michael Bloomberg. You can't have salt on the table. You've got to ask somebody for salt. He slammed the Democrats' pie in the sky policies, calling Elizabeth Warren's proposed tax on wealth "Venezuelan".

HANNITY: Now, the Democratic Party is downright disturbing, and believe it or not, it actually gets worse. Many elected Democrats are now openly associating with bigots, real anti-Semites. Now, for weeks, we have exposed some Democrats' close friendships with the anti-Semitic and racist like Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory.
Tonight, the scandal grows even deeper. According to a report from "The Daily Caller", Freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib actually belongs to a face group, Facebook group where fellow members frequently express their anti-Semitic views, and demonize people that are Jewish. And that's not all, Tlaib's key fund-raiser and campaign organizer frequently shares an anti-Semitic post on social media, including a recent video that refers to Jewish people as satanic, and questions the existence of the Holocaust, a Holocaust denier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, remember, we are talking by the same congresswoman who has called for boycotts of all things Israel. And let's not forget about Tlaib's colleague, that would be Congresswoman Omar. She wants to lift sanctions on Venezuela, but impose sanctions on our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. I wonder why.
And this week we learned that while she was serving as a state legislator in Minnesota, she actually urged the federal judge, not making this up, to show leniency towards a group of nine men that wanted to join ISIS. And now while some Democrats struggled to cover up the radical views in these associations, others absolutely obsessing about one thing: impeach Trump, impeach Trump -- which I warned you about before the election.
And, of course, that includes the impeachment cheerleader herself, Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Recently, she patted herself on the back for her wild, nonstop, reckless speculation. Take a look.

REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: I am pleased that I started the conversation early, I believe that the president early on had defined himself as someone who was incapable of being a legitimate president. And so, I started the conversation -- of course, we got a lot of criticism, I got a lot of criticism, but he has been defining himself ever since. And you will hear impeachment being talked about more and more.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Of course, but you would not tell us before the election, but that was your plan, and the endless investigations, and you want the crumbs back and you want open borders and you want to eliminate ICE. This party has gone so far to the radical left.
Now, in case you're wondering, Maxine Waters apparently found a smoking gun in her impeachment quest. She just does not have any evidence to back it up. Forget about due process and the presumption of innocence. Take a look.

WATERS: We know that Putin once the sanctions lifted, and I said from the beginning that I believe, and I do not have the proof, but I believe that Manafort was sent to the campaign to be there to ensure that they get Trump elected in every way that they possibly could, and this is an exchange for him lifting the sanctions.

HANNITY: I think we are making a strong case? The radical elements inside this Democratic extreme, socialist party are now pulling the strings, that's the reason why Nancy Pelosi, she can't even sit down with the president, sit across the table and address border security for the safety and security of the American people, and life-and-death issues like heroin and fentanyl.
But look at this, new poll, NBC News/"Wall Street Journal," looks like Nancy Pelosi is bearing more of the blame for the partial government shutdown and Speaker Pelosi's approval is at a whopping 28 percent, making her the least popular politician of those surveyed.
And tonight, the president holds all of the cards. The American people want a secure border. The president, he knows that he can and most likely will lawfully declare a national emergency assuming that Democrats refused to negotiate in good faith. I'm pretty secure, because this president has shown that he likes to keep promises, he is very tenacious. And if he does not get it that way, he is going to do it on his own. Mark my words, I'd say 99 percent. Just guessing.
Now, he also knows that by overwhelming margins, the American people -- they don't want any border deal that includes amnesty, green cards, or any path to citizenship. Now, why should we reward illegal behavior? There are people that want to come in legally. Shouldn't they get the first shot?
And he's also fighting harder than any Republican president ever has to keep the promise to secure our southern border. Because he knows what's at stake -- safety, security, life and death. For example, ICE announcing today that the rest of 118 illegal immigrants in New York and a five-day raid just this month where more than 107 of them were convicted criminals, 107.
And not only that, according to a new report from Bloomberg, immigrant reinforcement and processing, well, the costs have been surging, nearly 40 percent over the past four fiscal years, it's now costing $7.4 billion for the year 2018. That sounds like a manufactured crisis to you, ask yourself, what are the Democrats fighting for? They said that they wanted borders just a few short years ago. They say that they care about DACA. They say they care about Dreamers, yet they won't talk about it.
They are all about distracting, ailing, and frankly just hating the president at every turn, at all costs. And this also applies to phony claims of Russia collusion again and again.

Remember self-proclaimed sex coach who suggested she had dirt on Trump and the Russian oligarchs, yes, not true. She is coming clean admitting that she made up the entire story while she was in jail in Thailand, saying that it was all an attempt to get media attention.
And meanwhile, our own Catherine Herridge reporting tonight that new congressional transcripts revealed that there were contacts between Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele before the 2016 election, contradicting previous claims from congressional Democrats and Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson. Uh-oh, may be a predawn raid with 27 guys in armored vehicles coming to a home near you.
Remember, Simpson told the House Intel Committee in 2017 he worked with Bruce Ohr, quote, something after Thanksgiving. Where is that predawn raid? Where are charges to lying to Congress for him?
Speaking of which, we still don't have any answers for Mueller's excessive use of force during his predawn raid against Roger Stone, 27 agents, guns a blazing, heavily armed, armored vehicles, both circling his house for a guy accused of lying to Congress? Really?
Now, we're going to have more on that coming up. First, joining us now with the reaction is brand-new Fox News contributor Dan Bongino.
Welcome aboard, sir.
And Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera.

Geraldo, you have been around a long time. You look at this party --
(LAUGHTER)
GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT: You think?
HANNITY: Well, I did not mean that in a bad way, and one of my dearest friends. Both of you are.
RIVERA: Welcome, Dan, by the way. Welcome.
(CROSSTALK)
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: But do you see this as successful? Do you see this extreme rush to the left as something that's going to be politically viable?
RIVERA: I think that the Democrats are extremely frustrated. They are looking at Robert Mueller, the special counsel, they're becoming more and more convinced that there's not going to be any Russia collusion, so they are -- their eyes will drip to the next pretty pony, which will be impeachment. Maxine Waters who is so radical and so far out will become the mainstream of so many Democrats who aspired to hurting the Trump presidency and as fatal a way possible.
I thin that we've only just begun seeing, you know, some really outlandish rhetoric and some really inflammatory statements directed at the president's way, Sean. I'm not sure that the Democrats can harness their diversity is their energy is -- and what makes them attractive, and yet, I think it's also their fatal flaw.
HANNITY: And, Dan, welcome aboard. We're glad to have you on the family.
But, you know, think about this --
BONGINO: Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: -- 2018 they hid their agenda. 2020, they are like bragging about it. They're trying to out-socialist the other one.

BONGINO: Right.
HANNITY: In a very short period of time, I'm pretty convinced the American people are going to say, wow, they really are nuts. That's my take.
BONGINO: Yes. Sean, we've seen this before with the Walter Mondale campaign and the Michael Dukakis campaign where the Democrats lost, what is it, 49 states in that race with Mondale where he pledged to raise taxes? It wasn't even to the degree that they are talking about now.
Sean, listen, I'm astonished that we are having this fight again about expanding already expanded government into Americans' lives. Government is a forest fire. Outside of our military and our law enforcement apparatus, it is a forest fire. It destroys everything it touches.
It bankrupted your Social Security. It bankrupted your Medicare. It is not to teaching your kids according to standards. We are getting smoked internationally there. It's driving you into debt, and now, we want to expand government to --
HANNITY: You have government schools and --
BONGINO: -- healthcare, where they're going to ration your healthcare?

HANNITY: And government schools and Obamacare really did really well, now, we are not going allow any American to have their own health care plan.
Geraldo, I want to go -- I heard some comments that you made about Roger Stone. I don't care if you like him or not, the charge is lying to Congress.
RIVERA: I don't.
HANNITY: He is not El Chapo. He is not a mafia figure. He is not being charged with a violent crime. He is lying to Congress.
Do we really need tactical vehicles, armored guns drawn, predawn raids, CNN cameras tipped off?
RIVERA: That was preposterous, and total overkill, and it really was -- you know, a revelation of the political motivation of too much of our federal law enforcement. I hate to say that.
HANNITY: No, it's not law enforcement. This is Robert Mueller and company.

RIVERA: I've always honored the FBI and these other agencies. But when you round up a battalion of law enforcement to go after one senior citizen who overdresses, you know, in a predawn raid. You get him in his pajamas with his wife and his poodle -- I mean, this is ridiculous. I mean, Americans look at that.
HANNITY: It is done on purpose.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: One second, you have law enforcement, Jussie Smollett, this actor from "Empire", a black actor, a gay black actor, was apparently mugged and they put a noose around his neck last night. I want law enforcement going after the sons of (EXPLETIVE) that did that to that kid. I don't want them -- 25 of them going to Roger Stone's house.
HANNITY: This is Mueller's M.O., Dan Bongino. They do it again and again for processed crimes. This is just -- we only have 15 seconds, I'm sorry.
BONGINO: Yes, don't you find the timing of this coincidental? Remember the Paul Manafort raid, what happened that week? The Peter Strzok-Lisa Page text were revealed by the I.G.

Here with reaction, from the Trump Organization, is the son's president (ph), Eric Trump.
Good to see you. The baby is getting so big, so fast. Congratulations.
ERIC TRUMP, SON OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's good little boy. He's great.
HANNITY: I love the picture in the Oval Office.
All right. You just saw what we played, you cannot have the choice of health care, we are going to stop drilling natural gas, all our resources, all the jobs with it, the lifeblood of our economy. I'm listening and I'm saying, this is great for your father.
TRUMP: It doesn't make any sense. I mean, the Democrats are now the party of JFK. They have become so radicalized.
I mean, do you want 70 percent taxes? You know, you look at Kamala Harris, she always goes after ICE. She calls him, you know, the KKK. You remember that famous interview.
HANNITY: Yes, I played it last night.
TRUMP: They don't want law and order. They want to tax people to death. They want to get businesses out of this country. They want to let anybody in this country. They want to bankrupt us to system through free health care for all.
You heard her saying before, right? You know, let's just eliminate private health care. And --
HANNITY: All of it. You don't have a choice.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: She walked back that comment because it was so ridiculous.
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: I mean, how do you pay for this stuff? I mean, we would be Venezuela. We've become so many of these other countries. It doesn't -- it doesn't work.
That's not what America is about. I mean, America is about hardworking people. America is about capitalism. America is the greatest country in the world, because people work for that American Dream.
And it seems like --
HANNITY: Elizabeth Warren wants another bite at the apple after you paid all your taxes.
TRUMP: I mean, it's -- it's insane. And they have become so radicalized. And it's not -- it's not going to work. They become crazy.
I mean, the message doesn't even make sense anymore. It's almost anti- American message. It's just, you know, totally open borders.
HANNITY: It's not the values that has grown us into the envy of the world.
TRUMP: No. And look where we are right now. We've got the greatest economy in the world. We've got one of the safest countries in the world. We have a military that's totally rebuilt, the highest consumer confidence, manufacturers coming back, lowest unemployment.
You know, groups that, you know, had big, you know, employment problems, African-Americans, you know, Hispanics, et cetera, all-time unemployment lows. I mean, this country is doing awesome. And all they're trying to do is attack him.
I mean they don't want him to succeed at anything, because he's done such a damn good job. They don't want him to succeed at anything. And that's why you see them constantly - I mean, they've become the party of obstruction and nonsense and investigations, because they have nothing else. I mean, they have nothing else.
HANNITY: Eric, I've known your dad for over a couple of decades.
TRUMP: He's the greatest guy in the world.
HANNITY: OK. He is a great guy, and personality-wise, people knew the guy. Here's the funny thing. So there's a shift in strategy. All right, shut down, they won't even talk to me. I'll give you three weeks, do your job. I am 99 percent certain and I have no inside knowledge at all. I am 99 percent certain that when they can't do a deal and do their job, your father is going to go to Plan B.
That means they get no DACA, no Dreamer help, none of the things they say they wanted and they can shop it to - do judge shopping, go to the Ninth Circuit. I think, as Commander-in-Chief, stopping heroin, stopping cartels, gang members and some that will commit crime - not the 98%, but the 2%, that's his job. That's what he swore to upheld to keep the American people safe.
TRUMP: And that's why the American people elected him, because he's a fighter and he fight for what's right and wrong. And then you hear Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi - "We'll negotiate", but we're only going to negotiate when governments open. But then they don't actually come out and negotiate.
And then you have Pelosi, as you just said, "We'll give you a dollar toward your wall. But I want to spend $5 million on drones to fly over the Southern border, which aren't going to be effective at all. I mean, when can we start using some common sense in this country. When can you stop the drugs, stop the criminals, stop MS-13. Have people come into the system legally.
We want immigration, but we want legal immigration.
HANNITY: You want to bet you--
TRUMP: --the right way.
HANNITY: Here's what your dad was fighting for. He's fighting against drugs, human trafficking, drug trafficking, life and death issues for Americans, Angel Moms and Dads, I've interviewed a number of them. He's fighting for security and safety the American people. What was Nancy and Chuck fighting for? What were they fighting for?
TRUMP: You know what they're fighting for is to make sure he doesn't achieve the agenda that he promised to achieve. They realized he's winning on everything else, so how can we obstruct that message. And you see those Angel Mom - I mean, I ran into one. They lost a child a couple weeks ago and I remember her holding the picture, and she's showing me this picture--
HANNITY: 4,000 homicides.
TRUMP: And this is what we're fighting for. I mean this is what we're fighting for as well as having a country and having laws and you see what some of the immigration problems are doing to so many other countries around the world.
HANNITY: So the conservatives - you agree with me, one way or the other, he's not given up. He's going to combat.
TRUMP: I want him to declare emergency. You want my opinion, I want him--
HANNITY: Oh, I think he will.
TRUMP: You know what, if they don't come to the table, he said you know what I'm going to open up government and let's see if they were actually being truthful that once government was reopened that they would come to the table and negotiate something that's fair. And honestly if they don't, declare the emergency, build the wall with the United States Military, because that's what people in this country want.
Because - and you know what, and then redouble your efforts on legal immigration. Get great people in this country, because that's what America wants and that's what America needs, and quite frankly, our economy needs those jobs, because unemployment is so low that we need those jobs. But do it legally.
HANNITY: He's kept all the promises and some people - what have you done in the last 30 seconds switching strategies, he's not going to stop. I think, I know him pretty well, he's that tenacious. I would agree with you. I think that's where he's going. Good to see you.
TRUMP: He's the greatest guy in the world. And I couldn't be more proud of him.
HANNITY: Congrats on the - well, the country is doing a lot better. Thank God.
TRUMP: Country is doing incredible.
HANNITY: Trace Gallagher, shocking new report on the 2017 - remember the Vegas massacre that left hundreds injured, 58 dead, shocking details. Also a mini monologue on what is the single most barbaric, frankly, evil, abortion law in the State of New York and our "Villain of the Day", straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: So it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history. 58 people dead and today the FBI confirmed they have closed the investigation into the 2017 Vegas mass shooting. But there's one gaping question that is still left on answer. Our own Trace Gallagher joins us from our West Coast Newsroom Tonight with the very latest. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR: Sean, a 64 year-old Stephen Paddock had a motive for killing 58 people, he took it to the grave that is from the FBI, which is now concluded its investigation finding no single or clear motivating factor.
The report says paddock had no religious or political affiliation, was not directed or inspired by any group and was not seeking to further any agenda adding "It wasn't about MGM, Mandalay Bay or a specific casino or venue. It was all about doing the maximum amount of damage and him obtaining some form of infamy."
Paddock did not leave a manifesto or suicide note, but investigators believe he did plan to kill himself after the attack and may have been inspired by his father's reputation as a bank robber who was once on the FBI's most wanted list.
Paddock was in a corner suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel when he opened fire on the Route 91 Music Festival killing dozens, injuring nearly a thousand. Las Vegas Police declined to comment on the FBI report and has also closed its investigation despite a litany of questions and criticisms over how the Department responded to the shooting. Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Trace Gallagher, we got to get this information. Now we turn to another big story. We are following tonight Roger Stone. He pled not guilty in Washington today following that pre-dawn raid on his Fort Lauderdale home. Here with reaction Salem Radio, Nationally Syndicated Host, Larry Elder; also the author of #1 Bestseller "The Russia Hoax", Fox News Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett.
So you look at process crimes. He's not El Chapo.
GREGG JARRETT, "THE RUSSIA HOAX" AUTHOR: No.
HANNITY: He's not a - no claims of violence. 27 armed, guns blazing pre- dawn raid, armored vehicles for lying to Congress?
JARRETT: Right. Helicopters and FBI's tactical team in the canal behind the house. I talked to a 30-year veteran in the FBI. He called me over the weekend and he said - he rose to become, by the way, Assistant Deputy FBI Director. He was appalled and outraged that the FBI would be exploited and manipulated by Robert Mueller for such trivial, petty, frivolous purposes. This is a white-collar--
HANNITY: This is the third, Gregg.
JARRETT: And he said to me, I've arrested more than a 1,000 white-collar suspects. In my day never used force to do it. He said that if Christopher Wray, the FBI Director had an ounce of integrity he would notify Mueller, you - I'm withdrawing my FBI agents for such purposes. You are never to use them this way.
HANNITY: The FBI - and this is a fair point. Rank and file, field office, FBI agents--
JARRETT: These are great guys.
HANNITY: They don't have a choice. They can't say no to one assignment. They've got to do what they're told.
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: And, Larry, a good friend of mine is in studio time, one of our mutual friends, is an FBI guy. And I've talked to him many times. They're embarrassed at the upper echelon. They take great pride being FBI agents.
I mentioned, two of my family members - my own family - in law enforcement only two made it to the FBI and they were deity. And the rank and file special agent field office guys, can't believe what they're seeing here.
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL HOST/AM 870: Well, I've heard the criticism. I've heard Judge Napolitano criticize it. I've heard Greg say it, who is our overwrought. All I know is there's an article that, I think, is pretty persuasive in the Washington Examiner, which is not exactly a left-wing organ, by a former FBI agent 25 years.
And he says, once the decision is made to arrest somebody, it's up to the FBI to determine the tactics, to determine how many agents to use. When we want to arrest one guy, we send ten. We want to ref ten guys, who send 100. That's how we roll. We do it with overwhelming force. Others have also confirmed that. So I'm not sure what the truth is. I really don't.
HANNITY: Yes. But it happens only with Mueller, that's the difference here.
JARRETT: Yes.
HANNITY: And Andrew Weissmann's background.
JARRETT: Oh, it totally does. This has Weissmann's fingerprints all over it, because this is the kind of stuff he does all the time. But this is selective and unequal enforcement and prosecution of the law.
HANNITY: How many other people lied to Congress, Gregg, that we know?
JARRETT: More than half a dozen people in Hillary Clinton's orbit--
HANNITY: Cheryl Mills--
JARRETT: --made false statements. They were clearly false.
HANNITY: Huma Abedin, Hillary--
JARRETT: They were proven to be false by documents and yet none of them were prosecuted. And, in fact, half a dozen of them were given immunity in exchange for nothing. So the lesson here is
ELDER: Gregg
JARRETT: --if you're Hillary Clinton's friends you get a free pass.
HANNITY: Larry, last word.
ELDER: Gregg, the issue is whether or not Roger Stone posed the threat? And according - and again, the 25 year FBI vet, a lot of these docile guys with no criminal record, white collar criminals, are the ones that are most dangerous. And often he has agents, they end up dead because of this. So I'm just saying that other people have said something different. I don't know what the truth is.
JARRETT: You pick up the phone and you call his lawyer and you'd say, have your client down in the courthouse tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for arraignment and you can prearrange the bail.
HANNITY: By the way, they would have known, he has no guns--
ELDER: They say, they were--
HANNITY: They know he had no valid passport, where's he going to go?
ELDER: They say they were concerned that he was a flight risk. Again, I'm just telling you what the FBI agents have been saying. And that's how they roll. They want to make sure nothing goes.
HANNITY: What happens to Hillary's people and Clapper and Brennan and Comey, and all the rest of them they lied--
ELDER: Fair enough. Yes.
HANNITY: They don't believe it's real - equal justice under the law. But - all right, thank you both. When we come back, I can't believe I have to do this monologue about the single most barbaric - frankly evil, abortion law that was just passed in the State of the New York and then our "Villain of the Day" on top of that. Busy night, stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: --Left they always use words like immoral, heartless to describe the President's efforts to secure the border, keep our nation safe and secure, life and death. Well progressives are collectively cheering what is an absolute abomination, sad, disturbing, how could it happen in America.
A radical abortion law recently passed in New York, under, of course maybe presidential wannabe, Andrew Cuomo, the Governor. Under the "Reproductive Health Act", a fully-formed unborn child can have its life ended in the seventh, eighth, ninth month until the mothers due date. If the "abortion is necessary" to protect the patient's life or health.
But it gets worse, because health is broadly defined by the U.S. Supreme Court as "All factors physical, emotional, psychological, familial, woman's age. Now if the last part sounds ambiguous and open-ended, it's because it is.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan laid out just how gruesome this all is writing, "How, the law "drops all charges" against an abortionist who allows an aborted baby, who somehow survives the scissors, scalpel, saline, dismemberment to die before his eyes", before adding that the law even authorizes non-doctors to perform the procedure.
Make no mistake about it. And at its core this is about on-demand abortion up until birth when the child is viable outside a mother's womb. And just look at how the New York legislature reacted when they passed the law. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(Applause)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Applauding infanticide, legalized infanticide. Now you are ending the life of a child that is viable on its own. This is dark, barbaric. It is cruel. How is this something worth celebrating?
Look, there are honest people pro-life, pro-choice, religious, not religious that can have an honest disagreement about first term trimester. When a child is viable on its own and you can do this, this should disturb the conscience of the country. And while the "Hate Trump Media" never stops with their vicious attacks against the President, conservatives totally silent on policies like this.
Now, this double standard is being exposed. Their selective moral outrage and hypocrisy is now on full display. Here now with reaction Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov and Live Action, Founder Lila Rose. You're supporting this, really? You're supporting 8-month, you can have an abortion when the child can survive on its own, viable. You don't see that as infanticide?
New York's barbaric abortion law;
JESSICA TARLOV, CONTRIBUTOR: No it's not infanticide. First of all, it's just New York State upholding what the Supreme Court already ruled. The law in New York State which was--
HANNITY: No that's not true.
TARLOV: --yes, it is actually true - means that a mother can be punished under the penal code if she does have a late term abortion, that's after 24 weeks. We know that only 1% of abortions occur after the 20 weeks--
HANNITY: I don't want the percentages.
TARLOV: Why? That's a--
HANNITY: The fact that it's legal now New York.
TARLOV: --but the numbers matter.
HANNITY: You're missing the point.
TARLOV: It should - no, I'm not.
HANNITY: This is now legal in New York - seventh, eighth, ninth month you could have--
TARLOV: If a medical professional deems--
HANNITY: Right. And you can tell anybody to say emotionally--
TARLOV: --that the mother is in danger, one of the fetus--
LILA ROSE, LIVE ACTION FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: There is zero medical reason for this--
TARLOV: --is inviable. Do you not trust doctors?
HANNITY: Let me go to Lila.
TARLOV: There is - there--
HANNITY: Lila, you get doctor to say anything--
TARLOV: No.
HANNITY: --if they share your political view.
ROSE: I mean, an abortionist can make up to $10,000 dollars on these abortions. So those are not really doctors. These are people ending the lives of children in the womb. But, listen, there's no medical reason to kill a child in the womb. There's no medical justification for it. These are babies that are old enough to survive outside the womb, just let them be delivered alive.
In every late-term abortion you have to induce delivery. You have to induce labor and delivery. Why not just let these babies to be delivered alive? New York is saying we can provide the death penalty ultimately for children in the womb even old enough to survive outside the womb. This is something that's sick coming from a state that makes the death penalty illegal for convicted murderers, but now lethal injections can be given to little children.
TARLOV: That's not the way that I read it and it's not the way that supporters of the law are reading it.
ROSE: That's what the law says. You can have an abortion through all nine months for--
TARLOV: Yes, if there is good cause.
ROSE: --any life - reason.
TARLOV: This is such a fallacy--
ROSE: --the doctor, the abortionist deems necessary.
TARLOV: Lila, this is fallacy of the right-wing abortion-on-demand is a made-up campaign slogan to get people scared about something that is actually having to do with health care and a woman's right.
ROSE: How is permitting a--
TARLOV: As per the Supreme Court, our right--
HANNITY: Let Lila talk. Go ahead, one at a time.
ROSE: How is having abortions through all nine months which is what New York just celebrated and just made into law. How is that not abortion-on- demand, Jessica?
TARLOV: It's because there has to be good cause for it. A medical professional has to deem it appropriate. And if you think that a medical practitioner is going to risk their license--
ROSE: How is an abortionist who is making $10,000 off of that abortion--
TARLOV: so that a woman can just wake up one day and say, "Oh, you know what, I don't feel like it anymore". It's ludicrous.
HANNITY: Lila, how hard would it be to get somebody that shares that?
ROSE: The reality is there is no medical justification for abortion. Medical - doctors have agreed there's over a 1,000 of them who signed the Dublin Declaration who said that there's no reason to directly kill a child in the womb for the sake of a woman's life. It's a fallacy. Look it up and these children are humans, they deserve our protection just like these women.
TARLOV: Well, I hope that no one is watching this program is about to tweet at me that supports the death penalty, and I would say also that you--
HANNITY: When we come back our "Villain of the Day" and we'll read your comments. Although, these guys can be villains too.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Tonight's "Villain of the Day", Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He called his fellow Democrats facing accusations of anti- Semitism "Thoughtful colleagues", really? Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, D-N.Y.: I found those two new freshman members to be thoughtful colleagues on a wide variety of issues. We can have a robust debate on domestic policy and on foreign policy. I can say that the overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus is strongly pro- Israel--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Not anti-Semitism. By the way, also we asked you last night which Democrats scares you the most and why? One of our viewers wrote, "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her socialist utopian agenda should scare every American with an ounce of knowledge about the history of socialism.
Another viewer, named Sheri, said, "Andrew Weissmann". That's the Democrat she fears the most. Yes, that's Mueller's Pit Bull that was at Hillary's victory party - got overturned 9-0 in the Supreme Court, put people away for jail overturned in the Fifth Circuit.
All right. We want to hear from you. Our question of the day, "Do you think the democratic policies are hurting the American Dream? @seanhannity on Twitter, hannity.com. Let not your heart be troubled because Laura Ingraham is up next.
