'Off the Record', 5/1/14: More than 200 girls remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by suspected Islamist militants known for terrorizing women and girls. Where is the world on this?

Let's all go 'Off the Record' for a minute. Want to talk about a war on women? Actually, it's worse. It is a war on girls.
And it is going on right now in Nigeria. Two weeks ago, 270 girls -- yes, 270 between the age of 16 and 18 -- were kidnapped in the middle of the night from their school dorm beds by suspected Islamist militants, a group known to terrorize women and girls. Fifty of these girls managed to escape, but that means right now 220 are unaccounted for. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Right now, no one knows if the 220 girls were slaughtered or murdered or sold into slavery or marriage. Some reporters say they were sold for $12 each. A medieval kind of slavery -- capture the girls and sell them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is actually the most incredible act of cruelty. This is a war on women. Where in the world is the world on this one? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my 'Off the Record' comment tonight. But if you have an important story or issue you think I should take 'Off the Record,' to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
