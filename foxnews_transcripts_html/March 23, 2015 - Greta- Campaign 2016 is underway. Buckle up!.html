Let's all go "Off the Record." With Senator Ted Cruz making this announcement today:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SEN. TED CRUZ, PRESIDENTAL CANDIDATE: I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America. And that is why today I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END OF VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

it's official: Campaign 2016 is underway. And I have no idea what twists and turns will develop. But it's worth taking a second and thinking about Campaign 2016 and about coverage and anticipated candidates, starting with Governor Jeb Bush and Secretary Hillary Clinton. Both have family members who have held high office, in fact, the highest. But both Bush and Clinton should be judged on their individual records, whether it be accomplishments and failings. Their family members are not running; they are.
Likewise, at some point, if former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley announces, it is fair to give my comments extra scrutiny because my husband is a long-time friend of Governor O'Malley. In the law, conflicts arise when you hide stuff, not when they are out in the open, so you can decide. After all these years, you all know me. One thing is sure - I'm not a potted plant. My comments will be my own. My job is doing the best job, the fairest job, for all the candidates of both parties. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Campaign 2016, here we go. Buckle up. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
