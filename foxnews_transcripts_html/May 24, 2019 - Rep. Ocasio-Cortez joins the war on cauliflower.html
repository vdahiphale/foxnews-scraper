TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Just about 24 hours ago, the President issued a sweeping declassification order. He gave U.S. Attorney General William Barr broad authority to find and release any documents related to domestic surveillance -- spying -- by American Intelligence agencies over the course of the 2016 campaign.
You'd think everyone would like this. You'd think it would qualify as Donald Trump's least controversial decision as President. Everyone in Washington says, "We love transparency." "Democracy dies in darkness," "The Washington Post" reminds us every morning. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Even now members of Congress are calling for the impeachment of the President because portions of the Mueller report were redacted. "Let's see everything, they're telling us." Okay. Let's do that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The President suddenly appears to agree with them. "Let's see everything." So how did the left react when he suggested that? Not well. Watch this.

CARLSON: "Politicizing the Justice Department," that's what they're concerned about, they're telling us. It's funny, politicizing the Justice Department didn't appear to be a major concern when FBI agents spied on and then slandered Carter Page, an entirely innocent American citizen.
When another two FBI agents were caught talking about an insurance policy against Trump becoming President, and then promising to stop him -- that wasn't politicizing the Justice Department either according to them. Neither was the fired head of the FBI leaking memos to the press through a sympathetic left-wing law professor to make a political case. None of that was politicizing the Justice Department.

But an Attorney General declassifying documents that already exist, that he had nothing to do with creating, "Well now, we've gone too far." CNN trotted out former Director of National Intelligence and serial liar Jim Clapper to let viewers know really this could be dangerous.

JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Concerning because there has already been so much information declassified already particularly in the form of the Mueller report and the previous indictments going back to our original Intelligence community assessment that we did in January of '17.

So I wonder what else is going to be declassified that risk jeopardizing sources and methods.

CARLSON: Precisely. He is concerned that the FBI's methods might become public and that's exactly what we need to know a lot more about -- the FBI's methods.

        }
      
The FBI has a lot more power than any single government agency. Its agents can legally break down your front door and shoot you. Its investigations can destroy your life even if you are innocent. It has happened to a lot of people recently.
So the FBI absolutely must be above suspicion. If you sincerely cared about preserving our democracy as they claim they do, then you would immediately disinfect the FBI with sunlight. But James Clapper has no interest in doing that, neither does the rest of official Washington. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The only principle they care about is self-preservation and they will say anything in its service. Congressman Adam Schiff of California responded to the declassification order this way, quote, "While Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The cover-up has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American." End quote. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Got that? Declassifying information is now a cover-up. It's un-American. Keep in mind, this guy is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Adam Schiff is a complete nut case.
His allies in the media though are certainly more subtle than that. They know that cover-up isn't a plausible way to describe declassification. It's laughable. So instead, they are going with the term "distraction." Watch.

CARLSON: "Distract." As usual, you are watching projection at work. A distraction, yes. We are familiar with that concept. For two and a half years, we listened to their absurd theories about Russian collusion. The goal was to distract us from the implications of the 2016 election and more broadly, to keep Americans from noticing what is happening to their country -- the dying small towns, the needles and garbage flooding the big cities, the overrun border, the Middle Eastern wars that persist for no reason, the grotesque and growing income inequality on the coasts, the rise of China abroad, et cetera -- these are actual problems. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
In some cases, they are full blown crises. They need solutions and serious people to think about those solutions. Every day this farce about Russia and cover-ups continues is another day that America gets weaker and more divided.
After a while, you begin to conclude it must be intentional. There is no other explanation for it.

BRETT TOLMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Thanks, Tucker.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: So who should be concerned about this declassification order? Who should be worried?
TOLMAN: Well, first, we, as the American citizens should be concerned. It seems like political games, but there is nothing more important right now that our focus should be on but this issue, did our Federal government -- those in charge of using extraordinary powers under the FISA rules and using the FISA Court -- did they abuse it? So first we should be. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But there are two other groups that should be very concerned. Those that were involved in the process of getting a warrant using the FISA Court if they did so without justification or if they did so without following the rules or they knew that there was some aspect of the information they were providing that was not credible, they should be concerned, and we should be digging into that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The second group is certainly those that may be -- may have been in Congress. You hear some of the statements they are making that may have information and known all along and have been attempting to distract us from investigating this issue.
CARLSON: So how likely is it do you think that American national security would be damaged if this information was declassified? That's what Jim Clapper was telling us. You've heard Members of Congress say that, is that a plausible concern? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TOLMAN: Well, setting aside the sort of schizophrenic argument that it is, that it is a cover-up, at the time you are actually shedding light on an issue, just setting that aside, right?
CARLSON: It's hilarious, yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TOLMAN: Right? It's hard to take seriously. But if you set that aside, think about the executive order at issue here. The President didn't just say, "Release it," and by the way he has absolute authority to control what is classified and what is not classified, and here, he has asked the Attorney General to work with the heads of the Intelligence community, including the Director of National Security to look at these documents, redact what needs to be redacted and release what can be released. I see that as a thoughtful approach to the classification issue. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: So if you are the head of one of these agencies, if you are Chris Wray for example at FBI, apparently, he is fighting against any declassification efforts, that's kind of the classic posture of a Washington bureaucrat, of an agency head. He wants to protect his own people and his own fiefdom.
So why should that -- we consider that meaningful? Like in the end, who cares whether his agency is embarrassed? Doesn't our right to have confidence in our government override those concerns? Shouldn't it override those concerns?
TOLMAN: You are exactly right. In 2003, I was in the United States Senate. I was responsible for helping get the reauthorization of the Patriot Act done and I recall Jim Comey then, the Deputy Attorney General, Bob Mueller, the Director of the FBI giving assurance to Congress as we expanded their power under the Patriot Act and we expanded the rules of the FISA Court and its application giving assurances that it would not be utilized against American citizens.

And if it was, it would be because they had salute evidence of that citizen's work with an agent of a foreign power. That's not what appears to have happened. So are we entitled to have answers? We are and we shouldn't care whether or not -- and I know Chris Wray, we were U.S. Attorneys at the same time, and I have a lot of respect, but with all due respect, our need to know is greater than any need to not be embarrassed.
CARLSON: Amen. And thank you for reminding us of that as someone who worked on this exact issue 15 or 16 years ago. Brett, thanks. I hope you'll come back.
TOLMAN: Thanks, Tucker.

JOHN KIRIAKOU, FORMER CIA OFFICER: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.
CARLSON: When you hear Mr. Clapper say that we can't possibly declassify this material because it will jeopardize sources and methods, as someone who lived in a world of sources and methods. Do you think that's a plausible concern? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KIRIAKOU: No, no, not at all. I don't think it's a plausible concern, because he is making a judgment that the President and the Attorney General are just willy-nilly going to declassify everything, expose the names of sources, expose operational methods, and nothing could be further from the truth.
The heads of all the different Intelligence services are going to take a chop on this. They're going to redact what needs to be redacted, and the bottom line is, the American people own this information and they have the right to know what's in it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: Well, exactly. So that's funny, you anticipated my next question, which is, as someone who worked inside an Intel agency for as long as you did in, in the Federal bureaucracy for as long as you did, do the people who run these agencies remember that they're working on behalf of voters, that they're accountable to voters through their elected representatives, and that all of the information they gather belongs to the public and not to them? Do they keep that in mind? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KIRIAKOU: No, they don't quite simply. You know, the thing about these intelligence agencies and not just the intelligence agencies, but the FBI as well, is when people finally make their way to the top or into the mid- level leadership positions. It's because they've been there for 20 years, or 25 or 30 years and they know that they cannot wait Presidents. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Presidents come and go and they are there always and most of the time, they think that they can just wait out this President and he will leave and somebody else will be President and by then, they're going to be okay again.
So no, they don't consider the voters. They don't consider even the wishes of the President. They just want this problem to go away, and they think that if they stonewall long enough that it will go away. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

CARLSON: So I'm just hearing that John Brennan, as we speak right now is on another channel red in the face angry, calling this declassification order reckless. Why would Brennan be saying that, I wonder?
KIRIAKOU: Well, I would say that he has something to hide and he is afraid that a true transparent investigation is going to reveal whatever it is that he has to hide.
Remember, John Brennan is not an old man. He is still young enough that he has -- or at least he thinks he has something of a future in Washington. He is the kind of guy who is not shy about telling people here in town that he wants to be Secretary of Defense in a Democratic administration.
Now, if there's an investigation and information is developed that he was, in part responsible for spying on the Trump campaign, or for encouraging FISA warrants to be issued against an innocent American, Carter Page, maybe he is not going to be the Secretary of Defense. And I think that's what he is worried about.

KIRIAKOU: Thank you. Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: Great to see you tonight. It wasn't that long ago that Joe Biden was a completely different person, on tape opposing amnesty for illegal aliens, calling them illegal aliens by the way, and then touting English as our national language. We will show you the tape after the break. You will not believe what a decade will do to somebody in Washington.
Plus Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is denouncing cauliflower as a racist plant. We will tell you why, after the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Well, Joe Biden is supposed to be the moderate candidate in the Democratic field, but that term has been drained of all meaning. On everything important, Biden is identical to everyone else running and fully in sync with the party's radicalized base.
He is for taxpayer-funded abortions all the way through pregnancy. He is in favor of attacking people on the basis of their sex and their skin color and often does.
On immigration, he doesn't just want to keep the border open, he wants to draw even more people across it by offering free healthcare to anyone who sneaks in illegally -- for real. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It wasn't always like this. Biden was, for the course of his entire career, a bit of a blowhard, honestly, but a nice guy and basically pretty sane. He represented a party that cared about working class Americans and we have proof of that. Watch this tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Democratic position also recognizes you've got 11 million aliens -- illegal aliens here. They have to have a way to earn their way into the deal. This is an amnesty. They're required to take 11 years' worth. They pay a fine. They've got to learn to speak English. They've got to pass tests.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Yes, well, by the way, if we want the problems of Canada right now, just keep encouraging people to keep their foreign language. English is going to unite this country potentially. It always has to be the best. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BIDEN: You're quite right. I can't think of a country that has two languages as their accepted languages that is doing all that well, including Switzerland and/or Canada.
MATTHEWS: Right, it divides us. You can't talk to each other.

CARLSON: So when was that shot? 1958? 1973? Or is it a fake concocted by Russian agents to discredit him? No. That video is real and it's from 2006.
As recently as that year, Democrats could still admit that people who snuck in illegally are illegal aliens and that speaking English made this country better.
They could admit that illegal immigration had a real downside and that if illegals were going to get a path to citizenship, they had better want it and pay a serious price. Was Joe Biden a bad person then? A racist? Was Chris Matthews? No. Their party just cared about Americans then? Big difference?
Well, the President announced today that he is deploying 1,500 American troops the Middle East in response to rising tensions with Iran.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We want to have protection in the Middle East. We're going to be sending a relatively small number of troops, mostly protective and some very talented people are going to the Middle East right now. And we'll see how -- and we'll see what happens.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And is it --

        }
      
TRUMP: It'll be about 1,500 people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: So the question really is why? Fifteen hundred soldiers, they are not going to defeat anyone. They're not going to start or win a war with Iran. So why send any at all? And while we're deploying troops overseas to contain threats, why not contain a real threat like China?
To help us figure out what exactly is happening, we're joined by retired Army Colonel, Douglas McGregor. He is the author of the terrific book, "Margin of Victory," and he joins us now. Colonel, thanks very much for coming on.
COL. DOUGLAS MACGREGOR (RET), U.S. ARMY: Sure.
CARLSON: So what do you suppose the thinking here is?
MACGREGOR: Well, I think the President told you straight up the truth. This is a theater missile defense formation. The troops and the equipment they have are designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. So this is a purely defensive formation. It has no offensive fighting capability at all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And normally, in crises or in any period of tension, we routinely deploy these kinds of formations to the Middle East to reassure our friends and partners that we will help shoot down ballistic missiles if Iran shoots at them.
CARLSON: Oh, so we're not -- I mean, these are not missiles aimed at our country. They're aimed at other countries.
MACGREGOR: Absolutely.
CARLSON: Okay, so it sounds fine, I guess the concern would be, though, that their presence might be potentially a trigger that would get us involved in some sort of wider conflict, and the broader concern is that the small group of people around the President are pushing for that conflict. Do you think that's something to be worried about?
MACGREGOR: Well, I think you've already got that in the form of the Carrier Battle Group. The team of one that I call the President, the team of one because he is the only person who is obviously opposed to conflict in the region with Iran. He is trying very desperately, I think, in his own way to deescalate.
But he really has to pull the Carrier Battle Group out of the Persian Gulf. He needs to get it out of there, put it out in the Arabian Sea, even put it in the eastern Mediterranean, but get it out of the Gulf. That's the real trigger right now. That's the potential catalyst for trouble.
CARLSON: Looking at the world, the full expanse of the world, do you believe that Iran is the preeminent physical threat to the United States right now? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACGREGOR: Oh no, of course not. Iran doesn't threaten us at all. Look, this is an intra-Muslim conflict that we're watching unfold right now. You have on the one side, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and the Gulf, who are trying to escalate the tension and the conflict by dragging us in.
We are there ostensibly to protect them. But in reality, they would like to drag us into conflict with Iran. Obviously, the Israelis would appreciate that as well. But it's primarily right now Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arabs, they're unhappy with what's happened in Yemen with the fact that the Houthis haven't all committed suicide yet. They would like to see Iran driven out of Iraq and Syria, the only hope they have of any of that happening is by dragging us in to do it for them.
CARLSON: I mean, that doesn't seem remotely in our interest -- our national interest at all. Why we wouldn't we fight that idea? Why wouldn't we fight that with every ounce of strength we have?
MACGREGOR: Well, the problem is that the team of one once again, is surrounded by these globalists, interventionists with ties, in many cases to the Gulf Arabs, to Saudi Arabia and Israel. So they are going to do whatever they can to advocate for conflict. That's the problem.
The team of one sits there and says, "Wait a minute. Why?" I mean, we've been through this process in the past. There is no evidence that Iran had anything to do with the attacks on the tankers, far from it.
In fact, anybody who knows the Iranians knows that if they were actually trying to sink those ships, they'd have done it. So that looks like another false flag designed once again to create tension and drag us into the fight.
CARLSON: It's just funny. I mean, it seems like yesterday that the left was berating the Trump administration for doing the bidding of Saudi Arabia and now they're sitting by happily as we come closer to war on behalf of Saudi Arabia. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACGREGOR: Yes, well, this is what Yogi Berra called a deja vu all over again. You know, these kinds of things keep happening over and over and over again, I think President Trump knows better. But he really needs to get involved personally, de-escalate this thing.
The Iranians are trying very hard to communicate with us through intermediaries. I think we should talk to them privately, quietly in a third country, and sort out some of these differences, but we should not be in the intra-Muslim war. It's not our war.
CARLSON: No. Of course not. Colonel, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight.
MACGREGOR: Yes.
CARLSON: Well, normal people are fleeing the state of California in droves. The Governor of the state says it's not his fault. Instead, he is blaming this show. For real. We've got the tape after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Well, the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom spoke the other day to that California Chamber of Commerce, it was yesterday, in fact. And in his speech, Newsom submitted that business leaders in California are distressed, some of them are angry, some of them are fleeing the state entirely and not coming back.

Newsom admitted that's happening and then he said he knows why it's happening. This program is doing it. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIF., GOVERNOR: And I get why so many of you, you know, often seems in despair about this state. I watch Fox News as well.
(Laughter)
NEWSOM: Poor Tucker Carlson.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Newsom then proceeded to tell the business leaders that actually things are great in California. Don't listen to “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and you'll feel much better. Now, we'd like to think that we have enough power to convince people of things that aren't true, to work our voodoo, but we're not capable of doing that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What we've done instead is just show people what's happening in the largest state in the union, in California. And every day we do that. And every day the message is the same, homeless encampments in downtown Los Angeles; San Francisco, filthy, prettiest city in the continental United States -- destroyed, Sacramento.
Across the state, same story -- piles of needles, mounds of garbage and human waste. It's ridiculous. And then the absurd laws, bans on plastic straws or preventing authorities from reporting illegal immigrants to I.C.E. How does that help anybody? It doesn't help a single American citizen.
Then the sky high taxes and housing costs that make the place unlivable for the middle class. You don't take our word for it, because we've had video and statistical evidence for everything we say, obviously.
But let's be serious. Nobody in California needed us to tell them their state is in freefall. They see it every day themselves. The question is, does the Governor care? He doesn't appear to.
As California declines, its housing crisis seems worse in its most affluent towns. It's interesting paradox. Mountain View, California is the home of Google, the world's most powerful tech company. Apartments rent in Mountain View for more than $4,100.00 per month, on average. The average home cost more than $1.8 million, and these are ranch style homes. These are not big. You wouldn't want to live in one, trust me
Now, homelessness, not surprisingly, is exploding in Mountain View, hundreds of people living out of RVs. The city's solution -- kick them out.
The city councilors enacted a ban on RVs parking in the city overnight. This is a story that tells you a lot about a lot. To respond to it tonight, we've asked, Jason Nichols, Professor of African-American Studies at the University of Maryland to join us. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');

        }
      
JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Thank you, Tucker. Thank you for having me.
CARLSON: So there's a paradox here. Mountain View, one of the richest places in the world, also one of the most liberal. And yet, it's a city that's really defined by its income inequality. And it's not alone in that.
In fact, across the country, the places with the greatest divide between rich and poor, are almost exclusively left-wing places. What do you make of that?
NICHOLS: Well, I think that it goes beyond this kind of political divide that we're talking about. I think that actually, we're seeing gentrification around the country, in red states and blue states and red cities and blue cities.
This is just a matter of income inequality altogether. The fact that the price of housing is rising much higher and much faster than the wages. Wages are rising it about 3 percent right now, which is a good rate. We have a strong economy, but housing prices are rising by about 5 percent and have been for several years.
So I think that this is more than just political and I think we need to come in as Americans and come to some positive solution.
CARLSON: It is. I agree -- I agree with that. But I don't agree that this is happening in red cities and blue cities. It's just happening in blue cities. I don't think that there is a red state in this country, a place controlled by conservatives that has this level of income inequality. No place in Wyoming, for example, has this. Rural Alabama doesn't have this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's San Francisco. It's New York. It's Seattle. It's Portland, Oregon. It's Los Angeles. These are the most liberal places in America, and yet they have the most homeless. I mean, at some point, you have to ask, what is going on?
NICHOLS: Well, so, again, I would go if we're going to talk about places like San Francisco and LA, and Washington, DC, of course, I think part of this -- part of the reason, you know, real estate goes by supply and demand. And unfortunately, you know, I want to give a shout out to everybody in Wyoming, but there are many people who don't want to live in Wyoming or don't want to live in rural Alabama.
But many people, particularly people with lots of money, want to live in places like San Francisco and that leads to a push out, and people end up without homes and prices actually because the demand is so high, the supply is low.
CARLSON: But why aren't they helping? Oh, I get it, I get it. But why are they helping? So if you're in Mount -- you know, if you're the founders of Google and you are progressive icons, and you really believe you're a good person, because you help so many people. Why aren't you doing something to help people right on the sidewalk in front of your mansion? Why isn't Nancy Pelosi doing something about homelessness in her city? I don't get it. I honestly don't get it.
NICHOLS: Well, no, I would agree that there are many things that politicians need to do on both sides of the aisle in order to, you know, deal with this crisis, but I would say again, I would also go with the fact that the leader of HUD, who is you know, my old friend, Dr. Carson, is someone who is rising rents on some of the poorest people in the country right now.
They're doing some good things at HUD, and I'm not so sure that Dr. Carson is the guy to talk to, but there are many people over there who are also rising rents on people who can't afford it and that's leading to more of a push out.
Of course in California, you have eight in ten people actually live outdoors. So people in RVs are actually somewhat fortunate in that circumstance. So I think it's -- it's both sides of the aisle, Tucker.
CARLSON: I don't know. I just -- I guess, I just don't see that. If you can -- if you find -- I hope you'll come back if you can find a city of over a hundred thousand people in America, run by conservatives that has the same problem with homelessness or income inequality.
I just don't think there is one, but maybe there is and I will stand corrected if you can find it. Professor, thank you very much.
NICHOLS: Thank you for having me, Tucker.
CARLSON: Good to see you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just warned her fans that cauliflower is a white supremacist vegetable. Don't eat it. We will tell you what she's talking about after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Well, three years ago -- almost exactly three years ago -- British voters chose to leave the European Union. They voted to pull out. That still doesn't happen though because elites don't actually care about democracy. They're happy to ignore it when it doesn't affirm their wishes.
So yesterday, the British public voted in the European Union elections. The top party in the polls is Nigel Farage's Brexit party and that's running on a very simple platform, "Get Britain out of the E.U."
Now that idea is against the left's agenda, so much like in America they've responded with violence. The new fad in Britain is leftist throwing milkshakes at people they don't like. Nigel Farage was attacked on Monday.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS OF NIGEL FARAGE BEING ATTACKED WITH MILKSHAKE.)
CARLSON: Farage by the way will be joining us on this program this coming Tuesday. But keep in mind, it's not just politicians. An 80-year-old military veteran in Britain was also attacked since he was a supporter of Farage's party.
Physically attacking people for their beliefs, of course, is fascism and an actual attack on democracy. So what has the response been from powerful people in Britain? Well, of course, they support it.
A columnist for "The Guardian" called it justifiable political theater. Burger King's U.K. Twitter account tweeted this quote, "Dear people of Scotland, we're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun." Little woke capitalism for you, and the founder of Chorlton Brewing Company in Manchester said that throwing milkshakes was not enough instead, quote, "Hit them over the head with a brick as is traditional."
No one should be surprised though, the left stop caring about democracy long ago. What they want is power and any behavior is justified if it gets them more of it. Understand that and you will understand them.
It's getting hard to keep track of all the things that are racist these days. Jefferson statues, milk, not wanting African-Americans to abort their children. That's racist. Now add another one to the long list -- cauliflower is racist.
In a video posted on Sunday, young pioneer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explained to her followers that it is deeply problematic to grow cauliflower in urban gardens.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: If you really think about it, when someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca, instead of, I don't know, cauliflower or something? What you're doing is that you're taking a colonial approach to environmentalism. And that is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with the colonial lens on them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Huh? Even adjusting for the fact she's dumb, which she obviously is, it's still confusing. What is she saying? We need to liberal Sherpa to help us figure it out. Cathy Areu is the founder of "Catalina" magazine, and a frequent guest on our show, and she joins us tonight.
Cathy, thanks so much for coming on.
CATHY AREU, FOUNDER, CATALINA MAGAZINE: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: So how racist is cauliflower? And I am going to just say, I don't like cauliflower. So don't look at me like I'm part of the cauliflower problem, I'm not, but how racist is it?
AREU: Thank goodness. Well, it's part of mono-cropping. So our colonial ancestors grew cauliflower. So they are cropping the same old, same old vegetables, not good for the environment because it's the same nutrients in the ground. And it actually hurts the environment to have the same old same old, so the core in the cauliflower is colonialism.
So she is talking about diversifying our vegetables as we should diversify our culture. So yucca instead of cauliflower is the way to go if you do not want to be racist when it comes to our community gardens.
CARLSON: So okay, cauliflower, I mean, you make a fair point. And cauliflower is a European vegetable.
AREU: Thank you.
CARLSON: It originates in the Mediterranean region, I believe. Indigenous to the new world is tobacco. That comes from the indigenous peoples of the Americas and syphilis, too, by the way.
AREU: Both are healthy?
CARLSON: So would you say that tobacco is better? Well, I don't know now. I mean, tobacco is an indigenous plant, but you're saying it's bad. But it's -- I don't understand, so you're saying tobacco is worse than cauliflower or better than cauliflower?
AREU: Well, the point is -- the term is the mono-cropping. It's the growing of the same thing in our Earth. So there are no nutrients that are being given to our land, so therefore it hurts the environment.
So if we grow new things, so forget the tobacco, forget the cauliflower, we need the new yucca, we need the fiddleheads. We need the new -- different -- plantains. We need different crops being grown to help our environment.
CARLSON: But none of those - but can you say that the climate -- the climate plays a role in this, so I don't think yucca or plantains grow very well in the climate of say New York City, Brooklyn, or Queens?
AREU: Have we tried though? I mean --
CARLSON: You're right.
AREU: Have we tried? Those community gardens are usually led by people with time on their hands, those upper class women, upper class members of society who have time to volunteer, not those middle class workers. Yes, yes, so it's a crop of choice.
CARLSON: Right. The racist cauliflower haters. Are you concerned -- last question, are you concerned about applying social justice standards to the food we eat?
AREU: Yes.
CARLSON: Do you think ultimately that might, I don't know, drive us insane and cause food shortages?
AREU: I'm afraid. I mean, we need to realize that salsa is more popular than ketchup. So if we were truly racist, we wouldn't allow salsa in this country. So thank goodness, we are such a wonderful country that allows diverse foods and crops to come into our country and we can diversify our food and our crops. Yes.
CARLSON: Every time I get mad at the left, I think -- I think it must be living hell to be a member of it, because you'd have to remember all the rules, I don't think I could.
AREU: It's not that hard. It's almost good.
CARLSON: It's baffling to me. We're so glad that you're keeping track though. Thank you for joining us tonight.
AREU: Thank you. Thank you.
CARLSON: Well, cauliflower maybe the latest innocuous object to be called racist by the left, but it certainly won't be the last. What will they ban next? Kurt Schlichter is a senior columnist at townhall.com. He joins us with a list of things the left is planning to prohibit. Kurt, great to see you tonight. So what's on their list?
KURT SCHLICHTER, SENIOR COLUMNIST, TOWNHALL.COM: Oh, everything. Ban all the things Tucker. Let's start with pets. They'll want to ban pets. Have you checked your pet privilege?
CARLSON: Pets?
SCHLICHTER: Pets. Have you checked your pet privilege? Look, if cauliflower can be colonialist, can't your retriever be racist? Think about it.
CARLSON: If they come from -- if they start coming from people's dogs, I mean, I think you could have gunplay at that point. I mean, people are -- I think they will be overwhelmed. That might be overreach.
SCHLICHTER: Oh, you will pry my fat Corgi out of my cold dead hands as I like reading on a pile of smoking brass.
CARLSON: Exactly, exactly. I feel the same way about my spaniels.
SCHLICHTER: But Tucker, it's the importance of these animals to us. The importance of everything that makes it such a tempting target because it's not about pets. They don't like dogs or cats better than anything else.
In fact, a lot of liberals are probably with many, many cats right now who will devour them when they die alone in their apartments. But the simple fact is, our animals are important to us. When it's important to us, when it's something that matters to us, that's what's the most fun to take away, because it's the exercise of powers and about making a better society.
Take a look at America over the last 20 years. How did Iraq work out? The collapse on Wall Street. Obamacare. Failure after failure after failure. It's not succeeding by leading, it's the joy of exercising power over people you feel are your inferior.
CARLSON: No, that's exactly right. No, they got America to quit smoking and nobody got healthier, I noticed. Okay, so what else are they going to ban?
SCHLICHTER: Well, how about hunting. There's something related. Now, I don't hunt. I was in the Army 27 years. I spent enough time in the woods. No one brings me drinks in the woods, so I don't want to be there.
But other people think differently. Other people like to hunt. It's important to them. It's important to the way they build their communities and their families and their cultures. You go out to like Michigan and they'll close the schools, so families can go out and hunt deer.
That makes it even more of a target because our coastal urban elites can boss around a bunch of people they think are knuckle dragging, Jesus, gun people. It's fun to boss people around if you're that kind of person.
CARLSON: So we've got pets, hunting. Give me one more thing we should be on guard against having them banned.
SCHLICHTER: Well, religion. They don't like religion. And it's not because they don't appreciate diversity. It's because they hate blasphemy. Now, their religion is themselves. They worship their own dogma. They worship their own moral superiority over us. And if we won't comply, if we dare to worship God or Allah or go to the synagogue or do whatever, it means we're not worshipping them. It means we're not acknowledging their moral superiority. They can't live with that, Tucker. They can't live with that.
CARLSON: No, it's a really good point. They are God in their view, and finally they're going to ban conservatives, you think?
SCHLICHTER: Oh, I'm sure they're going to ban conservatives. They hate the idea that there are these obstacles out there, that there are people who have different views that's why they're always targeting you. They're always targeting me. They're always throwing people off social media because their ideas are -- you know, just fill in the blank. It doesn't matter.
The excuses differ, but the result is always the same. Silencing opponents, but I have a solution to this, Tucker. Would you like to hear it?
CARLSON: Yes. I'll give you 10 seconds.
SCHLICHTER: Here is my solution. I will think, say and do whatever I damn well please, and there's no a thing you, liberal leaders, can do about it. That's my solution. Simple and elegant.
CARLSON: I love that. Good luck with that. It's harder than it sounds. Great to you, Kurt. Thank you.
Time next for Dan Bongino's news explosion. We will wrap up the week by going over his top three stories of the past seven days after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: It's Friday. Time for the pyrotechnics. Dan Bongino's news explosion. Our favorite former Secret Service agent and New York City cop is here to run through his top three stories of the week. The great Dan Bongino joins us tonight. Hey, Dan.
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, always great to be back with you. Here are my three biggest hits of the week. Story number three: Bill de Blasio defies the odds again. Bill de Blasio has been a favorite of yours and mine, Tucker. I know the failed socialist mayor of New York City who has approval ratings that are somehow in the negative. I don't know how that's even possible. But Tucker, get a load of this one.
Bill de Blasio has defied the laws of statistics and is polling at a phenomenal zero percent. How that's possible, Tucker, I don't know. You and I both know, if were to substitute a teacher's class, Tucker, and walk into a class and say, "Kids who wants homework?" There's always that one kid who says yes. There's never zero percent in anything, except Bill de Blasio. It's just amazing. It's phenomenal, isn't it? Aren't you impressed?
CARLSON: I mean, it's so well deserved? And it really gives you hope for this country, as misguided as we can be, Bill de Blasio is just too obviously a fraud.
BONGINO: Oh, he's peachy. We love him. All right. Story number two. This, I love this one. Forty percent of Americans are embracing and giving a hug to socialism. I think the alternate headline is probably more appropriate here, Tucker. Four in ten Americans have no idea what socialism is.
Ladies and gentlemen, clearly you have not done your homework on socialism. You know, the little things like a hundred million dead -- the death, destruction, starvation. Mao's China, the Great Leap Forward, which is really a huge leap backwards. Kind of a big deal. You may want to crack a textbook before you answer that poll question next. I'm just saying, throwing that out there for you.
Now, on a serious note, story number one, the biggest story of the week. It broke last night while you actually handed off the toss to me when I was filling in for Sean, this declassification story.
Let me just tell you this Tucker. Americans need to know the truth. You've been all over this. I've been all over this. I got an e-mail today that really disturbed me. It's from a friend of mine up on Capitol Hill who is knee deep in this. You know what he said to me, Tucker? He said, "We're at a really dangerous inflection point now, Dan."
He said, "The Democrats have completely forfeited Western values. This spy thing is a big deal. We need to get to the bottom of it." Huge story, my number one story of the week.
CARLSON: And I think we will get to the bottom of that. Dan Bongino, thank you for capping off a great week with a great segment. Have the best weekend.
BONGINO: Always a pleasure, my dear friend. See you next week.
CARLSON: See you, man. We'll be back Monday, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have the best weekend.
