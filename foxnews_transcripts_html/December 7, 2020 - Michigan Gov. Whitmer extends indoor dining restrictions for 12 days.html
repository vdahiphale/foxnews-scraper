NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Thank you, Bill, very much.Well, Bill, like you, we're dealing with a coast-to-coast crisis here,right? On the West Coast, where they're envisioning lockdowns that couldaffect nine out of 10 Californians, you have already heard the story aboutthe one woman, Angela Marsden, who is on the brink right now unless theychange their policies.On the East Coast of the United States, in New York, Governor Cuomo isentertaining doing the exact same thing in the New York City metropolitanarea if hospitalization rates don't improve.Right now, a good many of them are close to full capacity. And that'sbefore the virus itself has exponentially been rising in terms of thenumber of cases.We're going to talk to some business owners who fear it can be a verytreacherous path, because, in the middle of the country, as we look atwhat's happening on either coast, word out of Michigan that they want tocontinue restrictions and add to them for at least another couple of weeks.That would take us right through the holidays.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.And what an incredible world, at that, as we're trying to get a sense ofhow far some of these measures to contain the virus go. Keep in mind that alot of the measures they have taken have done little to slow theprogression of the virus itself.So, what will happen on the West Coast, and what particularly in the BigApple?For the latter, we go to Alex Hogan following these developments quiteclosely in New York.Hey, Alex.ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.Well, we're seeing hospitalization numbers around the country rise. Andhere in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo says that the city will seeadditional restrictions if the spread continues to spiral out of control.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  In five days, if the hospitalization ratedoesn't stabilize in New York City, we're going to close indoor dining.We're now at 25 percent in New York City.In the rest of the state, any region where the hospitalization rate doesn'tstabilize, then, our 50 percent capacity indoor dining, we're going to goto 25 percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOGAN:  The state reported nearly 10,000 new cases yesterday. More than4,400 New Yorkers are hospitalized. The hard-hit restaurant industrybracing for another blow.In California, a video went viral this weekend of a woman pointing to herclosed outdoor dining area and just feet away the outdoor dining tents forwhat she said was a movie crew.California Governor Gavin Newsom today addressed business owners who arestruggling because of these restrictions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA):  I'm deeply empathetic and deeply committed toadvancing the cause of supporting our small businesses during this tryingand challenging time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOGAN:  Another sign of potential relief is the vaccine around the corner.But medical experts say this will only work if the country buys in as awhole.While millions of people will likely need to wait until the spring for theshot, some remain skeptical. Sixty percent trust the science here, but 39percent of Americans say they will not take this vaccine.Dr. Anthony Fauci says, for there not to be any more community spread, weneed to see about 75 to 80 percent of Americans buying in and taking thisvaccine to have an umbrella of protection -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Alex, thank you very, very much, Alex Hogan in New Yorkon that.I want to take you to Michigan and some developments there that they arewatching, because they are extending some restrictions that directly affectbusinesses and restaurants, almost right until Christmas, December 20, tobe exact, 12 days added to a partial shutdown, that affect everything fromretail establishments, restaurants, all the way to schools, and how much inperson training and classroom activity they can allow.We have got Joe Vicari here, Rosalie Vicari. They run a restaurant group,very successful one, at that. And they're in the middle of this, and sortof at Governor Gretchen Whitmer's sort of whim here.Guys, very nice of you to come here.These latest orders were based on a serious spike in cases in your state,according to the governor, and warrant this drastic move. She doesn't wantto do it, says that she's been compelled to do it.What do you think?JOE VICARI, PRESIDENT AND OWNER, JOE VICARI RESTAURANT GROUP:  I thinkshe's got her own agenda.I think that this has nothing to do with the science, because, if it did,then she said that it has gone up the last three weeks. Well, we have beenshut for three weeks, so it hasn't been coming from restaurants. So, that'sreally our frustration, is that there's no right and reason for this.Our neighbors in Ohio are open. You can drive 40 miles south and go torestaurants there. And, again, the restaurants in Michigan have had doneall the protocols they have asked us to do. And we have. And it's just sodisheartening, because there's -- like I said, we don't feel there's anyrhyme or reason to this.I think there's a different agenda that the Democratic governors have. AndI don't know what it is.CAVUTO:  So, Rosalie, when you look at this, it's -- obviously, you can'tdo anything. And now you can't do anything for at least another couple ofweeks more.I mean, can you guys hang on through this?ROSALIE VICARI, CO-OWNER, JOE VICARI RESTAURANT GROUP:  It's going to bevery difficult.I think, the longer that the governor closes restaurants and keeprestaurants closed, the harder it is for people to survive. They -- ourMichigan Restaurant and Lodging Association has already seen 2,000permanent closures of restaurants. And they predict, if the closure wentlonger than the three-week pause, which it is going longer now, that anadditional 4,000 restaurants will have to permanently close their doors.And that equates to -- with the 2,000 and then the additional 4,000, itequates to almost 250,000 restaurant workers that are going to be out ofbusiness. So, most of -- most of the small businesses, most of the smallerrestaurants will not be able to survive this closure again, especiallythrough the holiday season.This is our busiest period. We went all year long to get into the month ofDecember. And we just -- we just won't know what to do with the lostrevenue, the lost wages for our staff.The saddest part is listening to our staff. Our staff has been calling us.We hear from them daily about their struggles in trying to survive duringthe holiday season. So...J. VICARI:  We have -- we're a larger restaurant group. We had a furlough,layoff, 700 employees. It's -- yes, it's...CAVUTO:  Whoa.You know what is weird about it, though, guys? And you're aware of thesenumbers far better than I am, that these spikes in cases to which thegovernor refers, they're not happening in restaurants. They're nothappening in what seem to be the target zones for shutting things down.Nevertheless, she said, when she made this announcement -- quoting here --"Hope is on the horizon. But we need an additional 12 days to determine thefull impact of the Thanksgiving holiday on our efforts to mitigate thespread of the virus."So, it sounds to me, Joe, that we might get no proof the virus spreadduring Thanksgiving, but, out of an abundance of precaution, she could bepushing you to the brink.J. VICARI:  The Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association came out withsomething recently that said they can contribute 4.3 percent of COVID casesinto restaurants, a very low percentage.If this thing was 25, 35 percent, I would understand. It's 4 percent. Andshopping malls are 9 percent. So, shopping...R. VICARI:  But shopping malls remain open.J. VICARI:  Yes, they're open.And...CAVUTO:  Yes, that is what is weird, right?J. VICARI:  Yes.R. VICARI:  It's weird. It's weird to us too.J. VICARI:  Yes, very frustrating.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Guys, I wish we had more time.But I do want to be clear. One thing is, these spikes in cases occurredeven after pretty stiff measures that the governor was taking, by the way,not only in your fine state, but in other states, where this happened evenwith some pretty stringent measures.So, are these measures the answer?J. VICARI:  Well...R. VICARI:  Well, I think that the safety measures help. It helped to keeppeople safe. It helped to keep our customers and our employees safe.And we did everything the governor asked us to do. We did offer mandates.We went beyond even to keep people safe.So, like Joe said, the science to us shows that 4 percent, 4.2 percent iscoming out of restaurants. Restaurants were closed during the Thanksgivingseason. We have been closed the last three weeks. So, whatever spike ishappening is not attributable to the restaurant industry.We have been closed. So it's frustrating for all of us.CAVUTO:  I imagine it is, because everyone I talk to says that you have thebest food going.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  So, I have got to sample that out whenever I'm in theneighborhood.R. VICARI:  Please do.CAVUTO:  But just hang in there, guys.R. VICARI:  Thank you. That's all we can do right now.CAVUTO:  It's a strange world in which we live.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  I hear you.J. VICARI:  We appreciate it.CAVUTO:  I hear you, but happy holidays and merry Christmas just the same.We will be watching. Keep us posted, Joe and Rosalie Vicari of the VicariGroup Restaurant.One of the things that occurs with all of this is that a vaccine is goingto make all of this go away, that governors wouldn't be compelled to takesuch drastic action.Yet there are a good many people who are leery of the vaccine, including,in one survey, just one survey, half of New York firefighters. Why is that?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, president-elect Biden is busy wrapping up his Cabinetpicks right now. He's still a long way from done, but a very crucial one inthe health care arena, and particularly how that grouping now would dealwith these latest spikes in cases that could likely extend pastInauguration Day in January.Let's get the latest from Jacqui Heinrich, with the former vice presidentin Wilmington, Delaware -- Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil.President-elect Joe Biden's choice to head up Health and Human Services maybring a pause in pressure to select Latino leaders for Cabinet positions.Biden tapped Xavier Becerra, bringing praise from Democrats and somecriticism from Republicans.The Congressional Hispanic Caucus praised the choice, calling Becerra achampion for working families who's lived the American dream. Becerra, theson of Mexican immigrants who served 12 terms in Congress before becomingCalifornia's first Latino attorney general, led legal efforts on the healthcare front, including a campaign to defend the Affordable Care Act.And he's expected to use his fluent Spanish to promote and defend theupcoming COVID-19 vaccination campaign within the Latino community. ButRepublican Senator Tom Cotton indicated there may be a confirmation hurdle,tweeting: "Xavier Becerra spent his career attacking pro-life Americans andtried to force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise abortions. He has beena disaster in California. And he is unqualified to lead HHS. I will bevoting no. And Becerra should be rejected by the Senate."Biden also filled out his health team, naming Dr. Vivek Murthy, a currentchair of his COVID task force, to be surgeon general, and Dr. RochelleWalensky, the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts GeneralHospital, to lead the CDC.Now, they will be joined by a very familiar face, Dr. Anthony Fauci, whoBiden has asked to continue in his role as director of the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and also serve as chiefmedical adviser.Fauci reportedly said he won't be in person here in Wilmington tomorrow forthe unveiling. But he is expected to appear perhaps virtually -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Jacqui, thank you very much, Jacqui Heinrich on all this.Well, everyone is just waiting for a vaccine, right? And the FDA isbeginning deliberations right now to decide whether Pfizer's treatment andeven Moderna's down the road warrants getting it out for emergency useright now.Keep in mind, in the United Kingdom and Bahrain, it is out there foremergency use. But a lot of people are anxious about vaccines, period. Butone survey in New York raised a lot of eyebrows, when half the fire men andwomen who were answering it said that they would not be keen on a vaccinejust yet.Andy Ansbro is with the Uniformed Firefighters Association right now. He'sthe president.That surprised me, Andy. But I know it was based on a couple of otherthings. It wasn't exactly scientific. I know that not every firefighter waspolled. So, this is a fraction of a fraction.But what did you make of it?ANDY ANSBRO, PRESIDENT, UNIFORMED FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION:  Well, we feelthat the date was actually pretty on target. We actually managed to get 25percent of our membership to answer, over 2,000 members.But our numbers being roughly 50-45 no to yes, that's probably indicativeof the general population. I mean, it is a privilege to be at the front ofthe line for this vaccination. But it's not an obligation by my members toget it.So what I'm advocating for is my members to get all the information,educate themselves on the vaccine, the pros and the cons. And I expect themto make a decision based on what's best for their family. I'm going to getit myself. I will encourage my members to get it.But I'm going to stand behind whatever decision they make personally forwhat's best for them and their family. As far as the actual study beingskewed either way, we had a couple of issues with prior ways in which thedepartment administered a flu vaccine.And we tried to avoid that by letting members know this is just a strictyes-no question:  Are you interested? We're hoping that, when our membersget more information, just like everybody else -- this is all new stuff.When everyone gets more information, we're hoping more of our members willbe inclined to get it.CAVUTO:  All right. So the fact that half in this survey are not, is itthat they're cynical that it's going to work, or they just are leery ofvaccines?Firefighters are a tough-to-prove-it-to bunch. They're very, very doubtfulof a lot of things. And that's what makes them quite heroic, because they -- they're crazy enough to walk into a fire.ANSBRO:  Well...CAVUTO:  But my point is, are there -- is there something there that younotice that they're relaying to you, like, wait a minute, this doesn't addup?ANSBRO:  I don't think those numbers are any different for the generalpopulation.But, honestly, my membership was hit very hard during coronavirus. Over 35percent of us have been exposed. A lot of my members are young and strong.And they're really not worried about personally getting another exposure.They probably would rather see someone in more risk category get theirvaccine.CAVUTO:  I see.ANSBRO:  But, honestly, we did this poll with the intention of letting thedepartment know how much we're going to need as an estimate, and what theirexpectations are, and where they have got to work if they want to get thosenumbers off.As far as members being anti-vaxxers, I have been told that one, I don'tsee that. But, again, there's a lot of people that don't want to be at thefront of the line for vaccine. The final trial for any drug is the wide-scale application to the public.CAVUTO:  No, you're right.ANSBRO:  But I have been told that this is a safe vaccine by a close friendwho happens to be virologist. And I'm going to have an opportunity to havemy good friend who is a legitimate Ph.D. molecular biologist/virologisttalk my members, and hopefully give them the information they need fromsomeone that I trust.And maybe we can convince a few more people to get it. But, again, in theend, it's a decision they will have to make for themselves. I just want itto be an informed decision.CAVUTO:  Yes. You're right. And they are -- by and large, they're young menand women. So they're -- they have a whole different viewpoint on thisvirus.But would you -- you said that you would be likely to take it. Would youtake it in front -- in front of them too. So, guys, this is OK?ANSBRO:  Absolutely. That's my intention.CAVUTO:  OK.ANSBRO:  I'm not looking to have anyone do it because I'm doing it. I wantthem to do it based on the education and based on knowing what it is andwhat it isn't.CAVUTO:  Well said.ANSBRO:  This is different vaccine from a flu vaccine.CAVUTO:  Got it. Fair enough.ANSBRO:  Yes, the flu vaccine, to my knowledge, is actually a weakenedvirus.The COVID vaccine is basically a fraction of the virus shell, which isincapable of being a full active live virus, which can actually get yousick, while your body does recognize that fragment and build its ownantibodies to see -- find it if it comes across it again and destroy it.So the vaccine is actually a large dose of viral -- dead viral fragmentsthat your body will mount the response to, which is how you get he wasfevers and chills within 24 hours. That's not the virus. That is yourbody's natural response to it.CAVUTO:  Fair enough.ANSBRO:  And so, hopefully, by getting the information out...CAVUTO:  No, Andy, you raise a number of good points.And, obviously, there are some distinctions with this one. Obviously, ithas to be very cold. You have to take it in two doses spread some daysapart. So maybe that could be leading to some of the concern.ANSBRO:  Well...CAVUTO:  But, Andy, if you take it, well, gosh, I have a feeling those menand women will take it.But thank you very, very much. And that explains a lot. It's not -- it'skind of in keeping with some general public surveys on this.Andy, thank you on that.Meantime, want to take you to Georgia when we come back. As you know,there's a run-off election there on January 5. You might have heard a thingor two about it. Today was the final day you had to register to vote forit. How many are going to participate?That could be a very deciding factor, not only in that battle and thosebattles, but in the makeup finally of the United States -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Yes, Virginia, there could be a Christmas present regarding aCOVID relief package to the tune of close to a trillion dollars, wherethey're suddenly finding common ground.Now can they find a common calendar in time to do it?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it's a big powwow of the mightiest of the biotech drugindustry players tomorrow at the White House, but two very, very bigplayers won't be there. And we don't know why.But I have a feeling Blake Burman might. He joins us from the White House -- Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Neil. Yes.And this is some news that we have been gathering quite literally withinthe last few seconds here. There's going to be this big White House summiton vaccine distribution tomorrow, the who's-who who you might expect, thepresident, the vice president, members of Operation Warp Speed involved,some members from within the industry as it relates to distribution,members of Operation Warp Speed, et cetera.However, we have also learned quite literally in the last few seconds herethat the representatives, the top representatives from Pfizer and fromModerna will not be at this vaccine summit tomorrow. Of course, Pfizer's --Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate is up before the FDA on Thursday injust three days' time.After that, Moderna is a week later, 10 days later. According to a sourcefamiliar with the matter, Pfizer was just a bit uncomfortable being herefor this summit, considering that the FDA was going to be here as wellinvolved -- as a part of the summit tomorrow.So, because these companies, Neil, are up before the FDA here in the nextthree days, 10 days, when you're talking about Pfizer and Moderna, we arenow being told that the lead executives at the company not going to be herefor the summit tomorrow, but it is something, this summit, that we are toldcould potentially last hours, as clearly the White House wants to put thisforward, as vaccine distribution potentially could be happening by week'send -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Blake Burman, thank you very much for that, BlakeBurman at the White House.In the meantime, I want to switch to Georgia right now, last day forresidents of that state to go ahead and register to vote for the January 5run-off senatorial election.Jonathan Serrie has more from Decatur, Georgia -- Jonathan.JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Neil.Well, today, Georgia elections officials recertified the results of thepresidential race after the three counts. They have determined that theoutcome of that race has not changed. And Georgia's secretary of state,Brad Raffensperger, says it is time for conspiracy theories on both sidesof the aisle to stop.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE:  All this talk of astolen election, whether it's Stacey Abrams or the president of the UnitedStates, is hurting our state.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE:  Georgia's secretary of state is trying to instill voter confidenceas the Peach State heads towards January five run-offs for both ofGeorgia's U.S. Senate seats.Last night, Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler debated Democratic challengerRaphael Warnock on largely national talking points, including COVID-19 andthe economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA):  In your writings and your teachings, you haverepeatedly praised Marxism and the redistribution of income.Can you hear and now for all Georgians renounce socialism and Marxism?REV. DR. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  Listen, Ibelieve in our free enterprise system. And my dad was a small businessowner.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE:  In a separate debate, Georgia's other Republican Senator DavidPerdue chose not to participate, so he was represented by an empty podium,as his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, fielded questions alone.And today is the deadline for new voters to register in time for thoseJanuary 5 Senate run-offs. They have just minutes if they're going toregister in person, close of business at facilities like the one you seebehind me. And they have until midnight if they're registering online --Neil.CAVUTO:  Jonathan Serrie, thank you very much, my friend.I want to go to Lee Carter on this, GOP pollster, very good read of thepublic sentiment.Lee, I just wanted to step back from this. This is a run-off election. Itdoesn't get quite the attention or maybe the number of voters, for example,that a general election might. So, who does that help or hurt in Georgiaright now if it's a smaller crowd?LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER:  You know, I think that this is a littlebit different than what we would usually see in a run-off election, in thatall eyes are on Georgia.And I think the folks in Georgia really know what's at stake here. I mean,this is control of the Senate. That means that if -- whatever happensthere, then, if the Democrats win the Senate, then they will have theHouse, the Senate, the executive branch, and that really is going to changethe courts.Historically, Georgia is not a left-leaning state. It now seems to be very,very split. And let's not forget that this election was won, Joe Biden wonGeorgia by 12,000 votes. Every vote here is going to count.When you look at the margins that we're playing at here it is so, so, sovery close. You look at the Perdue race, Perdue won by a very narrow marginin the general election before the run-off. He would have 49.7 percent ofvotes. He was so close to not having to have a run-off.And when you look at Loeffler Warnock, that's also very, very close, verydifferent race there. But, at the end of the day, I think that we're goingto see much greater turnout than you would usually see in a specialelection because everyone there knows what is at stake.CAVUTO:  Did the president help or hurt the Republican candidates' causewith his rally this weekend?CARTER:  You know, it's a really, really fair question. I think he helps.And here's why. I think the fact that he went down there, and really showedthat the votes count, that Georgia matters is going to matter to Trumpsupporters, who otherwise are feeling very, very disenfranchised at thismoment.The bottom line is this; 75 percent of Republican voters feel like theelection was rigged, the votes were not counted. And so when you feel likethat, are you going to be likely to go out there and vote? I think the factthat Donald Trump went down there, gave the people of Georgia his supportand hope again, showed how important their votes were means that they'regoing to be more likely to show up on January 5, and they're going to vote.If he did not do this, if he did not energize his base, they might verywell have stayed home. And that could have cost the Republicans theelection there in Georgia. So I think it was a really, really importantmove for him to do.You might disagree with the content of his speech. A lot of people can notunderstand what's going on with his claims of voter fraud. And that's aseparate issue. But I think to energize those folks he most needed toenergize, he absolutely had to go there. And he did exactly what he neededto do.CAVUTO:  But, if you're claiming the vote was rigged, as he did, what wouldmake you want to vote in the run-off election?CARTER:  I mean, that's the really big question, right?But I think the fact that he went out there, got people excited about it,talked about how important it was, and really made it about almost aloyalty to him to show up, I think that's going to help people really see,get out there and do it.And I think, if he hadn't, I think that the question really would have beenthere, then you just feel totally demoralized. And so it's -- this is sortof a catch-22 situation. If you have got a bunch of folks who feel liketheir votes aren't going to be counted properly, are they going to go outthere and vote?They're certainly not going to answer pollsters in the right way. They'recertainly not going to trust institutions in this moment. But I do believethat they are very, very loyal to the president and to the Republican Partyin this moment.I also think that's why we haven't seen more Republicans take a stand andrecognize that Joe Biden is, in fact, the president-elect. And so it's areally, really complicated hand that they're playing right now. They needevery single vote to count.CAVUTO:  Yes.CARTER:  At the same time, you have got a lot of conservatives who areconcerned about what the president is saying. A lot of conservatives don'tagree necessarily that the votes were stolen, agree with voter fraud.CAVUTO:  OK.CARTER:  And you have got to get those people to come out to the polls aswell. So I think it's really really important that every vote counts.And I think Loeffler's performance last night might have been lackluster,but the criticism of her today actually, I think, is going to energize morepeople to go out there and vote as well.CAVUTO:  All right, we will see, I guess, on January 5.All right, Lee Carter, thank you very, very much.CARTER:  Thanks so much.CAVUTO:  In the meantime, stimulus is looking like I wouldn't say a donedeal, but a closer-than-ever-thought-possible deal.Where the differences remain and whether they can iron those differencesout -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, we are getting word right now from president-elect JoeBiden that he could announce his pick for U.S. defense secretary on Friday,not a gimme, but that Reuters is reporting at least that's the goal, andthat he could name his attorney general as soon as this week, presumablybefore Friday.We will keep you posted on that, as he rapidly begins to assemble his teamto take over on January 20 of next yearTo Mike Emanuel in Washington right now on things that are being puttogether by the lame-duck session of Congress before the president-electtakes over. And that is when it comes to stimulus, which is suddenlylooking, well, more stimulating, or at least more promising.What do you know, Mike?(LAUGHTER)MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, goodafternoon.One of the top Senate Democrats sounds hopeful heading into a new week. Buthe says the key to getting this done is Senate Majority Leader MitchMcConnell allowing the Senate to vote on a bipartisan $908 billion package.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL):  Well, my -- my prayers will be answered if itdoes.But we have got a few remaining issues. I think we can work them out. And,if we can and bring this forward, I just hope that Senator McConnell willlet us bring this matter to the floor as quickly as possible. We have a lotof work to do and just a few days to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  But compared to the $2 trillion-plus package Speaker Nancy Pelosiwas seeking or the $1.8 trillion package that Treasury Secretary SteveMnuchin was negotiating with her before the election, this is a muchsmaller agreement, and at this point doesn't have direct payments to theAmerican people.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  This is not a stimulus bill. It is a reliefbill.And it's something for the next three to four months to help those ingreatest need. There may be a stimulus check, but that would be part of adifferent piece of legislation.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  The other major issue of the week, of course, is governmentfunding, due to expire Friday night.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer not taking any chances, tweeting a shorttime ago: "I am disappointed that we have not yet reached agreement ongovernment funding. The House will vote on Wednesday on a one week C.R.,"continuing resolution, "to keep government open while negotiationscontinue."Senator McConnell just said he expects the Senate would take up that one-week extension. That would allow congressional leaders more time to finishup a long-term funding deal and potentially button up a COVID reliefpackage before leaving town for Christmas -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Man, that still seems like a lot to do, buddy, but I guess theycan do it. We will see.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Hope springs eternalMichael Emanuel in Washington all of that.Well, you have seen a lot of her, this Angela Marsden, this restaurant andbar owner who really exemplifies the real struggle with just trying to stayin business. But it's what she showed that showed the hypocrisy of all ofthis, punishing her, not punishing someone else mere feet from her -- afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELA MARSDEN, OWNER, PINEAPPLE HILL SALOON & GRILL:  Everything I own isbeing taken away from me.And they set up a movie company right next to my outdoor patio.They have not given us money, and they have shut us down. We cannotsurvive. My staff cannot survive.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, now, you have seen a lot of Angela Marsden.And I know a lot of you are saying, well, why do they keep playing thisagain and again? Because I believe she represents, really in an iconic way,what's going on here, restaurants and other businesses forced to close,when, in her case, mere feet from her a film project that's behind apopular NBC show, they can keep their outdoor catering operations goingalive and well.It's that hypocrisy, that double standard that makes her case sointeresting and indicative of what's going on in states across the country.I raised that with her a little bit earlier on FOX Business. And she laidout how this is hurting a lot more than just folks like her. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARSDEN:  The community is going to be destroyed, just destroyed, fromunemployment, to suicide rates, to businesses being shuttered, to homelessdoubling, tripling.I mean, I'm not a politician. I'm not -- I don't have a big, fancy degree,but I can see and I can figure it out. So, why can't they figure it out?CAVUTO:  The double standard from politicians who say one thing and doquite another? Of course, it's gotten legion in your state.I'm just wondering, is that really what gets you angrier?MARSDEN:  I mean, that is nonstop.So, let's just say you're a small business owner like myself, and you seethe governor go out to French Laundry and spend $15,000 on a bar bill. Doyou know how much that would have helped a small business like mine in themiddle of a pandemic, when he's telling us not to, with a bunch of people.It's the never-ending, basically, shoving it in your face that we'redifferent, and we have privilege that you don't, just tells you it must besafe.I mean, Sheila -- Sheila Kuehl, her saying it was the most dangerous thingin the world to dine out and then going next door and dining out, do youknow what that did to every bar and restaurant owner in this town and howangry and how upset?We have worked -- you can go to my site, phsaloon. I did tables seven feetapart. My servers were wearing gloves, masks, face shields, takingtemperatures in 110 degrees in August.And, you know, I had to decide between, are they going to have a heatstroke or are going to -- or do I get in trouble because they're notwearing the plastic face mask?The double standard is outrageous. And if you put yourself in leadership,your heart has to be for the people.CAVUTO:  I have seen many videos provided by people whose business wasaffected by this.This was so powerful because you were revealing something of a doublestandard that few people were aware of right next door. I think that's whathit home for a lot of folks...MARSDEN:  Neil...CAVUTO:  And even for those who are worried about COVID-19, that's whatregistered. People just said, that, that isn't right.MARSDEN:  On Black Friday, I was so depressed.I thought, I wonder if anything's open? The mall was open. On Black Friday,after they shut me down, I went to the mall, no temperature check, noplastic face shields, no gloves. Anybody can try on any piece of clothingindoors that they want on Black Friday, after they shut us down.I mean, it started that morning, and it started inside me. But it was ahigher power. I -- just, what happened on Friday, I am still in a whirlwindfrom. And I -- that was just somehow the world -- I don't even know howthose circumstances -- they just came about.And it was nothing -- I didn't expect any of this or all this. But I doknow so many businesses and employees and people have said, Angela, pleasekeep talking to people. Please speak on our behalf, because we're not goingto make it.And so, yes, it's just -- it's been a whirlwind. And I am awed in the humanspirit. I have had people from England call me. I have had people fromAustralia call, from all over the country, because everybody is in this.Like, we are in this together.And it's not me against the production company or me against the massageparlors or the mall. It's just about people and us surviving this. It'slike the Titanic is going down. What are you going to do? Are you going tosit and play a fiddle, or are you going to get the lifeboats out and startthinking outside the box and save people?And that is literally how serious this is. And we will not know the effectsuntil -- like I said, in February, they are going to start pullingevictions. Do you know how many people, how many restaurant employees arenot paying their rent?And when your rent is over $1,000 a month, and it's not been paid for fivemonths, six months, 10 months, what are you going to do when they startevicting you or telling you to start making payments, with regular rent ontop of that, with no job to go to because there's not going to be any jobsleft?The businesses are going to be gone. It's such a big trickle-down issue.And why are -- I mean, the numbers going up, you guys knew in March. So,open up the empty hospitals. Bring the ship. Get space for the ICU beds.But you can't crush people. The average person in the lower class, themiddle class, you can't crush them to try to save others and pit us againsteach other. You can't do that and expect to come back to a city. Do you --I mean, I know it sounds desperate, but it's desperate.I mean, it's desperate. If I could show you the stories and the homeless,and I have -- Neil, I had a homeless man jump through my to-go window.CAVUTO:  Oh, man.MARSDEN:  I know a bartender whose son was just robbed in their front yardby gunpoint. People are desperate.And it is very, very, very serious. And these politicians, I don't know --I don't know how they're not seeing this or how they're not -- excuse me --how they're getting it. This is -- this is real lives that they'reaffecting.CAVUTO:  Angela, you didn't want to become, nor did you seek out becoming aspokesman for your industry.MARSDEN:  No, I did not.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But you are now. You are now, whether you like it or not.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO:  All right, I think you know why she has now become the mostwatched, scrutinized, played, and replayed restaurant owner in the world.Now find out the impact -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, our panel's response to this woman who has had anamazing following social media worldwide, among the most scrutinized,played and replayed business owner videos across the planet.Charles Payne with us, Gianno Caldwell with us, Kristen Hawn.Charles, what do you think?CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, "MAKING MONEY":  So heartbreaking, Neil.When I saw it over the weekend, I wanted to cry. And the way she did it,the way she juxtaposed the big NBC tent set aside for the elites and her,the hard-earned money that she poured in tens of thousands of her owndollars, doing what they told her to do to stay alive, to stay in survivalmode.And then as you were interviewing her today, news broke that she's notisolated, right? The National Restaurant Association, 500,000 restaurantsand every business are in -- quote -- "economic freefall"; 87 percent offull services are down 36 percent in sales; 59 percent of senior laborcosts go up; 58 percent still have furloughs, 17 percent of the industry,110,000 restaurants, probably permanently closed.She's not alone. To your point, she's a great representative. Now, willsomeone please listen?CAVUTO:  Well, I believe, Gianno, she hit a chord precisely for thatreason, the double standard, I don't think it was a deliberate move at thetime being, but the oddity of it being feet from her, a business has thesame setup outside as she does for a popular NBC program, they'reunaffected. She's very affected. What do you think?GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes. And you know what?I'm going to take you straight to the politicians, specifically the GavinNewsoms the a Nancy Pelosis of the world. The idea that Democrats careabout the poor and the working class is a farce. How do we know this?Pre-election, Nancy Pelosi was handed a deal by President Trump. They werenegotiating numbers. Nancy Pelosi, pressed by a TV host, said that shewould not do a deal because she did not want to give President Trump a win.Meanwhile, the middle-class and working-class people that work at theserestaurants don't have a job. They don't have a paycheck. There's over100,000 restaurants that aren't coming back. This is a problem on manylevels. Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans to step to the tableand make something happen, because people don't have time to waste. Theyneed it now.CAVUTO:  Kristen, I'm just wondering what an incoming President Biden does.He's talked about mask mandates and the rest, maybe keeping them on for 100days. He's not talked about shutting down the economy, doesn't want to dothat. But this kind of stuff is happening beneath the federal surfaceacross all the states as we speak.So, I'm wondering, what can he do about it?KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, I think that having -- having aplan on a federal level is what we have been lacking. And I think is whyyou see -- it's heartbreaking what's happening to restaurants across thiscountry.It's also incomprehensible that the Congress -- and I don't think this is atime to point fingers at either party -- it's incomprehensible it took themthis long to come to the table and even talk.So, I'm hopeful that Biden and his team will be able to provide some betterguidance at the federal level for business owners with regard to health andpeople's livelihoods.CALDWELL:  Wow. This isn't the time to point fingers.CAVUTO:  You know, the only thing about it, I look at the money side of it,Charlie, and the only thing that I see is that the restaurants are notwhere these spikes are happening.And so they're the first ones targeted. Your thoughts?PAYNE:  The restaurants, the elementary schools, it is so weird what'shappening.Of course, we see what's happening with women in the work force, thedepression, the suicide rates, the layoffs. They can't do it both. They tryto work from home and do house at home -- homeschool the kid.It's just really nuts, who and why they're locking certain areas down.There's no rhyme or reason to it. It's an abuse of power. And it's havingdevastating consequences.CAVUTO:  All right guys, I wish we had more time. I apologize for that.Some breaking news I want to pass along as well. We're getting from The NewYork Times a report that Pfizer may not be able to provide more of itsvaccine to the U.S. until at least June of next year, due to a commitmentto some other countries.Keep in mind that this has formally not been passed for emergency use bythe FDA. Other countries, like the United Kingdom, have already done so.Here comes "THE FIVE."Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
