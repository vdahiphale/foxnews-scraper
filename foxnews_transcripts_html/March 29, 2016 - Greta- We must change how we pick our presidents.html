Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: Some states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have way too much power in the primary process. Other states may too late in the process to make a real impact. How democratic is that? 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record." This must change - and I'm not talking about who gets chosen for president. But how? The process has become, well, ridiculous.
I may get banned from Iowa, and New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but these three states have way too much power in picking our president. When they vote, the field is large. But after these three states, candidates drop out, and that means these three states screen the field for the rest of us. Is that fair? Why do they get to do that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And what about states with the caucus system? If you live in one of those states - like Iowa, Nevada, or Minnesota - and you have to work or can't afford to pay for a babysitter for hours and hours, to take care of a sick child, you are out of luck. You can't caucus. Now, how democratic is that? And then, there is the loopy delegate system. Who can figure that one out? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I get why Donald Trump is miffed about Louisiana. He won Louisiana, but runner-up Ted Cruz may end receiving more Louisiana delegates. That does sound messed up. But those are the rules. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the Democrats, well they have different rules and just as loopy, and they have something extra, super delegates. The party elite created them to make sure the party gets the candidate the party elite wants just in case the Democratic citizens go rogue on them and want someone else. It's so messed up.
And then, of course, each state has different rules. Do I need to go on? No, you get it. Our system for picking a president is so messed up. Let's fix it before 2020. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
