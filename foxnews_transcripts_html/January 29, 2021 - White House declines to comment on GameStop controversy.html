BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm BretBaier.Breaking tonight, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says he is not to blamefor an alarming number of COVID deaths at nursing homes during thepandemic. The report as we told you yesterday by the state attorney generalsays Cuomo's figures were underreported by as much as 50 percent.Correspondent Bryan Llenas leads us off tonight with Cuomo on defense. Goodevening, Bryan.BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. New York GovernorAndrew Cuomo said it's a tragedy that thousands of people died of COVID-19in the state's nursing homes, but he did not take any personalresponsibility. He said no one was to blame, but in the same Bret, blamethe Trump administration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Everyone did the best they could. The StateDepartment of Health followed federal guidance. So, if you think there wasa mistake, then go talk to the federal government. It's not about pointingfingers of blame. It's that this became a political football.LLENAS (voice-over): At issue is the March 25th order from the Departmentof Health requiring nursing homes to admit COVID-19 infected patients justreleased from hospitals. Grieving families believe this order helps spreadthe virus that killed their loved ones.On Thursday, an investigative report by New York's Attorney Generalconfirmed the order "May have put residents at increased risk of harm insome facilities."Cuomo said the state order was simply following federal guidance. ButAdmiral Brett Giroir, former Assistant Secretary of Health says that's nottrue.ADM. BRETT GIROIR, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES:In no way was this federal government guidance that is just absolutelywrong, and he can't shift the blame, he has to own this one.LLENAS: Cuomo said it was the nursing homes' responsibility to alert thestate if they could not properly care for COVID patients. But overwhelmednursing homes say they were left to fend for themselves.STEPHEN HANSE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NEW YORK STATE HEALTH FACILITIESASSOCIATION: New York State and policymakers did not prioritize nursinghomes with equal priority as they did hospitals.LLENAS: New York's Department of Health now says the actual COVID-19 deathtoll among nursing home residents is nearly 13,000. 4,000 more than whatwas being reported. The state had not been including nursing home residentswho later died at hospitals.New York now has the most long-term care facility deaths nationwide. Still,the governor says there's nothing he could have done differently.CUOMO: What could have been done differently? What could have been donedifferently? It's still happening today.LLENAS: Daniel Arbeeny's 89-year-old father, Norman, died in a Brooklynnursing home.DANIEL ARBEENY, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK RESIDENT: Own it, say his sorry andstart reaching out to those who lost so much.(END VIDEO CLIP)LLENAS: And Daniel said watching Governor Cuomo today speak and not evenacknowledge that he made some mistakes or say I'm sorry was like relivingthe pain of losing his father, Bret.BAIER: Bryan Llenas in New York. Bryan, thanks. Panel on that in just aminute.Wall Street will take the weekend to recover from enormously hectic weekafter another big surge for GameStop stock today. It shot up more than 70percent in early trading after Robinhood reversed its decision to stophandling the stock.The market tumbled today, the Dow dropping 621, the S&P 500 fell 73, theNASDAQ lost 266. For the week, the Dow was off two percentage points, theS&P 500 dropped 1-1/10, the NASDAQ was up 1-1/2.The Securities and Exchange Commission is also trying to ease some fearspledging to protect investors. But how does that exactly work? And what didthey say about the people who fear that big Wall Street is really the onebeing protected?Kristina Partsinevelos of Fox Business joins us from New York. Goodevening, Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good evening.You have this tug of war that continues between Wall Street and retailtraders. We know the story, GameStop the company right behind me is at thecenter of it. Why? because big Wall Street hedge funds bet the stock pricewould fall. Retail investors rally together online and push the stock up,Wall Street lost billions.But you have Robinhood, the trading app, that a lot of these trader's use.They put restrictions on a lot of these volatile stocks yesterday. Today,they did ease some of those restrictions, but users were furious, listenin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVE PORTNOY, FOUNDER, BARSTOOL SPORTS: To intentionally crater the stockat the expense of all of your customers, well, that's criminal in my mind,that's flat out criminal.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS (voice-over): You have at least two separate class actioncomplaints against Robinhood. You also have Texas, as well as New York, theattorney generals that are looking into this in a probe if there's anymarket manipulation.And it's not just the trading apps, it's also social media coming into playwith this. With many social media platforms banning some of these stocktrading groups. Facebook vaguely tells us they closed down one of thesestock trading groups because it violated their community standards.And I'd also like to point out too, the SEC did put out a statement sayingthey are closely reviewing the actions taken by the regulated entities thatmay disadvantage investors.PARTSINEVELOS: We have everyone looking into this, GameStop share pricestill climbed 67 percent, just today alone.And interestingly enough, Robinhood did put a post online today, and theyare searching for someone based in D.C. that has senior professionalexperience on Capitol Hill and experienced a focus on regulatory andlegislative affairs. Interesting timing, Bret.BAIER: That may be a big job. Kristina, thank you.The Biden administration is taking a hands-off approach to the Wall Streetturmoil, at least publicly. So far, the president met with his economicteam today.White House Correspondent Kristin Fisher is here to tell us live from theNorth Lawn about all that. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. For the thirdday in a row, the White House is declining to weigh in on this story thathas consumed both Wall Street and mainstream, even though, President Bidenmet with his economic team this morning.And shortly before, I asked the White House press secretary if there wereany chance that the GameStop controversy was going to come up during thatmeeting and if not, why not?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, the focus of the meeting isabout the recovery plan, about the status of the economic recovery, aboutobviously the data that we saw yesterday. I'm sure they'll cover a range oftopics during that meeting. But that's not the focus.FISHER: Big story.PSAKI: I know it's a big story, but it doesn't -- you know, obviously the -- our focus and our big story is getting the American people back to work.FISHER (voice-over): So, the White House is focused like a laser on gettinga COVID relief deal through Congress. During this meeting in the OvalOffice with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, President Biden called forquick action on his $1.9 trillion plan.He says the risk is not doing too much, the risk is not doing enough. Andwhile his preference is to get bipartisan support, the president made itvery clear that the priority is simply getting it passed.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I support passing COVID reliefwith support from Republicans if we can get it, but the COVID relief has topass. There's no ifs, ands or buts. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER: So, there you have it, President Biden carrying on hispredecessor's tradition of chopper talk by Marine One.As for next week, we can expect more executive actions in orders onTuesday, this time on immigration, including a task force to reunitefamilies that were separated at the border during the Trump administration,Bret.BAIER: Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you.President Biden is trying to drum up support for his almost $2 trillionCOVID aid package as you heard there. Most Republicans and some Democratsare having a tough time swallowing the price tag.Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich tells us what that means tonight from CapitolHill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As President Biden isworking the phones to sell his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, VicePresident Kamala Harris is making their case in the media, local media inthe home states of two Democratic senators who helped kill a viable butpartisan path to pass the bill without Republican support.Harris hold one paper in Senator Kyrsten Sinema's home state of Arizona, ifwe don't pass this bill, I'm going to be very candid with you. We know morepeople are going to die.And in Senator Joe Manchin's home of West Virginia, the vice president alsodial-up multiple news outlets after Manchin joined Republicans saying thebill needs reworking. Especially over stimulus payments to high incomeAmericans, urging his party to work with the GOP.SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): Let's do that first showing that we can start outthe new Congress bipartisan.HEINRICH: Progressives are growing impatient, attacking members of bothparties for wasting time with bipartisan talks.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do these so-called moderates have in common? Threemillionaires, who think hardworking Americans don't need major supportduring these difficult times. Tell President Biden, don't give in.HEINRICH: But Republicans including one who got a phone call from thepresident don't see the urgency. Senator Rob Portman telling Fox it wasonly several weeks ago that we passed a $900 billion package for COVIDrelief on a bipartisan basis. It has yet to be implemented. And if we hadto get it done yesterday, why didn't they consult with us?House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is edging closer to yet another tool, budgetreconciliation which Presidents Obama and Trump both use to pass Obamacareand tax cuts.REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): We want it to be bipartisan, always. But wecan't surrender if they're not going to be doing that.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH: While moderates want to pare things down, progressives want evenmore. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal is pushing for a $3-4 trillioncoronavirus relief package and Ilhan Omar called for recurring monthly$2,000 checks, Bret.BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich live on Capitol Hill. Jacqui, thanks. Regulators inthe European Union have authorized the AstraZeneca vaccine for use there.The E.U. has taken criticism for not moving fast enough to get its peopleinoculated.Here in the U.S., there is also encouraging word from another drug makerabout its single dose vaccine. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie tells ustonight from Atlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Today, Johnson & Johnson announcedits experimental vaccine. It's 66 percent effective in blocking moderate tosevere COVID-19 and had an 85 percent success rate in blocking the mostserious symptoms of the disease.Although, less effective than current vaccines, Johnson & Johnson'scandidate can be stored at higher temperatures and requires only one shot,producing protection against the severest forms of the disease within sevento 10 days.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: In fact, in the study, including in the South African isolate,there were essentially no hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccine group,whereas in the placebo group, there were.SERRIE: Federal health officials are concerned about a highly transmissiblestrain first detected in South Africa that has now been confirmed in twopatients in South Carolina.DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CDC: These cases were identified indifferent parts of the state and not believed to be epidemiologicallylinked. They each did not have any travel history.SERRIE: Which most likely means the variant has already been spreading inthe community. Current vaccines still protect against the South Africanstrain although not as well. Researchers are working on a vaccine boost incase new mutations develop resistance to the current shots.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE: Federal health officials say the faster Americans get vaccinated,the less time the coronavirus will have for further mutations.In the meantime, they are urging everyone to mask up, Bret.BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.One of the major issues surrounding the pandemic continues to be whetherstudents and teachers should be back in the classroom in-person.Tonight, Chief Correspondent Jonathan Hunt takes a closer look from SantaMonica, California.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI: The president wants to not only reopen schools; he wants the schoolsto stay open.JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Few parents orteachers argue with that goal for reopening schools. But there is intensedisagreement over how it can be achieved. Children may be less susceptibleto COVID-19.WALENSKY: The children not only have decreased rates of symptoms but havedecreased rates of transmissibility.HUNT: But many teachers worry about returning to the classroom before theyare vaccinated.In California, that's left Governor Gavin Newsom frustrated and saying on acall with the Association of California School Administrators "If we waitfor the perfect, we might as well just pack it up and just be honest withfolks that we're not going to open for in-person instruction this schoolyear."But in a letter to Newsom, the California Teachers Association warnedagainst shortcuts to reopen. And said, "The virus is in charge right nowand it does not own a calendar. We cannot just pick an artificial calendardate and expect to flip a switch on reopening every school for in-personinstruction."Teachers in Massachusetts are concerned that the state plans to vaccinatepeople over 65 before many essential workers, including K to 12 teachers.MERRIE NAJIMY, PRESIDENT, MASSACHUSETTS TEACHER ASSOCIATION: The governorpays lip service to getting students back in school, but his decision todayis delaying a safe return by weeks if not months.HUNT: And in Chicago, a showdown looms Monday with the public schools chiefinsisting in-person classes will resume then for tens of thousands ofstudents, even as many teachers say they simply won't show up.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUNT: So, the hopes and fears over school reopening seemed to hang as doesso much else on the availability of vaccines. Job number one for PresidentBiden, Bret.BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: The State Department of Health followed federal guidance. So, if youthink there was a mistake, then go talk to the federal government.I understand, maybe the instinct to blame or to find some relief for thepain that you're feeling? Why COVID? Why did God do this? I don't know.GIROIR: The one place you don't send infected patients back to is nursinghomes. There were numerous other choices that were better. In fact, everychoice would have been better than that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: For patient's families that press conference by New York GovernorAndrew Cuomo, they said was very painful. Many news organizations wrote itup differently. The New York Post wrote deadly lies scathing A.G. reportsays nursing home COVID deaths massively underreported. Team Cuomo hasfailed on both the transparency and action fronts from the pandemic start,repeatedly opting instead for various whitewashes.Chris Cillizza with CNN also had kind of a scathing assessment of the NewYork governor's performance, or at least semi-scathing.Let's bring in our panel. Jeff Mason, White House correspondent forReuters. Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at The WallStreet Journal. And Byron York, chief political correspondent of theWashington Examiner.Panel, we'll start there. Kimberley, listen, those families who have beenfighting this battle to kind of say this happened despite the New Yorkauthorities saying it didn't, feel vindicated, but then, listen to thepress conference and not so much.KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it was a remarkable pressconference. It was really something to hear Andrew Cuomo say, oh well, noone's really to blame. And then turn around and blame it on the federalgovernment. Turn around and blame it on the nursing homes themselves.And by the way, his point about federal guidance doesn't even make anyintellectual sense. If that was the guidance that gone out, you would haveseen this happening across the country instead it was a New York problem.So, they have a reason to be very angry, especially because it is ademocratic attorney general who put out this report in a democratic state.He can't claim this is his opponents going after him.BAIER: Right. Jeff, there is an instinct, I think, among some whenPresident Trump was in office that it was all focused-on President Trump.And there was a lot of laudatory coverage of the governor that seems tohave a second look now.JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: It does and his reaction ormis performance today was a contrast with what many people -- I think, hewatched Governor Cuomo in the early days of the -- of the pandemic saw. Andit was unusual, I think, to see that, and certainly underscores the factthat mistakes have been made with regard to this pandemic and treatment ofthe virus on a, shall we say, bipartisan basis.BAIER: Yes, and I mentioned Chris Cillizza, Byron, and I was kind oftongue-in-cheek, saying he was scathing. Here's a part of it. He says, "IfDonald Trump was seen as the public face of the failed government responseto the coronavirus pandemic, Andrew Cuomo was seen by some as the opposite.Well, it turns out that all the hype obscured a troubling reality." Seemslike there is a -- this realization that is hitting.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, this is a stunning reality.Remember, in March of last year when president say -- President Trump saidhe didn't feel any responsibility -- take any responsibility for this,there was an uproar. And basically, Andrew Cuomo who's said the same thing,and as Kim pointed out, this is a democratic attorney general's report.The attorney general race in New York State was basically a race to see whocould be the most anti-Trump. And Letitia James, the current attorneygeneral won that race. So, it's very -- it's very unlikely that she'd bedoing anything to support the Trump administration.And one last thing, what's striking in all this is that Cuomo keeps a highapproval rating in New York State. A new Siena poll asked specifically forjob approval of Cuomo's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, 63 percentapproval among Democrats 79 approval. It's really difficult for some of usto understand.BAIER: This story gets a lot of passion from viewers and obviously thefamilies involved. The other thing that really gets a lot of viewer e-mail,Kimberley, is the question of schools, and the going back, not going back,what exactly is happening. Dr. Anthony Fauci talking about the going backto school battle.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAUCI: The president is taking very seriously the issue both from thestudent standpoint and from the teacher standpoint. And he really wants toand believes that the schools need to reopen in the next 100 days,essentially, all the K-8 schools within 100 days. That's the goal.That may not happen because there may be mitigating circumstances. But whathe really wants to do is everything within his power to help get to that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: I guess there's a sense that the White House chief of staff RonKlain saying the teachers unions have a point because there's not enoughmoney to deal with all of this in public schools, they're trying to hang iton the COVID bill right now. But obviously, a number of private schoolsaround the country are doing it.STRASSEL: Well, not just private schools, public schools. My kids have beenin schools since August. They all go in -- for in school not remotelearning, but in-person learning, and there haven't been any issues. Andthat's what parents are seeing across the country at this point.And I think there's being this moment of realization which is that thereare districts that have been making this work from the start. And then, theplaces and they're really beginning to stand out that aren't refusing to goback to school a day after day are all big cities that are controlled byteachers' unions.We've already spent $50 billion out there on schools, Bret, and a lot ofschools are making it work. A lot of parents are beginning to say why nothours and really 100 days? Because at that point, you might as well noteven open school this year.BAIER: Yes. Jeff, I have 15 seconds. A little different covering the Bidenadministration.MASON: It is different, yes, on many levels. What I would say just quicklythough about education is President Biden wants the schools to be open. Andthat is -- that is a similarity between him and President Trump. He justsees it as something that requires some money, and that's why they'repushing really hard for this coronavirus relief package.BAIER: And how they get that is really a big question. Panel, we'll see alittle bit later in the show.Up next, our "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO" segment with new developments in themurder of American journalist Daniel Pearl.And later, what has four legs, a really sensitive nose, and can help detectcoronavirus?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good girl.

And avideo of the brutal execution released on the Internet. Six months on, aPakistani court convicted Omar Sheikh, a British-born Pakistani ofkidnapping, terrorism, and murder. And he was sentenced to death. Threeothers were given life in prison.But on Thursday, the country's Supreme Court ordered their release, andcleared them of wrongdoing, saying only that it would explain its reasoningat a later date.The White House has called the decision an outrage.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We're committed to securing justicefor Daniel Pearl's family and holding terrorist accountable for theirheinous crimes.HALL: Daniel Pearl was 38. His senseless death only deepened U.S. resolveto fight terrorism.(END VIDEO CLIP)HALL: For the moment, Sheikh is still in detention in Pakistan. And theU.S. government is looking at legal options to bring him to America to facetrial, hoping to secure justice for Daniel Pearl and his family. Bret?BAIER: Benjamin Hall at London.

Andby the way, it's not enough just to be like, oh, we're going to slap you onthe wrist and give you a fine. Somebody has to go to jail for this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: What a week on Wall Street. But the story about GameStop and otherstocks, the squeeze was on the big Wall Street investors. I think we've allexplained that over the last couple of days. These two stocks, GameStop andAMC up 67 and 53 percent. The Dow taking a wild ride today, and who knowswhat next week holds in this current environment.We're back with the panel. Kimberley, this is quite something to watch, andat the evolution of the story and how Wall Street kind of defends itself inthis moment.KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it's also really fascinatingbecause it's unprecedented. And you have both sides claiming manipulation.You have these hedge funds saying these small investors banded together toincorrectly drive up the price. You have the retail investors saying thatRobinhood incorrectly stopped them at the behest of hedge funds. And it'sgoing to take a while to sort this out, so over to the SEC.BAIER: But Jeff, it seems like the Biden administration is taking aHeisman, a stiff arm away from this issue broadly.JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: Yes. And you asked meearlier how it's different at the White House. This is one of the examples.President Trump, and perhaps a President Trump spokesperson would haveengaged on that. But that was unusual during the Trump years, that he wouldtalk about the dollar, that he would talk about the stock market. Mostpresidents and people who represent them keep that kind of a thing at anarm's length and refer to the treasury secretary, who also most likelywon't say anything either. That's what Jen Psaki has done all week, theWhite House press secretary, and that is on some level a return to normalcypolitically.BAIER: Yes. Another thing that's different is the executive orders andexecutive actions. Take a look at these numbers. This is just in the first10 days, 25 executive orders. This doesn't include the executive actionswhich actually add up to more than that. And you see the recentpredecessors in the first 10 days. A lot of criticism on Capitol Hill aboutthis. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RON JOHNSON, (R-WI): He doesn't need this on it. He's using his pen andphone, I guess. He's just flooding the zone. And he's just satisfying everydesire of the radical left wing of his party.SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO): It's just an attempt to basically govern thecountry by executive fiat. It's breathtaking what he is trying to do onsubstance. It's breathtaking that he's trying to do it without anydemocratic debate or legislation.SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR): He's gone way too far in some of these executiveorders. He preached unity last Wednesday from the inaugural platform. Butwhy don't we go ask some of those 11,000 blue-collar workers on theKeystone pipeline if they think it was unifying to cancel their jobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So Byron, that's three Republican senators. Bu this is "The New YorkTimes" this week, "Ease up on the executive actions, Joe. President Bidenis right to not let his agenda be held hostage, but legislating throughCongress is a better path." Thoughts?BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": In thepast, a president would resort to executive action when he couldn't get hispolicy preference through Congress. And now President Biden is just doingit all immediately, certainly satisfying a lot of the Democratic base thatwas very hungry to overturn everything Donald Trump did.We've only seen one real pushback from the courts so far, and that was thepresident's executive action halting almost all deportations. A court inTexas, a single judge said no, you can't do it, and put an end to that.The question is, will Republicans across the country start challengingthese executive actions the way that so many Democrats did to so many ofPresident Trump's executive actions.BAIER: And the other question is, if you're preaching unity and you'retrying to court Republicans, whether this is the right move to try to dothat right off the bat. Let's go to Winners and Losers. Kimberley, firstwinner then loser?STRASSEL: My winners this week are actually two, Senators Joe Manchin andKyrsten Sinema, for very bravely, in my mind, saying that they would notvote to kill the legislative filibuster. If you do believe inbipartisanship, which they say they do, that is the way to go ahead.My loser, the San Francisco school board, which cannot manage to educateits kids, but did have time this week to vote to strip 44 schools of theirnames, such as Washington, Jefferson, and even Dianne Feinstein.BAIER: Jeff, winner and loser?MASON: My winner is one that I don't think anyone is going to disagree with-- Champ and Major, President Biden's two dogs now in pretty fancy digs atthe White House. So it sounds like a pretty nice place, especially for somerescue dogs, which is pretty cool.On the losers' side, I went with the South African variant of the virus,which I also don't think anyone would disagree with. That's just a loserfor everyone.BAIER: Yes. Byron, winner and loser, quickly?YORK: Apropos our earlier discussion, my winner is anybody who boughtGameStop stock at $5 a share. That's what it was last year, and now it's$325. The trick is, when to get out. You don't want to be the last one atthat party.And my loser is Washington, D.C., and everybody who visits it after theCapitol police floated the idea of making permanent the huge fence andrazor wire around the capitol. A lot of bipartisan opposition.BAIER: To your winner -- I have a winner -- 10-year-old San Antonio boyJaydyn Carr. His mother got him $60 in GameStop stock for a gift. It turnedinto $3,200. He was on the Charles Payne show this morning. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the time, I didn't know what it was, but I didn'tknow it was deeply. So I just kept it like, as an achievement. It was agift for Kwanzaa.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: It was a gift, and he says he's going to use it on college. Verycool. Panel, thank you.When we come back, "Notable Quotables."(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Finally tonight, it is Friday. That means "Notable Quotables."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The markets just naturally has to shake off all ofthis irrational exuberance.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uninstall Robinhood. Get it off your phone.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They don't want you to win because they want to savetheir yachts, their mansions, and everything else they have.SEN. RAND PAUL, (R-KY): Impeaching a former president, a private citizen,is the antithesis of unity.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to take a stand and have a fine line aboutwhat is acceptable for a president to do or not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's my little buddy and she's going to sit here withme while you finish up.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Sounds like a magical creature.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, what did you talk to Vladimir Putinabout?JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm the one that had to look these people in the eye andtell them they didn't have a job anymore.JOHN KERRY, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL CLIMATE ENVOY: The fastest growing job inthe United States before COVID was solar power technician. The same peoplecan do those jobs.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK: Incompetent government kills people.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't want to call it a win. I just want to call itmaybe some justice.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a great disappointment, and for now remotelearning for all students will continue.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People like me and a line of other people out there whowill gladly take your seat and figure it out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A disruption of a strike to these vulnerable childrenis traumatizing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need a break from my mom.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, does that not make you smile?ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
