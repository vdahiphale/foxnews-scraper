SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity." This is a Fox News Alert. We are now witnessing the collapse of the liberal mainstream media right here in America. Sharyl Attkisson, Geraldo Rivera will have reaction tonight. 
Also, Sara Carter will join us, an explosive new report about the interim FBI director. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, CNN leading the way in the rampant decay of the liberal mainstream media. And tonight, I have a message for CNN's president, Jeff Zucker. That's tonight's "Opening Monologue," Jeff. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right, history is literally happening right in front of our eyes. We have the liberal destroy Trump mainstream media is now in a freefall and on the brink of complete and total collapse. That's not an overstatement, it's not hyperbole. Now, these propagandists and champions of fake news continue to be exposed day after day, and CNN is leading the way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I'm going to share my advice for the head of CNN, their chief of fake news and propaganda news, Jeff Zucker, in just a minute. Jeff, I'm trying to save your career. 
But first, let me explain how one of the biggest anti-Trump networks has lost all their credibility and can no longer be trusted by you, the American people.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, at this point, we should put CNN six feet -- you see right there -- underground for repeatedly spreading lies, propaganda, black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, and for viciously trying to take down this president. 
Now, let's just look at some of the network's many controversies and scandals, scandals they've had there. There's the image of CNN's former New Year's Eve co-host. Really, it's so graphic, every time we show you, we have to put a warning on the screen. Kathy Griffin posing like an ISIS fighter -- look at how despicable that it is -- with a bloody severed head of a Trump look-alike. Pretty disgusting. And after that vile photo shoot, CNN then fired Griffin. Fair enough.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then earlier this month, CNN cut ties -- remember Reza Aslan? That's the unhinged liberal responsible for disturbing tweets like this one, quote, "This 'POS'" -- you know what it is -- "is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency, he's an embarrassment to humankind." Oh, that's fair and balanced.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, kicking unhinged liberal hosts to the curb is just the beginning of CNN's massive credibility crisis. CNN has been routinely humiliated for pushing their fake news. Remember, earlier this week, three so-called journalists allegedly resigned -- I don't believe that -- after the outlet had to retract a completely made-up story about a Trump ally, a friend of mine, Anthony Scaramucci, which claimed that Anthony was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. 
Now, CNN and the rest of the destroy Trump media -- they have tried to play it off, "Oh, it's just an honest mistake," and say that CNN did the right thing. They retracted the story. 
But according to an explosive report in The New York Post, it appears that CNN may have been forced to correct the fake news hit piece. Take a look at this headline. "CNN faced $100 million lawsuit over botched Russia story." Now, according to The Post, CNN quickly retracted the story. Why? Anthony Scaramucci threatened a massive libel lawsuit.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, of course, that example is not the only time CNN has gotten a story completely wrong. Let's go back -- let's stay right there in the month of June. June 16th, the network had to delete a tweet and issue a correction for saying, "Oh, only Democrats were praying before the congressional baseball game," remember, after Steve Scalise was shot in the assassination attempt. And the day before that, well, CNN senior unhinged White House correspondent Jim Acosta, he tweeted and then deleted his ridiculous claim that President Trump didn't visit Congressman Steve Scalise in the hospital. Not true.
And also earlier this month, the head of the former FBI Director James Comey and his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, CNN had to alter a report that said that Comey would contradict President Trump's statements about not being under investigation by the FBI. Wrong!
The embarrassment for CNN doesn't even end there. Now, take a look at the times CNN covered the president's so-called eating habits. These are really, really hard-hitting investigative reports that really matter to all the Americans in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force and those that can't buy a house. This matters to them. Take a look.

HANNITY: Wow, such hard-hitting news. Which brings us to CNN's political commentator, yes, the one and only Van Jones. Remember? Former Obama administration official constantly smearing and slandering the president. Now, tonight, it appears Van Jones may have some explaining to do. Why? James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, has now released a new undercover video. It features Van Jones. In the tape, he appears to admit that there's nothing to back up the left's Russia collusion narrative that has been going on 11 months!

They're standing by their producer, which I'm glad this guy's not going to get fired. They didn't mention anything about Zucker's, "Let's get back to Russia," comments. 
Let's be clear tonight. Zucker is leading all the fake new circus at CNN. And as we said last night, all the blame for what is happening at CNN should be on his shoulders. Now, he's positioned his network to be one of the mainstream media leaders in trying to take down the president, this anti-Trump hate. He needs to be held accountable. 
And tonight, I'm going to do Jeff Zucker a favor. Hey, Jeff, you want to restore any sense of credibility at your network, you need to stop trying to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump and be on a jihad agenda to attack. And if you're willing to lie and collude to do that -- really? Where are your ethics?

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, here's my advice, Jeff. Start focusing on the six massive scandals that should really be investigated but are not being reported by your network. James Comey admitting under oath that he had his friend leak a memo to The New York Times, hoping it would lead to a special counsel. By the way, Jeff, look into the Records Act that might've been violated. That's a felony.
And by the way, also, there's former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch possibly obstructing justice. How? Interfering in the Clinton email investigation. Now, senators are starting to look into that. Jeff, I suggest that you and your network may want to do some investigative work here. 
Now, Comey testified that Lynch told him to call the Clinton email investigation not an investigation, a "matter," and he listened! And don't forget the 40-minute tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just says before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then, of course, next is Hillary Clinton's many, many scandals. Jeff, there's a lot of smoke and fire here, and there's now evidence to suggest that the original server investigation was, in fact, compromised.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus, there's also the Clinton Russia collusion story. That's the Uranium One deal. We had 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons -- she signs off a waiver. It goes to Vladimir Putin and Russia. And meanwhile, people involved in the deal are kicking back millions to the Clinton Foundation. Jeff, that's called pay- to-play. And by the way, destroying or mishandling classified information, those are both felonies.
And by the way, President Obama also has a serious Russia problem. Jeff, you might want to investigate this. Remember? After learning -- he learned in August of 2016 Russia was trying to meddle in our presidential election. Why didn't he do anything?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, look at Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. No matter how you feel about the guy, the only law we know that has been broken in this Russia collusion story is that they surveilled, unmasked, and then leaked intelligence on General Flynn! That's a violation of the Espionage Act.
And finally, there's a special counsel. His name is Robert Mueller. Look at the glaring potentially illegal conflicts of interest here. Mueller's BFF is Jeff -- James Comey. Members of the team that Mueller is hiring have donated to Obama and Clinton! That's called a conflict of interest. And one of the attorneys he's hired actually represented the Clinton Foundation! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So Jeff, these are six stories you at CNN, and frankly, all of you in the left-wing destroy Trump media should actually be covering instead of black helicopter theories, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know what? Maybe it's time to step up and instead of publishing fake, misleading, flat-out false news, maybe it's time to tell the American people the truth. Do some real reporting.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, former Governor Palin -- she's now suing the New York Times for an op- ed that was published after the shooting of Congressman Scalise. The Times editorial board incorrectly linked Palin's rhetoric to the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Now, the New York Times did later issue a correction. And also, today, we learned that Vice News had to retract two stories about President Trump. This never ends!
Here with reaction, the author of the brand-new book -- it's called "The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives, Fake News Control What You See, What You Think and How You Vote," the anchor of "Full Measure" on the Sinclair network, Sharyl Attkisson, and Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We color coordinated.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: Why do I expect that right out of your mouth? Forget the important monologue I just did.
RIVERA: That was an excellent monologue. And I thought that it was comprehensive and very powerful. I have two minor additions, if I may.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
HANNITY: Please.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RIVERA: To me, the real story is an atmosphere of unremitting hostility. And the specificity of your monologue really lays that bare. There is an underlying -- whether it's hatred, whatever, there's a mission to destroy the 45th president of United States.
Two little things happened today that I think are significant. Both got extensive coverage on CNN and the other networks. One was the phone call he placed to the Irish leader, and he's talking to the Irish head of government. And he calls over an Irish reporter who happens to be female and says...
HANNITY: You're talking about my people... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: ... she has a nice -- she has a nice smile.
HANNITY: Yes.
RIVERA: He was immediately attacked as a chauvinistic pig, as totally incorrect. How dare he? And it dominated -- it was 10 minutes on CNN. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: It was in the Oval Office. I saw it.
RIVERA: It was so nothing! It was so nothing. I mean, he's...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: He was being polite, and she's even recording it! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RIVERA: The other thing that happened was the story about the fake Time magazine news cover in I guess a half a dozen of the Trump golf clubs, golf courses. He has this picture, and it's photoshopped. It's not a real Time magazine cover.
HANNITY: Right.
RIVERA: And they went on -- (INAUDIBLE) look at this narcissist. Look, at this egotist. How dare he do this? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Guess what? Trump has been on the cover of Time magazine legitimately 14 times! He could have used any of -- (INAUDIBLE) four words...
HANNITY: How many times have you been on?
RIVERA: I've been on Newsweek, never Time.
HANNITY: OK.
RIVERA: For when my nose got broken. But I mean, he could have used any of -- I mean, for the story to have such import, when in fact, he could've easily shown any one of those real covers, shows how much animosity there is.
HANNITY: Hatred.
RIVERA: How much even the slightest little wrinkle is immediately seized. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You paid a price because your network at the time, CBS, wouldn't let you report on many of the issues you were trying to report on involving President Obama. You were really -- do you agree with Geraldo, A, on the hatred -- and explain what you mean, how it literally -- you know, you talk about here shady political operatives and fake news control what Americans are seeing, thinking and how they're voting. That's profound!
SHARYL ATTKISSON, AUTHOR, "SMEAR": I kind of dissect this process. How did we get to the point where the news could be influenced to such a degree. I worked at CNN in 1990 to '93, and I can tell you it wasn't the CNN that you've described today or that you've talked about. So how did we get here?
And by taking apart decades of what I call the smear industry, which are propaganda firms, PR firms, LLCs, non-profits, opposition research groups, which have grown into a huge industry, and they've understood how to get under the curtain at news organizations and say the right things, even get hired there, or write things that -- as reporter that will be printed in the press, even though these are simply paid-for partisan narratives -- it's pretty disturbing.
And one of the quotes I got from one of the smear operators I interviewed is, Everything that you see, you should suspect has been put there for a reason, every image and every narrative. Someone wants you to see it and has spent a lot of money sometimes to do that.
HANNITY: Both of you agree what I'm saying about Zucker, that -- and this is what I don't understand about Time-Warner. And they've got shareholders. But they are allowing him to destroy their brand and advance what is clearly a personal agenda that he has against the president, right?
RIVERA: Well, I think that the forced resignation of the three journalists -- and they were -- the -- these were not lightweights...
HANNITY: By the way, they use fake news -- they said they resigned. Bull! They didn't resign! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RIVERA: They were forced resignations, which is not an uncommon...
HANNITY: Fake news to cover fake news! Great.
RIVERA: Well, rather than brand them as having been fired and therefore making the rest of their lives...
HANNITY: You're so -- you always find a way to be nice.
RIVERA: I just want to be nice. And also, I want to be nice to Zucker. What happened here, it seems to me, is they were so shocked by the victory of Donald Trump. It was so -- it took everyone...
HANNITY: Traumatic.
RIVERA: It took everyone by such surprise that they never recovered -- they never recovered their balance. They have some fine reporters, even in their White House team. Sean rolled his eyes! You missed it. I actually saw the whites of his eyes as he rolled his eyes!

        }
      
HANNITY: Oh, you're giving my secrets.
RIVERA: But they have a personal agenda now. They have -- it's almost as if they have...
HANNITY: Personal, hate!
RIVERA: They have to show that they were right, right along, and that he's an illegitimate president. I really think it's very lamentable.
HANNITY: I got to get Sharyl real quick.
ATTKISSON: As the campaign went so disastrously wrong for those who predicted Trump couldn't do it -- by the way, I said I thought Trump was going to be president months and months before -- you did, too...
HANNITY: So did Geraldo!

        }
      
ATTKISSON: ... because some of us were listening to ordinary people and looking deeper into the polls and not just buying into what sounded like narrative. 
But the question was, after the election, would the media self-reflect and self-correct. And instead, I think they've doubled down, dug in their heels, and we've really done a disservice to ourselves.
RIVERA: That's why this Russia thing has metastasized...
HANNITY: Oh!
RIVERA: ... it's going nowhere...
HANNITY: Boomeranging now.
RIVERA: (INAUDIBLE) flog it and they'll flog it and they'll flog it

HANNITY: All right...
RIVERA: ... until it bursts in their face.
HANNITY: The book is awesome. I love the cover, too.
RIVERA: Yes, nice.
HANNITY: Yes, really nice. All right, congratulations.
ATTKISSON: Thank you.
HANNITY: And coming up, the acting FBI director is in real hot water tonight. Circa News has put out an explosive new report about Andrew McCabe. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett weigh in.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, we have a very important mini monologue tonight. We will expose the so-called conservative that works over at NBC who is now competing to be the biggest Trump hater on that network. Here's a hint. He's now practically begging for a job from Jeff Zucker. And by the way, like he once begged for a job here at Fox News.
And Dr. Gorka and much more tonight on this breaking news night.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." Tonight, another explosive story about the acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe, Circa News tonight reporting the FBI chief, McCabe, now faces three separate federal inquiries into his behavior. Now, the report details allegations into McCabe's behavior that range from sexual discrimination, improper political activity while McCabe was, in fact, a senior bureau executive. 
Joining us now with more, from Circanews.com, Sara Carter, Fox News anchor, Attorney Gregg Jarrett. As I read through your daily revelations here, Sara, I see an acting FBI director that's on a bubble and may not survive.
SARA CARTER, CIRCANEWS.COM: Yes, Sean, I know there's a lot of concern right now with senior lawmakers. They are looking into this, and I'm sure they're going to be asking the Department of Justice to answer questions about these investigations and where these investigations are now.
Just looking at the case on its face, I mean, not only was there Hatch Act violations, and we know there's a sexual discrimination suit still pending, but it was improper political campaign donations that they're looking at, as well, that were connected to Hillary Clinton... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: This to me seems to be...
CARTER: ... so I think...
HANNITY: ... the biggest problem. I mean, we don't know about the sexual allegations, harassment allegation. That will be adjudicated. But $700,000, his wife is in a race, he's involved in the Russia probe, and he is getting -- and his wife's getting the money from who? The Clintons' best friend, in part.
CARTER: That's right. That's right, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who at the time, remember, was also under investigation for his own campaign contributions, and that -- I mean, and that just kind of disappeared and went to the wayside. 
So there's a lot of questions here. There's a lot of conflicts of interest, a lot of political things happening on the back side that we don't know about. But I know, speaking to senior lawmakers, that they want answers to this and they want someone to look into it, and that would be the Department of Justice.
HANNITY: But if you look at everybody here, you got the deputy attorney general, Rosenstein, and his relationship with Comey, and the Mueller appointment is bad -- Comey's got issues with the Records Act, as you have been reporting...
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: ... and then Mueller is hiring Hillary Clinton's attorney and all these attorneys that donates seriously to Obama and Hillary? He's got to get out!
JARRETT: You can't make this up!
HANNITY: You can't make this up!
JARRETT: I mean, this stinks as bad as a sick oyster at low tide.
(LAUGHTER)
JARRETT: I mean, The stench of this is just awful. 
HANNITY: Is that what -- did you grow up on the water?
JARRETT: And you know, it all emanates from Hillary Clinton. She's like Pigpen in the comic strip Peanuts. Wherever she goes, whatever she does or says, she is engulfed in a cloud of dirt and scandal. And McCabe is the latest cloud of dirt. I mean, here he is overseeing the investigation into her multiple violations of the Espionage Act while at the same time, his wife is getting $675,000, truckloads of money...
HANNITY: I'm going to make a prediction.
JARRETT: ... from the Clintons' money man.
HANNITY: OK. So Comey is in trouble. We'll see where that goes. Lynch is in bigger trouble with obstruction of justice.
JARRETT: Oh, yes.
HANNITY: Obama now has to go under oath and answer questions. Why didn't you do anything if you knew that there was meddling by Russia in August? Then you got Mueller. He has to go. 
But I say, at the end of the day, the person that still has the most legal trouble -- that's the Uranium One deal, Russia kickbacks, pay-to-play, and we know she mishandled classified top secret special access program information and destroyed it! Those are felonies.
JARRETT: Right.
HANNITY: I still think Hillary will be indicted.
JARRETT: These are all reasons why they need to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Espionage Act, fresh eyes, re-examine the evidence. I mean, Comey himself laid out persuasive evidence of how she violated the law, and then in the same breath, said, Well, no reasonable prosecutor would ever bring that case. My goodness, you know, prosecutors everywhere would have been happy to bring such a strong case...
HANNITY: Hundred percent.
JARRETT: Yes, hundred percent.
HANNITY: You know, I'll go back to you. I keep talking about the boomerang effect. Are you confident, Sara, as I am, Russia-Trump collusion -- if there was anything, it's over now. I don't see anything coming out. They've been delving into this, and even the special counsel has now moved on to other issues, which is indicative that it's gone. But do you agree that Comey's issues, Obama now has to go under oath, Lynch obstruction issues, the Flynn case is still out there, Mueller's got conflict of interest issues and then Hillary.
Is there anything else? I see it all now going against the tide for the Democrats, and it's all come back to them.
CARTER: Yes. And to date, there is no absolutely evidence that there was any collusion with Russia with anyone in the Trump administration. And you're pointing out something that's very true, Sean. The pendulum has swung the other way, right?
So the pendulum has swung the other way, and I don't think that we are going to stop writing these stories. We see more and more information pouring out from sources. I think people feel emboldened now to tell the truth about what was going on. So it doesn't just stop here, and I think we'll be hearing from the Senate very soon when it comes to McCabe. And it wouldn't surprise me within the next few weeks if something changes on his part and his role...
HANNITY: Is it going to...
JARRETT: ... because what we have seen is that -- go ahead.
HANNITY: Has anybody in the race with McCabe's wife ever get $700,000 for that local race? I've never heard it before.
JARRETT: Yes. that had to set a record.
JARRETT: Well, it did. 
HANNITY: Yes, it -- yes, exactly.
JARRETT: it did. It did. The average -- actually, Sean, the average for a state senate race is about $50,000 to $60,000.
HANNITY: Oh, Terry McAuliffe stepping up for his good friend, the Clintons. No conflict of interest, though, that he's running and involved in the Russia probe. None at all! None whatsoever.
All right, this is only the beginning. Gregg, good to see you. Sara, great work, as always. You guys are killing it.
And coming up next on this breaking news edition tonight of "Hannity"...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Could Donald Trump be the end of CNN? What a legacy that would be!

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Marianne Rafferty. 
The U.S. implementing new visa criteria for six mainly Muslim nations. It follows a Supreme Court ruling Monday allowing parts of President Trump's travel ban to go into effect. The ban would not affect foreign nationals who lack close family or business ties. Several lower courts earlier ruled to block the president's travel ban. 
And the Homeland Security Department now demanding that airlines around the world step up the security measures for international flights bound for the United States, and if they don't comply they could face the possibility of a total electronics ban for planes. 
And a raging wildfire in Arizona has forced thousands out of their home, the fire burning near Prescott, a city about 100 miles north of Phoenix. So far, the fire has charred 32 square miles. 
I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to "Hannity."
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So it's safe to say that CNN is having this major credibility crisis. By the way, our friend Rush Limbaugh is asking if President Trump could be the end of America's premier fake news network. Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Could Donald Trump be the end of CNN? What a legacy that would be. 
This Jim Acosta guy, little Jim Acosta, CNN, the guy that lost his cookies yesterday with the press briefing when their cameras weren't turned on. I'll tell you, we've got the audio coming up. I'll tell you how this guy reminds me. If you ever had a cat, a pet cat, and got one of these red laser pointers and you point it at the floor and the cat tries to catch it, and you point it at the sofa the cat runs into the sofa, point it against the wall and the cat runs -- I think that's what the Trump administration is doing with many in the media. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here now with reaction, recording artist Kaya Jones, the co-host of "The Five," Kimberly Guilfoyle. All right, Kaya, your first appearance. I thought Russia was funny, but when you really think about it, Donald Trump is saying fake news, fake news, fake news, and they keep falling right into the trap. I think he's right. 
KAYA JONES, RECORDING ARTIST AND ENTREPRENEUR: He's 100 percent right. At this point it's messing up actual factual input of what's going on in the country and what's going on in the world. Their literally using press briefings to drum up fake stories at this point. It's horrible. 
HANNITY: K.G., it's almost like every night this show writes itself because they keep pushing lies. 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO- HOST, "THE FIVE": Right. And you know what, the American people are wise to it. They understand what's going on, and they are sick of it because they are smarter than the mainstream media and the liberal press are giving them credit for. They see what's going on, which is a concerted effort to try to delegitimize the president of United States. They are publishing stories that have no business being on air or imprint. They are anonymous sources that are debunked very quickly. There's a lot of reputational smears going around. 
 And also they are trying to stop this president from putting forward the agenda that he was elected to do by the American people, the working men and women who have been left behind, and that who he's looking out for. 
HANNITY: That's what the election was about.
Kaya, here's my question for you, though, because you come from this entertainment background, and then all of a sudden I just noticed through a lot my friends and people sending me notes on social media that you emerged as this very outspoken Trump supporter. And I've seen some of your videos, and they are very entertaining and they're also hard-hitting. But you get what K.G. and I get, too, right, you're getting the hate. 
JONES: Yes. But I also get 12 or 13 LGBT conservatives, thank you for making me feel like I'm not alone. And when you get emails like that, it has to happen where we start to actually come out and support our president and support our nation and try to unite because what's going on is complete division. And they are posing fake news and dividing this nation by doing that. It's horrible what they have done to Trump and to Melania, the entire presidential family. It's horrible. 
HANNITY: K.G.?
GUILFOYLE: She's right. And there isn't really the respect that you've see for the Oval, for the first family, for the first lady and for their beautiful son that you saw and the respect given and afforded to Barack and Michelle Obama, Sasha and Malia.
HANNITY: Not even close.
GUILFOYLE: And I'm just asking for them to give this family, give this presidency and the vote of the American people a chance to succeed and move forward on health care, on tax reform, on immigration, on national security. We are hurting as a country. How about jobs? 
HANNITY: Ivanka and Melania and all these women, the Trump women get attacked. Where's Hillary, where's Pelosi, where's Feinstein? They never open their mouth. 
GUILFOYLE: That's the problem. It's a total disconnect and blatant hypocrisy. You don't see any female senators on the left standing up for them and saying don't disrespect these women. Treat them with the respect that they should be afforded. That's what really bothers me, especially. These are strong successful women that, by the way, could be doing a lot of other things, and they are trying to do something for this country. 
HANNITY: Kaya, I'm going to give you the last word on that. 
JONES: Yes. I really think that right now we need to be more united, and we are divided right now. And the fake news has to stop. CNN is about to be done. 
HANNITY: How about they stand up in being attack unfairly -- 
JONES: The fact that Melania has not been on the cover of "Vogue" and the cover of "Vanity Fair" and been respected -- she is absolutely stunning. 
HANNITY: What they said about Ivanka. Really? It's pretty sickening. 
JONES: It's horrible. 
GUILFOYLE: We know them personally. They're lovely people, intelligent, compassionate. 
HANNITY: And they deserve better.
GUILFOYLE: They absolutely do. We are likely to have them. They should be treated that way. 
HANNITY: Guys, good to see. Kaya, welcome to the show. Thanks for being with us.
And coming up, President Obama, he knew about Russia meddling back in August of 2016, did nothing because he thought Hillary was going to win. Should we be investigating that? The answer is yes. We'll ask Dr. Gorka.
And also we have a very important mini monologue about a host over at NBC News. He used to say he was a Republican, one of the most hinged leftist liberals in the country in his anti-Trump rant and hate. We'll explain. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So according to a recent report, President Obama new since August of 2016 that Russia was trying to influence, meddle in our presidential election. He did nothing about it. The reason is he thought Hillary Clinton would in fact win, that it was in the bag. And now President Trump wins the White House, Democrats, oh, all of a sudden they're crying foul and they've been pushing now for 11 months, Trump-Russia collusion, a phony narrative ever since. 
Last night on this program we showed you a clip of President Obama from October saying that the American election system couldn't be rigged. Really? That was when he thought Hillary was going to win. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found. 
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections, in part because they are so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. There is no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances which that will happen this time. And so I would invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and to go make his case to get votes. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: How about you stop whining, because Trump won whether you like it or not? 
Here with reaction, deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. I listen to that, and then we find he knew in August, and he didn't lift a finger to stop it because he thinks his candidate is going to win. It's in the bag. It's not a big deal. And that's the same for everybody in the media. Doesn't that prove the whole thing was fake and phony and fraudulent, Dr. Gorka? 
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: You know it, I know it, the White House knows it. And you know who knows it most, Sean? The Americans that elected Donald J. Trump. If you look at the figures, you look at any reliable polling, most Americans couldn't care less. They don't believe it. If you look at how the media has spun this story, the latest Harvard poll says that more than 70 percent of Americans don't trust the media. Why? Because of these false, fake news, propaganda products like Russian collusion. 
Let me give you an example. We've had six months of Russia, Russia, Russia, by places like CNN. For my sins I go on CNN yesterday, and then they try to tell us we're going to go to war with Russia in Syria? Either we're in bed with Moscow or we want to go to war with them. Which one is it? They're schizophrenic, Sean. 
HANNITY: It's that, and there never was any evidence. And they were able to advance a false narrative for 10 plus months now. And do you think the media can ever recover? We've been pointing it out, pointing it out. They're proven wrong and wrong again, print media, television, news media, they're all wrong and they've been wrong. How do they ever recover any credibility with the American people? 
GORKA: I think we're coming to a point where it may be something you can't recover from. This is a crash dive that you may not be able to simply win your reputation back. These places had relatively solid reputations in the past, CNN for infield reporting, "The New York Times" for being the gray lady. That's gone. That's gone in a puff of smoke. The house of cards has crumbled because they can't see beyond their political agendas, and the people see through it. And thanks to the president and his Twitter, he can just short-circuit all of it. 
HANNITY: It's unbelievable. Well, I will say this, it's interesting to watch everything now boomerang. What are your thoughts on that? 
GORKA: My friend Chris, radio show NBC, he keeps quoting the famous scene from Red October. Do you remember "The Hunt for Red October" when the enemy sub launches the torpedo, and at the last moment they realize, you idiot, you're going to kill us. This is the torpedo that the leftwing media shot and it's coming back to sink them. 
HANNITY: Ouch, very well said. Dr. Gorka, thank you. 
When we come back, a very important mini monologue. I will reveal to you which NBC host who said he used to be, well, he was a Republican, now one of the loudest, most irrational, unhinged liberals in the Trump hating network at NBC, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." All right, it's time to talk about one of the worst anti-Trump media personalities on TV. He was actually once a Republican Congressman. He left early for some reason. Now, he was from a conservative district in the Florida panhandle, but now he has transformed into the incredibly liberal host of "Morning Joe" on MSNBC. Now of course I'm talking about Joe Scarborough, liberal Joe. 
Now tonight we break down just how vicious, nasty, one-sided, petulant, arrogant his coverage has become. And that's tonight's mini monologue, Joe. 
All right, so each and every morning Joe Scarborough, he lobs baseless insults at the president, the administration, and Republicans, and by the way, real conservatives in the media. Now let's take a look at today's unhinged rant by liberal Joe. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: This lecture is coming from the greatest liar that has ever sat in the White House. The New York Times highlighted a thousand lies. To compare Nixon to this guy is absolutely ridiculous. He lies every day. A lot of times he lies every minute. He forgets the lie that he told five minutes ago. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: And Joe you are a chameleon and a phony. 
Now, when liberal Joe wasn't calling the president of the United States a liar, he is defending his fake news friends over at CNN. This is pretty remarkable. So yesterday liberal Joe tweeted, quote, "CNN has more integrity on its worst day than Donald Trump has on his best. Real news." 
Now, liberal Joe perhaps is hoping that his favorite fake news network will hire him. Now, if that's the case, I would say his audition is going really well sucking up and kissing Jeff Zucker's ass. In fact, Joe, because I'm such a nice person I put together a reel of some of your most interesting moments of your liberal bias so you'd fit right in there in case you get fired and NBC -- in other words, the most ridiculous coverage. And by the way, you can send it over to Jeff Zucker as you suck up to him. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
SCARBOROUGH: Donald Trump, again, being a schmuch.
SCARBOROUGH: He looked like a thug. He looked like a goon. You look at the handshake, look at this. Just what I thug. What an embarrassment. Look, he's mauling him like an idiot. And just what an embarrassment to the United States. 
SCARBOROUGH: This is so unbalanced. This is so -- he is not well. 
SCARBOROUGH: He's Vladimir Putin's hostage. 
SCARBOROUGH: It would be like somebody pooping their pants and then people looking at him saying, oh, that's modern art. Don't you understand.
SCARBOROUGH: There is no attempt to hide the fact that Donald Trump is breaking every promise he made. 
SCARBOROUGH: The Republican fools that are suggesting and fools on talk radio and fools blogging, suggesting, "that's just a request," you seriously embarrass yourself because you have to living in your mother's basement, eating Cheetos and blogging your entire adult life. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Hey Little Joey, you actually failed at talk radio. Let's see, we've got schmuck, liar, thug, mauling, pooping pants, what great coverage. 
By the way, poor Joe, listen, if your career in fake news doesn't work out, let not your heart be troubled. I hear you have a shot at making it big with the huge Scarborough band. In case you, my viewers, are not familiar with Joe's material, let's take a look at how unhinged he is about Donald Trump, a recently released a music video. Here it is, Joe Scarborough, it's the kind of cringe-worthy so-called hit, and it's a screed against Donald Trump. Wow. It's called "Mystified." hit it. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
SCARBOROUGH: I, I'm looking inside, and I've been mystified by what I saw. 
I, I'm looking inside, and I've been terrified by who I saw. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: I don't even know what to say. You two are so weird. You're so unhinged, you've lost it. I'll still pay for counseling for a year. The only thing mystifying to me other than why Scarborough made that horrific, cringe-inducing music video is why the liberal morning host is so completely obsessed with trashing the president. Maybe Joe should take a check from the song and look inside himself and ask himself if his daily biased coverage is really good for America. By the way, Joe, we are sorry you didn't get hired by Fox. I know you tried hard. 
And coming up, we need your help, a very important "Question of the Day" straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Time for our "Question of the Day." So do you think the liberal media as I believe is now finally collapsing because of their lying, their misinformation, their ideological agenda, colluding with Hillary, lying, black helicopter theories? Yes, I think so. But we want to hear from you, Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter.
That's all the time we have left this evening. As always on this program, fair and balanced. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.
