Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Did you hear President Obama was snubbed by ABC, NBC, Fox Broadcast and CBS. He wanted the broadcast networks to give him some time on Tuesday night to it announce 7.1 million Americans have enrolled in ObamaCare. But the networks said no to the President.
Maybe ABC thought "Trophy Wife" was of greater interest to the viewers or Fox thought singing and dancing on "Glee" was more gleeful than ObamaCare. All right. Well, you got the point. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, I know Republicans say that 7.1 million ObamaCare enrollment figure is phony math and President Obama just wanted free airtime to spike the ball and Democrats, they see it differently. They are all high fiving all over the place. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But this "Off the Record" is not about whether the 7.1 million is phony or fantastic. It's about an offer I have for the president. He wants time? I got it. I will give him 10 minutes uninterrupted to talk to the nation about the 7.1 million. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, yeah, I know, many of you are thinking right now, that you won't turn "On The Record" until 7:10 after he is finished, but behave yourself. But, anyway, in exchange for the free air time, President Obama needs to give me 10 minutes, 10 minutes of a real interview, not one of those filibustering ones where he talks, talks, and talks until his time is up. But one with quick questions and quick answers.
Well, Mr. President, you said you wanted airtime. I will give it to you. Fair deal? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
