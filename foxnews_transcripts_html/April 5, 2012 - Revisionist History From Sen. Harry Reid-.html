Majority Leader Harry Reid was speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday and asked his Republican counterpart what would have happened to car companies had not the government stepped in to help.
Reid said, "Isn't it a good thing today in America that we have an automobile manufacturing sector? If it had been up to [Republicans] -- General Motors would be gone. If it were up to them -- Ford Motor Company would probably be gone. Chrysler would definitely be gone." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Republicans were quick to point out that Ford was actually the only U.S. automaker not to take a bailout and by most accounts has profited because of that choice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But Reid's office defended the remarks, explaining, "Senator Reid was saying what the CEO of Ford said on the record, the steps taken to stabilize the auto industry were critical to Ford's survival as a company." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
U.N.-acceptable
An outgoing United Nations official is slamming Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his record on accountability. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Inga-Britt Ahlenius stepped down last week as the head of the agency that battles corruption at the world body. She blames Ban and his senior advisers for weakening the U.N. to the point it is falling apart and drifting into irrelevance. She says Ban blocked her from filling vacant posts and took other steps that undermined her agency's oversight.
A U.N. spokesman says Ban "would be the first to say this organization has a long way to go to fully implement changes that are needed." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bride Wars 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One bride is insisting her big day could turn into a big headache -- if her wedding turns out to be in the same area as Chelsea Clinton's impending nuptials.
There is speculation that on July 31, Rhinebeck, New York could be the site for the Clinton wedding, and that would mean -- according to Emm Haddad-Friedman -- her special day could be clouded over if security closes off the town's roads.
The other bride tells Yahoo, "I know she's not doing it on purpose, but Chelsea Clinton has taken what was supposed to be a special day for me (and) turned it into hell. Now I'm freaking out and my mom is going nuts."  </pre>
