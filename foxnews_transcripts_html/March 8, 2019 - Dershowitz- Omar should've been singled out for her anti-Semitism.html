SEAN HANNITY, HOST: This is a Fox News alert.
We are following several major breaking stories this Friday night. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I know so many of you have been very frustrated, so have I, with our system of justice. We've watched Mueller's witch-hunt. That's been playing out for two years, day after day. A lot of people's lives have been ruined over, quote, "process crimes" just because of their connection to President Trump. And I know you've been saying to yourself, well, what about all of the people that we know have been abusing power, committing real and serious crimes? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Hillary Clinton's one. We look at people like McCabe and Comey and Strzok and Page and many, many more. What about the FISA abuses, stripping Americans of their constitutional rights? What about the rampant conflicts of interest at some of the highest levels at the DOJ, FBI? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tonight, we have great news. According to my sources, everything that we have been revealing about the deep state for two years will very soon result in major serious ramifications. We're going to have a complete breakdown of all of this coming up.
All right, but first, just breaking a couple of hours ago, Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly orchestrating an elaborate, poorly executed hate crime hoax. If found guilty, he could face major prison time. We are going to have more on this breaking news throughout the show. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also coming up tonight, we have big breaking news and surrounding House Intel chair, known the liar, and known collaborator, collusion himself, involved in, Adam Schiff, and his brand-new best friend, Michael Cohen. Serious charges tonight being made about Adam Schiff.
Plus, new developments in the Democrats' new wave of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate. We have a “Hannity” expose on crazy Uncle Joe Biden. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But we begin tonight, breaking news out of our “Hannity Watch” of the deep state. What we are about to show you, this is only the beginning. Buckle up. Thanks to a surprise move by one very brave House Republican, we now have damning evidence surrounding the corrupt, unethical, dishonest actions of so many deep state actors of the past three years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The congressman is from Georgia. His name is Doug Collins, and he released the full transcript of Bruce Ohr's deposition and its contents are shocking. By the way, there is going to be a cascade of these depositions being released.
Now, the deep state house of cards, mark my words, it is beginning to tumble down. To give you some background, keep in mind, Bruce Ohr was once the fourth highest ranking member of Obama's Department of Justice. He became a conduit for the federal government Russia collusion investigation. Remember, his wife, Nellie, actually work for Christopher Steele. She was working at Fusion GPS on the Clinton bought and paid for and he dossier, and used her husband's position to proliferate the dossiers content throughout the highest levels of government. That's contained in this deposition.
And according to Ohr's testimony, which is now completely public, Bruce Ohr passed along a thumb drive from his wife to the FBI so that Trump-haters like Strzok and Page could have direct access to Hillary Clinton's oppo research. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we also learned that both the FBI and the Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS, they were both paying Christopher Steele for this so-called intelligence. And we know that Steele was being paid by Russian oligarch - - we talked about him -- Oleg Deripaska, who had a grievance against Paul Manafort over a business deal gone wrong.
Let me recap this so you have to understand this. Steele was getting paid by your FBI, Hillary Clinton, and the DNC, and a Russian oligarch. Pretty good gig if you can get it.
But that's not all. Thanks to this transcript, we now know that Bruce Ohr testified under oath about meeting with Fusion GPS founder and Christopher Steele's boss, Glenn Simpson. Now, this occurred during the 2016 campaign. Now, Simpson, he testified that he didn't meet with Bruce Ohr until after the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The question is, which one of these two guys is lying? Now, we also learn from this deposition that Ohr testified that he notified the FBI about his contacts with Christopher Steele also during the 2016 election. But according to a statement from Adam Schiff, who I think is the biggest liar in Congress, he claims that Bruce Ohr did not tell the FBI about his contacts with Steele, again, until after the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here we are again. Which one is lying? My money is on Schiff.
Now, here's where it gets really important. Bruce Ohr also testifies that he notified the FBI of the dossier's extremely biased source and Christopher Steele's personal mission to stop Trump, a big Trump hater. On page 15 of the October, 2016 FISA application against Carter Page, it reads the following: The FBI was unaware of any derogatory information pertaining to Christopher Steele. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's right. The problem is, everybody in the FBI knew in August of 2016 the dossier was tainted, that Hillary paid for it, that DNC paid for it, Comey, McCabe, he even briefed Andrew Weissmann, who is Mueller's pit bull, about this bias. So, literally, the special counsel's office has been long aware of the bias origins of the face phony Clinton, DNC and apparently, FBI and Russian oligarch payments to Christopher Steele.
This is hugely important. A detail never provided to the FISA court. That is called the conspiracy to commit fraud on a court, to spy on a Trump campaign associate, denying that person his constitutional rights, and this being done at the height of the 2016 election. So in other words, they had purposely withheld to the FISA court conspiracy to commit fraud, plain and simple, information that was so relevant, and it became of the bulk of the FISA application. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it doesn't end there. Christopher Steele testified under oath, in Great Britain, under the threat of perjury, I don't know if any of this dossier is true, maybe 50/50. You know, it's just draw intelligence. In other words, the author of the dossier doesn't stand by the dossier. Raw intelligence, 50/50 does not become the bulk of evidence to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, his constitutional rights and get a FISA warrant. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, thankfully, Senator Lindsey Graham has now reopened the Senate investigation into FISA abuse, and we are also waiting for Michael Horowitz, the inspector general's report, on the same. And unlike the Democrats' never ending witch hunt, this investigation centers around real crimes, with real evidence.
So what I'm telling you is it's all now beginning to cascade down. It's time to officially now pull the veil off the deep state effort. They tried to steal an election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They had a favored candidate, Hillary Clinton. They had somebody they didn't like, Donald Trump. And literally, they wanted to alter the will of the American people, both before the election, and then undo the career of a duly elected president. This is abuse of power we have never, ever seen in the history of this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have a lot more coming up.
Now, to turn to another breaking news tonight about another deep state bad actor. Do you remember when Congressman Adam Schiff made such a big deal when then-House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes went over to the White House to review documents? Remember this? Take a look.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct, which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House because he cannot do both. Unfortunately, I think the actions of today throw great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation the way it ought to be conducted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

HANNITY: Tonight, I'm calling for an investigation into Adam Schiff. He is in hot water after reportedly -- get this -- sending him as a staff to New York City to meet with Michael Cohen for over ten hours. Remember, he testified only seven hours, prior to his hearings on Capitol Hill. Ten hours! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, that kind of reminds me of the time Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac during the Department of Justice's investigation, they were about to rule on whether to indict Hillary or not. Remember, Cohen also testified that he went over and he reviewed topics with Schiff himself, something that Congress did not deny. Again, one is lying. Which one? Take a look.

MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I spoke to Mr. Schiff about topics that were going to be raised at the upcoming hearing.
SCHIFF: The extent of my contact was inviting him to testify and also trying to allay his concerns about the president's threats against him and his family.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This now needs its own investigation. What he did with Michael Cohen would be called witness tampering, and it's not a first for Adam Schiff.
In July of 2018, Congressman Schiff actually met with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson. He said accidentally. They run into each other in Aspen, Colorado, while Simpson was a key witness in an ongoing House collusion probe. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the pair denied talking about the investigation. They were just socializing. And let's not forget, Ed Henry's reporting from 2017, according to Ed, during a closed-door confidential hearing with Donald Trump Jr., remember, Schiff was spotted going in and out of the hearing room over and over and over again, while at the very same time, fake news CNN was gaining access to what was going on in real time with Don Jr. testimony as it was happening. Care to explain that, Mr. Schiff? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And who could ever forget the time that Schiff was caught on tape -- yes -- colluding with somebody that he thought was a Russian to get dirt on President Trump so it could impact America's electoral process. The thing that he says he's investigating, we got him on tape doing it! Listen.

SCHIFF: Thank you very much. We will be back in touch with you through our staff to make arrangements to obtain these materials for our committee and for the FBI. And I appreciate you reaching out to us.

HANNITY: Real collusion with Russia. Naked pictures of Donald Trump. I'll have more flexibility after the election.
All right. Given the serious conflicts of interest, now allegations of witness tampering, collusion, his constant lying, apparent leaking that needs to be investigated, well, Adam Schiff needs to hold himself to the same standard that he held Devin Nunes. That would be recuse himself from the Intel Committee's investigations immediately.
They are now needs to be an ethics investigation into Adam Schiff, and he needs to be held accountable. No wonder he doesn't want to come on this show. His actions over the past two years represent every single thing that is wrong with the sewer of Washington, D.C.

All right. We continue, by the way, our very important “Hannity Watch” on the rise of anti-Semitism and bigotry inside the Democratic Party. This has been a really revealing and despicable week.
As we speak, an elected U.S. member of Congress is sitting on the all powerful Foreign Affairs Committee, even after suggesting, evil Jews are hypnotizing the world, that Jewish money is controlling our government, and that her colleagues have a dual loyalty to Israel, which is anti-Semitism on the most vile level.

        }
      
This should shock the conscience and alarm every single American. Apparently not those in the Democratic Party. A group of outspoken, radical socialists, they are now pulling the strings in the House of Representatives.
Here's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman Tlaib, Congresswoman Omar, apparently they are the head of the entire Democratic Party and Nancy Pelosi is just a speaker in name only. The rest of the Democrats are either fear-mongering or total agreement. They had an opportunity to condemn this hate, this bigotry, this anti-Semitism, and they didn't do it this week.

HANNITY: There is no shortage of prominent Democrats rushing to defend Omar. And as per usual, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez leading the way. Get this, she actually -- we saw at the beginning of the montage, is fund- raising off of Omar's anti-Semitism, begging for donations because pro- Israel groups are coming after her, Tlaib, and Omar.
The new narrative of the Democratic Party is anyone who calls out Congresswoman Omar's anti-Semitism is Islamophobic. This is a disaster. This is really not an issue this country has to deal with.
What? You have that. We have oh, abortion after birth, during the birthing process, a party that leans so far left -- let's see -- no planes, no cows, highest taxes ever, and no cars, oils, or gas. President Obama is not liberal enough. Congresswoman Omar actually went after Obama today.
Now, we had a big problem in this country. Let me get to our first guest. Joining us, Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know, Professor, you and I have a common bond, a love of Israel. And what has now come out on multiple occasions should outrage every American, and the fact that the Democratic Party could not take a stand and name this woman and condemn this and keep her on the committee, to me, is outrageous. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');

        }
      
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL EMERITUS PROFESSOR: I agree with you. I think that these Democrats, the one the extreme left, are trying to turn the Democratic Party into Britain's Labour Party headed by an overt anti- Semite like Corbyn. Corbyn makes the same arguments. So, it wasn't anti- Semitic, it was just anti-Zionist.
But what Omar said is clearly anti-Semitic. And she should have been condemned by name, singled out, anti-Semitism should have been isolated as the real problem that we are confronting, not only in this country come but around the world. But the Democrats, by watering it down, it was as if, you know, after the black children were killed in Alabama, back in the civil rights movement, and somebody wanted to introduce a resolution condemning attacks on black children, some southerner said, oh, yes, yes, let's also include attacks on white children.
No, that's not the way you do it. You look at the problem, the problem is anti-Semitism coming from Omar, and others like her, and that has to be condemned and it has to be condemned uniquely and singularly and strongly.

        }
      
HANNITY: I'm worried about the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. These insane white supremacist groups, they are rearing their ugly heads. I don't care where it comes from. It needs to be confronted and stopped and called out. And I thought this was an act of cowardice this week. I really did. It was disgraceful.
DERSHOWITZ: You know what else is an act of cowardice? Democrats and others and people on the left wall condemn Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter, in their platform --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: What do we want? Dead cops.

DERSHOWITZ: -- singles out one country, Israel, calls it genocidal, calls it apartheid. And look, I care about black lives, I've devoted my life to protecting black lives, but I will not support the organization Black Lives Matter because I have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, zero tolerance for anti-Catholicism, zero tolerance for anti-Muslim, zero tolerance for any kind of bigotry. You cannot tolerate it.
HANNITY: I agree. That group has said, what do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now. WE have it on tape. Pigs in a blanket.
I got to move on, though. Let me ask you about Adam Schiff and, Professor, this one but her testimony of Bruce Ohr is showing many lie and contradictions.
This is just the beginning. We're going to see the FISA warrants. We're going to see the 302s. We're going to see the Gang of Eight information, and we are going to get all of these -- all the testimony of all of these people. And what we are learning is --

        }
      
DERSHOWITZ: We should see everything.
HANNITY: Uh-huh. OK, but what bothers me at all --
DERSHOWITZ: Transparency is the essence, yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Yes. We now know that many people lied under oath. What do you think of Adam Schiff? What did you think of that tape with him thinking he was talking to a Russian? What do you think of his staff spending ten hours with Michael Cohen?
DERSHOWITZ: Well, we now know that the allegations in the Steele dossier are not even supported by Steele. I think that FISA court to consider holding in contempt, contempt of court, people who submitted a FISA application while withholding relevant information that might have led them to a different conclusion.
Look, you know, we live in such a strange time. The other headline is just a small and getting indicted, thankfully, it's very important. Anybody who falsely accuses anybody should be called to task.
I've been falsely accused. Fortunately, I was able to do able to disprove the allegations. But the people who accused me should be prosecuted, investigated. Nobody should be able to make false accusations and get away with it.
HANNITY: I've lived with that my whole career. And the standard is so high, even you and an army of Alan Dershowitzs couldn't win a case.
I am glad about this -- these Covington kids, they have a great lawyer and who in wood, and what happened in his gaze was a disgrace.
All right. I want to remind everybody, you were going to write an introductory response to the Mueller report.

        }
      
DERSHOWITZ: That's right.
HANNITY: And that will be coming out?
DERSHOWITZ: It will be out just days after, just days after the Mueller report becomes public. I'm working with a very, very fast publisher, Skyhorse. They will be the first ones out with a report, with my introduction.
HANNITY: All right. Professor, thank you for being with us tonight.
All right. We continue our investigation into the deep state. A lot of news with this Bruce Ohr testimony just released tonight. We'll check in with Ed Henry, John Solomon, Sara Carter, and the congressman with more details on whether or not Cohen was coached by Schiff's team as Fox's reporting.
And we have two villains of the day today. Two. Straight ahead.

        }
      
HANNITY: All right. Joining us now with the very latest surrounding Congressman Adam Schiff, possibly coaching Michael Cohen or staff prior to his appearance before the House Oversight Committee and also the release of the Bruce Ohr interview, Fox News chief national correspondent, our own Ed Henry.
Ed, this is the beginning of the cascade, because there are a ton of those interviews that I believe are going to now be released.
ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sean, it could be just the beginning because Democrat Adam Schiff is on record refusing to even answer if you would accept Robert Mueller's conclusion if the Mueller report did not find Russian collusion.
Instead, Schiff told CNN last month he's moving forward with its own House Intel investigation, so that the Russian probe will continue no matter what Mueller finds. So, in case you are wondering if this will be a fair investigation of the president, Fox's Catherine Herridge found out that Schiff's Democratic staff came here to New York four times to meet with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for over 10 hours ahead of his seven hours of public testimony.
Republican Congressman Mike Turner told Fox this clearly shows to him the witness was coached inappropriately. Sources familiar with the Cohen meeting say that the House Intel staffers covered such topics as whether the president inflated some of his assets to insurance companies and his close relationship with head of the "National Enquirer." That raises eyebrows about how that ties in to oversight of intelligence matters, which is what Schiff is supposed to be doing. In fact those topics were among the ones that Cohen ended up discussing in his public testimony that went after the president. So, it is sparking questions tonight about whether Cohen was coached.
Now, Schiff's office insists to us, nothing inappropriate happened. They tell us, standard procedures or talk to witnesses about what they previously told Congress and get a preview of what they may now say in public. But, Sean, it's interesting, tonight, the president is tweeting, according on something Congressman Turner said about how he believes the only time Michael Cohen told the truth was when he pled guilty to lying to Congress.
HANNITY: Unbelievable story. It continues to develop. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Ed Henry with us tonight on this breaking news night.
HENRY: Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: Now earlier today, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had this to say about Michael Cohen's testimony last week. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: If they don't prosecute him, it would be a complete outrage as to what they did to Flynn, a bunch off other people. His perjury is overwhelmingly proven. How about, I didn't ask for a job? I wouldn't have taken one? Put next to that a tape going back to that time with Chris Cuomo in which he says, he wants to be chief of staff to the president of the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. Here now with much more is Ohio Congressman Mike Turner. He is a lawmaker who sent a letter to Cohen's legal team asking for clarification about their meetings with Congressman Adam Schiff. Also with us, executive vice president at "The Hill," John Solomon, FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Congressman, let me begin with you, because, first, the Bruce Ohr issue, coupled with the Adam Schiff issue. We now know, this is going to be a cascading, unstoppable event, where we are now going to have access to all of these interviews, and all of the contradictions that I pointed out, but more importantly, there is -- you know, Adam Schiff -- remember, he met -- he just ran into Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson and Aspen. His staff, ten hours, that's a problem.
And remember what he did to Chairman Nunes? He had a fit over the whole issue that Devin Nunes actually went to the White House and demanded recusal, et cetera, and then investigation. Tell us what you think this is going.
REP. MIKE TURNER, R-OH: Well, Sean, this is shocking. When you look at the fact that we learned on the Government Oversight Committee that Cohen had had conversations with Adam Schiff and then we learned from Fox News reporting now and Lanny Davis reporting that four trips to New York totaling over ten hours of meetings, that's not just talking to someone about the logistics of their testimony. That's actually talking about their testimony. That's when coaching can happen, that's when suggesting of answers happens.
This is certainly very concerning. It shows orchestration. I think this is a professional investigation, this professional orchestration. And when you look at the comparison between the amount of time the Democrats questioned him at oversight, it was four hours of Democrat questioning that was public testimony and over 10 hours in private preparation for that testimony. That certainly is not appropriate and it's not professional.
HANNITY: It's beyond inappropriate. John Solomon, we now have obvious coaching. What else will they possibly be meeting for? And Cohen said, oh, we were going over the question, his testimony.
So, we have coaching, literally, Schiff's own collusion on tape, as he thinks he's speaking with the Russian operatives trying to get Russian compromised material on the President for electoral purposes. Then of course, he hired the one guy in the country, the one guy that still believes in this debunked dossier, which its author doesn't even believe in, and we now know in the case he's on tape colluding with Russians.
What needs to happen and how big is this, especially with the release of that Ohr transcript? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOHN SOLOMON, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND COLUMNIST, THE HILL: I think personally that the Committee should demand of its Chairman all of his contacts with witnesses, including witnesses who may have at some point stopped cooperating with the Committee.
I have some reason to believe that Chairman Schiff and his staff have had contacts with people who subsequently stopped cooperating with the Committee. I think that's an important question. If he believes in transparency, like he says, put all of your contacts down to the table, let us know all the witnesses you've been talking to behind the scenes out of view.
But a week ago, I said John, I thought Michael Cohen testimony would be a boon to the President. Ten days later, after he made it, here are the facts. We're not talking about what he said, we're talking about the lies, we're talking about prosecution now, we're talking about his lawyer who has a Russian client and representing him after representing Hillary Clinton.
And The Hill did a poll, and listen to this poll, back in December when he pled guilty Michael Cohen, 51 percent of Americans said they thought he was credible. After he testified last week, now only 37 percent of Americans think he's credible. The entire Cohen testimony has backfired on the Democrats.
HANNITY: All right, now Sarah, let's go over this, because now I believe this will be the beginning of what will be a cascade of transcripts. But remember, we talked about five buckets. The 302s have yet to be released, they will be released. The actual FISA warrant which we're told the bulk of information is the debunked dossier that Steele doesn't even stand by.
Then, the Gang of Eight material. What else do we expect is going to be coming and how transformative to this entire story do you believe this will be?
SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's absolutely imperative that the President make these documents available to the American public and to Congress. Whether there's national security issues regarding some of the documentation, that can be taken care of before the release, but it has to be transparent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sean, there's also another issue. I mean we know that Adam Schiff, and I reported on this several weeks ago, has gone as far as hiring a National Security Council personnel that worked in the White House, that had access to executive privilege documents, on to his investigative staff.
HANNITY: That can't stand.
CARTER: We need to know what - it cannot stand, because there has to be a line that they cannot cross and we know now that Cohen has lied over and over again. Sean, another thing that I think will be coming out is, now with the release of all this testimony, we will be seeing testimony from Loretta Lynch, we saw the testimony from Bruce Ohr, and the enormous contradictions.
Look at Glenn Simpson, the enormous lies and contradictions between who's telling the truth, Bruce or Glenn Simpson, about his meetings and his contacts with Christopher Steele, when he spoke to the FBI. Rod Rosenstein, John wrote a great piece on that, and it's another contradiction as to who and when he knew about Nellie Ohr.
I mean Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers, he basically said he wouldn't answer any of their questions as to when the Department of Justice knew when Nellie Ohr was actually a conduit, her husband was a conduit for her information, and then later it's discovered in his own testimony that Rod Rosenstein was the man that he met with, was the man that he got the information from. So, everyone here is lying.
HANNITY: It's two years this month that you and John started all this, and that we've been unpeeling every layer of the onion. You guys have done a great job, other people as well, Congressman welcome to the club, we're glad to have you as well.
All right, when we come back, more breaking news, shocking past statements by Joe Biden that could cost him the nomination for 2020. We're going to show them all to you coming up next. Later, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has the nerve to attack the late John McCain now, in the midst of this anti- Semitism scandal? What does it tell you about her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But more importantly, what a week of exposure for the Democratic Party, bigotry, anti-semitism, they did nothing about it, straight ahead.

Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher. President Trump traveled to Alabama earlier today to survey damage from Sunday's deadly tornado. The President, along with First Lady Melania Trump, were in Beauregard, the community that was hit the hardest. They met with survivors and those affected by the storm. A moment of silence was also held in an area housing 23 crosses, representing those who were killed. The President has ordered FEMA to give Alabama "the A+ treatment as it recovers."
White House Communications Director Bill Shine is leaving his post. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says Shine gave the President his resignation on Thursday. He will take on a new role as a member of the President's reelection campaign. Bill Shine served as the former co-President of Fox News, before joining the White House last June.
If news breaks out, we will break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Hannity.
HANNITY: All right, time for a mini monologue on the ghost of Joe Biden's past. Now reports are surfacing that crazy uncle Joe Biden will announce that he's running for President in 2020. Now, the former Senator has a long political career behind him, which is now coming back to haunt him, even before he officially declares his candidacy, which we hear might be in April.
On his time in the Senate, Biden made remarks well he should have been ashamed of at the time, particularly regarding race. Watch this impassioned speech that he delivered on the Senate floor. Now this is regarding the 1994 crime bill. Take a look.

JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: It doesn't matter whether or not they're the victims of society. The end result is they're about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, taken on my sons. So I don't want to ask what made them do this, they must be taken off the street.
We should focus on them now, not out of a liberal instinct for love, brother, and humanity, although I think that's a good instinct, but for simple pragmatic reasons. If we don't, they will or a portion of them will become the predators 15 years from now. And Madam President, we have predators on our streets.

HANNITY: Now, with reaction, Fox News contributor Leslie Marshall, Sebastian Gorka. Leslie, those statistics are all true. Biden and Obama failed, and I didn't even talk about Iran yet and $150 billion they sent to the mullahs there.
LESLIE MARSHALL, CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, the goal of the Democrats, despite our love of health care and immigration and issues like that, as you know is to make Donald Trump a one-term President. So, right now, most not all - some are hung up on New Green Deal infighting--
HANNITY: So they are going to ignore all of that?
MARSHALL: --which has to stop--
HANNITY: --what Joe Biden--
MARSHALL: --the bottom line--
HANNITY: Leslie, do you support what Joe Biden said?
MARSHALL: I don't support what Joe Biden said, but I do think he is the candidate that can and will beat Donald Trump.
HANNITY: Okay, I understand you feel that way. Dr. Gorka, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, I won't repeat it. I got to tell you something, the most atrocious record of any President ever, the only one never to hit 3% GDP growth.
SEBASTIAN GORKA, SALEM RADIO'S AMERICA FIRST HOST: Yes, Sean, Joe Biden is a testament to who the Democrats were and who the Democrats are. This is the party that wanted to stop integration, this is the party of Bull Connor, this is the party that led to the death of Abraham Lincoln.
The KKK was not a Republican organization; Lincoln was a Republican. Joe Biden, you're absolutely right, that little clip you played, he's a good old boy. Isn't this the person who said famously about Barack Obama? He's the first clean presentable African-American politician who speaks--
HANNITY: And articulate.
GORKA: --properly, articulate. This is the Democratic Party.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: When we come back, unbelievable about Congresswoman Omar viciously going after Megan McCain today. And we have not one tonight, two villains of the day, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, Congresswoman Omar, who once called Israel evil is now exposing what is now a very ugly bigotry at the heart of the Democratic Party, their radical base. Now yesterday, The View's Megan McCain had an emotional reaction to Congresswoman Omar's very incendiary, very anti- Semitic statements, take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST OF THE VIEW: I take this very personally. I would go so far as to say I probably for John being a Zionist as well, but I will say that I don't have family that is Jewish. But Joe Lieberman and Hadassah Lieberman are my family, and I take the hate crimes rising in this country incredibly seriously and I think what's happening in Europe is really scary.
I'm sorry if I'm getting emotional, but the idea that this is politicized, I'm really not - I was very nervous to talk about this on this show because I thought it would become politicized and it really shouldn't be. On both sides, it should be called out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow, Omar responded on Twitter, actually retweeting an Al Jazeera host who said Meghan was expressing faux outrage. Meghan responded by saying the Congresswoman retweeting that quote is trash, is beneath a sitting member of Congress.
Here to react to all this, human rights attorney Brooke Goldstein is with us. Democratic Strategist, Jason Nichols. You know Jason, we're now watching this week the Democratic Party, the party that says they have the most compassion. This is a Congresswoman who says that Israel has hypnotized the world and evil. They have repeated it, absolute anti-Semitic lies about dual loyalties.
We have - you have in your party prominent Presidential candidates, not only supporting her, but getting on stage with Linda Sarsour, who supported the genital mutilation of a woman and Sharia Law. You're a Democrat. If I was a Democrat tonight, I would be outraged and embarrassed that they couldn't do the right thing or have enough votes to condemn this virulent hate bigotry and anti-semitism. Will you do that?
JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well Sean, I share outrage when it comes--
HANNITY: That's a question. That's a question, will you condemn the bigotry and hate of this Congresswoman and people like Linda Sarsour that's on stage with Kirsten Gillibrand? Would you get on stage with Linda Sarsour?
NICHOLS: Sean, again I don't think this is a yes-or-no question. Now what we have seen is that 400 - over 400 Democrats and some many Republicans rejected bigotry altogether, including Ilhan Omar who has some things to learn.
HANNITY: Not by name, not by name, and the watered down version. You're not answering my question.
NICHOLS: Oh okay, so Sean, are you going to--
HANNITY: Would you - this is a simple question, this is a yes or no question, would you get on stage with a woman like Linda Sarsour?
NICHOLS: Well Sean, I'll tell you this--
HANNITY: Yes or no?
NICHOLS: --what about Kevin--
HANNITY: Is that a complicated question, would you get on stage with a woman that supported the genital mutilation of another woman and supports Sharia Law, would you?
NICHOLS: Would you get on stage with Steve Scalise?
HANNITY: All right, Brooke Goldstein, let me go to you because he doesn't want to answer. The answer is obvious and this is the thing, they want to talk about everything else, but the bigoted anti-semitism that was on display this week, which speaks volumes about the new radical Democratic Party.
BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LAWFARE PROJECT: Yes, the failure to unequivocally condemn anti-semitism is alarming, is extraordinarily scary, and kudos to Meghan McCain for being honest and talking about it.
And of course she and I think the majority of Americans are emotionally distraught at to what's happening in the Democratic Party. Now I remember there was a time when people were advocating for the Black Lives Matter movement to be called All Lives Matter. And the Black Caucus came out against it and all of the liberals came out against it and said, well this is racist.
Well, I want to know, is it okay to unequivocally condemn racism and bigotry against a minority unless that minority is the Jewish community, or do we have a double standard in this country?
And so many people who are defending Omar are saying, well should we able to debate about this issue, shouldn't be people - shouldn't people be free to criticize Israel? Well, yes, of course they are, but that's not what she's saying. She's not saying Israel is violating international law because its presence in the West Bank or Israel's treatments of Arab minority is illegal.
And all those things are false, but she's free to debate it. She is saying American Jews have a dual loyalty. She is saying that American Jews are buying off members of Congress.
What if somebody said that every single member of Congress--
NICHOLS: That's not what she's saying.
GOLDSTEIN: --that voted for the Iran deal was bought off by Muslim money? They would be accused of being a racist and rightly so.
HANNITY: All right, we have not one but two villains of the day coming up. And tonight's closing argument, an important one, stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, tonight we have not just one, we have two villains of the day. Over there at conspiracy TV MSNBC, Donny Deutsch, while trashing the President, which he usually does, said he could not vote for a socialist over Donald Trump and Joe Scarborough, Crazy Joe loses it, Liberal Joe.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONNY DEUTSCH, BRANDING AND MARKETING EXPERT: I find Donald Trump reprehensible as a human being, but a socialist candidate is more dangerous to this country as far as the strength and well-being of our country than Donald Trump. I would vote for Donald Trump, a despicable human being--
JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST OF MORNING JOE, MSNBC: No, you won't.
DEUTSCH: Let me tell you something.
SCARBOROUGH: Stop yourself.
DEUTSCH: Let me correct myself, thank you Joe, you always have--
SCARBOROUGH: You will never vote for a bigot, a guy that is bigoted statements for the past three years.
DEUTSCH: Thank you for correcting me, I stand corrected.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Poor Liberal Joe, painful to watch. All right, now for tonight's closing argument. How low is the media in this country going to go? Last night, we witnessed just how much hatred the media has for anybody associated with President Trump. The Hate Trump media mob viciously goes after Judge T.S. Ellis. Why, he only gave Paul Manafort 4 years in jail.
Keep in mind, Manafort was prosecuted by Mueller's team in a case it had nothing to do with Russian collusion, not even the time that he knew Trump or ever about President Trump. But they are so angry, only 4 years. Think of one day not having your freedom. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Underneath the sentencing gap, just what - underneath the empathy gap, underneath the wealth gap is this value gap, and the value gap is the belief that white people matter more than others, particularly white people with money.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we are all astonished at the low sentence that he received.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The jury fairly convicted him based on the evidence and did not (inaudible) and for the judge to take that into consideration to me is a failure.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the beginning, he was hostile to this case and he actually sounded like somebody at a Trump rally from the bench.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: It's the Left wing media, they are now playing judge, jury, executioner, all because, what, their hateful anti-Trump bias, rush to judgment. It's always irresponsible, reckless, no due process, no presumption of innocence.
They want Manafort to die in jail for things that have nothing to do with President Trump. And the Hate Trump media mob is just heart-broken that Judge didn't send him there to die, with only bread and water, to be tortured every hour of every day.
How many times do we have to see this play out? Paul Manafort admitted he broke the law. The media is acting like the courtroom of public opinion. This is a real courtroom, with a real Judge.
All right, now time for viewer responses. All right, we had a great message from one of our viewers named James. There it is on Twitter. He wrote on my Twitter.
Hello sir, my mother just turned 80 on the 6th. During the party, my mom noticed that the 9 p.m. was approaching and said to my dad, Record Sean Hannity, I never miss a show. Is there any way you could say hello? She doesn't have Twitter but her name is Shirley.
Shirley, thank you, we love you, happy belated birthday. Of course to mom and we wish you all the best. Thank you, you make this show possible.
All right, that's all the time we have for tonight. As always, we will never be the hate-Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues, Laura Ingraham up next. Hope you have a great weekend.
