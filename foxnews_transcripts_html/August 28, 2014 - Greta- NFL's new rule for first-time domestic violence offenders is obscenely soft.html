Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Did you hear the new NFL rule? It now imposes a six-week suspension for first-time domestic violence offenders. That means you can put on an NFL uniform, beat someone, and you only miss six games of work.
But before you roll your eyes at that and how obscenely soft that is - and it is - think how happy Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice is tonight. He got in under the wire. Rice was caught on camera six months ago dragging his then-fiance out of an elevator after knocking her unconscious. So what did the NFL do about Rice's disgusting conduct? They suspended him, but for only two weeks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, what if you did that? Well, you'd lose your job. The system feels rigged sometimes, doesn't it? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
