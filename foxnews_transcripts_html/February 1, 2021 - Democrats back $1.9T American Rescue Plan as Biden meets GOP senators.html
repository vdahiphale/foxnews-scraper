BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): That's true. You know the tail ofthe tape Greg or Tom Brady. Tom Brady didn't get boo, OK. Thanks, guys.Good evening. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, President Biden is meeting with Senate Republicans rightnow in the Oval Office to discuss a possible bipartisan COVID reliefpackage. The 10 Senate Republicans say there are $600 billion proposalcould be approved quickly by Congress and one of them will join us in justa few minutes after that meeting ends coming right from the Oval Office toour camera.At the same time, congressional Democrats are considering going it alonewith a much more expensive and expensive bill.White House Correspondent Kristin Fisher joins us live from the North Lawnwith the latest on these negotiations. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Evening, Bret.Tonight's meeting is the first time that President Biden has invitedlawmakers to the White House and all of them are Republicans. But whetheror not he's willing to compromise enough to earn their support of hisAmerican Rescue Plan is still very much in question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (voice over): Go big or go bipartisan, that's the question PresidentJoe Biden faces as he attempts to pass his $1.9 trillion stimulus package.The president called for bipartisan support, and 10 moderate Republicansenators responded with a roughly $600 billion plan of their own, less thana third of what the President is asking for.SEN. JERRY MORAN (R-KS): I'm going to do everything I can to encourage thepresident to do something that is much more targeted and much lessexpensive than the $1.9 trillion package that the White House has proposed.FISHER: Republican Senator Jerry Moran was one of the 10 moderates to senda letter to the president on Sunday, reminding him of the promise he madein his inaugural address. "We recognize your calls for unity and want towork in good faith with your administration." That letter was the catalystfor today's meeting, which the White House press secretary described as anexchange of ideas, but not an open negotiation.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He's happy to have a conversationwith them. What this meeting is not is a forum for the president to make oraccept an offer.FISHER: The Republican senators are proposing $160 billion for vaccines andtesting, which is on par with what the president is proposing. But the twosides split on stimulus checks. The Republicans are asking for $1,000 thepresident wants 1,400.And then, there's perhaps the biggest sticking point: funding for state andlocal governments. And these Republicans have set aside zero dollars forit.Despite the President's preference for bipartisanship, he also knows hedoes not need Republican support. Provided moderate Democrats like JoeManchin are on board.But over the weekend, the West Virginia senator made it very clear he'supset with Vice President Kamala Harris for what many viewed as a pressurecampaign in his home state. With the V.P. pushing the White House'sproposal in local T.V. interviews.SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): I saw it, I couldn't believe it. No one called me.We're going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, I think we needto, but we need to work together. That's not a way of working together whatwas done.FISHER: Psaki says the White House has been in contact with Senator Manchinbut she also opened today's briefing with this statement of support fromanother powerful West Virginian.PSAKI: West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, also Republican said ininterviews today that he agrees that going big in this moment is critical.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): So, the White House seeming to lean on Senator Manchinyet again. Now, tomorrow is going to be immigration day at the White Housewith President Biden expected to sign even more executive orders andactions this time to reverse many of his predecessor's policies down at theborder, Bret.BAIER: Kristin, it looks like you're at a -- in a snow globe at the WhiteHouse on the North Lawn.FISHER: It feels like it.BAIER: Kristin, thank you.Just down the street from the bipartisan meeting in the Oval Office,Congress remains deeply divided. Chief Congressional Correspondent MikeEmanuel looks at the partisan fights there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In the latest sign of instability in Washington, House Democrats areoffering Republican leader Kevin McCarthy an ultimatum. Remove Georgiafreshmen Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from the Education and LaborCommittee or the House will with a vote on the floor, more evidence thatthe 117th Congress is more divided than ever.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The enemy is within the House of Representatives.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): This is a new definition of unity for theDemocrats.EMANUEL: Some would like to go even further seeking to remove MarjorieTaylor Greene from Congress. The Congresswoman tweeted defiantly today; Ionly bow to one. He alone sits in the judgment seat.McCarthy is expected to meet with Congresswoman Greene this week. She'sbecome a lightning rod for conspiracy theory she supported before beingelected to Congress after progressive Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouriinstigated a yelling match with Greene for not wearing a mask.REP. CORI BUSH (D-MO): Follow the rules and put on the mask.REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): You know what, yes, don't yell atpeople.BUSH: Put on the mask.GREENE: Stop being a hypocrite.BUSH: Put on the mask.GREENE: Yes, this is how it is here now.EMANUEL: Bush now claimed she's moving her office because she doesn't feelsafe. But this is just one sign of the broader conflict on Capitol Hill.Metal detectors are up screening lawmakers, fistfights have nearly brokenout on the House floor.PELOSI: The gentleman will clear this chamber.EMANUEL: Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott says there's no sign of amajor theme for the president.SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): Joe Biden said that he wanted unity, he wanted towork with Republicans. When they say they don't care if a Republican votesfor this, that's not -- that's not working with Republicans.EMANUEL: Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman Matt Cartwright says give it atime.REP. MATT CARTWRIGHT (D-PA): You know, one thing I always liked about JoeBiden was that he does pride himself on working in a bipartisan fashion andI do too.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): Much of the problem is a lack of trust of people fromthe opposing party. The House is expected to vote this week to findlawmakers who refused to pass through magnetometers when entering the Housechamber. $5,000 for a first offense, $10,000 for a second offense, 10 timeson Capitol Hill, Bret.BAIER: You bet. Mike, thanks.As with everything over the past year, the pandemic is causing majordisruptions this time for Senate Democrats and their control of the splitSenate.Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest. And it all comesdown to numbers as it always does. Good evening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Good evening, Bret. Well, technically at this moment, Democrats do not havethe majority in the United States and the reason is that Mark WarnerDemocratic senator from Virginia was exposed to coronavirus and he is inquarantine.Now, Democrats got a scare last week when Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont,the most senior member of the body went to the hospital for tests, He'sback now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NORMAN ORNSTEIN, RESIDENT SCHOLAR, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Narrowmajorities are tough, but they're especially tough at a time of a pandemic.When if you lose any of your members for any length of time, you are indeep jeopardy of losing the ability to muster a majority.PERGRAM (voice over): Republicans are inching closer to claiming one moreHouse seat, New York Republican Claudia Tenney increased her lead to 122votes over the Democrat in the last uncalled race in the country.Democrats aren't willing to negotiate with Republicans so far. SenateMajority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the GOP for talking with the WhiteHouse about COVID aid.Schumer told the New York Daily News "They should negotiate with us, notmake a take it or leave it offer."Liberals may be unwilling to bend a compromise that could pose consequencesfor Schumer, especially if fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezchallenges him in the primary. But to fight Democratic dissension, leaderslike Schumer may only have one option, give rousing football coach halftimespeeches to rally the team.DANNY WEISS, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: You're down tojust, you know, one running back and one ride receiver and you tell yourteam, you know, are we going to do this or not? Are we going to put thatinto play? Or are we going to fight among ourselves?(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): Now, the Senate hasn't yet approved a power sharingagreement. And for now, technically, Republicans continue to hold committeegavels, that's why Lindsey Graham remains the Chairman of the JudiciaryCommittee. And that's why Merrick Garland up for attorney general still,again, has not yet gotten a hearing, Bret.BAIER: All right, Chad, thank you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): There's no reason why Joe Biden can't work withRepublicans in Congress for bipartisan legislation if he's willing to pushBernie Sanders to the side and work with Republican senators, Republicancongressmen.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): The question is not bipartisanship; thequestion is addressing the unprecedented crises that we face right now. IfRepublicans want to work with us, they have better ideas on how to addressthose crises, that's great. But to be honest with you, I have not yet heardthat.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The definition of bipartisanship as we mentioned, 10 Republicansenators are currently meeting with President Biden and Vice PresidentHarris in the Oval Office, among them Shelley Moore capital from WestVirginia. She will join us on this show, as soon as that meeting is over togive us an inside look behind the curtain.But let's bring in our extended panel in early. Fox News Senior PoliticalAnalyst Brit Hume. Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee congressman, CEO ofEmpowerment Inclusion Capital. Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at TheFederalist and Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary and host of TheBill Bennett Show podcast.Brit, let me start with you, you know, the bipartisan talk and the unitytalk, but there's really no sense that Democrats are ready to go down thenegotiating side. They kind of are setting up for budget reconciliation,which means 51 votes.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (on camera): Yes,that's right, Bret. You know, I'm old enough and I know Bill is too toremember when $600 billion was not exactly considered going small.Let's look at it this way for a moment, in terms of the -- in terms ofCOVID, cases are down, hospitalizations are down, we now have two vaccines,there've been some delivery issues, but they're getting out there. One moreis clearly on the way.So, the situation is such that you would think it was getting better, we'rebeginning may be beginning to see our way clear. And so, is this really thetime to throw $1.9 trillion at the problem? Much of it not directly relatedto COVID-19. All of it borrowed money, when the rest of the money that has-- that had been previously appropriated, has yet to be spent.So, I think the Republicans have a case, but I also sense that this bill isa train that is going to leave the station. So, you can probably understandwhy the Democrats are trying to load it up with as much as they can get onit because they know it's likely to pass.BAIER: Well, there's one Democratic conductor that may not let that trainleave and that's Joe Manchin from West Virginia. One of the reasons why,Harold, that the White House was pressuring Joe Manchin by sending the vicepresident on to local television there in West Virginia with a message.This is part of that message and the senator's reaction. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you talk to himabout climate change, the first thing that he talks about is job creation.Job creation around, for example, all of those skilled workers who are inthe coal industry, and transferring those skills to what we need to do interms of dealing with reclaiming abandoned land mines.MANCHIN: I saw it, I couldn't believe it. No one called me. We're going totry to find a bipartisan pathway for it, I think we need to, but we need towork together. That's not a way of working together what was done.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Besides the fact that the vice president said abandoned land minesand not mining lands, Joe Manchin seem to take offense to that, Harold.HAROLD FORD JR., CEO OF EMPOWERMENT & INCLUSION CAPITAL (on camera): Thanksfor having me on. I think what's happening in the White House, Bret thisevening, is what Americans are longing for. You have 10 Republicans meetingwith the Democratic president, they clearly had laid out what they like. Heclearly has a different opinion, but said let's talk. The fact that thatmeeting is lasting longer, I think is a positive.I do hope that some of the petty preschool squabbles that seem to be takingplace on the Hill and the weaponizing of every little disagreement and theyelling at each other, hope these members of Congress can take a breath andreflect on the oath that they all swore to take.It's also important to remember as much as I agree with Brit around thevaccines coming and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is so promising andencouraging. You still have one in seven Americans who have run out ofmoney and can't put food on their table.So, I hope they can find an agreement between the 600 billion and the 1.9trillion. I'm old enough to remember that when a guy made a billion dollarsor a woman made a billion dollars, it was a lot of money. Elon Musk, Ithink made $40 billion during the pandemic.So, I think Americans are looking at this in a way and saying what isCongress going to do? If you want to have a unity government and get along,then, we build trust with people. Both sides have got to put aside some ofthe partisanship, some of the grievance and come to an agreement that willhelp Americans more quickly.It's probably not going to be 1.9 trillion and I hope it's larger than 600billion. That's what they've got to come to an agreement on.BAIER: Mollie, you know, Joe Biden is praised often about negotiating.We'll see what comes out of this overlap (AUDIO GAP) Shelley Moore Capitoon the show.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, the mediaseem to be praising Joe Biden and suggesting that he's going to craft abipartisan attempt here. The same time, Joe Biden seems to be saying hedoesn't need any votes, that he has majority in the House, he's got enoughin the Senate to just push through legislation without a bipartisansupport.But this isn't like when Obama was in his first term where, you know, hehad like 60 Democrat senators, and he had I think Nancy Pelosi had an 80vote majority. She's down to where she can only lose about five votes. Andyou've got this, you know, completely evenly divided Senate.So, he might want to try to push legislation through, but it would causeelectoral problems for him. I think it's really an open question whether hecan or whether he might need some of these 10 Republican senators in orderto get what he wants.BAIER: Bill Bennett, your thoughts?BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, which way willthe Biden brain go? I listen to Harold and Harold said, you know, this iswhat America has been waiting for the beginning of this meeting, but maybethey'll regret it at the end of this meeting. Is he going to go with jam itthrough Bernie or is this going to be the old negotiator?Judging from the executive orders that we've seen over the last couple ofweeks, it may be trying to jam it through Biden. But there are problems asthe lead in pointed out, maybe Leahy, maybe Senator Warner, also, JoeManchin, that was not a good move to be talking about the landmines --sorry, in West Virginia, lack of familiarity with West Virginia on the partof the vice president here from San Francisco was evident. We're talkingabout a collision of worlds here, different points of view. We shall see.We'll see what happens the end of the hour.Just to end where I started with Harold Ford, I wish Harold were up therein the Congress. We need more sensible, moderate thoughtful Democrats likeHarold, rather than what the Democratic Party has become.BAIER: Harold, what about the control of the caucus by the House Speaker? Imean, there are two sides of it, the progressive side and the moreconservative side?FORD: Look, first of all, thanks, Bill Bennett for the kind words. I thinkboth sides have got to take a breath here. And I think that Nancy Pelosihas to manage a five-person Congress.To Mollie's point, we have a tighter Congress. We have a tight tightSenate. I think Joe Manchin is going to act as a check, he and Mark Warnerboth. And I would argue Mark Kelly and maybe even Pat Toomey and RobPortman who I believe Rob Portman's in that meeting. Pat might be as well.I want to -- I think -- I think Bill Bennett framed it right, if they comein at that meeting, and there's signs from the Republicans that there's anagreement that can be reached, I think that we can see that the Joe Bidenand a lot of Americans believe they were getting when they voted for him afew weeks ago or a few months back is that Joe Biden that they're indeedgetting.BAIER: Well, you know, Britt Hume, the Joe Biden that signed all thoseexecutive orders and actions didn't exactly send the outreach to theRepublican side with those moves.HUME: No, I don't -- it wasn't, Bret. But one way to look at this is this,these executive orders were low hanging fruit for him to signal to hisparty's left that you know, he's not going to disappoint them in the longrun.In the end, executive orders can only do so much either way. So, you know,as big a flurry as there were, and some of them are important, they'renothing compared to what you can do in legislation.So, that he might have done that to help pave the way for himselfpolitically to make a compromise on something like this where the left willscream if they think he's not going far enough or big enough. So, that'ssomething I suppose that people who want a bipartisan solution can hopefor. We'll see.BAIER: All right, panel, thank you very much.Up next, the CEO of Robinhood has agreed to answer lawmaker's questionsover the platform's decision to restrict stock trading.First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 13 in Seattle where employees and guests at theWashington hotel had to take shelter for several hours Sunday after ahomeless activist group tried to take over that hotel.Approximately 45 activists, some armed with knives and hatchets attemptedto give beds to people experiencing homelessness. At least 12 people werearrested.Fox 12 in Portland where a new Oregon law is now in effect, decriminalizingpossession of small amounts of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine.Possession will now be a $100 fine, or a health assessment that could leadto addiction counseling.Critics say the law is flawed, particularly in regards to how it deals withminors because there is no requirement to inform parents.And this is a live look at Orlando from Fox 35 our affiliate down there.The big story there tonight, SpaceX postpones its latest shuttle launch dueto stormy weather. At the International Space Station, astronauts finisheda four-year long effort to modernize the power grid with new batteries. Theprocess took 14 spacewalks, dating back to 2017.That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: A slow moving winter storm continues to hit the Northeast causingdangerous conditions and closing many coronavirus vaccination sites.Philadelphia, New York and Boston areas could see up to two feet of snow,two feet.New York City has banned non-essential travel to help keep the roads clearand in-person school is canceled through Tuesday.The stock market bounced back after last week's drop, the Dow gaining 229today, the S&P 500 rose 60, the NASDAQ finished up 333.Last week, during the GameStop short squeeze trading platforms reduced and,in some cases, cut off the ability of traders to buy and sell. Now, the CEOof one of the fastest growing platforms has agreed to answer questions fromlawmakers. And one precious metal, maybe the next target for traders.Kristina Partsinevelos of Fox Business joins us from New York. Goodevening, Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Good evening, Bret. That free trading app, many of them like Robinhood havebeen a gateway to the stock market for millions of investors.But now, the CEO of Robinhood could face the wrath of House Representativeson February 18th over limited trading.So, we know this story. Investors pushed up the price of highly volatilestocks. And a lot of these platforms went ahead and restricted trading.On Robinhood, many of those restrictions have been eased, but some arestill in place. The app says that they put them in place due to financialobligations. So much so that today they have to raise $2.4 billion frominvestors. It's a lot of money swinging in this.According to new research, since January 1st, large funds lost roughly $6billion in this GameStop market frenzy and that is why the CEO of Robinhoodwill have to explain to House Representatives about why the platform choseto restrict the trading of highly volatile stocks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI: There is an important set of policy issues that have been raised asa result of market volatility in recent days and we think congressionalattention to these issues is appropriate.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS (voice over): And what goes up must come down. Already today,GameStop share price closed 30 percent lower in after hours trading, it'sgetting hammered, but that doesn't mean it's the end. A lot of attentionhas now shifted over to silver and silver ETF, silver mining companies.PARTSINEVELOS (on camera): The shares of those companies have climbedhigher, even the price of silver, the actual commodity itself, the spotprice hit an eight year high today.And so, because of this news, this evening, the U.S. regulator or the U.S.commodities regulator did say that now they're going to be looking into anytype of market manipulation within the silver market, so that's acommodity's market. This volatility just doesn't want to end, Bret.BAIER: Alright Kristina, thank you.Up next, the debate over double masks, should you do it should you not andthe battle in Chicago over going back into schools.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't care about kids. This is all about power.And they're not -- they come up with different excuses every day of whatthey want.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is reasonable for me to go to work every day and tobelieve that I can come back safely.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: January was the deadliest month of the COVID-19 pandemic with nearly100,000 people dying in the U.S. The total U.S. death toll now isapproaching 450,000 with more than 26 million cases.There are signs of progress as mentioned before, hospitalizations are below100,000 for the first time in two months, and the vaccination drive ispicking up speed. The CDC reports more than 32 million doses have beenadministered, up from 17 million on January 20th, 5.9 million Americanshave received both the required doses.On the prevention front, there is disagreement tonight over how many masksshould be worn.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  Well, if you have a physical covering with one layer, you putanother layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be moreeffective.DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, DIRECTOR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH, UNIVERSITYOF MINNESOTA:  If you add on another mask, you may actually make it tougherfor the air to move through the two cloth area. And then at that point itcauses more air to actually leak around the sides, which actually enhancesyour ability to get infected.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That was the same weekend. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention is currently studying the effectiveness of double masks,specifically a cloth mask placed over a medical mask, in stopping thecoronavirus spread. The CDC does not have hard data to support doublemasking and has not recommended for or against the practice.The TSA will require travelers to wear facemasks in airports, bus, and railstations following President Biden's executive order. Passengers without amask may be denied entry.Meantime, Chicago public schools were supposed to begin in-person teachingtoday. That did not happen. Senior correspondent Mike Tobin is in Chicagowhere city officials are squaring off with local teachers.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  After almost a year empty and apromise that in-person instruction would resume today, Chicago publicschools remain quiet, students still not getting instruction behind thecomputer screen.JANICE JACKSON, CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS CEO:  We are starting to see some ofthe effects of schools being closed. Many of our students aren't loggingon. We are seeing African-American and Latinx students in particular beingespecially hard-hit.TOBIN:  The CEO of public schools gave an ultimatum to teachers on Sunday,show up Monday or access to Google Suites, which they use for remoteteaching, will be cut off. Chicago teachers' union president Jesse Sharkeythat could trigger a strike vote. Chicago officials claim they haveexceeded CDC recommendations and spent $100 million on everything fromfiltration systems to facemasks. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot says whennegotiations make progress, union leaders make more demands. The union saysnegotiations are about the safety of teachers.STACY DAVIS GATES, CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION:  This discussion is not about ifwe return, but how we return. And how we return is with the maximum amountof safety that we can obtain an agreement.TOBIN:  When asked about the school crisis in Chicago, the White Housedodged controversy.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We trust the mayor and the unionsto work this out. They are both prioritizing the right things, which isensuring the health and safety of the kids and teachers, and working tomake sure that children in Chicago are getting the education they deserve.TOBIN:  And tens of thousands of parents in Chicago just want their kidsback in the classroom.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My husband is an essential worker. He is excited toshow up and do his job every day, pandemic or no pandemic. I've had to putmy career on hold and stay home with the children every day to make surethey are doing their lessons.(END VIDEO TAPE)TOBIN (on camera):  And in the last few minutes, Mayor Lori Lightfoot'soffice announced a 48 hour cooling off period. Remote learning will not becut off during that period. In fact, all classroom work will be remote forthe next two days. Bret?BAIER:  Mike Tobin live in Chicago. We will follow this one. Mike, thankyou.In California, Republicans are gathering signatures to try to recall thestate's Democratic governor as the state struggles to control thecoronavirus. National correspondent William La Jeunesse has details fromLos Angeles.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, (D-CA):  Deaths continue to be significant.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Despite a risingdeath rate and a spreading virus mutation, California Governor Gavin Newsomdenies putting politics ahead of science with the sudden plan to reopen theeconomy during a voter revolt to kick him out of office.NEWSOM:  That's just complete, utter nonsense, so let's just dispense withthat fundamental, foundationally nonsense.LA JEUNESSE:  The effort to recall Newsom is gaining momentum. Supportersare well on their way to collecting the 1.5 million signatures needed byMarch 17th. So far, possible candidates include a Silicon Valleybillionaire Democrat, and Republican John Cox and former San Diego MayorKevin Faulconer, who claims to have raised over $1 million for a campaign.KEVIN FAULCONER, (R) FORMER SAN DIEGO MAYOR:  This is across the board inCalifornia. I believe it's going to qualify, and I believe we are going tobe into a recall situation here very soon.LA JEUNESSE:  Critics say Newsom has himself to blame, pointing out hefailed to reopen schools, the vaccine rollout is among the nation's worst,their belief that his stay-at-home orders have been inconsistent,enforcement arbitrary, state testing and tracing was late or nonexistent,and a broken promise to fix unemployment insurance that paid those whodidn't deserve it while failing those who did.KATHLEEN VAN HART, TENANT:  I'm always robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've soldanything that I've had that is worth selling to try to make ends meet.LA JEUNESSE:  Newsom's latest directive has unions angry, allowing theelderly to get vaccines before essential workers. "It's like he's puttingus out to die" said the SEIU's Sandra Diaz. "We can't play politics withpeople's lives and frontline workers."(END VIDEO TAPE)LA JEUNESSE (on camera):  A recall vote wouldn't likely happen untilsummer, giving Newsom time to get kids back in school and Californiansvaccinated and back to work. Bret?BAIER:  William, thank you.Up next, we head to a city in Nebraska feeling the effects of PresidentBiden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Former President Donald Trump has a new impeachment legal defenseteam following the resignation of five attorneys just over a week beforethe start of his Senate impeachment trial. A source familiar with the splitsays the former O'Rourke wanted that team to make the election fraud case,and the attorneys quit over that. The trial is scheduled to begin nextweek.The Lincoln Project, a group formed by veteran Republican operatives whooppose President Trump, is disavowing its cofounder John Weaver as apredator, liar, and an abuser. The statement came after a "New York Times"report detailing Weaver's history of alleged auditory predatory behavior.The report featured interviews with 21 men who accused Weaver of sendingunsolicited and sexually provocative messages, often while suggesting hecould help them get work in politics. One alleged victim was only 14-years-old. In a statement to "The Times," Weaver says he is disheartened andsaddened that he may have brought discomfort to anyone in what he says weremutually consensual discussions.Tens of thousands took to the streets in Russia to support jailedopposition leader Alexei Navalny, and more protests are expected ahead ofTuesday's court hearings. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Amy Kelloggis following that story.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Draggedthrough the snow, beaten with officer batons, and bundled into police vans,more than 5,000 Russians were detained Sunday in dozens of cities acrossthe country. Tens of thousands were out again, braving often sub-freezingtemperatures to demand the release of Russian opposition leader AlexeiNavalny, an end to corruption, and in some cases simply the end ofPresident Vladimir Putin's 20-year reign.All this sparked by Navalny's arrest after recovering from poisoning by aSoviet era nerve agent, and a new documentary he did about $1 billionpalace allegedly belonging to Putin. The Kremlin denies the palace isPutin's claims Navalny is on the CIA payroll, and that the west is stirringRussia up.ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Russian government makes a bigmistake if it believes that this is about us. It's not. It's about them.It's about the government. It's about the frustration that the Russianpeople have with corruption, with kleptocracy.KELLOGG:  The U.S. and other western governments are condemning the protestarrests and demanding Navalny be released. The Kremlin is not willing tocompromise.DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator):  As to the commentsof the U.S. representatives in respect to our country, in respect to theillegal rallies which happened in our country, I repeat, we are not readyto listen to the American opinion on this matter, and we will not do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLOGG (on camera):  Navalny's team is calling for sanctions on somepeople close to Putin, and another opposition figure says the U.S. isactually Navalny's greatest hope for pressure on Russia as Europe, he says,quote, "doesn't have the political will." Bret?BAIER:  Amy, thank you.Another story from Beyond Our Borders tonight. The military in Burma stageda coup and detained senior politicians, including Nobel Laureate Aung SanSuu Kyi, reversing the progress toward democracy the nation has made fivedecades of military rule. The military says a senior general will be incharge now of the country for one year, and the seizure was necessarybecause the government had not acted on the military's claims of fraud inNovember's elections. In a state, President Biden condemned the seizure ofpower as a direct assault on democracy and the rule of law.Just one of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight.Up next, the panel rejoins me to discuss the COVID vaccine progress and thedouble mask debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The size of the package needs tobe commensurate with the crises we are facing, the dual crises we arefacing, hence why he proposed a package that is $1.9 trillion.JARED BERNSTEIN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  The American people reallycouldn't care less about budget process, whether it's regular orderbipartisanship, whether it's filibuster, whether it's reconciliation. Theyneed relief and they need it now.SEN. BILL CASSIDY, (R-LA):  Ours is about $600 billion. We are verytargeted. We're targeted to the needs of the American people, treating ourtax dollars as if they are our tax dollars, not just money to spend.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  At this hour 10 Republicans are meeting with President Biden andVice President Harris in the Oval Office. There you see the beginning ofthe meeting. One of them sitting right there in the plaid jacket isRepublican Shelley Moore Capito. We expected her to be out on the NorthLawn talking to us about what was happening inside the Oval Office in thismeeting. The meeting is still going on. So, we told her, you know what, youshould probably stay in there and not come on SPECIAL REPORT right now. Butif she does come on, we will put her on the air. There you see PresidentBiden with the mask in the Oval Office, and that meeting has been lastingfor quite some time.We're back with our panel, Brit, Mollie, Harold, and Bill. Bill, you havebeen through a number of negotiations over time. The fact that they last along time is usually a good thing.BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Well, we'll see. It can be likejuries. Interesting you made the point that the news is more important thanthe news show. I understand the temptation.(LAUGHTER)BENNETT:  And I know the business we're in. But if there were more mathmajors in Congress and fewer lawyers, we might not be having thisdifficulty. What about the couple trillion or more we've already put in? Isthat all been accounted for? Has it all been spent? I don't think so. Andbesides, what are the details in this bill? How much of the politics ofbribery is involved here, such as in the teachers' union stuff going on inChicago? I just wish we were a little more careful about our numbers. Fewerlawyers, more mathematicians. But they are probably in the aerospaceindustry where we need them. Anyway, let's see what happens.BAIER:  Yes, Mollie, Bill mentions the teachers, and the response has beenthey need money to open up these schools. Obviously, a number of schoolsaround the country are doing it currently. There is this big dustup inChicago. What do you make of this? Because there are a lot of teachers anda lot of parents that are frustrated at this moment.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  The science has neversupported keeping children out of schools, and the fact that many childrenhaven't been in school for a year is flat out abuse and neglect, and thereare a lot of people are having tremendous problems with it.It's just amazing that we are still talking about it. It's like the wholecountry has forgotten how to do cost-benefit analysis, whether that's aboutcomplete shutting down the economy and thinking you can print enough moneyto get out of this, not thinking about the long-term economic catastrophethat's happening, or not thinking about the damage to children and theshuttering of society and how many problems we have had as a result ofthat.We need people who can do better cost-benefit analysis and understand thecosts associated of these really draconian shutdowns instead of justunderstanding we have vaccines now. The weather will be getting warmer.People are getting vaccinated. The numbers should continue to go down, andpeople need to get back to living.BAIER:  Brit, we have been told to trust the science. This weekend therewere different assessments of the double mask and whether it was good orbad from scientists in the field.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's a problem. The thingabout masks, I think, Bret, is a good way to look at it is this, thatcommon sense They say that the mask will do something, that it will retardyour ability to push this virus, if you have it, away from you onto otherpeople. Double masks may be effective, but there are problems with thattoo.I think the idea of wearing a mask comes down to this. Even if you don'tbelieve they are particularly effective, an awful lot of people do. And ifyou are walking around in some indoor space without a mask on because youdon't believe they work, and you may be right, other people are going to befreaked out. So, be nice. Wear a mask. It can't hurt. It probably willhelp, and it will make other people more comfortable. That's how I come outon masks.BAIER:  There you go. I'm with you. But Harold, I guess what people want toknow is what the true facts are. We have seen some evolution about howthings are treated. The schools are one thing. We hear that there is reallyvery small percentages, if many at all, transmitted from children toteachers. But yet the teachers' union is very concerned about health andsafety. Thoughts?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  I think one of theways to address this, and there's politics around the unions. We shouldremember, no one goes into the teaching profession to become famous or tomake a lot of money or for the glory of it. I do think that if we were tovaccinate all the teachers, and teachers' union made this point, it wouldweaken them considerably. So maybe that should be something to consider.But the science is right. And the science, you can't say you embrace thescience when it's convenient for your politics, and the science suggeststhat kids in schools, they have a lower transmission rate. So we shouldfigure out what those schools are doing that have those lower rates and weshould replicate that around the country.Again, I think what's happening tonight is fantastic. Problem solving istrumping pettiness and partisan politics. If staying in that meetinganother hour or two gets us to a point where we can have an agreement thatwe can address the economic slowdown, the pandemic at the same time --remember, it was government that shut down these places, and I thinkrightly. So we have to help people not only get back up on their feet butresume a way of life when these vaccines take place. And hopefully thatdistribution is wider and more available to every American, the vaccinedistribution, that is, sooner rather than later.BAIER:  Yes, let's hope that's what's happening in the Oval Office. We'llfind out, and hopefully Senator Capito and others will tell us whathappened.Bill, you know a little bit about education. Your thoughts on the situationcurrently?BENNETT:  Yes, they may take a vote to strike, and people should payattention to that. There's a canard going around that it's all the unionbosses, and not the teachers. This wouldn't be going the way it is if a lotof teachers didn't support it. I know a lot of teachers. I agree withHarold. A lot of them are in for all of the right reasons. But thesituation, places like Chicago, they make pretty good money. They get threemonths off. They have excellent benefits. And the state understands whatthese benefits are.So I think we are engaged here, they are engaged in the politics ofbribery. And I think the American public might see this as an opportunityto consider other alternatives. There are those doughty Catholic schoolsout there. They are just going at it, doing what they're supposed to do onmuch smaller budgets. And they too are dedicated to the education ofchildren. It might bring about a little bit of a revolution here in schoolsas people think about this.BAIER:  Bill, I only have 15 seconds, but can you put a sense about whatthis means to kids doing this virtual for so long, not being in person?What the implications are for our kids down the road?BENNETT:  Social, academic, emotional loss. Books will be written about alost generation or part of a generation because of this year. You cannottake kids out of the normal environments they are in without loss. Andwhere are the Democrats thinking about the kids for whom school matters themost? Those kids in the inner city communities, those kids who are poor,they need to be in school. Their parents need to be at work. This is a realshame and scandal, and the losses are incalculable.BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much for tonight. We had a little audiblesince that meeting is still going on. We appreciate the time.When we come back, you think kids enjoy the snow in the nation's capital?You're not alone.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, it was a good weekend to be a kid in D.C., lots ofsnowfall, lots of hills around here, including one with a capital on it.But humans weren't the other only ones having fun in the weekend snowfall.The Capitol's favorite pandas were caught at the National Zoo having somefun of their own as the pair, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, giant pandas rollingaround, sliding through the snow. We could watch this for at least 30minutes, I could just watch it. It looks fun.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIALREPORT. Fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
