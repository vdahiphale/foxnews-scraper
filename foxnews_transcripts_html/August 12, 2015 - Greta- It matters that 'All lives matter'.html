'Off the Record,' 8/12/15: How did saying 'All lives matter' become politically incorrect? Yes, black lives matter, but any politician who refuses to say all lives matter is just pandering 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record." I never for one second want to discriminate, or hurt anyone. But I want to say what has inexplicably become politically incorrect - all lives matter. There, I said it, and I mean it.
All lives do matter. Go to an emergency room. Whoever comes in on a stretcher bleeding, everyone rushes to help because all lives matter. Multiracial police forces respond to a 911 call putting themselves in danger. They don't ask who it is. They go because all lives matter. And the fire department, multiracial firefighters hear the alarm, jump on their trucks risking their lives. They don't call ahead and ask who is trapped inside that burning house, because all lives matter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I spent years doing poverty law with other poverty lawyers. It was all about who needed us because all lives matter. You get the point? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, it's very painful when politicians won't stand up for everyone and say, "All lives matter," instead that only "Black lives matter." And let's me say this loud and clear: Yes, of course, black lives matter. But so do other lives. And a politician who won't say it is simply pandering. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that pandering is dividing us. They need to stop that, they need to do the right thing - work on uniting us. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
