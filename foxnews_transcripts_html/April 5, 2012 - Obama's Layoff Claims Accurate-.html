And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's the Economy...
President Obama talked about government layoffs during an economic town hall Wednesday. He said -- quote -- "there have been huge layoffs of government workers at the federal level, at the state level, at the local level. Teachers, police officers, firefighters, social workers -- they have really taken it in the chin over the last several months." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But according to the Labor Statistics Bureau, federal workers have actually added 11,000 jobs in the first quarter. State employees have experienced job losses of half a percent or 25,000; local government employees lost 38,000 jobs or a quarter of a percent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CATO Institute analyst Chris Edwards says -- quote -- "Even if the president's claim about government layoffs were true -- and it isn't -- why does he assume that government workers should be a 'protected class' immune from the career realities that every private worker is experiencing in our sluggish economy?" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On the Job Hunt
Federal Communications Commissioner Meredith Baker announced she's resigning next month to become Comcast NBC Universal's senior vice president of governmental affairs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just four months ago, Baker voted to approve a merger between those two companies. Back in 2009, President Obama appointed Baker as one of two Republican members among the five on the FCC board.
Comcast says it did not begin discussions with Baker about a possible job until after the transaction had closed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Salahi Sing-Along 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And finally, alleged White House party crasher Michaele Salahi is trying to break into the music industry. Her first single titled "Bump It" is out.
Salahi says she was inspired to sing after Oprah Winfrey once told her she had a -- quote -- "amazing voice." However, Oprah's camp denies the two ever discussed Salahi's vocal abilities during a brief meeting backstage in Washington.
You may also remember earlier this year Salahi was kicked out of "Celebrity Rehab" for not actually having an addiction.  </pre>
