BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Very nicely done, and that bridehad something blue already, so there was that. All right, Dana, thank you.Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we're following several major stories. President Trumpagain today made his case for winning the election, this time at the WhiteHouse vaccine summit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We were rewarded with avictory. Now, let's see whether or not somebody has the courage. Whetherit's a legislator or legislatures, or whether it's a justice of the SupremeCourt or a number of justices of the Supreme Court. Let's see if they havethe courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER (on camera): Late this afternoon, though, the U.S. Supreme Courtdenied a request to prevent state officials in Pennsylvania from certifyingthe results of last month's election, a case that many Trump supportersthought held the best chance of being heard by the Supreme Court.Justice Samuel Alito referred it to the whole court and none of the ninejustices dissented, including the newest Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Thedecision to deny injunctive relief came within 40 minutes of all thefilings being received, more on that in a minute.This as the vaccine summit at the White House came to an end and in it, anew implementation of President Trump's America First policy in thecoronavirus era. The president has issued an executive order mandating allAmericans have access to the eventual vaccine before it is shippedelsewhere as the U.S. passes the 15 million mark in COVID-19 cases with anaverage of more than 2,200 per day.We begin tonight at the White House as we await reaction from the presidentto the Supreme Court decision with Chief White House correspondent JohnRoberts. Good evening, John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Haven't heard anything yet from the president on that front but it was abig loss for supporters of the president at the Supreme Court as the courtdenied a petition to nullify the results of the November 3rd election inPennsylvania. The case have been brought by Congressman Mike Kelly andothers who had contended that the expansion of mass mail-in voting wasunconstitutional.Now, had the court taken up the case as what was expected that TexasSenator Ted Cruz would be arguing it on behalf of the plaintiffs. Thecourt's decision was another blow to the president's efforts to try to finda legal path to another four years in the Oval Office and it came on a daywhen his Manhattan Project-style effort to develop a coronavirus vaccineappeared ready to pay off.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (voice over): At the White House today, President Trump hosting asummit on the coronavirus vaccine, which may be just hours away fromdistribution in the United States.TRUMP: This is one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-daymedicine. American companies were the first to produce a verifiably safeand effective vaccine. Together we will defeat the virus and we will soonend the pandemic and we will save millions and millions of lives.ROBERTS: An FDA advisory panel today reported that an initial analysis ofthe Pfizer vaccine data founded safe and effective, paving the way for whatmay be emergency use authorization later this week.The president also signing an executive order to ensure Americans getAmerican-made vaccines before they are shipped to other countries. Andvowing to use the full power of the U.S. government to keep vaccineflowing.TRUMP: We have worked very well with the companies but if for any reason wehave any problems, we will be instituting the Defense Production Act and wewill make sure that we don't have any problems very long.ROBERTS: The White House continues to push back on reports that HHS turneddown an offer from Pfizer in the summer to lock in hundreds of millionsmore doses of vaccine. Officials tell Fox News that on July 21st, HHScontracted for 100 million doses with an option for 500 million more.In October, after early data on the Pfizer vaccine looked promising, HHSexercised its option and ordered 100 million additional doses to bedelivered next spring.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's just simply not truethat they offered extra doses according to the people who are involved inthe negotiations. With each and every company, we contracted for 100million doses.ROBERTS: Operation Warp Speed co-leader Moncef Slaoui reminds that when theinitial orders were put in last summer, the vaccines were stillexperimental.DR. MONCEF SLAOUI, CHIEF ADVISER, OPERATION WARP SPEED: If somebody came tous and said let's buy more of this vaccine or that vaccine, no onereasonably would buy more from any one of those vaccines because we didn'tknow which one would work and which one may be better than the other.ROBERTS: President Trump today also waded into politics. When asked why hedidn't include anyone from the Biden transition, the next administration inthe Summit, the president turned to his view of the election results.TRUMP: Well, we're going to have to see who the next administration isbecause we won in those swing states and there was terrible things thatwent on. Whichever the next administration is will really benefit by whatwe've been able to do with this.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (on camera): President Trump we'll be watching closely anotherpetition to the Supreme Court, this one from Texas Attorney General KenPaxton. Paxton is asking the Supreme Court to block electors from voting inthe states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin contendingthat those states broke election law by using the pandemic to expand massmail-in balloting.And there is still one other Supreme Court case that could go to the --there was one other Pennsylvania case rather that could go to the SupremeCourt, that one challenging the legitimacy, the acceptability and theadmittance of all mail-in ballots that came in after 8:00 p.m. on electionnight, Bret.BAIER: All right, John, thank you.A federal judge meantime has dismissed the criminal case against formerTrump administration National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, but JudgeEmmet Sullivan pointedly noted Flynn's pardon from President Trump does notmean that he is innocent. The president tweeted congratulations to Flynnsaying he and his family had suffered greatly.Let's get some additional perspective on these legal fights. JonathanTurley is a professor at George Washington University Law School and a FoxNews contributor. Jonathan, good evening.Let me start with the Pennsylvania decision by Justice Alito, he turns itover to the full Supreme Court, no noted dissents and they do not moveforward. There's no injunctive relief there. Is that a big blow for thepresident's chances?JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): It is a bigblow. You know, we've talked in the past about how the president wasrunning out of runway. And at this point to really make a difference, he'dhave to land a jumbo jet on a postage stamp. I mean, he does not have a lotof runway left. This was considered his strongest case for the SupremeCourt.And the court system has proven that it is independent and reviewing theseclaims. Many of these are Trump appointees who are voting against theposition of the president not because they have animus, but because theydon't see the legal case, particularly in terms of the relief of blockingcertification.There is this sticker shock that kicks in for these courts saying, look,there are problems that you've identified. There have been illegal ordersand other cases, there have been votes that have been negated. But they'reasking for a really massive form of relief, which is blockingcertification.Now, at the same time, it'd be nice if some Democratic senators actuallyapologized to people like Barrett, and others. You know, during herhearing, they put out these conspiracy theories that she was being put onthe court to kill the ACA or steal the election. None of that seems to betrue, obviously.BAIER: You say he's running out of runway and just look at the electoralcollege timeline here. Today was the deadline to resolve disputes actually.December 14th, the electors vote in the states December 23rd, the state-certified, deliver the votes. January 6th, the House and Senate jointsession, count the votes, declare officially the winner.There is this other case that John mentioned out of the Texas attorneygeneral filing to the Supreme Court directly. Court watchers are looking athow this particular Pennsylvania case was dealt with 40 minutes after thefilings came in. Does that suggest that they're just not in the mood totake care of anything else like this?TURLEY: I'm afraid that Texas case falls in that category of that dog won'thunt. I mean, I don't see how that's going to be successful, particularlyafter this loss.And yes, the timing was notable this, the ink was hardly dry on the filingwhen the court came back and basically ended this issue. So, I think thatit does not look very promising.Last few days, we've also noticed the Trump campaign and President Trumphimself are talking more about going to the legislators. You'll notice onhis list of people that could change this. The first justice was numberthree, he talked about a legislator or legislatures and that's a straightmuscle play. That's an effort to try to get legislators to say we don'twant the certification of these votes to go for Biden. That is also notlikely to succeed, but it does show a shift away from the court.BAIER: Finally, Judge Emmet Sullivan wrapping up this criminal case againstMichael Flynn, he was pardoned by President Trump. But notable that JudgeSullivan had this detail in this final filing about how he's not -- hedoesn't have to be innocent. Just talk for a minute about the how he'shandled -- the judges handle this entire thing.TURLEY: Well, you know, I've practiced in front of Judge Sullivan foryears. I've had great respect for him, but I've been very critical of hishandling of the Flynn case. You know, he has been criticized for years ofusing General Flynn as a vehicle for criticizing the Trump administrationrefusing to dismiss the case, the prosecutors came in and said, We nolonger want to charge Michael Flynn, we no longer believe a charge isappropriate and the Justice Department filed for a dismissal but JudgeSullivan refused.Court of appellate -- Court of Appeals judges in the first panel criticizedhim and ordered him to dismiss the case. That was later reverse becausethey wanted to give the judge a chance to issue a final order.But even then, he would not dismiss the case and when the pardon came down,he still held on to the case. And now he has finally dismissed it. But indoing so, I think that it was really grossly inappropriate for him toessentially declare a verdict of a person who wasn't even sentenced. That'swhat this was.And you know, judges usually don't even address the guilt of a defendantuntil sentencing. They certainly avoid that when you're having a dismissalof a case. They don't talk about guilt or innocence because the defendantdoesn't have a right to appeal those types of gratuitous comments. Andthat's what this was. It was gratuitous and it was wrong for the court todo it.BAIER: Jonathan Turley as always, thank you.Back to the vaccine story. Breaking tonight, Britain's mass vaccinationprogram is underway this evening, a retired shop clerk received the firstshot today. 90-year old Margaret Keenan was the first in line at theUniversity Hospital Coventry, one of several facilities around the U.K.handling the initial phase of the United Kingdom's program.Even with all the optimism about a vaccine or vaccines, there is stillsignificant portion of the population, about half in this country thatremains defiant about actually getting the shot when it's available. Ourweeklong series on the vaccine continues tonight with some of the reasonswhy. Here's correspondent David Spunt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's a new era inmodern medicine. COVID-19 vaccines developed in record speed in the sameyear, an unforgiving pandemic pummeled the United States.DR. PETER HOTEZ, VACCINE DEVELOPER, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: This hasbeen a slam dunk success.Dr. Peter Hotez is a vaccine developer with Baylor College of Medicine andhas followed the progress in detail. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine touts anefficacy rate of 95 percent, Moderna's vaccine 94.1 percent.HOTEZ: Just to give you a sense of what that means, our very best vaccineof any vaccine is the measles vaccine and two doses gives you 97 percent.SPUNT: These COVID vaccines are unlike a traditional vaccine where aweakened version of a virus is administered to patients.HOTEZ: This does something a little bit different. It actually asks thehuman body to make the protein or the virus component ourselves bydelivering messenger RNA into part of the cell and that manufactures theprotein to induce the immune response.SPUNT: Ribonucleic acid or RNA vaccines have been tested for years. Butthis would be the first time an RNA vaccine would be approved for mass useon humans. Still, concerns exist in homes and offices across the country.More than half of the firefighters in New York City said in an internalsurvey, they would not take the vaccine.NATASHA ANDERSON, VACCINE SKEPTIC: Everybody that's a parent should lookinto the information.SPUNT: Idaho mother of two Natasha Anderson tells Fox News she's worriedabout the speed of the trials.ANDERSON: I am not anti-vaccine. I am like informed consent. Their scienceis like revolutionary, but I don't know if I want to be a guinea pig inthis revolutionary different thing.SPUNT: But 66-year old Linda Lamberth was happy to be a guinea pig.LINDA LAMBERTH, VACCINE ENTHUSIAST: I was really excited to get the e-mailthat I could be a part of this study.SPUNT: She took part in the Moderna vaccine trial at Baylor University. Amonth after her first shot, she received a second dose, followed by mildmuscle aches and a low-grade fever.LAMBERTH: I encourage everybody to get the vaccine. It certainly would helpus get back to normal.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): Experts fear that low confidence in the vaccines willdelay the ultimate goal of herd immunity, Bret. As for the long-term sideeffects, the short answer scientists just don't know that they believe inor confident these vaccines are safe trials took place for months includingat the hospital behind me, George Washington University Hospital, Bret.BAIER: David, thank you. Wednesday, we look at the politics of herdimmunity in our series.Meantime, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he has presented a newcoronavirus relief proposal to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

And it does not work.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The battlelinesare drawn. Newly elected Republicans heading to Congress as a new freedomforce pushing for low taxes and limited government to counter the loudestprogressive voices in Congress.NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS, (R-NY) REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT:  They want to dismantlethe U.S. economy. They want to do away with the free market. They want totake away our freedoms and liberties. They want to change the way we electpeach.EMANUEL:  They're seeking a war of ideas with four freshman in thisCongress known as the Squad who favor policy issues like Green New Deal,Medicare for all, and tuition free college. Congresswoman AlexandriaOcasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley are expectedto add new members to their Squad in January. Even before being sworn in,these newly elected Republicans are taking aim.CARLOS GIMENEZ, (R-FL) REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT:  The ideas that are being putforward by members of the Squad are not going benefit anybody. It's almostan assault on the lower and middle classes of the United States.EMANUEL:  Some of at least eight newly elected Republicans have familymembers who fled oppressive regimes in places like Cuba, and they intend totell the American people socialism is not the answer. One of the newmembers grew up in Ukraine under Soviet control, which molded her views.VICTORIA SPARTZ, (R-IN) REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT:  For me it's very sad to seehow quickly people can turn to Utopic ideas and how our country went to theleft to these radical progressive ideas that destroy a lot of people, a lotof countries.(END VIDEO TAPE)EMANUEL:  These Republicans suggest part of why they were elected isbecause many Americans are fed up with where Democratic Party leadership inthe House is taking the country. So their mission is advocating for pro-freedom policy in Congress and making the case for Republicans winning backthe House in 2022. Bret?BAIER:  The Force, the Squad, what's next?

GUSTAVE PERNA, OPERATION WARP SPEED:  It is this trifecta, the CDC,commercial industry, and the governors and their states that is going tomake us successful at the end of the day.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Impressive vaccine summit today at the White House with a lot ofthe different players explaining all elements of the logistics of gettingthis vaccine in just -- both vaccines out in just a number of days comingup.In the meantime, after that late this afternoon the U.S. Supreme Court camein with this, and that said "The application for injunctive reliefpresented to Justice Alito and by him refer to the court is denied." Thishas to do with the Pennsylvania filing about one specific element. There isanother Pennsylvania case that is still active, and other legal challenges.But this was seen by Trump supporters as a big one for the Supreme Court topossibly take up. In fact, Ted Cruz wanted to argue this case.Let's bring in our panel Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary, host of"The Bill Bennett Show" podcast, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at"USA Today," and Guy Benson, political editor at, the host of"The Guy Benson Show" on FOX News Radio. Guy, earlier in the show you heardJonathan Turley, his assessment of what this means for the legalchallenges, essentially saying it signals to him that the Supreme Courtreally doesn't want to get into this.GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR:  Yes, the fact that there wereno dissents noted in this decision suggests that all nine justice, at leaston this case, said no thank you. As you mentioned, Bret, there are still afew irons in the fire legally speaking, but those options seem to bedwindling.The other active Pennsylvania case that you mentioned, my understanding isit's about a challenge of about 9,000 ballots, which is far less than themargin would need to be to overturn the result in that state ofPennsylvania. Then there is the Texas lawsuit that is getting pretty widelypanned by legal analysts across the board. So it's not over until all ofthese cases are resolved, but, as you suggested, rather, this was a big onetoday. Not unexpected, but still significant.BAIER:  Bill?BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Yes, well, the pay narrows. Ithink Guy is right. But those two cases are still out there. Sometimes whenthe court doesn't take a case you don't have the opportunity for dissentingvotes. There may be someone disagreed. Maybe they're waiting for thisbroader brush, broader stroke, Texas case and the other case. But yes, it'snot good news for the challenges.By the way, the numbers that matter here are not the numbers, thedifference between Democrat and Republican votes in any single state. Whatmatters here is whether there was a systematic fiddling with the machinesor with the whole approach, which would affect many states, which is whatthe Texas challenge is about. We'll see.BAIER:  Susan, today was really dominated at the White House with thisvaccine summit which, no matter what side you're on, is really impressiveas far as the logistics, to be able to hit this mark before the end of theyear. And the question is whether President Trump is going to get creditfor it.SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, "USA TODAY":  President Trump tried totake credit for it today, and it is a huge achievement. It's an achievementfor the administration, for the scientists involved for the companies. It'ssomething that we're all grateful for. But it was really striking when youcontrasted a split screen today where you had President Trump talking aboutthe success of the vaccine, great days ahead in the spring. You had JoeBiden almost simultaneously unveiling his health team and talking about thedifficult weeks ahead in December and January and February before mostAmericans will have gotten vaccines -- gotten the vaccine, and while thenumber of coronavirus cases continues to rise and rise, the death toll justgets bigger. His focus on bracing people for tough times. President Trump'sfocus was on taking credit, deservedly so, for the vaccines.BAIER:  Guy, speaking of that, the split screen look, Joe Biden wants tohave masks in federal buildings, interstate travel. He wants to havegovernors and mayors do the same. Also wants to have at least 100 millionCOVID-19 vaccines in the first 100 days. If you do the math by listening tothe CVS and Walgreens guys and all of the people at the summit today,that's going to happen as it stands right now.BENSON:  Yes. So it's nights to set a goal on vaccines that has basicallyalready been fulfilled for you by all the hard work of your predecessor andthen, of course, all the other components and people who contributed toOperation Warp Speed.I have to say, Bret, that I had to catch myself today because I was lookingover at the U.K. and seeing the images of some of these senior citizensover there being immunized, and one of those vaccines, I believe Pfizer hasalready been approved there, and our meeting of the FDA to make that finalhere is still in a few days.And I'm sitting around saying this is kind of frustrating to watch, thatanother advanced country, our close ally, is already there. There arealready injections happening. Every day counts. And you have to -- even ifthat's true, maybe there is a little too much bureaucracy. I just forcemyself to take a step back and just marvel at the fact that this is avaccine that is safe and massively effective on a scale and a timeframethat was literally unheard of ever before. And maybe that tempers myimpatience just a little bit, because once there is a new reality, thenyou're impatient all over again. But I think it's important to take amoment and acknowledge what a seismic achievement this is.BAIER:  Yes. And the Trump campaign put out a video saying all these peoplesaying it couldn't happen before the end of the year.I wanted to play one thing, Bill, and that is there is already pushback tosome of these choices by President-elect Biden. One of them is his Healthand Human Services secretary nominee. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  For secretary of health and education Inominate Xavier Bakaria (ph) -- you know, Xavier Besheara (ph), excuse me.SEN. MIKE BRAUN, (R-IN):  I'm going to meet with him and talk to him why hethinks he'd be good at that role. I know that he has got a heavy influencefrom the healthcare industry already in terms of contributions and so forthwithout a lot of experience.SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR):  I woke up this morning with a message for afriend in California who said that Xavier Becerra is so far to the left hemakes Bernie Sanders look like a Tea Partier. Xavier Becerra will be JoeBiden's nationwide lockdown enforcer. The Senate ought not to confirm him.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Those, Bill, are two Republicans, but there are Democrats pushingback to some of those choices.BENNETT:  Yes, absolutely. No background in health policy. He is checking abox. Hispanic, check, left-winger, check. But this is not a goodappointment. The guy is not qualified for this job.On the other hand, I'm a bit of a dissident with both Republicans andDemocrats. General Austin, who may be heading to the Defense Department, Ithink there is a problem with his calling the ISIS group junior, or flashin the pan. But, I've have never bought this civilian control of themilitary means you can't have a general at the Pentagon. Why not havesomebody there who knows what the heck he's doing, and maybe General Austindoes.We've had four presidents who were generals, at least four presidents.Washington, Grant, Jackson, Eisenhower, and there are others. And they didpretty well. And civilian control means civilian control. It doesn't meanthe guy can't have not served. And I think having that experience, if theguy checks out in terms of his background and his decisions, would be agood idea, not a bad idea.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much.When we come back, the brighter side of things.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, sending joy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you. I appreciate it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It made me feel beautiful.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you all for making the videos that we watched.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  When the pandemic struck, high school student Hita Gupta wanted tohelp some of those most affected, so the 16-year-old from Pennsylvania hasused her nonprofit Brighten a Day to make senior care residents in need ofcheer. And with help of volunteers Hita is delivering uplifting cards andcheerful videos to seniors around the world. That's awesome. Thanks forinviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair,balanced and still unafraid. One day closer. And here is Martha.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
