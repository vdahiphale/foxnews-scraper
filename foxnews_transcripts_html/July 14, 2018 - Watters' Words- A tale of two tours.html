JESSE WATTERS, HOST, "WATTERS' WORLD": Welcome to "Watters' World," I'm Jesse Watters. A tale of two tours - that is the subject of tonight's "Watters' Words." Before Barack Obama was elected President, he flew to Europe, the socialist crowds loved him, and he said this.

Enter Donald Trump. Here he is in Europe on his America First tour urging our NATO allies to pay their bills. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Many countries are not buying they should and frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back. We are protecting all of these countries and then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where they paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, we are supposed to protect you against Russia, but they are paying billions of dollars into Russia, and I think that's very inappropriate and Germany will have almost 70% of their country controlled by Russia with natural gas. On top of that, Germany is just paying a little bit over 1%. Whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2% of a much larger GDP, so I think that's inappropriate also.

        }
      
This has been brought up by other President, but other Presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved. But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country. It's very unfair to our taxpayers.

I also remember Barack Obama actually alienating our allies and the media saying nothing. Remember, he was caught tapping Angela Merkel's cell phone. He was caught trashing Netanyahu.

SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST: I love it, Jesse. I mean, imagine if you are a member of a club where 80% of the club members aren't paying their dues, and you get stuck with the bill. I mean, that's NATO since the end of the Cold War. Out of 29 members, only six of them, including America actually pays more than 2% of their GDP on defense.

It's the freeloader complex, and it's got to end and instead of fancy press statements and protocol, the President goes there and on camera calls them out and gets commitments, and also does what?

WATTERS: Because past Presidents, Nigel, probably said these things behind closed doors. Never anybody said this out loud in front of the cameras like this. He kind of reminds me of the guy when the bill comes at the restaurant with a group of people, he goes through the bill and itemizes it out and says, "You know what? You had the steak, you had the wine, I didn't have any wine, I just had a salad. Let's play this thing fair and square." 
NIGEL FARAGE, FORMER UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER: Yes, but the media that you are talking about, basically, you are seen as virtuous and good if you denigrate your own country, if you give away as much of your taxpayers' money as you possibly can. And if you make sure that democratic decisions are transferred from your country to somebody else, and the Germany thing is really interesting. 
I mean, here is Trump calling out German hypocrisy, and worth remembering that the former German Chancellor now works for, you've guessed it, a Russian gas company. And yet Obama wanted Germany to be the dominant new force in the United States of Europe run by the sour faced Mrs. Merkel.

Let me ask you guys a hypothetical question and I'll stasrt with you, Dr. Gorka.

She goes and meets Lavrov, this complete Cold War warrior Foreign Minister of Russia and he just eats her lunch. She comes with this cheesy plastic button and says "Hey, let's reset our relations." And he goes, "It is not translated properly. It says overcharge, not reset." I mean, he made a fool of her - an absolute fool of her, and we wanted her - somebody wanted her to be President? Look, I don't care what god you pray to, if he was out there, but November 8, 2016 is proof that God exists because Donald Trump won that election.

WATTERS: That's true, and Nigel, very powerful images over there that are being broadcast all over the world of President Trump walking with the Queen. A very formal ceremony, which I thought was quite touching and special, and they really rolled out the red carpet. 
And to see those images of our President shaking hands with the queen and being saluted the way he was saluted, I think shows the American people and the world something very strong and very powerful and very special. Would you agree?

And that for him today, you know, it would have been one of the highlights of his Presidency. He will have loved it. I have no idea what they talked about, between them, but it would have been a really wonderful thing for him. His mother who of course was born in Scotland was a big fan of this Queen. 
And if you think about it, in a way, they were the world's two most famous people sitting down for tea in Windsor Castle. After all that I saw in London today, with this mob of protesters, and by the way, only one person that the protesters hate more than Donald Trump and that's me, that's why I've taken some abuse today. I had to escape through a few fire exits, but a nice way for the formal trip to end, tea with the queen.

I think outside of Anderson Cooper watching it and the people who are forced to watch it in airports, nobody is watching CNN. So the President is absolutely right.

FARAGE: Yes, it's a question virtue signaling. The virtuous rolled out on the streets of London today, and most of them that were there come from upper middle class families. They've got rich mummies and daddies. They don't go to work. They have names like Sebastian and Nigel - well, there you are, well, I'm sorry, it's sad, but it's true. Sebastian, Geokasta, Hugo - and they are all frightfully jolly nice, and isn't this Trump chap simply ghastly. And they don't mean a thing.

GORKA: Look, Nigel, I was Sebastian a long time ago. Forty seven years ago, thanks to my mum. Let's recognize the people who love him being there. So, Nigel is right. These people are irrelevant. But when I grew up in West London in Wheeling, when I heard that a pop in hammer-smith is renaming itself, "The Trump Arms" in honor of the President's visit, you know that the salt of the earth Brit loves this man. He's a straight shooter. The Scots love him, so forget about the chattering classes. They are the reason that Brexit happened and they are the reason Trump won. 
WATTERS: And the chattering classes are going to be chattering quite a bit because the President is going to be sitting down with Vladimir Putin. And kind of on the eve of this summit with the Russian leader, Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General here comes out with big news that he is indicting a bunch of Russians for hacking the DNC and Hillary and all of this stuff. What do you make about the timing of this? And Sebastian, will this come of anything since I guess these Russians are part of the Intel service over there. They are never going to step foot here in the United States. What do you think? 
GORKA: Well, look, I've just started reading the indictment. It's probably as irrelevant as the last one that Robert Mueller's team dropped. If you are indicting Russian nationals on Russian soil and Russian companies registered in Russia, that's not going to lead anywhere.

The fact is, we've had 420 days of the Mueller investigation with not one indictment connected to Russia and the Trump campaign. It's just - it's all smoke and mirrors. Rod Rosenstein is an arch-bureaucrat swamp dweller. It's not really, really something that's going to make America safer. 
WATTERS: All right, Nigel, really quick, what do you think about the Trump-Putin summit? 
FARAGE: We've discovered that 12 spies were spying. Kind of it's what they do. It's their job, and I'll tell you something, to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mails, you did not need to be a rocket scientist, did you?

REP. TREY GOWDY, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: And then, on August 8, you still hadn't interviewed anyone. You are eight days into your Russian collusion with the Trump campaign investigation and you got another text from your colleague, Lisa Page. "Trump's not ever going to become President, right? Right?" And you replied, "No, no he's not. We'll stop it." By the time you promised to stop him from becoming President on August 8, how many interviews had you conducted? 
PETER STRZOK, FBIT AGENT: Mr. Gowdy, so two answers to that. One with regard to how many interviews had or had not been conducted, I have been direct by counsel for the FBI not to answer that question. 
GOWDY: I don't give a dam what you appreciate, Agent Strzok, I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus work on two major investigations here in 2016. I don't care when it was written. I don't care whether it was long hand or cursive. I don't care about any of that. I want to know what it meant, Agent Strzok. 
STRZOK: It would be his candidacy for the presidency and since that the American population.
GOWDY: Yes, it's not that tough.

WATTERS: Joining me now, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and Fox News contributor, Kim Strassel. Kim, this feels like torture watching this thing. He wouldn't say anything about the investigation and denied he was biased at all. I mean, what a mess? 
KIM STRASSEL, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOUNRAL: Yes, you know, the funny thing is that even though it was Peter Strzok in the hot seat. What struck me was that there was actually two more powerful players in that room both working to protect Peter Strzok from having to answer any questions. One was the FBI, which as you just heard in that clip, there was a lawyer who sat behind him the entire time, directed him not to answer anything that had to do with the Russia investigation. So this is the FBI continuing to obstruct Congressional oversight, and the other were Democrats with a whole new strategy for shutting down oversight - that interrupt and call points of order. It was crazy. 
WATTERS: This an actual strategy, and I know that this happens because they do this when it gets really tough. They get in there beforehand and they say, "When something gets really to the heart of what the Republicans are getting at, and it's starting to look really dicey for Peter Strzok, we're going to start screaming, calling for order, saying all kind of ridiculous things and causing mayhem in order to distract and prevent punches from being landed," but you mentioned before about these lawyers that are sitting in the background. 
You can't - he was asked, you know, "Are you biased, are you biased?" He says, "I'm not biased." And then the Republicans say, "Okay, prove that you are not biased," and they ask a question about the investigation and he's told, "I can't answer a question about my investigation." So, you never get to the bottom of anything. 
STRASSEL: Well, and that gag order was obviously bogus from the start because listen, by the end of this, that FBI lawyer and probably Christopher Wray was watching this back in headquarters could tell that the Republicans were at the end of their rope and about to lose it, and so they actually did allow Strzok to answer some questions. Why couldn't that have happened at the start? What other areas is it perfectly fine for him to be able to talk about it. They just don't want Congress to have any details about this investigation. 
WATTERS: They are obviously hiding something because they are withholding documents and they've basically put a gag order on Strzok for anything having to do with the investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, personally, I was struck by Strzok's demeanor. I thought he was arrogant. I thought he didn't show a lot of respect, and I thought he didn't think he need to be bothered by these people. He's going all over the internet viral by some of these ridiculous and bizarre expressions that he made. How do you think he conducted himself in terms of temperament and optics during the hearing? 
STRASSEL: It's hard to see how the average American, how he did himself any favors. Look, this is a guy who has embarrassed and humiliated the FBI with the text messages he sent out. And, yet he showed no humility, no regret, no contrition for that. He was not just - came across as somewhat arrogant, but he was disrespectful to the members of Congress who had the temerity to question him about those, and he actually lectured Congress at some point when they actually had the right to even ask questions about an investigation. 
And Bob Goodlatte, the head of the Judiciary Committee had to remind him. He goes, "In case you have forgotten, we, Congress created the FBI and you don't get to tell us when we answer questions." 
WATTERS: I mean Strzok thinks he's got a super hero cape on. He is this big crusader to protect America, meanwhile, he hates half of America because he said, "I can smell the Trump support in Southern Virginia." He was called out about that, too. Didn't have a great answer there. They actually made Peter Strzok read some of the texts, which was pretty funny. Let's watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STRZOK: "OMG, he's an idiot. Trump is a disaster. I have no idea how destabilizing his presidency would be."

WATTERS: Okay, so now he's claiming that he's not biased. Watch this effort to that end. Go. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STRZOK: After months of investigations, there simply is no evidence of bias in my professional actions. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: You know what this remind me of, Kimberly? This would be like, and I can't think of a better analogy, and I hate to do this, Jim Acosta at CNN. So, Jim Acosta is yelling at the president. He's investigating the president. He hates the president, disparages the president all the time. And then, he has the gall to say, "You know what? I'm non-biased. I don't have any bias in my reporting at all. I am straight shooter and my personal bias has never affected my work."

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
STRASSEL: Well, this is why I like being an opinion writer because I don't have to pretend that I don't have opinions. But you know, the reality is, look - I mean, when you watched Peter Strzok there, and he's reading those texts and you read those texts, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how dismissive they are of Trump voters, exactly what he meant when he said them. So, then when he then goes to try to justify them and at the same time says, "I'm honorable and I never tell a lie, and I do not lie under oath," it just becomes that much harder to believe him. 
WATTERS: He's unbelievable, and you don't believe him. Kimberly, I've got to run. I'm sure, we'll see more of this guy later. 
STRASSEL: Thank you. 
WATTERS: Up next, shocking violence south of the border and an incredible video of Antifa classing with ICE agents, wow. And later, road rage, what the heck is happening in America? 
ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live From "America's News Headquarters," I'm Robert Gray. The top US diplomats saying President Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin should meet as planned Monday; this despite new charges that 12 Russian intelligence officers hacked into Democratic e-mail accounts during the 2016 presidential election. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters on his flight back from Mexico last night that he is confident the meeting will quote "Put America in a better place." Pompeo is scheduled to be in Helsinki for the Trump- Putin Summit, Monday. 
The Israeli military unleashing the largest daytime airstrikes in four years on the Gaza strip after Hamas fired dozens of rockets into Israel throughout the day. The Palestinian Ministry says, two teenagers were killed and several Israelis were wounded. Israel says the strikes targeted military strikes and Gaza civilians were warned to stay away from the areas. I'm Robert Gray. 
WATTERS: As illegal immigrants pour into the United States, violence continues to surge south of the border. The Mexican drug cartels are tightening their grip on the country, killing off more than 100 politicians alone in the run-up to Mexico's recent election. Cartels fighting to take over for captured drug lord El Chapo. This was the Mexican Army's raid on his hideout.

WATTERS: Joining me now, editor, townhall.com and Fox News contributor, Katie Pavlich. Katie, I don't even know if anybody knows this, but Mexico in 2017, most violent year on record, and it's just the homicide kingdom south of the border down there and that's what's causing a lot of the violence and a lot of the smugglers and the drug traffickers to pour across the southern border. 
KATIE PAVLICH, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: Yes, Jesse, I'm really glad that you are talking about this on your show because Mexico and the crisis there with the homicides, we're not just talking about regular homicides, we're talking about heinous acts of violence like boiling people in acid while they are still alive, delivering the heads of police officers and police chiefs to police departments as a warning, hanging bodies from bridges in Mexico. These are things that are happening all the time, and based on the numbers that you just talked about, it really is a crisis. 
The first thing I want to point out is the video you showed from El Chapo's lair, so to speak, let's not forget that the Obama Justice Department trafficked a 0.50 caliber rifle that was found during the investigation of that lair and where he was hiding out after he was arrested. That's the first thing. And the second thing is ... 
WATTERS: That was the fast and furious - that botched gun running operation. 
PAVLICH: Exactly, and the second thing is, while we don't see the violence flowing over into the United States on the level that we are seeing in Mexico, thank God, it does have an impact on ranchers living across the border, Border Patrol agents who are risking their lives every single day and by the way, in the streets of American cities including Chicago, and nobody likes to talk about the fact that the Sinaloa cartel is one of the main reasons that Chicago has so much violence and perpetuates the drug problem that we have in the United States. 
WATTERS: Right, and the cartels, they are the ones that are doing the human trafficking and the smuggling because they get paid a $5,000.00 bounty per head when they have these young people cross the border. Now, we just got some statistics, you know how they had to separate families because of the massive influx. They are reuniting some families, some of the "families," they can't reunite because listen to this, Katie. I mean, dozens of them aren't their parents. 
One is a child abuser, the other wanted to send the young person to a sexually abusive relative. Some of them have criminal history including child cruelty, murder and human trafficking. These are the people that have been separated from these young central and south American minors and that's for that reason alone.

PAVLICH: Right, Jesse, I actually wrote a story for townhall.com a couple of weeks ago when we were at the height of the hysteria surrounding the separation of families at the border. I interviewed a former ICE agent who actually blew the whistle, his name is Jason Piccolo, he blew the whistle in 2014 during the Obama administration and talked about how they were releasing unaccompanied minor children to sex offenders, to sexual abusers, to people in the United States who had been in the country illegally, but also previously convicted of these crimes. 
And so, we hear a whole bunch about parents, but really, the billion dollar smuggling industry thrives on our open border process of catch and release because smugglers are paid to pair up children with strangers. And if you look at the statistics, there are a lot of single men coming across the border with children. And you had Elizabeth Warren a week ago accusing the President of having to do DNA tests because he was ripping children from mother's arms. 
Now, they are having to do DNA tests, which aren't always the best implication by the way that people are actually related to their parents.
WATTERS: Yes, and Katie, being open border.
PAVLICH: Maybe they are doing that because they have been put with smugglers and into horrible trafficking situations, so I am not sure why the left isn't concerned about that considering it's such a massive (inaudible).
(CROSSTALK) 
WATTERS: Well, there should be because they are pro-children and being open borders is being pro cartel. They don't even realize that. 
PAVLICH: Absolutely. 
WATTERS: You brought up ICE, and I quickly want to show this video. This is Antifa out in Portland confronting ICE agents using some really disgusting language. Listen to this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: [Bleep]. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will laugh on your grave. You are a [bleep]. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: You can't even show the whole thing because they used the "N" word when they were talking about the black ICE agent. Unbelievable, and now this is going mainstream within the Democratic Party. They really want to abolish ICE in some level of that party, and it's just really despicable if you ask me. 
PAVLICH: Yes, it's disgusting, you know, ICE agents are regular every day Americans who want to serve their country and protect the communities that they are in. It would be interesting to see how people felt. I'm sure Antifa doesn't care because they are almost as bad as drug cartels to be quite frank. Communities - how they would care if ICE immigration was not in there getting out the criminal elements. They combat sex trafficking and they combat drug paraphernalia. 
WATTERS: Yes, they do everything. 
PAVLICH: They do everything. 
WATTERS: No one knows that. They just think they are just a bunch of goons on the southern border.
PAVLICH: And for little pay the way. This is not a high-paying job.
 (CROSSTALK) 
WATTERS: Right, and there's 20,000 ICE agents that are serving their country trying to do their job and I think they deserve a lot more respect than what we just saw. Katie.
PAVLICH: One thing we should put out really quickly.
WATTERS: Got to run now.
PAVLIC: The Democrats had a bill that they wanted to abolish ICE and then they brought up to the four Republicans who said, "Okay, let's vote for it." They're not voting against it. 
WATTERS: Yes, it's political suicide. 
PAVLICH: Put your money where your mouth is. 
WATTERS: Exactly, and the smart ones realized that. 
PAVLICH: Exactly. Thanks, Jesse. 
WATTERS: You're welcome and happy birthday. 
PAVLICH: Oh, thank you. 
WATTERS: Left-wing comic George Lopez pulls a disturbing stunt on Trump's Hollywood star. Diamond and Silk here to react. 
After this week's hearing what Peter Strzok, the disgraced FBI agent became a meme. His bizarre and arrogant facial expressions spread throughout the internet like this one. Joining me now, Diamond and Silk. All right, ladies, I mean, you probably watched this. How could you not? It was a marathon that probably lasted close to seven hours. He didn't come off too well, did he? 
DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: Oh no, he didn't. 
SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: No. 
DIAMOND: You know, he almost was like a vile, vicious, malicious creepy little boy that gets into things. No, he didn't come off well. Listen, we want answers. We want answers from him. He's biased. He made the FBI look crazy. We don't trust him or the FBI. And you know what? He is a criminal in our eyesight and he needs to be locked up. 
WATTERS: He acted exactly how I thought he was going to act based on the text messages that he sent. Let's talk about George Lopez. Now, this guy used to have a nice career, I guess, I mean, he was a pretty decent stand- up comic and actor for a while, so TMZ caught him doing something pretty nasty at the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Donald Trump's star. Watch this. 
I mean, maybe that's comedy. I don't know, should I not take it seriously, ladies? What do you think? 
DIAMOND: Well, we took it serious. Now, we know that urinating in public is a crime. But pretending to urinate in public, it's not funny. It makes you a gutter bug is what it makes you. 
SILK: That's right. 
DIAMOND: He's a nasty foul gutter slime is what he is. And what he needs to do - let me tell you what he needs to do, he needs to do what he told everybody he was going to do back in 2015 if President Trump became the President. He need to leave the country because he's so foul and so nasty, he is no longer funny. We don't want to see him no more because he's disgusting. 
SILK: And that's why we call him a sewer sucker because there's so much sugar honey, I see, that flows from him. 
DIAMOND: That's right. 
WATTERS: All right, I guess Lopez has to go to Canada if he's going to be a man of his world. Also, the star of "Seinfeld," Jerry Seinfeld was talking to one of my favorite actors, Zach Galifianakis and surprisingly both of them think this political correctness BS has gone way too far. You can't even say anything, especially on college campuses. This is what they had to say. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
JERRY SEINFELD, AMERICAN ACTOR: It's so weird that colleges have become these places where - of restrictive thought as opposed to thought freedom. 
ZACH GALIFIANAKIS, AMERICAN ACTOR: Well, there is nothing liberal about shutting someone up. 
SEINFELD: The problem with not allowing intolerant talk is it's, now you are intolerant. 
GALIFIANAKIS: Well, how do you judge what intolerant is? 
SEINFELD: Exactly. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: I mean that sounds like a "Fox & Friends" segment. What's going on with these Hollywood people? Are they finally seeing the light? 
DIAMOND: Well, some have probably finally seen the light. Listen, when you restrict other voices, your voices can become restricted, too where people can restrict you. Leave people's freedom of speech alone. Let people be able to voice their opinions about things. We're going to have to agree to disagree. I'm so happy that they are talking about this, and this is not a closeted conversation. It's out in the open. We need to talk about this and we need to not politicize shows, but show stuff like this here, well, listen, on either side of the aisle people have a right to their freedom of speech, so we love it. 
SILK: And we also need to let the liberals know, it is not okay to terrorize people. It is not okay to take away their free speech or their rights to even eat in public. 
WATTERS: That's right. We all need to chow down in public without someone yelling something. All right, ladies, I will see you guys next week. 
DIAMOND: All right. 
SILK: All right. 
WATTERS: Coming up, the craziest surveillance footage you are ever going to see. "Watters' World" is watching you. 
Surveillance video making headlines this week, an enraged customer at a restaurant in Milwaukee walked into a kitchen, sucker punches a female employee and is ready to keep going until a pistol-packing coworker scares him off. Joining me now, the co-host of "Fox & Friends First," Jillian Mele. All right, Jillian, what the heck happened here? This is really dangerous. 
JILLIAN MELE, CO-HOST, "FOX AND FRIENDS FIRST": This was really dangerous. This apparently - the suspect is apparently a regular at this restaurant. He was very unhappy with how long the server was taking with his food and went right back there and decided to literally punch her in the face. 
WATTERS: Wait, he went and attacked the chef because the food wasn't coming out soon enough? 
MELE: He was unhappy with the time it was taking, yes. This happened in Milwaukee and as you can see, the coworker there didn't even flinch it looks like. 
WATTERS: Wow, I mean, that's a hard right across the face. 
MELE: I know. 
WATTERS: She didn't even go down. 
MELE: No, and the other woman didn't even flinch. 
WATTERS: Amazing, I mean, and that's why women and men, too, have concealed carry permits because if things like this - thank God, she was armed.
MELE: I know. 
WATTERS: Something even worse could have happened. 
MELE: And the employer does allow folks who have concealed permits to be able to carry their guns and in this case, it obviously ended up being a good thing. 
WATTERS: Now, if you just waited a little longer for his eggs and his bacon, this never would have happened. 
MELE: You've got to be patient. 
WATTERS: You've got to be patient when the food comes out. Now, this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. 
MELE: Ever? 
WATTERS: This is a surveillance - one of - this is some surveillance video out of Canada, I believe. Watch this. Okay, so what was going on here? She was running away and she tried for an escape route and that didn't work out. 
MELE: Right, so, obviously if you are using a stolen credit card to buy a soda, you get caught, right? You're going to hide in the ventilation system? No? Am I wrong about this? 
WATTERS: Was she trying to escape through the ventilation system in the ceiling or was she trying to just hide out in there? 
MELE: I don't know if she was trying to get out of the building that way or if she was trying to hide, but regardless, what ended up happening is, boom, on to the ground and she gets caught. 
WATTERS: Where did she fall into? Was that like - what were they selling in that aisle? I mean that was a pretty.
MELE: Something that they are not selling anymore. 
WATTERS: That was a hard fall. And good for her, she showed a little toughness, that's for sure, but she is behind bars. Now, this is some funny video. This is an Apple store, and usually the Apple stores are pretty calm and everybody has to wait forever. 
MELE: And pretty crowded. 
WATTERS: Yes. To get their stuff. This is a bunch of bandits run in with some hoodies, steal, what? Thousands of dollars' worth of Apple products. 
MELE: Thirty six items totaling $27,000.00 from an Apple store, this was in Fresno. But like, look, if you are going to steal something, would you think let me go into a crowded Apple store where there's all of these people around and they're going to probably try and stop me? 
WATTERS: Did they catch these guys or not? 
MELE: I don't think so. 
WATTERS: So, these guys are still on the loose? 
MELE: Well, to my knowledge, I could be wrong, tweet me if I'm wrong, but someone tried to block the door and they just ran right past. 
WATTERS: All right, some high tech thieves. Now, one of the most bizarre videos, this was a thief who busted in somewhere trying to conceal his face. Now, if you look closely, it's not your hoodie, like the guys in the Apple video. 
MELE: Nope. 
WATTERS: Take a look, what is he wearing, Jillian, on his head? 
MELE: It looks like a pair of blue underwear. 
WATTERS: Those boxer briefs, I think. 
MELE: I hope he did laundry that morning. 
WATTERS: It doesn't really obscure his whole face. 
MELE: It does not. So, actually, the police department where this happened in Texas posted this video online, on Facebook saying, "If you know this guy, give us some information," and lot of the comments were like, "Does he realize even though he tried to hide his face, his fingerprints are all over the place?" Like, come on, dude. 
WATTERS: Maybe, get some boxer briefs and some gloves might have been a better idea. All right, Jillian, go, Eagles. 
MELE: Yes. 
WATTERS: All right, we'll see you soon. Up next, red light road rage. Lock your doors, America. 
Time now for "Last Call." A crazy scene in Florida last week as road rage spilled out to the street during a red light. The brawl caught on camera. 
By the time the cops arrived, everyone involved in the fight was gone, but two of the young women were eventually arrested on aggravated battery charges. Now, I'm going to go out on a limb here, the fight was probably over a guy. They usually are. Look at the girl in the green. My God, sign her up. My goodness. You have got to lock your doors people. I mean, you can't let someone get into the car like that at a red. You've got to keep those doors locked. Little advice. Not that that's ever happened to me before. 
That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. "Justice with Judge Jeanine" is up next and remember I'm Watters and this is my world.
