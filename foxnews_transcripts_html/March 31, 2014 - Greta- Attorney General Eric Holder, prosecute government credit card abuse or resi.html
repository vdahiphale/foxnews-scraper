Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. If Attorney General Eric Holder doesn't have enthusiasm for his job to fight all crime, protect us, including our tax dollars, I say just go.
For reasons not totally unclear to me, Holder and the Justice Department are not prosecuting the postal service manager who got caught stealing $35,000. She is using her government credit card for gambling, rental cars, personal things and each wrongful use of her credit card is a separate felony. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, why isn't she and everyone else being slapped with a grand jury indictment? That's Holder and the justice department's job. An indictment would fix this postal service manage wagon and anyone else who is tempted to do the same. Also, having some videos and handcuffs, that would put a lid on the stealing, discourage others from stealing, too. And one other thing, why is the government issuing credit cards? That is so crazy. That's not how we do it at Fox or most private businesses. We use our own credit cards and submit receipts showing legitimate expenses and that we get reimbursed. That way, no stealing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't get the government. I don't get Attorney General Holder. Just get out and enforce the law. And don't tell me it's only $45,000. It's a crime, 45,000 or 45 million, it's all stealing. I suspect that's the tip of the iceberg. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
