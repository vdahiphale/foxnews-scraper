Left Out in the Cold 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

White House press secretary Robert Gibbs has upset more Democrats with comments dismissing what he called the "professional left."
Gibbs blasted progressives for never being satisfied with what President Obama has done in office, telling The Hill, "I hear these people saying he's like George Bush. Those people ought to be drug tested. I mean it's crazy." He went on to lament, "They will be satisfied when we have Canadian health care and we've eliminated the Pentagon. That's not reality." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It didn't take long before Gibbs was forced to clarify his remarks, telling The Huffington Post that he was "in-artful" and that he and other Democrats need to "stop fighting each other and arguing about our differences." But he didn't win over Minnesota Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison, who called on Gibbs to resign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just last month, you may remember, Gibbs angered Democrats by saying there are enough contested House races for the majority party to possibly lose control of the House in the midterm elections. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Mr. Mayor?
It appears Levi Johnston may need a press secretary of his own soon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Johnston has moved on from his broken re-engagement to Bristol Palin to throw his hat into the political ring. His manager says Johnston is planning to run for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska as part of a new reality TV show. You may recall his almost-mother-in-law Sarah Palin held that office before she was governor. The project is still in development, but is supposedly titled "Loving Levi: The Road to the Mayor's Office."
Swan Song 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And finally, some high school students attending a conservative leadership conference here in Washington, say they were told by a security guard to stop singing the national anthem during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Park Police confirm the students were in violation of federal law, because the area is supposed to be what they call "completely content neutral." But the national anthem?
A Park Police spokesman says President Lincoln would have wanted the area content neutral, but he did not say how he knows that.  </pre>
