'Off the Record', 4/28/14: I'm glad L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling got caught with his racist views and opened an important dialogue - but this is no time to pour gasoline on the fire of a potentially explosive situation

Let's go "Off the Record." I'm glad the L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling got caught. He got outed for what he is: He's a racist.
I'm for racists being out in the open, so they can be condemned, and not sneaking behind closed doors with possible like-minded other racists who might do harm to others. So good, I'm glad Sterling got caught. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And one other thing: This is not the time for some to grab what Sterling said, which is horrible, and run with it. Yes, racism exists. Yes, it is terrible, it is awful, but racism can be a two-way street. We need a good dialogue, an honest one. But that means not throwing gas on the fire. Reverend Sharpton, are you listening? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
