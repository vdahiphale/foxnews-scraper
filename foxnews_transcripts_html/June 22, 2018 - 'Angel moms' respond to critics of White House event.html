LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is "the Ingraham Angle." We end the week with some of the most moving and heart-breaking stories you will ever hear. Three angel moms are here with me tonight, separated from their children forever, by an epidemic of illegal immigrant crime. Meanwhile Fox News has learned that Russia probe between Congress and the DOJ may come to a head tonight. And in Friday Follies, Raymond Arroyo explains the thinking behind the relaunch of "Roseanne" without Roseanne, that's going to work. 
But first, the total emotional manipulation by the over the current border crisis. It was the image that shocked the conscience of the nation, or so the media told us. A little girl separated from her asylum seeking mother at the border crying her eyes out, it was heart-breaking. It was said to symbolize a cruel and heartless Trump Policy and the June 12 photo of the two year old from Honduras went viral on news coverage around the world.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Words like callous, soulless, craven, trunk said the New York Daily News. And the image of the child was so powerful TIME magazine paired it with the president to try and make, of course, a political statement.

LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: The first lady of the United States went to the border today which was a good thing but she did not accomplish as much as that little girl standing up to the First Lady's husband on the cover of TIME magazine. 
BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: The controversy that was happening at the border. It's made a lot of people, obviously, step back and assess what it means to be an American. And TIME magazine is doing it this way

Although ridiculed, many Trump supporters were skeptical of the image, and with good reason. Well the crying child was real but the story behind it was not. Her father said the girl and her mother were never separated and are still together at a family residential center run by ICE in Texas. Border Patrol agent Carlos Ruise explained why the girl was crying. 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
CARLOS RUISE, BORDER PATROL AGENT: I personally went up to the mother and asked her, "Are you doing okay, is the kid okay?" She said, "Yes, she's tired and thirsty". This is 11 o'clock at night.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

INGRAHAM: Here's another twist, Dennis Javiera Hernandez said his wife, Sandra, was seeking political asylum but in fact went to the US to find a good job. He also said she had already been deported from the United States. Despite the fact that ICE confirmed that the mother and child were never separated, incredibly, TIME magazine is still defending the cover. 
 While conceding that the original story misstated what happened, and that, "The girl was not carried away screaming by US Border Patrol."
TIME editor in chief Edward Felsenthal doubled down in the photo, insisting that the photo, "Became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment". So the magazine defends an emotional but totally misleading image because it makes their point toward their agenda. And I guess making the point of course is more important than reporting the facts, doing a little due diligence.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The image has become a potent prop in the left's continuing narrative that immigrant children are being held in something akin to concentration camps, internment camps et cetera. Well like this photogenic protest that was held at the capital yesterday featuring a dozen children in Mylar blankets, like those given kids at the border shelters. Well it's important that we do not blame the kids in protests like this one, they're kids. But we should blame the adults who use them in this way, turning them into pawns in a political struggle, through their own propaganda.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

Let's discuss the media's preference over emotion manipulation over the facts with Democratic strategist Joel Payne, Howard Kurtz, host of Fox News' Media Buzz and Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Gentlemen happy Friday. Howie, I've got to say when I first saw the image we were talking amongst our staff and I had to say, "I wonder if that child was actually separate from her parent?" And lo and behold, she wasn't. 
HOWARD KURTZ, "MEDIABUZZ" HOST: This is precisely why trust in the media is plummeting. Now I understand why TIME magazine, which usually runs an anti-Trump cover every other week or so, wanted that iconic image on the cover. Many of us had assumed that she had been separated from her mother but once that proved to be flat out false, TIME's editor should have had the candor and the common decency to say, "We were wrong, we made a mistake, we regret it". Not, "Well you know, it's perfectly fine because it's a metaphor for the entire controversy".  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Well when we Conservatives make mistakes, we are driven through threats and intimidation and we apologise. Like I'm not perfect, I've made mistakes on air. And you apologize and say, "You know, I shouldn't have said that". When you're on the air as much as I am you're going to say stuff like, oh I was tired. When they screw this up Krikorian, I've got to tell you, it goes right to the core about what so many of us know goes unreported, selective reporting by the media. They'll report one series of sad stories but completely ignore the chaos and the carnage on the other side of the immigration debate, which we're going to get to later in the show with the angel moms. 
MARK KRIKOREAN, CENTRE FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: This kind of thing happens all the time ad it's not even an immigration thing. This is part of basically a long history of what you might call atrocity propaganda. You know the Germans invaded Belgium and the people were saying, "Well they're bayonetting babies and they're raping Nuns". It was a political point to create moral panic and stampede people. Remember during the Bush administration, the supposed epidemic of church burnings? Again, made up, fake for political purposes this is just part of that same political strategy.

STEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC ANCHOR: Help us understand what this kind of damage does to these young people because they are going to be a member of society and it makes me think, "Where do you think MS-13 was born?" In Los Angeles, where often see these angry gangs sprout up and I'm worried that we're creating terminator-like character that will seek vengeance. We must care.

INGRAHAM: If we enforce our immigration laws, people who cross the border, not through a normal port of entry, but just walking across the border, if we enforce out laws we're risking creating terminator-like characters. 
JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm sure I'm not the only person here whose not outraged that there are 2,300, 2,300 children--

He says there should be border but there should be absolutely no penalty for crossing the border because then if you penalize someone, you're a Nazi, you're putting people in internment camps, you're going to concentration camps and anyone who voted for Trump is a Nazi. That's where the left is and that's why they're going to get killed in the 2020.

So this is part of a pattern to display false images or misleading images to stampede people against immigration at the border. 
INGRAHAM: Andrew Hannon is a federal district court judge in Brownsville, Texas. In 2013, he had to hear one of the cases, it was a case about a human trafficker that had been aided and abetted by a parent in the United States who had already been deported once out of the United States. This is what he wrote, "By fostering an atmosphere where illegal aliens are encourage to pay human smugglers for further services, the government is only allowing them to fund the illegal and evil activities of these cartels, but it is also inspiring them to do. By virtue of this DHS Policy under Obama, American citizens are helping fund these evil ventures with their tax dollars".

And that was 2013 in Texas federal district court. We are creating a perverse incentive Joel, where because in order to enforce our laws means okay, we are horrible, awful, rotten Nazi internment camp, according to you, so anytime you imprison someone, it's an internment camp. So if it's an internment camp, your choice is being called a Nazi, or you put people in internment camps, according to Joel. Or you aid and abet the cartel which are getting, Mark, you know this, 15 to 20,000 per person to bring them the border correct?
KRIKORIAN: Yes. What we are doing here is specific to people who bring children, this is the important thing. The percentage of people the border patrol are arresting who have kids with them has been increasing significantly. It was three percent, just three percent of all arrests in 2013, eighteen percent of arrests in 2017, last month it was one quarter of all the people at the border.
INGRAHAM: What is Judge Hannon saying here? He's saying policy encourages individuals to bring children and in 13% of the time, according to DHS, they're not even their children. They're being picked up along the way because it is, as another person said, a fast pass into the country. 
PAYNE: There is a mature way to enforce our borders and enforce our rules. By the way, Barack Obama did it. So the fact that Donald Trump lies every week and says there's an immigration crisis, you want to know what the crisis is? The one he created this week by creating a ridiculous family separation policy. That's what the truth is. Now, that might not be convenient but that's actually the truth.

INGRAHAM: Susan Bannon isn't in the White House anymore but nice try. Howie the American media has to be even handed. I think you can do fair criticism, as you said, in the way the White House decided to roll this out. They didn't get ready for the images are powerful and no one wants to see a child crying. No one wants to see a mother, any mother, that girl on the time magazine. You know when I see her, I see the thousands of kids that I've seen in Guatemala, on the streets, in villages, in orphanages. Just to get a hug, they're happy, to have a ball, someone to lay with them makes them happy. They're desperate for attention, love and sometimes food. To see that picture is a heart-breaking thing as a mother. 
KURTZ: And as a father. And when the president did end the separations and of course there are still separations to be reunited, instead of the press saying, "Well, you know, no at least he's doing the right thing," in their view, it was, "Well it's too late, he should have done this", you know, they never give him the befit of the doubt. And just a quick word on the children in blankets at the center protest today, everybody has the right to protest but to use the kids as props says to me that some of these protesters are more interested in scoring political points and getting in front of the cameras-
ONGRAHAM: There were twelve kids, 12 or 13 years old. And one of them was very articulate, "President Trump is incarcerating these children". It was amazing, he was 12 years old, I don't think I could have said that 12. But it's something about using kids in a protest, I've never liked it--

CYNTHIA NIXON, D-CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR: ICE has strayed so far from its mission. It's supposed to here to keep Americans safe but what it's turned into is frankly a terrorist organization of its own that is terrorizing peoples who are coming into this country.
They have strayed so far from the interests of the American people, the interest of humanity. We need to abolish it

And she's not alone, NBC reports than 15 Democrat Congressional candidates are calling for the defunding or dismantling of Immigration Customs Enforcement. Back to my point, we don't want any borders right? No borders at all. Let's discuss this with Hector Garza, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council. 
So Hector I know you drove two hours to be on the show tonight. That's so inspiring, thank you so much, I know you've had a long day. When you hear ICE being described as a terrorist organization, and again she's a candidate for Senate but she being followed around by all these media folks because, of course, she's a former actress and so forth. But what runs through your mind, I think ICE and border patrol is like 50% Hispanic at this point so to hear Nazi concentration camp, internment camp, now terrorist organization, what's your reaction?

        }
      
HECTOR GARZA, VICE PRESIDENT NATIONAL BORDER CONTRO COUNCIL: Shame on her Laura. She's offending our law enforcement agents, not only the Ice agents but Border Patrol agents. These are the law enforcement agents that go out there every single day and risk their lives to serve the community, serve the American public and protect our country. It's just very, very unfortunate that she would be spreading this type of hateful rhetoric. 
INGRAHAM: On of the things that Han van Bykovsky wrote in the Heritage Foundation, I guess it was yesterday, Heritage Foundation website, he talked about who is responsible for this. Because the left says it's Donald Trump crisis, it's all Donald Trump, not one else is responsible, it's all Donald Trump. But I think a fair assessment, and the Trump administration made a decision that's to stop the crush at the border, we had to adopt zero tolerance, that's what their decision was. 
But other decisions made along the way Hector that you see every day, parents sending children alone on a 1,800 mile journey and parents deciding to bring children with them on a 1,800 mile journey through very dangerous territory to present themselves at a non-legal crossing into the United States. That is a responsibility that they decide to take on and there are consequences as they are in Mexico when they're caught crossing the border illegally. 
GARZA: So first of all, these parents that are bringing these kids over here, they're breaking the law. But not only are they breaking the law but they're also endangering their kids, when they bring their kids along the journey. And it's unfortunate because if we don't take action, we're going to continue to encourage illegal immigration. And by doing so, it's going to put all these people in danger. A lot of them are going to get killed, murdered, raped and a lot of them will not make it through Mexico because Mexico is a very dangerous country. And they are not doing enough to stop these crossings that are coming from Central America. 
Again, if we're going to care, let's care about illegal aliens not being placed trunks of vehicles. Let's care about illegal aliens not bring placed in the back of tractor trailers in 120 degree heat. Let's be real, let's go to the facts, not about this made up situation at the border which separated families. Unfortunately these people broke the law and they need to be held accountable and the people that are in these countries should not be coming here because they'll be breaking the laws as well. 
INGRAHAM: Hector what is your thought of what might happen with the numbers approaching the border now that the president has announced that there will not be separations of families. They didn't back off necessarily in the zero tolerance but they're not going to separate families. Do you think that will encourage more people to come or the news will take a while to get down to Central America? 
GARZA: So Laura, it's definitely going to increase. We saw it in 2014 under the Obama administration. Under the Obama administration, everyone was under catch and release. These people would cross the border, unaccompanied minors were crossing the border and we were releasing them into the country to the relatives. All that caused was more illegal immigration. More people making this dangerous journey from Central America and our resources being overwhelmed here in the United States.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Something that's very interesting Laura, during the Obama administration, the influx was so amazing, there was so much illegal crossings that a lot of the people that border patrol were detaining back then under the Obama administration, they didn't even have access to water, residence or food. Under the Trump administration, it is totally the opposite. People are being taken care of, they're being provided with medical services, they're being provided with food, with shelter with proper detention facilities. That wasn't happening during the Obama administration, that's happening now. 
INGRAHAM: All right Hector thank you so much. And Fox News has learned that a crucial moment in the oversight battle on the Russia probe may arrive tonight, we'll explain. Stay there. 
Fox News Catherine Herridge has learned that the show down between the Justice Department and Congress may come to a head tonight. She's reporting that the DOJ still has not given the Congressional investigators key documents about the beginning, the timing, of the beginning of the Russia investigation. Herridge says the DOJ will either ask tonight for more time or explain why it cannot comply with the Congressional subpoenas. 
Let's discuss the implications with judicial watch president Tom Fitton, attorney and RNC National Committee woman from California Harmeet Dhillon and Democratic strategist Scott Bolden. Great to see all of you. Let's start with you Harmeet, this has been a wild taffy pole regarding documents with the DOJ. I want to play for all of you my exchange a few days ago with Jeff Sessions on this very issue because we knew tonight it was going to come to a head, let's watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: They're out of patience. They feel like they have been asking these documents, some of these documents end up showing up in the IG report Congress asked for months and months and months ago. I mean you were in Congress, you know what's it's like to try to do oversight, it's really frustrating and they're going to hold Rosenstein in contempt. They're going to hold him contempt of Congress, then what?
JEFF SESSIONS, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well we have a responsibility to respond to Congress. We intend to be responsive to Congress if we're running behind in production we'll take efforts to step it up

INGRAHAM: Harmeet, big meeting last Friday and apparently they had a big come to Jesus moment Brian and Rosenstein and May, so far we haven't gotten the documents. 
HARMEET DHILLON, RNC COMMITTEEWOMAN FOR CALIFORNIA: I don't think they're running behind production Laura, I think they're running in the opposite direction with these documents. It is a travesty, the subpoena was actually exactly three months ago and the due date was two weeks after the subpoena, so it's two and half months late now. 
And we saw last week, Jim Jordan get very angry over the fact that the texts messages, that are the most damning ones, weren't given by the inspector general to the DOJ for production and there's no explanation as to why they were withheld. Documents have been given that have been heavily redacted, that are critical to analyzing the Pfizer issue so of the three topics of that subpoena, only one and a half has been satisfied at this point. 
The topics were the Hillary Clinton emails, the McCabe firing, which I think has been addressed now and the Pfizer thing is completely unaddressed. So what is the DOJ hiding, why are they hiding it and why is that the normal rules don't apply to them? It's really quite shocking. 
INGRAHAM: Scott I think what the concern is, is that we were told the investigation kind of began end of July, now they have new information that indicates it began before then. A lot of contact with the state department, with the Steele dossier. A lot of people at the state department were reading over the Steele dossier, I think that's the concern. I know you think this is much ado about nothing but give me some more context over this show down tonight. The showdown would be O.K. Corral about the document. 
SCOTT BOLDEN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I certainly don't think it's much to do about nothing but I also don't think DOJ is running from their responsibilities with the Congressional subpoena. Here's the deal Laura, okay there's a balance here as you know as a lawyer. Sure, we got to have Congressional compliance with subpoenas, at the same time we got two ongoing investigations, highly sensitive information including Pfizer warrants that go to a secret court.

        }
      
As well as all of these other documents that DOJ and FBI are concerned about turning over because they don't want to prejudice the investigations that are going on, the whole Mueller investigation. They don't want to give up the identity willy-nilly to their secret sources, or confidential sources, and then the president himself is a subject of this investigation, regardless of what he says, so there's got to be a balance. 
My concern here and I think what the DOJ's concern is, what happens when documents after I turn them over? Will they be politicized? Will Nunes run to the White House and share them? Those are real concerns based on fair conduct that he's GOP Chairman, those are fair balances and so they've got to resolve them. 
INGRAHAM: Oh come, you're still on that old trope? He's going to run over to the White House? The document's out, the White House will see it soon, I assume. I hear what you say but Tom, there's a reason-
BOLDEN: Well then tell the Republicans should stop fighting over documents. They control all the others. 
INGRAHAM: They want to know why this investigation was really started. Tom, the Mueller popularity's approval had gone down from 49% according to a CNN poll done in December. Now it's down to 41% and obviously Comey's numbers are in the toilet at 32% of people supporting him. Is it no wonder really that people are losing faith in this process, given what we're seeing?
TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH: Well everything that's come out has undermined the credibility of the Mueller investigation, and that's why we're getting this modified limited hangout approach to document production by the justice department. It's extraordinary to see this Justice Department attack and undermine. And the Democratic talking points aren't too far off from the Justice Department talking points in going after the oversight function of Congress.
Remember we have the allegations that Rosenstein threatened the criminal investigation because the oversight was too aggressive towards him and the Justice Department, but what are they hiding here?

INGRAHAM: Well you guys are always suing Freedom of Information Act to get documents. If they're so working overtime not to release these documents, why are hey not revealing what's in these documents? What's the reason? 
FITTON: It's going to highlight the political nature of the DOJ in getting in the Russia investigation--
INGRAHAM: Who knew what, when? Who knew what about this Dossier, correct?
FITTON: How, when and why. Not only the dossier but generally the targeting of Donald Trump which began even before the dossier was used by the Justice Department and the FBI, dossier created by the Clinton campaign. 
INGRAHAM: Now, the Daily Mail, Harmeet, camped out at the house Sally Moore, the FBI agent on the Hillary Clinton email, there she is. And she traded these anti-Trump with her FBI colleague lover, a lot of love going on there at the FBI, a lot of hooks ups over there. Aren't they a little busy, it's getting more interesting by the day. 
BOLDEN: Relationships of the FBI. 
INGRAHAM: Yes, exactly. I'm working at the wrong -- so since her name was revealed by Congress we know who she is. But she referred to Trump voters as retarded. She used the f-bomb when it comes to Trump. You have got these radical -- she looks like out of central casting of feminist from Dartmouth, like the old women's studies major at Dartmouth. Sorry. But come on, it's just textbook stuff. So if a conservative used the word "retarded," that's the end of their career. But she uses it in a text message and she is still working at the FBI.

DHILLON: Right, the problem here is the FBI leadership and DOJ leadership for that matter appear to be tone deaf to the bias that is very evident in the staffing of all of these investigations. I feel and I think a lot of other Americans feel like the inspector general report that we saw last week only scratches the surface. We don't know because he doesn't have subpoena power of a lot of stuff that's gone on there. There is a conspicuous absence of any text messages or emails from the Department of Justice. So that's a black box with the bias that's going on there. We saw a little bit of the bias of DOJ with this paralegal yesterday who moonlights as a protester at night at Mexican restaurants. 
INGRAHAM: Was at the Kirstjen Nielsen Mexican dinner. That was fun. 
DHILLON: Yes, exactly. They all have a right to their views. Let's be clear. They all have a right to private views and what have you. But where we have to draw the line is where people like Rod Rosenstein are staffing investigations or allowing -- 
INGRAHAM: This is partisan. It's total rank partisan.
DHILLON: That's outrageous. 
INGRAHAM: Scott, we have no time. Scott, you would be upset, yes or no, if text messages came out against Obama or Hillary calling Obama supporters retarded and saying that Obama and was investigating Obama or Hillary. You would be bothered by that correct? 
BOLDEN: Well, certainly inappropriate. But until it shows that it effects the outcome or the investigation --

INGRAHAM: We got the documents? Hold on, Scott, you are bothered. I know you are bothered. We love you too much not to be bothered. 
BOLDEN: If it doesn't affect the investigation, then they may or may not have to be removed.
INGRAHAM: OK, but you don't know until you get the documents. Should we get the documents yes or no? 
FITTON: We are going to get some documents. 
(CROSSTALK)
FITTON: We're going to get some documents.

FITTON: We're going to get some documents and they are going to come out in dribs and drabs over the next few weeks and few months. We'll be talking about that fight two years from now I bet you. 
INGRAHAM: So dribs and drabs but not the fundamental documents showing that missing time period in the spring, right, that missing time period. 
FITTON: They are protecting the Mueller investigation. The Congress should be asking Mueller where the documents are. That's who is being protected here. 
INGRAHAM: Tom Fitton, Harmeet, Scott. 
BOLDEN: But there is an ongoing investigation. Why shouldn't they be sensitive to that? 
INGRAHAM: We're up against a hard break. Sorry, Scott. We're going to go to black. Sorry about that. "Friday Follies" up next, Raymond Arroyo on "Roseanne" reboot without Roseanne.

INGRAHAM: It's time for "Friday Follies."
(MUSIC)
INGRAHAM: I like that. That's good. I like that now. I like that graphic. Here's a question that sounds more like a Zen riddle. Can there be Roseanne TV without Roseanne? There's going to be a show "Roseanne," but -- here with answers is Fox News contributor and New York Times bestselling author of the "Will Wilder" series Raymond Arroyo. Raymond, Roseanne, I was very excited. "Roseanne" is back without Roseanne.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, yes, she just gave her rights away so that the rest of her staff, the 200 people working on the show, could continue working. The problem is this -- ABC is going to relaunch her show. They are calling it "The Conners," so it will focus on the family, John Goodman, Sara Gilbert. Here's the problem. Disney was on the hook for tens of millions of dollars which they owed this staff, this crew. So they figured we'll rename the show. We'll relaunch it. We'll give them 10 episodes. One of the staff told me through a friend, they may not get 11. 
And there is good reason to think that, Laura. Without Roseanne, that central chaotic, fascinating, and politically balanced figure for the show, she gave the balance. She was representing conservative America. Without that balance, I think the show is tilted in one direction, and won't work. And there are a string of these shows, Laura. Remember, think back --
INGRAHAM: Give me the list. I want the list. Give me the list. 
ARROYO: I will give them to you. "The Ropers." Remember the spinoff of the Ropers. Normal Fell, this was "Three's Company," and it did not work. 
INGRAHAM: You are really going back. You are really going back. 
ARROYO: I will give you a more contemporary one. Remember "Joey." This was the "Friends" spinoff. That one season, it was gone. Then "The Golden Girls." "Golden Girls," this popular franchise, Bea Arthur leaves the show. All the other golden girls said we want to continue going. They launched something called "The Golden Palace" where they ran a hotel. Well, it closed in one season. The fortune cookie didn't look good. 
And then there was "Gloria." You remember "Gloria," an "All in the Family" spinoff. Well, it was an "All in the Family" spin off. Sally Struthers did not work. The only good news I have to report is Fran Drescher says she is coming back with "The Nanny." So you will have somebody to watch the kids. 
INGRAHAM: One person from Roseanne's orbit who won't be getting a spinoff is Tom Arnold who has bizarrely claimed earlier today that he and Michael Cohen were working together it take down Trump? Raymond, what is that about? 
ARROYO: Well, he took, there was a tweet released of the two of them in a hotel lobby. Now, he then said, Tom Arnold, that he and Cohen, the president's former lawyer, have been meeting, that they had six meetings, and this was photographic evidence that they had met. He then went on CNN and talked to Poppy Harlow. Listen to this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM ARNOLD, COMEDIAN: Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, I am spending the weekend hanging out with Michael Cohen. And there is a lot going on. So, you have disrespected him and his family. And there is a lot going on. So, he gets to sleep -- that's good enough for me. This is too important to me to f-around. And you know the word I'm talking about. And I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter, and that's really why I'm doing the show. And we are having fun with these Trump tapes. But this is serious to me, Poppy, I'm not f-ing around. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: He is a class act. 
ARROYO: Something is wrong with this man, Laura. He's loaded. He's like a drunken Michael Moore. He's got a new series on "Viceland" where is he chasing down the Trump tapes. 
Here is the long story short. Michael Cohen and Tom Arnold have since tweeted that they aren't actually working together. 
INGRAHAM: This is stupid.
ARROYO: In fact, he is as close to Michael Cohen as I am to Michelle Obama. I was American Library Association here today. I guess I can say I spent the afternoon with the first lady. I actually attended her talk. That's about the relationship that he has with Michael Cohen. He met him in the lobby of a hotel. This is much ado about nothing trying to promote a lame show. 
INGRAHAM: We don't care about that. Too much time on that. There's this controversy now swirling around this new ABC show called "The Proposal." What's that about? 
ARROYO: I'm surprised you are not watching "The Proposal," Laura. 
INGRAHAM: No. No. 
ARROYO: This is right up your alley. What's happened is one of the contestants claimed that another contest set her up for a date rape. And these are serious charges and certainly not laughing matter at all. ABC spiked the episode that it was to run, the second in the series, because of these allegations. But then I looked at the show. It's no wonder this stuff is going on. This is like a pimping pageant where people parade in front of a contestant, and they get to choose which of the five contestants they will offer a proposal to. Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ten people looking for love. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm ready for the love that people write movies about. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A new series from the producers of "The Bachelor." 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not every day you meet your future soulmate. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where a chance at love.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In life great rewards come while taking great risks. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taking a chance. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel like my heart is going to explode. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it all happens in one hour. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you marry me? 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: You know what I like about these shows, Raymond, you know what I like about these shows is that when the girl or the young man or the woman or the man doesn't get picked, like on one of these shows, they act like they've just lost the love of their life. They just met them 15 minutes ago. We had such a connection. You spent 12 minutes with them. Oh my God, they in the limo crying. Oh my God. 
ARROYO: Every time they walk into a singles' bar these people must get suicidal. I have never seen anything like it. But this show "The Proposal," Laura, makes "The Bachelor" look like something from the Victorian era. I don't like the idea that you're trivializing marriage, you're trivializing love. And it's really sexist. In the Me Too movement and the Me Too era I'm stunned that you've got people parading around and having to do swimsuit expose to decide I will go with you but not you. This really, I want to -- proposals are easy. Marriage is hard. I want the camera to follow these people home after their 60-minute proposal. That's how much time they have exposed to this person, 60 minutes before --
INGRAHAM: The best, Raymond, is when they do the recap show after the show is completed and then they all sit around saying yes, she is a real nightmare. He was awful. And then they sit around and they just complain to each other. And I guess that's the highest rated of all the shows, when they do the recap show. This is why I don't watch TV anymore. 
ARROYO: I want to see the woman hitting the guy with a pan over the head for his night out, and that he snores. That's the stuff we want. The complaints about snoring and leaving the toilet seat up.
INGRAHAM: Did you and Michelle Obama have any conversation today or nothing? 
ARROYO: I did not. I just watched Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress, interview the first lady. And she really talked about her forthcoming memoir. I thought we would have a little more news for you, but there wasn't much. She just kind of talked about raising Malia and Sasha and the first grandmother being there. She said she had a therapy room upstairs that all the staff as well as Michelle regularly visited. All of that and more in her forthcoming memoir. 
INGRAHAM: I like her mother. Her mother seems like the coolest person. I like Marian Robinson. 
ARROYO: Marian Robinson, she is the untold story of the Obama years. 
INGRAHAM: She knows all. She knows all. I want to read her memoir. Raymond, thanks so much. 
And up next, a segment you cannot miss. Lost in all the concern over illegal immigrants this week is the intense suffering of our own citizens at the hands of criminal illegals. In a minute, three Angel Moms come out of the shadows to share their own story. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We weren't lucky enough to be separated for five days or 10 days. We were separated permanently. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration. You hear the other side. You never hear this side. These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones, the word "permanently" being the word that you have to think about, permanently. They are not separated for a day or two days. These are permanently separated. 
Our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the United States. We don't want people in our country that don't go through a process. We want people in our country based on merit. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That was President Trump at the White House today honoring angel families, those who have lost loved ones to illegal immigrant crime. The great debate across the nation this week has been over the separation of children from their parents crossing the border illegally. Of course we have great sympathy for the border crossers after these dangerous journeys and we want to see them well-cared for. But there are other parents who will never see their children again, and they were the victims of crime by illegal immigrants, also many of whom who cross the border, of course, illegally, not overstaying visas. 
We have the privilege tonight of introducing you to three Angel Moms who were honored at the White House today, Michelle Root, Maureen Maloney, and Sabine Durden. Ladies, it is very good to see you, and thank you for your courage and making your voices heard throughout this process. I know it's really difficult to even speak about what happened to you and your family, but we think it's really important for your voices to be heard by all of America. 
Michelle, I want to start with you. Your daughter, a beautiful 21-year-old. She was killed by an illegal who was released on bail. Tell us the story. 
MICHELLE ROOT, ANGEL MOM: Sarah had just graduated from Bellevue University in Bellevue, Nebraska. She was out celebrating with friends. On her way home stopped at a stoplight. Edwin Mejia who was drinking and driving, street racing, his blood alcohol was .241, rear ended Sarah going 70-plus miles an hour. He had come to our country illegally, unaccompanied minor, at age 16, crossed our borders and was taken to a sanctuary city in California where he was met up with his brother in Tennessee who was also illegal. They moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and I believe it was 2014 he came over at 16 in 2013, then killed Sarah in 2016. 
INGRAHAM: He was released on bail. Somehow he managed to scrounge up $5,000, $10,000. He never showed up for his trial. He's a fugitive from justice? 
ROOT: Yes, correct. Correct. 
INGRAHAM: Have the authorities in California, who is looking for him? 
ROOT: ICE actually is now because of course the new administration. He is on fugitive task force wanted list, the ICE's top 10 wanted list, and that's all we know at this point. 
INGRAHAM: Did Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska, did he reach out to you after this happened? 
ROOT: He did as well as my Iowa representative Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, Senator Fisher also from Nebraska. 
INGRAHAM: Maureen, your son Matthew was killed, by an illegal immigrant. 
MAUREEN MALONEY, ANGEL MOM: Yes, yes. 
INGRAHAM: Tell us his story. 
MALONEY: So Matthew was 23 years old. He had recently graduated from college also. He was on his way home from helping a friend. He was riding his motorcycle in the downtown area that had a 20 mile-per-hour speed limit when Nicholas Guaman who had been drinking all day, was a criminal illegal alien, ran through a stop sign and collided with Matthew's motorcycle. 
Matthew flew off the motorcycle, landed on the hood, and rolled off the truck, and according to witnesses he survived the initial collision, and he was getting up out of the street when Nicolas Guaman fled and ran Matthew over, dragging him a quarter of a mile to his death while witnesses were begging and pleading with him to stop the truck. He had his six-year-old son in the truck with him while he did this. Then he dragged Matthew a quarter of a mile. He ran over a curb, Matthew became dislodged. He backed over Matthew again and continued to flee. Left Matthew there to die. 
INGRAHAM: Do you know when he came into the country illegally? 
MALONEY: He came into the country 2004. 
INGRAHAM: And he is in prison still? 
MALONEY: He is in prison. He was convicted and sentenced to 12 to 14 years. 
INGRAHAM: Twelve to 14 years doesn't seem like a long time to me, does it. 
MALONEY: Right. And in Massachusetts you get 30 percent of your sentence taken off for good behavior, so he will be getting out. 
INGRAHAM: Sabine, you're a German legal immigrant. Tell me about the son who killed your son. 
SABINE DURDEN, ANGEL MOM: He was an illegal from Guatemala, had two felonies that he committed and got pled down to one. He was deported. Came back, was arrested for drunk driving, received probation, was arrested again while on probation with drunk driving. And they gave him probation again in Riverside, California. 
INGRAHAM: Sanctuary state. 
DURDEN: Of course. At that time, it wasn't a sanctuary state, but Riverside was a sanctuary city. And five weeks later he took his unregistered, unlicensed, uninsured truck, and my son was going to work as a 911 sheriff's dispatcher for the Riverside sheriff's department, going on his motorcycle. And Dominic was hit by this guy and thrown into a wall and killed instantly. 
INGRAHAM: We're going to continue with these stories and the criticism of what President Trump is doing and your reaction when we return. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Welcome back to "The Ingraham Angle." We continue our discussion with three very special women, Angel Moms, Michelle Root, Maureen Maloney, and Sabine Durden. All of them have lost family members, sons to illegal immigrant crime, forever separated from them. Sabine, you said the killer, by the way, of your son, how long in jail? 
SABINE DURDEN: Thirty-five days. 
INGRAHAM: Thirty-five days? 
DURDEN: Thirty-five whole days. His mother was probably crying real hard. 
INGRAHAM: Paul Begala said this today about the Trump meeting with all of you. Let's watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: He knows what he's doing. He is taking this raw, real pain that these poor families are suffering, which is authentic, and he's politicizing it. It is monstrous to take these folks' pain and then to use to use to divide America. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Michelle? 
ROOT: I don't even know how to respond to that, but that is so angry because our voices need to be heard. Our children's voices need to be heard. We need to hear the other side of this. 
INGRAHAM: Your daughter is beautiful. Your son is beautiful. 
ROOT: Very angry. Very angry. 
INGRAHAM: Maureen? 
MALONEY: It's ridiculous. I was speaking out against this long before Trump announced he was even running to be president. Our children need to have a voice, and we are trying to raise awareness and educate people and prevent future deaths. 
INGRAHAM: This is Kathy Griffin, Sabine, so-called comedian. "Message to the parents who are on stage with Trump at this press conference. I am so sorry for your loss, but the man you are standing with, Trump, could give two s-" she can't tweet without swearing, "He is using you for propaganda." Sabine, what do you have to say to Kathy Griffin? 
DURDEN: I want her to meet me face to face and tell me how this is propaganda. This is my son's ashes in here. He is the only man that brought this to the forefront. She needs to go into a little back alley and entertain the two people that are still following her. She has no -- she just has no ground, she has no soul, she has no heart. And I pray to God she never knows this feeling. 
INGRAHAM: Michelle, a Salvadoran man was telling a very heartfelt story, an illegal immigrant who was separated crossing the border. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobis (ph) and his daughter were arrested in Texas by border agents. I was told my daughter and I had to get on different buses because there wasn't enough room, he says. But when they were driven to McAllen where many migrants are being processed, six-year-old Maybelline was suddenly nowhere to be seen. I said, where is my daughter? Don't separate us. Don't let us in, but don't rip us apart, he says. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Emotional, your reaction. 
ROOT: I was ripped apart from Sarah, and you're accountable for your action. You are the one that crossed that border illegally with your child. You were not looking out for your child. 
INGRAHAM: Maureen. 
MALONEY: I concur with Michelle. We didn't have a choice. Our children were ripped from our lives. They have a choice. 
INGRAHAM: Women across the country have a heart for all victims of crime, including these women. We'll be right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: These are my new friends. And it's a great privilege to be with these women tonight. It's been a big week here on "The Ingraham Angle." We started in Los Angeles -- we started in San Francisco, then Los Angeles. We went down to the border, did a show from there before heading back here to home base in Washington where we're lucky enough to be joined by women who have the guts to speak out even though they are being hit and trashed on social media by radical leftists.
