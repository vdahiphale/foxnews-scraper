President to appear on reality TV as he turns his back on big city murder rates 
In an act of wonderfully skewed priorities, President Obama will appear in a reality TV show in which he gets survival tips from Bear Grylls in Alaska.

Funny how far that is from the streets of Chicago -- outposts in need of real survival training, much like the streets of Baltimore, Milwaukee, New York, New Orleans, where citizens are ventilated daily. As Obama grins in insulated comfort, somewhere another bystander bites the dust.
So as Putin slices apart the Arctic, our guy renames a mountain from McKinley to Denali. Who knew Obama was a fan of trucks used to drop pop stars out of rehab?

This is all window dressing for his bigger shtick, his apocalyptic climate change kabuki, featuring a nightmarish end game of road warrior ruin. Unless, of course, you heed his warning.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone. They're on their own shrinking island.
If we do nothing to keep glaciers from melting faster and oceans from rising faster and forests from burning faster and storms from growing stronger, we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair. Submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields no longer growing, indigenous peoples who can't carry out traditions that stretch back millennia.

Well that doesn't sound so bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's the same strategy used with Iran. Agree with the great one, or you will cause nuclear war. "Denali" sounds like "denial" as Obama turns his back on big city murder rates. Remember, he was going to stop the rising tides. But what of this ocean of red? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {

Milwaukee's murder rates jumped 76 percent, that's 45 extra bodies. St. Louis murder rate jumped 60 percent, that's 41 extra bodies. Baltimore jumps 56 percent, 77 bodies. D.C., 40 percent leap, that's 32 extra bodies. Chicago, a 20 percent jump, 50 bodies. And New York, a nine percent increase gives you 18 extra bodies.
So in eight months, that's hundreds of extra bodies, many of them black. It's quite a mountain, Mr. President. What shall we name it?  </pre>
