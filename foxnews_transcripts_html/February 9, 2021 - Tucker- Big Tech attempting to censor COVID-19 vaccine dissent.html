TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT.You've probably been glued to the tube all day, Donald Trump's secondimpeachment proceedings started. We didn't watch any of it. We did hearfrom a number of people that Trump's head lawyer didn't do a very good job.On a slow day that might be a mildly interesting fact. But at this point,honestly, who cares? Impeachment? The whole thing is ridiculous. They areliterally impeaching a President who isn't even the President anymore.They're yelling at someone who's already left the room. It's a farce,insulting and absurd.Anyone who tells you the details of today's Potemkin impeachment areimportant is probably trying to distract you from something that actuallyis important. There are a lot of those things right now, more than ever.One of them is our ongoing COVID pandemic, after months of hearing thatlife could never return to normal until we get a vaccine, we got a vaccine-- two vaccines actually, but life did not return to normal. Life gotworse.We were instructed to take the new vaccine as soon as possible, and then toput on more masks. One mask was no longer enough. Anyone who complainedabout that was punished.Most people obeyed the orders, they had no choice. But the whole thing madethem nervous. How could it not? Why exactly did the rules change all of asudden, they wondered? Was there a good reason for that?When are we finally going to repeal corona law? And what about thisvaccine? Why are Americans being discouraged from asking simple,straightforward questions about it? Questions like how effective are thesedrugs? Are they safe?What's the miscarriage risk for pregnant women, for example? Is there astudy on that? May we see it? And by the way, how much are the drugcompanies making off this stuff?Well, there's nothing QAnon about questions like that, they're notconspiracy theories. They're the most basic questions.In a democracy, every citizen has a right to know the answer. But instead,we got fluff and propaganda. The media rollout for the vaccine came offlike a Diet Pepsi commercial at the Super Bowl, tons of celebrityendorsements, not a lot of science. It was totally disingenuous, andnaturally, it had the opposite of the intended effect.Most Americans already supported vaccines. They didn't need to bebrowbeaten in order to be convinced, they were grateful their kids nolonger get tetanus and polio and chickenpox. They weren't anti-vaxxers.And yet, from the very first day, the way the authorities handled the COVIDvaccine did not inspire confidence. If the vaccine was so great, why wereall these people lying about it? Honest question, and they were lying.Clearly, they were lying. You know that for certain because from the momentthe COVID vaccine arrived, the most powerful people in America worked tomake certain that no one could criticize it.Here's Bill Gates' wife on CNN back in December.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Do the social media companies -- Facebook,YouTube, Twitter, on and on -- have a responsibility to do more right now,Melinda in terms of getting this misinformation, this disinformation offtheir platforms?MELINDA GATES, COFOUNDER, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION: Theyabsolutely have a responsibility. The internet and the rise of social mediahas happened so quickly, that really the regulations and the goodpolicymaking hasn't stayed out in front of it, and quite frankly, it needsto catch up.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Quite frankly, she says, we need to censor people's views on theCOVID vaccine. Now, remember, Melinda Gates is not a scientist. She did notdevelop this vaccine. She has no background in epidemiology or any relevantdiscipline.She worked in the marketing department at Microsoft. But she is the wife ofa billionaire. That's why she is on television. It's why she is allowed tocontrol what you're allowed to say about the drug she is demanding youinject in your body.Is this really science? Not even close. It's oligarchy. And all thebillionaires are participating in it.The tech companies announced early they would not allow anyone to criticizethis vaccine and anyone who did would be kicked off their platforms rightaway. And then corporate media took it upon themselves to enforce thisrule.Just yesterday, CNN ran a story with this headline, quote, "Facebook vowedto crackdown on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, but misleading postsremain easy to find." That's not a news story. That's an open call forcensorship, and it worked.CNN identified a group on Facebook called COVID-19 Vaccine Injury Storiesand the group was exactly what it sounds like, people talking about theirexperiences with the vaccine. Last week, that group was in the top 20groups on all of Facebook. Today, after the CNN piece came out, we searchedfor that group, we couldn't find it. Even when we search specifically forits name, effectively COVID-19 Vaccine Injury stories no longer exists. CNNshut them down, erased them.Instead search for the word vaccine on Facebook and you will find a lot ofmaterial -- exclusive material -- that matches precisely the storylineapproved by Melinda Gates and her fellow non-scientist billionaires. Andthe line is clear, you've heard it a million times, the COVID vaccine ismorally good. Period. Don't dare say anything else.So if your neighbor drops dead after getting the shot, keep it to yourself.Facts like that are not allowed on Facebook nor on Twitter. They've got thesame policy. Quote, "I posted that there were multiple reports of adversereactions to the vaccine," wrote one Twitter user, " ... and that thevaccines were still not fully trialed on pregnant women and kids. Twitterbanned me until I deleted it for false information."Is it false information? That's irrelevant. According to another user,quote, "Twitter suspended me for saying that vaccines have known sideeffects," end quote, which of course they do. Physicians who developvaccines concede that, but at the moment, you are not allowed to say it.Facebook has long led the way in this kind of censorship. Last year, thecompany prohibited users from buying any advertisement that mightdiscourage people from taking the vaccine or that might portray the newvaccines as quote, "unsafe or ineffective."Now in the months since, tens of millions of Americans have been vaccinatedand most of them seem fine. On the other hand, scientists are now concedingon the record, that the vaccine may trigger a fatal blood disorder in asmall number of people. "The New York Times" wrote about it the other day.It's one of those stories you should save as a period piece for when thecurrent darkness finally lifts, and we can think and speak clearly again.Two of the people at "The New York Times" interviewed wouldn't even givetheir names. One said she had been badly injured by the drug, but shefeared she would be punished if she criticized the vaccine in public. Inthe picture "The New York Times" ran, she covered her face like she was afugitive.Science can't live in an environment like this without relentlessskepticism, science dies. That's what science is -- relentless skepticism,and when it leaves, inevitably, it's replaced by witchcraft andsuperstition.Are we there yet? You decide.The liberal website, VOX recently ran a piece complaining that Facebookusers were still being allowed to, quote, "Make fun of COVID-19vaccination," and this offended them. Mockery is always the gravest threatto false religions. VOX demanded that Facebook remove the offending contentimmediately.As an example, VOX highlighted this image which they noted with alarm hadalready been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, and thisinfuriated them. Damn those smirking Americans. Make them stop laughing.And in a way, it is amusing. Even with total blanket censorship, it ispretty hard to crush the average person's sense of humor. But you've got towonder, if they can force you to stop laughing about vaccines, what can'tthey make you do?Glenn Greenwald is a truly independent journalist whose work appears on"Substack" and that we hope you'll support, he joins us tonight.Glenn, thanks for coming on. I don't think you have to have a position onvaccines -- for whatever it is worth, I'm for them -- to think that it'svery troubling news organizations or the government or billionaires oranybody would try and censor open conversation about their effects.GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, we've obviously talked a lot, Tucker,about the practice of censoring for political opinion, declaring thingshate speech or offensive and the dangers of censoring for that.I actually think this -- this pretense that they're able, this conceit thatthey are able to decree right and wrong, truth and falsity to the pointwhere they can ban things that they declared to be false is even morepernicious than opinion-based censorship.The irony -- think about this -- if this Facebook policy had existed backin March less than a year ago, that says that if you dissent from theconsensus of the World Health Organization and scientific experts, you willbe banned from their platform.That would have meant that if you were somebody who in March went ontoFacebook and said, I believe that you should wear masks, I believe thatmasks are effective against respiratory diseases of the kind that SARS andCOVID-19 represent, you would have been banned because the science backthen said that you shouldn't wear masks.Dr. Fauci was saying don't wear masks, they were saying not only are maskunnecessary, they could actually be dangerous. That's the whole point ofscience.Everything they do, these liberal guardians of orthodoxy and piety is abouttrying to make you think that they have a monopoly on objective truth bycalling it science.Science is a human study which means it's fallible and exactly as you said,it is extremely dangerous to say that any kind of human knowledge is sounchallengeable to being discussed that it's off limits from even beingquestioned.CARLSON: I'm worried that maybe paradoxically, their demand that youbelieve what they say will result in millions of Americans not believingwhat anybody says. This will have an effect on people's faith in knowabletruth. It'll have an effect on their mental health, it will make peoplecrazy. That's my concern.GREENWALD: Well, no, and I think that's valid. You know, I agree -- I havethe same view as you do, which is, when the vaccine is available where Ilive, I'm going to get it. My family is going to take it as well. Becausethe reason I'm convinced not that it's clearly true, but probably the bestcourse for me and my family is because I informed myself.I use the free and open Internet to look at what experts were saying. Isought out dissenting opinion. And I was convinced that the consensus wasprobably right, that taking the vaccine was the best thing to do.But if the internet were a place where no dissent were allowed, I wouldhave way less confidence in that ability because that would mean this is aprofession that isn't confident enough to allow dissent, and if they're notconfident enough to allow dissent, I think that they earn much less trustand faith in their pronouncements.CARLSON: Yes, I think it's a really wise observation. So I have to ask you,and I'm not sure the answer myself, why are they doing it? If it has theopposite of the intended effect, and that seems like it makes sense that itwould, why are they continuing to do this, do you think?GREENWALD: I think it's so important to recognize that Silicon Valleycompanies are not the ones who want to do this. They are they -- they wouldrather stay as far away from censoring and arbitrating and intervening andkicking people off their platforms, not because they're noble and nice, butbecause it's in their business self-interest not to do it.They're being pressured to do it, Tucker. This is what's so amazing by CNN,and NBC and "New York Times" who are saying, every time you allowinformation over your platform that we think is wrong, we're going to shameyou, we're going to disgrace you.And they have their partners who are the Democratic Party who control theentire government now who are right along with them saying, we demand thatyou censor more. They are being pressured, led by journalists, who are nowthe leading activists to destroy free discourse and free thought in theUnited States. That's the dynamic that we have to understand.CARLSON: I think you're exactly right. I don't think we can say thatenough. Glenn Greenwald, thank you for that wise assessment. Appreciate it.GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So last week, we told you, we reported on this show that Bank ofAmerica which used to be a bank has become instead of kind of IntelligenceAgency, combing through its customers private financial records and turningthem over to Federal investigators without the knowledge of theircustomers, doing it in secret. We caught them. We've got an update on thatstory. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States sowhat happens there matters. And right now, the City of Los Angeles isteetering on the edge of collapse and many are dying. Why? Because of baddecisions by its leaders, destructive decisions.South Los Angeles so 59 shooting victims for example in the first two weeksof this year. Last year, at the same time before the city defunded thepolice, there were seven murders. That's a massive increase. Dead peoplebecause of bad decisions.Meanwhile, the new District Attorney of Los Angeles, George Gascon hasrefused to enforce laws including against violent crime. That may shockyou, it doesn't shock George Soros who paid for his campaign. That's whathe wanted.But tonight, a Judge has stepped into all of this, FOX LA's Bill Meluginhas more on that story for us tonight. Hey, Bill.BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX LOS ANGELES: Hey, Tucker, good evening to you.That's exactly right. Our new progressive District Attorney here in LAGeorge Gascon suffered a pretty major setback in court yesterday. That'swhen a Judge ruled that some of his new progressive reforms are not onlyillegal, they are also unethical.So if we can pull up some video right now, I'll explain starting with hispolicy on California's three strikes law. California's three strikes lawwas voted in overwhelmingly by California voters back in the 1990s and thestrikes law essentially allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences forrepeat criminal offenders.And on day one in office, George Gascon issued a directive to all of hisprosecutors saying we are not going to enforce the three strikes lawbecause it's my opinion that it is racist and it is unconstitutional. Hethen started forcing his prosecutors to read a statement in court,essentially agreeing with his legal opinion, and the Prosecutor Union had abig problem with that, so they sued him. They essentially sued their ownboss.And yesterday a Judge ruled against George Gascon and sided with theUnion's writing in part quote, from James Chalfant, the Judge, "TheDistrict Attorney's disregard of the three strikes law plead and proverequirement is unlawful as is requiring Deputy DAs to seek dismissal ofpending sentencing enhancements without a lawful basis. The specialdirective statement that prosecutors are required to read in court islegally inaccurate and incomplete, and reading this statement in courtwithout correction is unethical."So a big loss for Gascon on that. The Judge went on to issue an orderrestricting George Gascon from not following the three strikes law. He saysjust because it's your opinion that you don't want to enforce it doesn'tmean you can't not enforce it so Gascon must now start enforcing it.I talked to the Vice President of the DA Union out here, they said theywere relieved by this ruling from the Judge. They feel vindicated. And theysay George Gascon's directives were causing a big problem for them. Take alisten.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it kind of put us in this impossible position, do wefollow his directives or do we follow the law? And the court clearly said,well, you need to follow the law.(END VIDEO CLIP)MELUGIN: And George Gascon released a statement yesterday in response toall of this saying he knew he was going to have a tough job trying tochange what he says is an outdated racist system here in Los Angeles ofmass incarceration. He says he plans to appeal this decision to a highercourt -- Tucker.CARLSON: Bill, thanks for that report. One of the great reporters in thestate that badly needs more of them.Well, last week, we told you that one of the largest and oldest banks inthe country, Bank of America founded by A. P. Giannini is no longer reallya bank, it is now kind of an Intelligence Agency spying on its customerswithout telling them, turning information over to the Feds.We obtained proof that Bank of America scanned through its customers'private financial records back in January and turned the information overto Federal investigators, once again, without telling its customers.The bank was looking for people who did among other things, rented hotelrooms in Washington in January, people who made purchases in January inWashington, D.C., and people who bought plane tickets. What's the point ofthis?Well, Bank of America when we asked them said they wouldn't comment oncommunications with law enforcement -- that was not reassuring -- and toldus the bank has quote, "Responsibilities under Federal law to comply withpolice inquiries." That's not technically true. In fact, what they did maybe illegal.But here's the interesting part. Since our story aired last week, Bank ofAmerica has not provided any further explanation for the spying we knowthey did on their own customers for political reasons. And as far as weknow, despite the fact this is a big story, no politician in either partyhas bothered to ask Bank of America.So it is okay that one of America's largest financial institutions is nowspying on people. And by the way, Bank of America may not be the only one.They're the only one we've caught so far.Should you be concerned about any of this? Victor Davis Hanson is a fellowat the Hoover Institution. He has thought about this subject fairly deeplyand joins us tonight.Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. Should we be worried about this?VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you.CARLSON: That Bank of America is spying on its customers?HANSON: Yes, because it suggests that the quietude might reflect that thereare other people doing it more than we were aware of. And it's sort of alsodisturbing because we always thought that the corporation, the financialinstitution was wary of the left, and that wanted to be bipartisan in itsconsumer base.But when it starts to help an investigation of a particular ideological orperceived ideology, then it's kind of scary.Remember, Tim Cook at Apple during the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, thedeceased shooter who killed 14 Americans, radical Islamic terrorist, theF.B.I. went to court to ask Apple to unlock his data on his iPhone for theinvestigations, and they refused. They said, we can't do that because wehave to reassure our consumer base that their iPhone data is sacrosanct.And so this is -- it's not consistent. That's what's also worrisome. Dothey pick some groups to spy on or surveil or turn over their private data,knock groups, we need it -- we need to know that.And I think people -- it's kind of scary Tucker, because in this hugeoctopus that we're facing now of Silicon Valley, traditional media, socialmedia, professional sports, entertainment, Hollywood, we always thought thecorporation and the financial institution was wary of surveillance or theleft because it was afraid of, you know, the impairment of free marketcapitalism.But when you start to have the corporate boardroom or the financialinstitution giving the impression that it might have an ideological basisfor some of its investigations, that's pretty scary and it shows you thatwokeness is -- if that's the right term -- is everywhere now.CARLSON: I mean this --HANSON: In every institution of power and influence in American society.CARLSON: This investigation is transparently political, of course, theydidn't conduct anything like this when Antifa and Black Lives Matter burneda dozen cities this summer, nothing like this.HANSON: Yes.CARLSON: If Apple were participating in this kind of surveillance, ofcourse, you would have no privacy at all. That would be truly horrifyingand truly invasive.Why are no politicians demanding that Tim Cook explain whether or not Appleis cooperating with the Department of Justice to spy on Americans?HANSON: I don't know that answer, but I think the politicians of bothparties because these five or six companies -- Google, Apple, Twitter,Facebook -- they have about $6 trillion in market capitalization. We'venever seen such money aggregated in a 50-mile radius, and they've used itquite promiscuously.Remember, Mark Zuckerberg, $350 million. So it's not just that they'regoing to give the one politician or one candidate, they have the means toalter an election by getting out the vote or giving money to governmentofficials in a particular precinct.I think people are having an ad campaign or spending -- helping to spend$100 million in Georgia. I think people are frightened of them, and theyalso maybe -- to give Tim Cook the benefit of the doubt, he is on recordthat Apple would never do that because he resisted the demands of his owngovernment that was investigating a mass murder and a radical Islamistideology.And would he be what -- tough on the F.B.I. that was investigating massmurder and not so tough on people who, you know, went into the Capitol,although there were five people killed, so I don't know the answer. But I'mvery worried because I think that the average citizen looks around at thispanopticon and every -- get -- use Facebook, do Twitter, turn on the NBA,you know, look at your investments. Look at your bank, and it's all nowcoalesced.Remember this "Time" Magazine's recent issue, the history of the shadowcampaign where they boasted about the power of this collusionary effort.It's really -- I think people have got to wake up. It's dangerous.CARLSON: It is dangerous. Victor Davis Hanson, I appreciate it. Thank you.HANSON: Thank you.CARLSON: The one member the United States Senate, by the way, who might bepressing the Big Tech companies on these questions and the banks is JoshHawley of Missouri. Nobody has been attacked more aggressively in the lastsix weeks than Josh Hawley.Is it possible they tried to take Josh Holley offline because they knew heis the one guy to ask those questions? I don't know.This is the moment of no questions though to add to the list of noquestions, the World Health Organization is demanding that you stop askingquestions about China.We're going to keep doing it though. Questions like: why does Joe Biden'spick to lead the C.I.A. have close ties with the Communist Party of China?That might be worth asking. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: A man called William Burns is Joe Biden's nominee to lead theC.I.A., and we're now learning just like the Biden family itself that Burnshas ties to China and its communist government. The nominee to run theC.I.A.FOX's Trace Gallagher has details in that story tonight. Hey, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, William Burnsis a former Deputy Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to Russia.In 2014, he left government to lead the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace, a very influential U.S. think tank that has close tiesto China. In fact, one of Carnegie's global centers is based in Beijing.And during his time as President of Carnegie, William burns brought inChinese businessman Zhang Yi Chen to join the Board of Trustees. Zhang is awealthy Chinese investor and member of two organizations linked to theChinese Communist Party.According to "The Daily Caller" News Foundation, between July of 2017 andthe end of 2020, Zhang donated between $750,000.00 to $1.5 million toCarnegie. The think tank says the donations do not support researchprojects in the U.S., but some say it's not the money, it is the influencebecause while Burns was at Carnegie, it also received donations from theChina United States Exchange Foundation or CUSEF, which is a Hong Kongbased think tank.But a global research firm led by former Intel officials from the U.S. saysthat CUSEF's lobbying activities in the U.S. quoting here, " ... allows itto play a valuable role in Beijing's efforts to sway public opinion andbuild influence in America." And all of this is why Republicans haverepeatedly questioned whether Joe Biden will confront China for its humanrights abuses and unfair trade practices, or allow China to keep cheating -- Tucker.CARLSON: Unbelievable. Trace Gallagher. Thanks so much.GALLAGHER: Yes.CARLSON: Again, we're not talking about the nominee to run the Departmentof the Interior, we're talking about the C.I.A. Director, ties to China.Insanity. But not the only insane thing going on.The World Health Organization for a long time has been useful, mostly forrepeating exactly what the government of China would like it to say.When this pandemic began last year, for example, you'll remember that Chinatold us the virus could not spread person to person.Doctors in Wuhan doubted that, but not the World Health Organization. Theywere busy praising the government of China on Twitter.Now, the World Health Organization wants you to know that the coronavirushad absolutely nothing, not one thing to do with that government virologylab in Wuhan, so shut up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER BEN EMBAREK, FOOD SAFETY SCIENTIST WITH W.H.O. AND THE INTERNATIONALMISSION LEAD: The findings suggest that the laboratory incident hypothesisis extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus into thehuman population.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, it's extremely unlikely. So we're just going to shut thatinvestigation down. But the W.H.O., like China, itself, is now saying thatreally the virus may have come from frozen food shipments from othercountries.Armenia seemed fine with this. Last night, in fact, Tom Friedman, probablythe most famous columnist at "The New York Times" suggested that China is amuch better country than this, and we should learn from them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, "THE NEW YORK TIMES": What are they doing inChina today? You know, Chris, do you know that it takes four hours and 18minutes to take the bullet train from Beijing to Shanghai, and it takes 21hours to take the train from New York to Chicago, and both about the samedistance.I can't -- I'll tell you something they weren't thinking about in Chinathis week. They weren't thinking about some knucklehead. They weren'tspending the week thinking about a knucklehead who claimed 9/11 didn'thappen.They weren't thinking about some guy who is a QAnon Shaman. I don't know.They were probably thinking about some bad stuff, with the Uighurs and allof that. Oh, for sure.But I guarantee you, they weren't wasting their time on this nonsense. Andhow do we do this week after week, month after month, and think we are aserious country. We are so deeply unserious as a country right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, he's right. There are some deeply unserious people in thiscountry, particularly on the op-ed page of "The New York Times" people whoworry about some bad stuff with the Uighurs like genocide, whatever. Theyhave fast trains.Miranda Devine is a columnist with "The New York Post," a much more seriousperson. She joins us tonight to connect some dots and assess what we'rewatching. Miranda, I appreciate your coming on tonight.So the W.H.O. says stop asking questions about where the virus came from.It probably came from frozen food from like India. And no one in our mediapauses and says, wait a second, is that true? Why does no one pause and askthat?MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Tucker. It's justthis sort of Kafkaesque situation where we know that the World HealthOrganization is in bed with China, it's already made this pandemic muchworse than it needed to be because it was lying for China, as you said backin January about human to human transmission.It's now orchestrated this completely fraudulent investigation in Wuhaninto the source of the virus with a handpicked team of investigators andthe American representative on that team is a man called Peter Daszak whois so deeply conflicted. There wouldn't be anyone else in America asconflicted unless you talked about Anthony Fauci who funded a lot of hisresearch.Peter Daszak was actually working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology onthat very dangerous Gain of Function Research into bat coronavirus as hefunded it, and he also co-authored papers with them.So to have someone like him who has been so vociferously denying the ideathat it could possibly have leaked from the lab is just putting, you know,the fox in charge of the henhouse.And of course, it's so predictable that they've come out now, they've beenthere a month, they've spent three hours in the Wuhan lab, and they havedeclared that the lab is not the culprit.Well, why are we surprised? And of course, the reason for all of this is towhitewash China's role, and that's suitable for everybody. That just makesus in America able to become friends with China again, which is of course,what Tom Friedman and, you know, all of Joe Biden's appointees to nationalsecurity roles, they all want that.They just want to normalize what China has been doing and forget about theUighurs, that's just some pesky little detail if you have a concentrationcamp where you're organizing gang rape of your own citizens, who cares?CARLSON: I think you make a smart point. China is acting in its owninterest in whatever amoral diabolical way. It is people in the West whoare betting it that we should be offended by. I think that's -- I thinkyou're absolutely right.Miranda Devine, I appreciate it. Thank you.DEVINE: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So just the other day, Joe Biden invalidated Federal enforcementof immigration laws in this country. We've got the memos that prove that.The former Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, I.C.E. walks usthrough those documents next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Joe Biden tried to end all deportation of illegal aliens from thiscountry. That moratorium has been blocked by a Federal Judge. Today, theJudge extended the injunction through the end of this month. But despitethe Judge's order, the Biden administration has still managed to endvirtually all enforcement of Federal immigration law.Last night, we shared with you the details, internal memos from I.C.E. Thedocuments say authorities should not attempt to arrest most criminals. Theonly exceptions are terrorists, migrants who crossed the border afterNovember 1st and illegal aliens who have been convicted of felonies likemurder.But the White House has made it clear that most other felony, seriousfelonies are not our problem. For example, the White House has quote"postponed to play an I.C.E. operation to target sex offenders," sexoffenders. They're telling us that drunk driving isn't really a problemeither.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: There's a newreporting that I.C.E. is going to get some new guidance to no longer focuson deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of DUI, simpleassault, solicitation, drug-based crimes, among other things, and I'mcurious how that is in the interest of public safety?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Priority for the enforcement ofimmigration laws will be on those who are posing a national securitythreat, of course, a public safety threat, and on recent arrivals.Nobody is saying that DUIs or assaults are acceptable behavior and thosearrested for such activity should be tried and sentenced as appropriate bya local law enforcement.But we're talking about the prioritization of who is going to be deportedfrom the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, and you thought DUI was a big deal, you believed MAD when theytold you that, you're a fool, apparently.The show has also confirmed that I.C.E. officers are now required to obtainapproval from the head of the agency, whenever they want to make an arrestin the field. We are told that most of those requests have been denied.That's the point, of course.Jonathan Fahey is the former Director of I.C.E. He joins us tonight to tellus what exactly is going on. Mr. Fahey, thanks so much for coming on. Imean, what do you make of this? It must be shocking to you.JONATHAN FAHEY, FORMER DIRECTOR OF I.C.E.: Thank you for having me, Tucker.First of all, it is alarming, but it certainly is not shocking orsurprising.If anyone watched the campaign or have watched the Democratic sanctuarycities over the last few years, this shouldn't be the least bit surprising.But it's still alarming, and it's still putting our public safety at riskbecause essentially, I.C.E. has been told not to deport criminals anymore.We've gone to another level on this immigration debate. It used to be ifpeople were here working hard, not committing crimes, the argument was,they should be allowed to stay.Now, the argument has evolved into even when they're here committingcrimes, committing aggravated felonies, they should be allowed to stay andenjoy every right, privilege or benefit that American citizens enjoy. It'struly remarkable.One of the things that's most amazing about this is they do not even wantto deport gang members without proof of gang membership. But they considergang tattoos not to be sufficient proof of gang membership.So this idea that somebody would get an MS-13 tattoo and not be affiliatedwith a gang, I guess is what they're thinking. But this is the thinkingbehind these memos and behind these policies, which are going to lead tohigher crime rates, and it's unquestionably true in an era when crime isskyrocketing thanks to the anti-police policies, and other things. This isjust going to add to that.It's going to reduce deterrents to committing crime for illegal aliens thatare in this country, because now they know they can commit crimes and stillstay. It used to be a deterrent factor that they would be deported.This will harm public safety, undermine the respect for the law, lead tofurther flooding of our borders, so we are going down the road of openborders and amnesty and that's what this is all about.CARLSON: All these people's presence is a crime. None of them has a rightto be here in the first place, okay, so that -- I mean, that's sort of themore basic crime, I would say.Really quick, why would you suspend an operation designed to catch sexoffenders?FAHEY: Well, if you read on -- my understanding of the second memo is theonly people under this public safety prong are the people that were incustody at the time the memo was written. So these people that arefugitives and sex offenders don't even fall within this public safetyexception.So they cannot go out and arrest him, if my understanding of the memo iscorrect. So why would they do that? I have no idea. It defies any logic orreason. It puts our communities at risk.But again, it is all about open borders, amnesty, keeping as many people inthe country as possible. And this is, I think this is just the tip of theiceberg, Tucker.We're going to see more of this and we're going to have some crime victimsthat are going to be, you know, we know it could have been prevented nowand there are going to be crime victims and what's the explanation going tobe to them?CARLSON: It's all beyond belief. Jonathan Fahey, I appreciate your comingon. Thank you.FAHEY: Thank you.CARLSON: So Planned Parenthood makes a ton of money from abortion. Now,they have a new plan. They're getting involved in transitioning people'sgenders. Planned Parenthood, the very center of that debate, Abigail Shrieris here to explain their role, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Planned Parenthood is America's number one provider of abortions,but pregnancy rates are declining dramatically. So now, Planned Parenthoodhas another revenue stream: kids who identify as transgender.One Planned Parenthood employee put it this way very bluntly, quote, "Transidentifying kids are cash cows, and they're kept on the hook in terms offollow-up appointments, blood work, meetings, et cetera. Whereas abortionshopefully, are a one and done situation."You probably might want to know about this. Abigail Shrier knows a lotabout it. She is the author of "Irreversible Damage: The Transgender CrazeSeducing Our Daughters." She's a brave voice. She joins us tonight.Abigail, thanks for coming on.ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR, "IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE": Thank you, Tucker.CARLSON: Planned Parenthood is involved -- outline this for us, if youwould.SHRIER: Sure. In the last decades, you know, as you said, the rates ofabortion have plummeted in America. It's the lowest they've been since 1973when Roe v. Wade was decided.So Planned Parenthood, which has, you know, a large infrastructure tosupport has found a second revenue stream that is incredibly lucrative. Asyou said, these young girls become lifetime patients once you medicallytransition, you become a lifetime patient and the drugs are extremelyexpensive.CARLSON: So Planned Parenthood takes a huge amount of Federal money. Doesany of that money wind up as part of this revenue stream?SHRIER: I don't know. But I can tell you that, you know, this is somethingthat has gone from, you know, 26 clinics were providing testosterone atPlanned Parenthood clinics were providing testosterone only five years ago;now 210 Planned Parenthood clinics provide testosterone. So it is clearly avery big business for them.And they claim on their website to be the second largest provider ofhormone treatments for trans-identified people.CARLSON: So we spend a lot of time talking about the trans question. We'relectured a lot about it, I think most people, including me have very littleidea of what it means medically. You said that this is a long termcommitment between the patient and the healthcare provider. What do youmean by that exactly?SHRIER: Well, to maintain the effects of something like testosterone, youneed to stay on it. Otherwise, you will end up in this in-between lookingstate. For a woman to maintain the effects, the secondary sexcharacteristics of a man, she needs to stay on massive, massive doses.Now, that doesn't mean that some of the effects aren't permanent, many ofthem are, but she still has to maintain that appearance and she has to keepcoming in for checkups to look at her blood levels.Now that said very often these teenagers who come in at 18, and yes, farbelow 18, depending on the state to a Planned Parenthood clinic, very oftenthey never see a doctor.CARLSON: I mean, I think we know that there are long term health effects offlooding your body with hormones that you don't naturally produce. Do weknow what the long term effects of this might be?SHRIER: Well, some of them include infertility, vaginal and uterineatrophy. They're at risk of cardiac events, you know, and of course, thegreat unknown which is that we've never done this to biological women fordecades, and that's what we're doing now.So we really don't know all of the long term effects.CARLSON: Man, this is a conversation I think the country really needs tohave, and I'm grateful that you're forcing it in some way, at great expenseto yourself. So thank you for doing that. Thanks for coming on tonight.SHRIER: Thank you.CARLSON: So it's been a pretty heavy show. Sorry about that. We tried tolighten it up at some point, it is a little relentless. Tonight, itcertainly was. So we're going to end with this.Rod Ponton is county attorney in Presidio County, Texas, and today, he hada little difficulty during a virtual hearing before a Texas District CourtJudge. Here's what happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE ROY FERGUSON, PRESIDIO COUNTY, TEXAS: Mr. Ponton, I believe you havea filter turned on in the video settings. You might want to find out.ROD PONTON, COUNTY ATTORNEY, PRESIDIO COUNTY, TEXAS: Can you hear me,Judge?FERGUSON: I can hear you. I think it's a filter it and --PONTON: It is and I don't know how to remove it. I've got my assistanthere, she is trying to, but I'm prepared to go forward with it. I'm herelive. It's not that -- I'm not a cat.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "I am not a cat." Probably the best line ever from a lawyer inAmerican history, "I am not a cat." He took it well in the end.The lawyer told reporters quote: "If I can make the country chuckle for amoment in these difficult times they're going through, I'm happy to letthem do that at my expense." In other words, the American spirit is notdead. It's just slightly more feline than normal. We appreciate that.Thanks for joining us tonight.
