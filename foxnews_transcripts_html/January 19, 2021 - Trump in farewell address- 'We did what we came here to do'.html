DANIEL HOKANSON, BUREAU CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD: We work very closelywith law enforcement and if there's any identification or anything,whatsoever, that needs to be looked into, out of an abundance of caution,we automatically pull those personnel off the line.EDSON: The Pentagon says the military is removing two of the 12 NationalGuard members because of inappropriate comments or texts.Federal law enforcement is examining the 25,000 National Guard troops inWashington to protect against any potential insider attack.JONATHAN HOFFMAN, SPOKESMAN, PENTAGON: Vetting efforts that identify anyquestionable behavior in the past or any potential link to questionablebehavior, not just related to extremism.EDSON: Officials say this is part of routine security, especially forevents involving the President of the United States.Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said, "While we have no intelligenceindicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securingthe capital."Though one congressional Democrat contends there should be serious concernabout the National Guard this week.REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): You got to figure that in the Guard, which ispredominately more conservative that I see that on my social media, and weknow it. They're probably not more than 25 percent of the people that arethere protecting us who voted for Biden, the other 75 percent are in theclass that would be the large class of folks who might want to dosomething.EDSON: Republicans and Trump administration officials quickly condemnedCongressman Cohen.CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING U.S. SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: Those commentsare offensive. They're disgusting, and every member of Congress should bedemanding that he apologized for those comments.EDSON: Cohen's office says he was answering a question about the Guard andthe January 6th Capital riot and that the congressman has and continues tosupport the National Guard.Also, a law enforcement official tells Fox News the FBI has warned agenciesthat officials are still trying to identify the suspect responsible forplacing pipe bombs near the Capitol January 6th, the FBI warns that thereis concern the person is still active and could attempt more explosivedevices.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (on camera): Workers have been adding barbed wire to the fencingbehind me. We're just a couple of blocks away from the Capitol in the U.S.Supreme Court. And beyond this area, there's plenty of the city that'sclosed down businesses, bridges and roadways.

In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measuresaround international travel in order to further mitigate the spread ofCOVID-19.We're also learning a little bit more about the future First Lady Dr. JillBiden from daughter Ashley.ASHLEY BIDEN, DAUGHTER OF JOE BIDEN: Dad loves his Raisin Bran in themorning, and she's like Joe, wash that bowl don't put it in the sink.DOOCY: A hallmark of Biden remarks quotes from Irish poets and today he puthis own twist on a line from James Joyce that when I die, Dublin will bewritten on my heart.BIDEN: Excuse the emotion but when I die, Delaware will be written on myheart.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): Tonight's event reflected Biden's belief that we are inthe middle of a dark winter because of COVID-19. And we just watched as along motorcade of blue and red sirens passed by these amber lanterns takingBiden on a four-minute trip to Blair House right across the street fromPresident Trump. They are neighbors for one night, Bret.BAIER: And they won't see each other. Peter Doocy live on the mall. Peter,thanks.We will have complete coverage of the inauguration tomorrow.

One of theitems is how power will be divided in an evenly divided chamber.Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things standtonight. Good evening, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST (on camera): Bret, good evening. Ashort time ago, spokesman for Senator Chuck Schumer said Schumer andSenator Mitch McConnell had a substantive meeting and made progress on theissues of quickly confirming Biden nominees and conducting a fairimpeachment trial.Schumer says the fairest, most reasonable and easiest path forward in termsof running the Senate is to follow the 2001 bipartisan agreement betweenthen leaders Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, allowing equal representation oncommittees and largely sharing power.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (voice over): Late today, Senators Mitch McConnell and ChuckSchumer met to discuss how best to operate a 50-50 Senate.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): We are to pursue bipartisan agreementeverywhere we can and check and balance one another respectfully.EMANUEL: Their discussion expected to include possible power sharing, moreCOVID relief and confirming the Biden cabinet.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Those cabinet officials in charge of nationalsecurity must be confirmed quickly, as well as those in charge ofresponding to the current health and economic crises.EMANUEL: Today, five cabinet nomination hearings with Secretary of Statenominee Antony Blinken asked what the Trump administration got right onforeign policy.ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINEE: President Trump was right intaking a tougher approach to China. I disagree very much with the way thathe went about it in a number of areas. But the basic principle was theright one --EMANUEL: Another big issue, Iran.BLINKEN: President-Elect Biden is committed to the proposition that Iranwill not acquire a nuclear weapon.EMANUEL: A major focus in Homeland Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas'confirmation hearing Biden administration immigration policy. Mayorkas sayshe does not support defunding ICE and was pressed by Senator Mitt Romney onhandling a new migrant caravan.SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): What's the plan?

In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh thecosts.EMANUEL: At General Lloyd Austin's confirmation hearing to lead thePentagon, Austin made the case for receiving a waiver, which the House andSenate must authorize since he retired from the Army in 2016.GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN (RET.), DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: Today I appear beforeyou as a citizen, and if you confirm me, I am prepared to serve now as acivilian.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): Democrats are eager to get the Biden team confirmed asquickly as possible but Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley has put ahold on Mayorkas' nomination. Hawley says he's worried about Bidenimmigration policy and enforcement of the law, Bret.BAIER: Mike, thank you.A rhetorical shot at the soon to be former president from one of hispolitical allies from the Senate floor in the wake of all that has happenedand had happened on January 6th. Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergramhas the story from Capitol Hill tonight. Good evening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Good evening, Bret. Well, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pulledno punches today. He placed the blame for the assault on the Capitol onJanuary 6th at the feet of the President of the United States.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The mob was fed lies. They were provoked bythe president and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear andviolence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federalgovernment, which they did not lie.PERGRAM (voice over): Just before the attack on the Capitol on January 6th,McConnell criticized sweeping conspiracy theories. He warned Republicans ofheading down a "poisonous path" contesting electoral votes from Arizona andPennsylvania.McConnell himself didn't recognize President-Elect Biden as the winneruntil early December. That drew criticism from Democrats. They saidMcConnell should have led by example and acknowledged Biden's win early on.They contend that McConnell could have diffused some of the rancor.Attorney General Bill Barr called the raid on the Capitol "despicable" butBarr said the riot did not surprise him. Still, the former attorney generalwouldn't go as far as McConnell, saying, the president's words prompted theriot.WILLIAM BARR, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: We just cannottolerate violence interfering with the processes of government. When peoplelose confidence in the media, and also when they lose face and theintegrity of elections, you're going to have some people resort toviolence.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): Fox has told that McConnell is seething at thepresident he's no longer going to be the majority leader, he is going to bethe minority leader later this week.He blames the loss of the Senate on the president and those Georgiarunoffs. Watch to see how Mitch McConnell approaches a Senate trial andwatch to see how he may influence other Republican senators. Remember, ittakes two-thirds to convict in the Senate. Bret?BAIER: Chad Pergram, live on the Hill. Chad, thank you.Up next, a look back at the Trump administration and a look forward to thefuture of the GOP. I'll be joined by former vice president of the UnitedStates Dan Quayle.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: In these final hours of the Trump administration, we're going totake a look at some of the major happenings over the last four years,things viewed by the president's supporters as major accomplishments, andby his detractors as something else. Here is correspondent Gillian Turner.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We achieve more than anyone thought possible.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): PresidentTrump before today has stayed largely silent on the topic of his ownlegacy, but top officials have not. Vice President Pence touting nationaldefense over the weekend.PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON EUROPEAN AND RUSSIAN AFFAIRS: We've rebuilt ourmilitary; we've restored the arsenal of democracy.TURNER: Today, the secretary of state making a major move to lock in gainsmade against China's government. Formally accusing the Communist Party ofgenocide on the world stage.MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: The Chinese Communist Partyhas committed these crimes against humanity --TURNER: It's a continuation of the Trump administration's push to holdChina accountable for the coronavirus pandemic and the trade war that hascost the U.S. economy over $300 billion.TRUMP: China's pattern of misconduct is well-known.TURNER: Across the Arabian Sea, political experts tell Fox News, it's theAbraham Accords, the foundation steps from Mideast peace that will cementthe Trump administration's foreign policy legacy.ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Just remarkable to have fourMuslim nations, three Arab nations enter into peace agreements with Israel.Joining Egypt and joining Jordan. It's a sea change in the Middle East.TURNER: The Accords are one of the rare Trump-era policy achievements theincoming Biden team plans to keep, declaring in September, they will buildon these steps.Here at home, the signature accomplishment of the Trump administration inthe eyes of the president's own team is the pre-COVID economy. Thestrongest the U.S. had seen in nearly three decades, according to the WallStreet Journal. Poverty tumbled, and America's least skilled workers sawsignificant wage increases. President Trump attributes this in large partto sweeping deregulation across industries.TRUMP: For every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federalregulations would be permanently removed.TURNER: The jewel in the Trump administration's crown of domesticachievements just may be the appointment of a record-breaking number offederal judges across the country, including 54 appellate judges and threeSupreme Court justices who will determine American jurisprudence fordecades to come.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera): Another signature achievement to track over the comingdecades is the creation of Space Force, which re-launched America into the21st-century space race.So, while President Trump will depart 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue tomorrowunder the cloud of impeachment, he leaves behind a solid policy record andwill take with him an 87 percent approval rating among Republicans. Bret?BAIER: Gillian, thank you. Let's talk about it with former Vice PresidentDan Quayle. Mr. Vice President, thanks for being here.DAN QUAYLE, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you.BAIER: You know, 32 years ago, January 20th, 1989, you were sworn in,administered the oath of office by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, PresidentReagan looking on as you took the oath there in front of the Capitol.Here you are today, why did you feel compelled to come back to this eventtomorrow?QUAYLE: Well, first of all, I think I've been to every inauguration sincethe Jimmy Carter inauguration in 1977 when I was a new member of theCongress.I also believe that somebody in my position really needs to show up towitness the transfer of power, the peaceful transfer of power. It's amagical moment. Something that American history has proven to be able tosee this over, you know, centuries.Also, you know, I'd know Joe Biden fairly well. I served with him in theSenate. I think I've known him for 40 years. He is a good person; I wishhim the very best. I hope I get to talk to him briefly, although, I don'tknow if I will or not.And also, finally, if there is any hesitation, I know, there was a lot ofhesitation with people such as myself. I think in this -- the circumstancesright now that it's imperative or not imperative, but I think it'simportant that to show up to show the bipartisanship, show that Republicansand Democrats are united in trying to move this country forward, and that'swhat it's all about.BAIER: Well, you know, the picture of Bush 41 greeting Bill Clinton thereon the White House, 1993. That has happened every time as well with theincoming president going to the White House with the incoming first lady.That's not happening this time.And the current leader of your party, President Trump is not going to be atthe inauguration. So, what do you -- what do you make of that?QUAYLE: Well, I think it's unfortunate. I wish he -- that he had -- or whatwas going to attend the inauguration.I remember that moment in history did riding it to the Capital with AlGore, who I served within the Congress and also the Senate. On our trip upto Capitol Hill, we had amicable discussion about our family, about, youknow, where the country was going. Dick Gephardt was also in the car.That's part of the tradition, but as you well know, this president, youknow, tradition is not necessarily his strong suit. So, unfortunately, he'snot going to attend. But my good friend Mike Pence will be there, my fellowHoosier. He'll be there and I'll be there. So, you know, hopefully, thatwe'll add a little bit of support for that -- the inauguration that willtake place tomorrow.BAIER: Mr. Vice President, the -- President Trump obviously tapped intosomething four years ago. The forgotten man. There were a lot of people,this time, 74 million who voted for him.Where do you think your party goes from here after President Trump leavestomorrow? Where do you think the GOP is, and where it goes?QUAYLE: Well, today I would say the party is split. Time will tell whetherwe can get that back together or not. I think that we can. Bret, I thinkyou have to sort of separate the policies and the accomplishments of theTrump administration with the personality.The policies of the Trump administration, I think, you know, a great numberof people in the Republican Party support what he's accomplished, you know.Your previous segment had all the accomplishments that he had with thejudges, and deregulation, less taxes no new wars. So, I think that, youknow, policies are fine. It's really the personality.And let me just be very clear about this. I think from a political point ofview, it's a lot easier to correct personalities than it is policies. Thereare not deep divisions in the Republican Party on policy. It's more, moreabout the personality of President Trump, and I think that's going to befairly easy to correct with whoever the new leader in the party thatemerges. There'll be a number of them looking at 24, 22. There'll be a lotof people out there campaigning for senators, congress, you know, men andwomen, governors.So, it will take time. But we'll get there, I -- just because there are notthose deep policy divisions.BAIER: Vice President Dan Quayle, we appreciate your time tonight. 32 yearsafter you were sworn in. Thanks a lot.QUAYLE: 32 years ago.BAIER: You got it. Thanks, have a good one.(CROSSTALK)QUAYLE: That's a long time. It's a long time.BAIER: Up next, the latest in the investigation -- that is.In the resignation of the Capitol riot and the most recent arrest. As youlook live the National Mall, of the flags there. There won't be people, butthere'll be flags. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  It has been almost two full weeks since the Capitol riot, and we'regetting word of more arrests tonight.

This morning, authorities arrested a 65-year-old Virginia man named Thomas Caldwell, who according to this courtdocument, holds a leadership post with the far-right militia group calledthe Oath Keepers. According to a criminal affidavit, what differentiatesthem from other antigovernment groups is their explicit focus on recruitingcurrent and former military, law enforcement, and first responderpersonnel.MICHAEL GERMAN, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  This is a problem that has beenpersistent through our history, and that is the association of some membersof the military and some law-enforcement officers with white supremacistsand far-right militant groups.SPUNT:  Caldwell is facing multiple charges, including conspiracy, thefirst defendant to face that charge. Also in custody, 22-years-old RileyJune Williams, facing charges of violent entry and disorderly conduct onCapitol grounds.

He died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. Sofar authorities have conducted dozens of interviews in that investigation.Bret?BAIER:  David, thank you.Coming up, we'll have the panel going down the list of accomplishments forthe Trump administration and what lies ahead.First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country arecovering tonight.

Correspondent Jonathan Serrie has our update fromAtlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As U.S. coronavirus cases surpass24 million, researchers at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles warn a new strainmay be responsible for more than one-third of cases in L.A. However,vaccines still appear to work against new mutations.DR. ERIC VAIL, CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER:  Everyone who has the abilityto get a vaccine should go get a vaccine. I think that is a thing that willeventually get this pandemic over.SERRIE:  But the vaccine rollout has been slow, especially in parts of thesoutheast. In Mississippi, nearly two-thirds of private clinics haveadministered less than half of the vaccine they have been allocated,prompting the governor to withhold additional shipments.GOV. TATE REEVES, (R-MS):  The vaccines that we don't send to sites thatare falling behind can be used to support sites that are efficientlygetting the vaccine out.SERRIE:  One bright spot, West Virginia bypassed the federal government'spartnership with national drug store chains to bring in local pharmacies,health departments, and the National Guard to vaccinate more residents percapita than any other U.S. state. As Wisconsin prepares to make vaccineavailable to teachers, child care providers, and police, grocery storeworkers are questioning why they are not included among these essentialworkers. And an expert panel commissioned by the World Health Organizationhas criticized China and other countries for not responding faster to theinitial outbreak and limiting the WHO's authority to investigate.ELLEN JOHNSON SIRLEAF, FORMER LIBERIAN PRESIDENT:  When it comes to apotential new disease threat, all WHO can do is ask and hope to be invitedin.(END VIDEO TAPE)SERRIE (on camera):  Today's Surgeon General Jerome Adams issued a reportcalling on businesses to partner with community health organizations.

They are bringing crime, they arerapists, and some, I assume, are good people.I don't, frankly, have time, for total political correctness.Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslimsentering the United States.I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and Iwouldn't lose any voters, OK?We're going to have great borders. We're going to have the wall.You had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people thatwere very fine people on both sides.As far as people getting out of prison, you're going to get that chance.You're going to really make everyone proud.First it was the Russia hoax, then it was Mueller, remember Mueller withthat hoax.I can tell you on COVID or coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it,plenty of names, tremendous progress is being made.After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new MiddleEast.This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and JusticeKavanaugh.Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, we developed a vaccine in just nine months.This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of thesepeople. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you.This impeachment is causing tremendous anger. I think it's causingtremendous danger to our country.I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.Thank you and farewell.

What do you say?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  I actually think thatis kind of what the last four years have been like, these two verydivergent views of the Trump administration. Today is a day that makesWashington, D.C., extremely happy. The establishment has accomplished whatit set out to do every day for the last four years. They are seeing the endof the Trump presidency.And for Republicans, for many Republicans, most Republicans, this is a verysad day. They're saying goodbye to what many people think is the bestpresident they will ever know. And it's worth thinking about what heaccomplished during this administration over unprecedented obstruction,resistance, sometimes even illegal behavior, whether it was reorienting inforeign policy to be in the nation's interest, reorienting trade policy tobe in the interest of the middle class, deregulation that allowedbusinesses and individuals to flourish without the burden of strictregulations, and showing how the media and the administrative state are socorrupt and so unaccountable and can be a threat to the republic.And so it is like that situation where you are in these two worlds withvastly different looks, and I think for a lot of Republicans lookingforward, they are hoping that there will be other people with the fortitudeto take on some of these big issues that they elected Donald Trump to takeon.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Tom, Real Clear Politics, might as well toss to a Real ClearPolitics average. President Trump's job approval from 01/08 to 01/18, 40percent average of polls, and you can see the drop, but some of them havebeen down to 29. This is over the past 12 days or so. Thoughts on how heleaves this office, and what it means going forward?TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER:  Yes, his approval rating hasdefinitely taken a hit since January 6th, and that will hang over his exit.But I think his list of accomplishments, again, setting aside thepersonality and the drama and all of that, is substantial. And many ofthese things the Democrats and Joe Biden will try and reverse,deregulation, immigration policy, et cetera.The one thing they won't be able to reverse or take away from him is theSupreme Court, three justices, which was one of the, I think, forconservatives, for Republicans, will be his strongest and most lastinglegacy. And then internationally, of course, the Abraham Accords issomething that will be, I think, at the top of his foreign policy legacy.And once he's off the scene, we'll have to see how the public processes himand his compliments, because usually when presidents leave the fray, theiropinions, and we've seen this with Truman and Bush 43 and many otherpresidents, their favorability ratings or approval ratings go up, and we'llsee if that happens with Trump or not.BAIER:  Chuck, we've heard all kinds of pundits on the left, and maybe evennot so left, saying that Trump supporters somehow have to be reprogrammed,or there needs to be de-Trumpification out of the GOP. As Biden gets readyto deliver this speech tomorrow, what is the outreach, do you think, to the74 million people who voted for Donald Trump? Does he care inside hisparty?CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, "WASHINGTON POST":  I think he is going tosay something like he's already been saying, which he wants to be thepresident for the entire country, including the people who did not vote forhim. And he's going to be saying that in spite of the fact that the countryhas been governed for years by somebody who didn't show that the mediacould be dangerous to the republic, but showed in fact that some of thethings he was saying were creating dangers to the republic, as we saw onJanuary 6th.Listening to that compendium of quotes that you brought out, Bret, I wasjust reminded by how much more his celebrators might have to celebrate ifthe president had managed to modulate his behavior and behave decently andspeak in a civil tongue even in the face of a lot of criticism, much ofwhich was inevitably unfair. He might've been reelected if he had been ableto manage his impulses and his personality and not go crazy on Twitter andrepeat conspiracy theories. So those who are disappointed that he has beendefeated ought to consider how much he was his own worst enemy over thelast four years.BAIER:  Mollie, quickly, just in the past minute as we've been talking, theWhite House releasing a memo on declassification of certain materialsrelated to the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation, saying thepresident declassifies the remaining materials in the binder, finaldetermination under the declassification review, "I've directed theattorney general to implement the redactions proposed in the FBI's January17th submission return to the White House an appropriately redacted copy."Essentially the last move on trying to get more materials on theinvestigation into him and his campaign.HEMINGWAY:  Yes, this will be much of the remaining documents about thatRussia collusion conspiracy theory that did so much to damage theadministration. People talk about transfers of power, and it's worthremembering that four years ago at this time was the conclusion of thiseffort to undermine and sabotage the Trump administration with a spying andillegal leaking campaign to set that false and delusional conspiracy theorythat Donald Trump didn't win the 2016 election except by conspiring withRussia. It was a really sad and awful chapter, and if people wonder aboutwhy there is no unity in this country, they would be well-served to look attheir own role in perpetuating that hoax.BAIER:  OK, I don't know if that's going to be a headline, but when we comeback, a look at tomorrow's headline tonight with the panel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  A look live at the National Mall, the field of flags, you get tosee it finally.Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines with the panel. Chuck,let's start with you.LANE:  Well, obviously, the inauguration is going to be the number onestory, but the growing -- Mitch McConnell said the president provoked theviolence on January 6th, Vice President Pence will be conspicuously presentwhile the president is absent, so the post Trump reckoning with theRepublican Party continues.BAIER:  Mollie, your headline?HEMINGWAY:  Is that Trump will pardon Julian Assange. It's probably 50-50whether he does it or not. This is such an important case, the U.S. isprosecuting Assange for publishing documents that were embarrassing to theU.S. They way that they're going about it threatens journalistic freedomfor everybody who reports on malfeasance by the U.S. government, so this isan important one.BAIER:  Quick headline Tom?BEVAN:  Trump has left the building. The media, the viciousness with whichthe media has attacked Trump and his family and members of hisadministration since the day he took office I suspect will continuetomorrow, and they will gleefully celebrate his exit and give one last kickon his way out the door.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much. Tomorrow Martha MacCallumand I will host special coverage of the inauguration of Joe Biden as the46th president beginning at 11:00 a.m. eastern. That will do it for us.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
