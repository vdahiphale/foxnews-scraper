Head in sand, all we see is ass 
After the Paris attacks, President Obama pleads with the media to offer some perspective: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The media needs to help in this. I mean, I just want to say, during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus. But one of the things that has to happen is how we report on this, has to maintain perspective and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger. They're a bunch of killers with good social media. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's our O: His first reaction is always about overreaction. I think he overreacts about overreaction and it's his under-reaction about action, that's the infraction. I await a retraction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He's right, though, it's been a tough week. But it's strange how he never asks the media for perspective when emotional responses help him out. Be it climate change, guns, or even his own popularity, when the press fell head over heels with him, he never said, "A little perspective, guys. I'm not all that." No, when it's his crusade, you better lick that boot.
But maybe he's worried that terror steals the spotlight from climate change, which as you know, causes all terror. True, high temperatures create jihadists. Just look at the ISIS franchises popping up all over drought-ridden California. Oh, wait. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But we're used to our concern being smeared as fear-mongering. O's disdain for our priorities, feels lifted from "West Wing" scripts where such mockery passes for thoughtfulness and it blocks any path to unity.
The White House mascot should be the ostrich, head in the sand and all we see is ass. Whatever, time to prepare for evil. You aren't living in fear, but learning to be feared. The Islamists are mindless droids programmed by ideology and numbed by phenolphthalein. It's not a "them" anymore, it's just an "it." And there is no Islamophobia when you're extinguishing a wildfire. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So when the president says, this is not who we are, remind of that it goes both ways. We may not be who you are, either. Good for us.  </pre>
