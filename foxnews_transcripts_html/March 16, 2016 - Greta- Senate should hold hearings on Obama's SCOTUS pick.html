Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: It's time for the political games to stop and for one side to swallow its pride. Merrick Garland, the president's pick to replace Justice Scalia, deserves a hearing.

Let's all go "Off the Record." Tonight would be a great night to call all quits to all the political games that hurt the American people. Let's start with the Supreme Court and with the president.
Many of you have criticized President Obama for using executive power, saying he acts beyond his constitutional authority. Well, when it comes to the Supreme Court, the Constitution says the president shall nominate justices to the Supreme Court. Not may, but shall. And today, he did, nominating Federal Judge Merrick Garland. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while the Constitution does not require the Senate to hold a hearing on the nomination, the Senate should. And if the Senate Republicans don't like the president's choice, they can just vote no. But, instead, Senate Republicans say they won't hold a hearing. So, we citizens never hear from the nominee. That's a political game. And political games are petty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Democrats do the same thing. But political games hurt the American people, and will go on until one side acts big and stops those games. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This would be a good time to act big. Hold those hearings, so that the next time something like this happens, we can look back at this moment in our history for guidance to do the right thing.
I'm not without criticism of the president for being petty. It was disgraceful he did not drive three miles to attend Justice Scalia's funeral. But, let's put all this behind us. Let's start anew. Give Judge Garland a hearing, and if Senate Republicans don't like him, they can just vote no. But hold a hearing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
