'Off the Record', 2/7/14: America hit its debt ceiling Friday and our government is going to sugarcoat its failure with 'extraordinary measures'

Let's just go "Off the Record" for just a minute. You have got to love our government. They sugarcoat their failures, trying to make them look OK, or even worse, special or extraordinary.
Case in point, guess what happened today that they hoped you wouldn't notice? The nation just ran out of money. We've hit our debt ceiling. That's it. We can't borrow another dime. We're broke. And now, no one can lend us any money. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So now what? Well, that's where sort of the funny business comes. The nation is resorting to flimflam accounting procedures, essentially, that the Treasury Department gloriously called "extraordinary measures." That's P.R. for you. Extraordinary measures? That sounds sort of, well, sounds special. Well, that's the point. That's the sugarcoating. That's what they want you to think of their failures. Fancy description they use for themselves for their failure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How about you? What do you think the government would call you if you ran out of money, ran out of borrowing room on your credit card, and could not pay your income taxes? Well, that's easy. They would call you a deadbeat. But when they do it, it's extraordinary. And when you do it, you are a deadbeat. Now, that's all messed up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
