LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is "The Ingraham Angle." I thought things were supposed to slow down in the summer time, what happened? Well of course, there's no such thing as a slow news cycle these days, certainly not with President Trump. And we're going to have insight and analysis that you cannot and will not get anywhere else tonight. 
President Trump meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Queen today and on Monday, he's set for that one on one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Newt Gingrich is going to be here in just a moment. He's going to analyze the president's entire overseas trip and preview what's instore for Monday. Back here at home, a major development in the Mueller probe, interesting timing too. The DOJ will be announcing today, new charges against 12 Russians for hacking the Democrats in the 2016 election. But is there any evidence of collusion? Doesn't look like it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's the end of the week so you know Raymond Arroyo's going to be here for Friday Follies, a special London edition. And we're going to bring you the latest on that overhyped Trump protest balloon flying madness above London. And then discuss the president's meeting with her majesty. Plus Dinesh D'Souza joins us to unpack some of the most curious statements by the new odd couple, George W. Bush and his pal Bill Clinton.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first our top story, thousands of demonstrators hit the streets of London to protest the president's visit to England today where Trump continues to challenge the global status quo. And as we reported last night, President Trump gave an interview with the London Sun newspaper and he said British Theresa May's approach to Brexit could put a trade deal with the United States at risk, talk about ruffling some feathers. At a press conference today though, President Trump clarified things and he shared his view on several international matters.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't criticize the prime minister. I have a lot of respect for the Prime Minister and unfortunately there was a story done which was generally fine but it didn't put in what I said about the Prime Minister. And I said tremendous thigs. It's called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument. Based on just trade in general and our other relationship, which will be fine, but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade and they want to be able to trade and I think we'll be able to do that, OK. And I think she's doing a terrific job. By the way.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Prime Minister I wonder if you agree with the United States that the immigration has damaged the cultural fabric of Europe and President perhaps you could elaborate on that remark, what do you mean by that? 
TRUMP: I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things, you're changing security.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The UK has a proud history of welcoming people who are felling persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society. And over the years, overall immigration has been good for the UK.

        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wonder if, are you giving President Putin the upper hand heading into your talks given that you challenging these alliances that he seeks to break up and destroy? 
TRUMP: See that's such dishonest reporting because, of course it happens to the NBC which is possibly worse than CNN, possibly, let me explain something. We have left NATO with more money, with more unity, with more spirit than NATO probably has ever had. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would you characterize your relationship with the United Kingdom? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: I would say I give our relationship, in terms of grade, the highest levels of special, so we start off with special. I would give our relationship with the UK, and now especially after this two days with your prime minister, I would say the highest level of special. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I'd like to have the highest level of special introduction of my nest guest. Joining me now, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich whose executive producer of the George Washington documentary, oh gosh, "The First American," now available on Amazon Prime video. Oh my gosh, I cannot wait to see it on Amazon Prime, I've already watched it but Newt Gingrich, great to see you as always, very special. What did you make of that appearance today with Theresa May after that Sun article that did have an audio component so they did quote him but apparently they didn't quote him fully on what he said about May. How did that go down? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NEWT GINGRICH, R-FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well I think Trump sometimes spends a fair amount of time making up lost ground that he lost and they are allies, they are friends and I suppose that he embarrassed that it came out the way it did. She's got a very weak government in a lot of trouble and that certainly didn't help anything. But I thought the press conference actually helped her. The tone was right and Trump has actually had a very good trip and I think even the New York Times admitted in a shock editorial that he had accomplished a great deal of what Obama had tried to do with NATO but had failed to do. And I thought you know, Trump must have gotten a lot done if even the New York Times had to say it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: I think it's like this, if someone comes to our country, a foreign leader, and criticizes our president or our polices, we don't much like that in the United States and I think Donald Trump doesn't like that. When we had previous Mexican presidents doing that on our immigration, I know I hit them hard on the radio. It doesn't feel right so going and giving that interview with the Sun, well I agree it was a ridiculous mistake. 
GINGRICH: It wasn't a mistake he said. Look he's had a very good trip-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: But he clarified and he apologized apparently. 
GINGRICH: He's done very good things overall and he made a mistake. Trump is a little bit like a baseball player who strikes out but also hits a lot of home runs and there's some balance in there. I think that's his style and his nature.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: And he's still relatively new, it's a year and half into this and still a lot of successes. The criticism of the president and I got to play this for you. This was Tom Donilon former national security advisor for Barack Obama today on CNN, let's watch.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

WOLF BLITZER, CNN NEWS ANCHOR: If you were advising this president, you would tell him cancel it?

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DONILON: I wouldn't have scheduled it in the first place. It wasn't well prepared, there were no goals, it wasn't coordinated with the allies. We don't have the kind of unity you'd like to have coming into something like this. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: There are no goals, how many summits did Barack Obama have that ended up being more like just parties that kept the catering office well busy in the White House, that's ridiculous.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GINGRICH: You know I think it's inappropriate to measure the comments of an Obama administration official as though they're real. I mean these people represented a world view of weakness. They represented a world view of quote, "Leading from the rear" John Carey's model of being secretary of state was any four star hotel with any five star restaurant any time and he then thought that that was negotiating.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think that if you watch what Trump is achieving, for example, NATO members have now absolutely committed to get to the level of commitment that President Bush asked for, President Obama asked for, Trump got him to say yes. And there are a number of these things happening that I think represent substantial gain, partly by force of his personality. 
INGRAHAM: And he's different from the usual. I mean a lot of these smart people, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, all of these well-heeled think tanks, they spent their lives dedicated to geopolitical understanding and foreign policy. Written these long articles most people haven't read and a lot of them were responsible for screwing up the post-Cold War eras as Pap Yucanon said on my show today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This guy comes along with no experience and it's like, this is ridiculous. Why are we paying so much of this burden? Some of you are going to have to start coughing up more money. And why shouldn't we have a better relationship with Putin? We're not going to agree on a lot but we talked to China and they certainly have a much bigger military and in many ways more aggressive, more of a threat. And, "Oh you can't say that. Why?
GINGRICH: Well I think two things, first of all, Trump is the certainly the most unusual president since Andrew Jackson in his personality, his style, his aggressiveness. Second, I think what drives the foreign policy establishment crazy is that they're prestige, they're role in the world, is because they're really smart and they write good papers.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: It's too complicated for the little people to understand. When Donald Trump comes in ad says he explains it and we can actually do better.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GINGRICH: And he devalues all of them because he doesn't need them. So they're all sitting around going, "Oh my God, what if the new model became electing a president who didn't need us?" That's why you see this frenzy on both the right and the left among foreign policy.

 INGRAHAM: Oh the right is worse, let's face it. These people on the right, and they're this many five, they're talking just to themselves and maybe a few people on MSNBC and that's dwindling audience, God bless them. Today these indictments were handed down, very long indictments, Russian GRU officers, intelligence officers what do you make of this? There's serious allegations, hacking into American accounts, placing malware into prominent American accounts like Podesta, the DNC, very serious. 
GINGRICH: They're very serious. They raise two questions in my mind, the first is why is it that Mueller would decide to release this just before the president sees Putin? Now it's just an odd timing but I don't care personally because I think it actually strengthens Trump's hand to walk in say to Putin, "You tell me your guys didn't do that, we just indicted 12 of your people" 
But the second question I'd raise which is a very interesting question, if we're going to start going after people, if we engage in hacking in the United States, there are going to be so many Chinese that we should be indicting. That I think this is a very serious standard to start setting, probably the right standard. But it does mean we're going to go after other country's nationals in their own homeland and indict them, that will be very big change. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

TRUMP: Well we'd be talking about meddling and I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'd have any, "Gee I did it, I did it, you got me" There won't be a Perry Mason here I don't think but you never know what happens, right but I will absolutely firmly ask the question.

INGRAHAM: They have a narrative that they can't get off Trump's cozy to Putin and mean to our allies. This is a just a drum beat you hear all day long and sometimes with you're friends, you have to have a real honest relationship. 
GINGRICH: If they listen to what President Trump said to Chancellor Merkel when he went right at her and said, "Don't accept the Russian pipeline for natural gas, buy our liquid natural gas instead" He's threatening Putin with billions of dollars of losses and that was certainly not the act of somebody who is in Putin's favor.

INGRAHAM: And the more we are able to triangulate with Russia and China that's also a good thing. We don't want to drive Russia into the arms of China, that would be a disastrous point for us and Trump sees that. Again, someone who has had no experience until running for president on all these issues, I think he continues to show up so many of these people on their supposed expertise on matters that, they are complicated, they are important but Donald Trump's like, "It doesn't have to be this linear on all these things, we can have better relationships with more countries. 
GINGRICH: He also has a model in his own head that we live in an age where leaders can communicate directly with leaders. It changes the whole nature of diplomacy. He does that with Kim Jong-un and North Korea. He does it with president of China, he's doing it now with the president of Russia. As Churchill once said, "Jaw, jaw, jaw is better than war, war, war" I would much rather have them talking than have us drifting more and more towards a conflict.

INGRAHAM: And now we have Democrats saying we shouldn't talk. In the `80s they were like all we should do is talk to the Soviet Union when we needed them. I have to ask you something, speaking of the `80s. They're making this big deal of the balloon. We're going to talk about it later with Raymond Arroyo, the big Trump balloon and their protest. Yeah there are protests in London.

Remember the protest against Reagan and against Bush, we have some of the video. Reagan in '82, Bush many times, London, Berlin hundreds of thousands of people in Spain. That was '82 in Berlin and for Reagan we had fires, we had huge mass protests and yet we're supposed to believe it's only Donald Trump. We're the most hated we've ever been because of Donald Trump, you hear that all day long today. 
GINGRICH: Well listen as you know I spend a lot of fair time in Rome and recently I was in Paris. I don't think that we're hated. I think that people on the left react like people on the left. And of course a lot of the Reagan demonstrations were paid for by the Soviet Union which was actually subsiding the peace movement, something that Liberals don't like to concede. But I think that, so somebody puts up a big balloon, my first reaction is, this is the best they've got? This they're idea of intellectual answer to Trump? 
INGRAHAM: Final one more point, we're running late but on the trade issue. He's getting slammed for these tariffs. One of the top most respected analysts on financial matters from Allianz had a great quote. Actually I think we can play it if you don't mind. Let's just listen to this because it blows away what everyone is saying about tariffs and whether Trump can win a trade war, let's watch.

MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ: We are winning and we will win the trade war and I think just look at the performance of US markets relative to China and relative to others. I call it the Reagan moment for trade that when people realize that at the end of the day the US will prevail because it's a less open economy because it's a more dynamic economy.

INGRAHAM: Not quite at collusion yet are we. Well let's bring in some experts to see what they think. Kim Strassel is a columnist with the Wall Street Journal, Sol Wisenberg the attorney and former independent counsel in the White Water probe and Scott Bolden is a Democratic Strategist and an attorney. All right let's start with you Scott on your reaction on today's handing down on these indictments against Russian operatives, Intel officers with GRU.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
SCOTT BOLDEN, NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION PLC CHAIR: I think the string keeps rolling forward. With 12 indictments to go with the other 20 and you've got five convictions. The whole issue here is that America and DOJ but importantly particularly the White House has got to take this meddling seriously and I think these indictments further that process along. 
What I worry about most, whether I'm a Democrat or a Republican, is if this president doesn't accept it or doesn't take it seriously, what are administrative agencies and our government doing to prevent this from bothering or affecting the midterms or even 2020? It's a real risk. 
INGRAHAM: Right, hacking is a real problem. I mean we had one of their top Intel officials today saying that our infrastructure is highly vulnerable to hacks which could shut down our entire power grid in our country, really serious stuff. 
BOLDEN: And our border too by the way.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: And our border too. Being counting indictments, however, does not Sol Wisenberg get us to tis grad theory of collusion upon which this investigation was initially started and kicked off? But you've read more indictments than I would have ever read in my life. What did you glean from what dropped today and do you think the timing is in any way at the very least curious Sol?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, WHITEWATER: Well that's a lot of questions. Let me start with the timing being curious or suspicious. I don't know how long the Putin trip or summit has been planned. I've heard it's only a few weeks so I seriously doubt that. A couple of things though, you talk about indictment counting and you talk about the investigation being about collusion originally. 
From the beginning the investigation was also about Russian interference OK. Also whether they colluded with the people here but also about Russian influence in the election and I think this indictment goes to the heart of that. And it's real and it's serious and it certainly buys Bob Mueller a lot of time and he can say, "Hey folks, this is what I've been doing and it wasn't very easy to do and to put together"
Now to Scott's point and this may seem petty but you talk about indictment counting and being counting. This is not 12 indictments, it's one indictment id 12 people OK and he's had a perennial mis-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOLDEN: You're right that was petty. 
WISENBERG: That was petty, by you or by me?
BOLDEN: By you. 
WISENBERG: No, no by you. But the other thing to remember here and Scott will validate me on this and I know you will too Laura. You don't need much, there's right, there was no collusion whatsoever here, it's strictly a Russian operation here, it's very serious we should all be very concerned about it. However, under conspiracy law in the United States, once you have a conspiracy it takes very little to connect a new person to that conspiracy, still have to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

There are a lot of reporting with Roger Stone issue whether he knew about when these emails were going to drop. And he denies this and he says they're trying to bankrupt him, he's very adamant about this. So Kimberley the Democrats were, and it's not surprising, absolutely gleeful at the Rosenstein announcement, let's watch.

CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIFORNIA: This is no ordinary criminal case. This a criminal case that potentially implicates the president and people around his campaign.

INGRAHAM: Kimberley Mueller has racked up a lot of indictments. I mean Manafort, some of his conduct goes back many years, predates all of this. But nevertheless on the pure issue of trying to influence our election and hack into our systems, it does seem like Mueller is coming up with some facts that are very important and looks like he could probably get some convictions. Whether or not that matters because you're not going to get these people coming to the United States, they seem to be hot on the trail of something here.

        }
      
KIM STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST: Well look, what was missing from all of those comments is the realisation that yes there are this new indictment engaged in 12 people but none of it had to do with collusion. Not of it has to do with obstruction of justice from the Trump team as Rosenstein made very clear and as he did the last time they named Russian nationals who they had charged with hacking and being engaged in our election. And I think that this is the one disingenuous aspect of the Mueller probe which frustrates a lot of Americans out there, which is if he's spending 95 percent of his time looking to unravel Russian plots to infiltration here, it would be nice if he could come out and make that clear.
Because the press certainly doesn't want to go there, the Democrats they still are obsessing everyday making it out to sound like as though there's an imminent arrest of a Trump official coming at any moment. When in fact even those convictions or guilty pleas or indictments that the special counsel has filed have been unrelated to any of the original accusations. You've got a couple of them on the catch all of lying to the FBI and one for a supposed wire like money laundering fraud from a decade ago. 
INGRAHAM: Well I also think we have to remember even Rosenstein said that no evidence that this changed the outcome of the election, no evidence of an American being involved. There may be but as of now, they very pretty much better be careful how they describe this, Kimberley that's well taken. The White House comments today on this, I've got to them, "Today's charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone at the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result. This is consistent with what we have been saying all along'
Scott another thing a friend raised with me and I hadn't thought of it, I wish I had. Doesn't it underscore how important it was for Hillary or anyone else in high levels of government not to have unsecure email servers? Remember back when we discovered that this email server had been unsecure that she was using, very unusual the way she was keeping her emails.
Peter Strzok when this issue was raised with him about whether this could have been compromised, pretty much every expert believes the Russians probably were able to hack into her system. They were going into Podesta's, they were trying to go into hers. He decided not to engage on that issue. Curious, if they're so worried about Russian hacking, they didn't seem all that worried about hacking into Hillary's emails? 
BOLDEN: Well the federal government and those agencies appropriate ought to be concerned about if they're unsecure processors are--
INGRAHAM: But this was the secretary of state having an email server in a house or within a bathroom and then the Russians are--  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOLDEN: You sound like you're going to Hillary Clinton for email being hacked. That's like blaming the robber because the bank left the doors open. 
INGRAHAM: I am saying that if you guys are worrying about the secretary of state, as smart and savvy as she was, trying to circumvent the normal course of business in government and making her communications vulnerable and everything that was in--
BOLDEN: I think they were and that's why they said that her conduct--
INGRAHAM: She was worried about that? When she was caught she was. 
BOLDEN: I think the government, well there were rules against how she should operate--
INGRAHAM: She violated them all. 
BOLDEN: Absolutory. And whether she was reckless or careless or what have you, that's been said.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');

        }
      
WISENBERG: Laura. 
INGRAHAM: Yeah Sol go ahead. 
WISENBERG: Well the indictment apparently appears to say, it doesn't mention her by name. Apparently on the very day that the president said, "Russia if you're listening find those missing emails" They apparently later that night made an attempt to go into her server and to find them and apparently, according to the indictment, it was unsuccessful. They have to be describing her. But if could just speak very briefly to one's of Kimberley's points. I think it's wrong to say that this has nothing to do with his original charter or what he was originally supposed to be looking at. It's true that-- 
STRASSEL: I never said that, I never said it had nothing to do with it. 
WISENBERG: OK. 
STRASSEL: I said rather that it I think it would behove him to come out and make clear that this has been one of his main focusses. 
BOLDEN: But it's in the document. He said that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WISENBERG: Rosenstein has already said that for him. My point is that you're right, it's a very important point. It doesn't look like they have anything close to a collusion case and we certainly haven't seen more evidence of this. 
INGRAHAM: They're coming up empty on it. They're coming up empty. 
BOLDEN: No they're not. Why are we closing the investigation down?
INGRAHAM: We're not. 
WISENBERG: But he was supposed to be looking for Russian interference in general and this goes to the heart of that, and I think it's very wrong to have said to him, "It's a witch hunt" Now what does he go and do, he wants to get tough with Putin and say, "Look what you've done. Look what you're people have been indicted for. You had to have known about it" What's Putin going to say? "Well this the guy you've been attacking. You said he's running a witch hunt" So I don't think that's good. 
STRASSEL: But they could have solved this though. 
INGRAHAM: All right last word Scott and then Kim.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOLDEN: Let's talk about this briefly, collusion right? The GOP believes that since there's no collusion that therefore somehow the White House and Donald Trump are absolved of something. Collusion is not a crime, it's an act. It will be in the body of the indictment. The charges whether it's money laundering or something else, that will be what the charges are. And the other important thing is that this investigation is about Russia but it's also about whether there were Russian connections to Donald Trump. Just remember that.
INGRAHAM: All tight Kimberley, last word. 
STRASSEL: So Mueller could have solved all this and made it a lot easier for himself with the press out there suggesting all the time that he has been working non-stop against just on the Trump campaign, that this was his sole purpose. We know the Mueller campaign leaks, they're team put stuff out, they could have corrected that impression, made clear that one of their focus was on the Russians or the bigger focus was on that. And then it wouldn't have cause the White House to then suggest that this cause was about something very different. 
INGRAHAM: And then the PR has always been it's someone in the Trump campaign, it's Manafort. The PR has always been separate from the legal issues Scott and Sol raised great points, but separate from the legal issues, PR was always, "Donald Trump himself was pulling the lever or someone else at high levels" and I think Kimberley is right about that. Great segment, have a great weekend guys. Up next, Raymond Arroyo will be here to explain how Trump's visit with the queen actually went really well today. And why the media is so obsessed that Trump has this little protest balloon which I think it cute. A British edition of the Friday Follies, next.

ARROYO: Yes we do, from Truman back in 1951 before she was on the throne, then there was Eisenhower in 57. And then after that she met with everybody from Ford to Carter. President Carter -- 
INGRAHAM: FDR. No, that's Truman.. 
ARROYO: No, Truman. Believe, President Carter kissed the queen mother on the lips causing her to proclaim no one's done that since my husband died.

(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: So there have been some snafus. Today went swimmingly actually. And by the way, today 13 presidents have met with Queen Elizabeth because she met with Herbert Hoover in a hotel room -- 
INGRAHAM: Look at her smiling. Look at her smiling. She's having a good time with Trump. I love her. 
ARROYO: She had a great time with Trump. This was a very gracious, beautiful tea. They got along well. She was smiling and pointing him where to go. There was one awkward movement -- 
INGRAHAM: Must you go to the awkward moment? 
ARROYO: I couldn't help but imagine what was going through the mind of the queen as they reviewed this honor guard. 
INGRAHAM: Donald, would you move to the left. You're blocking me, young chap. Oh, he has no clue.

        }
      
ARROYO: Queenie, I've got to say, you were wonderful in the crown. So good in the crown. Don't put me up. Now we're in trouble. We're doing bubbles in their head. 
INGRAHAM: I just love her. I'm sorry. In 1939 she sat, not as queen but sat as the daughter of the king with FDR. 
ARROYO: I'm not true if that happened. That was her mother, Elizabeth. She looks almost exactly like her. It was her mother. 
INGRAHAM: OK, I got that wrong. Edit that out.
ARROYO: Sorry about that. But then there were in central London these protests at the same moment that flooded the streets, which it's kind of uncharacteristic that you'd have this level of protests given the Chinese president, Putin, Robert Mugabe have all come to town with virtually no protests. But it drew a huge crowd. Piers Morgan on "Good Morning Britain" challenged one of these protesters, a woman named Ash Sarkar, and she claimed to protesting Trump's immigration policies, and did it get ugly. 
INGRAHAM: Let's watch.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ASH SARKAR: I'll be marching in Westminster tomorrow alongside thousands of other people who found the policy of forced separation unconscionable, who think that the sight of our elected prime minister holding Donald Trump's hand is an utter embarrassment -- 
PIERS MORGAN: Did you find Obama deporting 3 million people unconscionable. Why don't you check out some basic facts about your hero? Obama. 
SARKAR: He's not my hero. I'm a communist you idiot.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The centerpiece of the protest today was that Trump baby which I think is adorable. I have no problem with the baby balloon. I think it's adorable. I want to hit it around with my kids. CNN covered it as if it actually was a visiting head of state, Raymond. Look at that thing.
ARROYO: Wait till you see this coverage. This is hilarious. They were covering every moment of the floating balloon. 
INGRAHAM: It's so cute. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nick, you've been all over the Trump baby balloon. What is the latest? 
NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Not major stunning development here. It's been up in the air for 35 minutes. Nothing has changed there. It's got about another hour and 25 under the permission granted by the London local authority, actually London's mayor, Sadiq Khan. Bear in mind there's a lot of political context around this balloon. Just to repeat what it is, Donald Trump as a baby, as an infant in a nappy or a diaper holding a mobile phone obviously where he dispatches his favorite weapon of war, Twitter. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: His favorite weapon of war.
INGRAHAM: He's holding a nappy with his cell phone. 
ARROYO: Here's the amazing thing here. It was a 19-foot balloon. This is hardly a blimp.
INGRAHAM: They're making it look like a Macy's day parade the way they're shooting it, the way you shoot the balloon. 
ARROYO: But here's the amazing thing, if you watch closely, the people surrounding it, these are like the Israelites around the golden calf. They were beating drums and singing songs to this Trump weeble, and they attributed the presence of the balloon with driving Trump away from Central London. This was practically a pagan religious -- 
INGRAHAM: If they did something like that with Obama, what they would have said.
ARROYO: It's very curious. The Turkish president, Erdogan was here not long ago. He's charged with horrible atrocities. 
INGRAHAM: They were smashing the security detail. 
ARROYO: When he was here in the United States. He goes there, there are almost no protests. But the last big protests like this where when George Bush visited during the Iraq War, 100,000 people showed up in the streets. They selectively get outraged. 
INGRAHAM: Bush equals terrorists. Here's some of the headlines, thousands of, Reagan, then Bush, a region inflamed in protests. "New York Times," marchers in London denounce Bush visit. Thousands of people in London, thousands of people in Europe. They have a long, long, long, memory about conservative slights, but they have a very, very short memory about these types of historical --
ARROYO: As Piers Morgan was alluding to, it seems as if the outrage is selective. If Obama was guilty of doing the same thing Trump is why didn't you have a protest there? 
INGRAHAM: Raymond, thank you. And globalists much? Some former president's level thinly veiled criticisms of Trump at the NATO summit. Dinesh D'Souza here to explain. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: President Trump of course making some demands of our European counterparts, but two former occupants of his office thought it was necessary, of course, to take shots thinly veiled at our commander-in-chief. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I view the role of the United States as very important. The truth of the matter is the way the world is today that if the U.S. takes the lead, others tend to follow. 
BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Do you really want to say we're going to make everybody have a big military but we're not going help build their own future and change their own lives? I don't think so. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's right, the new best buds George W. Bush and Bill Clinton scolded the current president for essentially doing what they could not, or did not, would not, take NATO to task for their decades of free riding on the United States. To discuss the latest edition of the globalists striking back, let's bring in Dinesh D'Souza whose new document "Death of a Nation" comes out August 3rd. Everyone is very excited, his book as well. Dinesh, it's a little low, I think, isn't it to take shots at the president while he's abroad. We know what they were talking about. They didn't mention him by name, but come on. 
DINESH D'SOUZA, AUTHOR AND FILMMAKER: The very fact that two guys who ran against each other from opposite parties can come together like this shows how Trump has changed the political cartography, the whole map of international relations. 
In a sense this should have been done in 1992 when the Soviet Union collapsed because the whole NATO alliances was assembled for the purposes of anti-communism. In fact, some of it even goes back to World War II. The reason we pay for the defense of places like Germany and even Japan is we were afraid of them, those countries remilitarizing in the way that they did in the 30s and 40s. So an accounting, a reexamination is long overdue. It took an outsider, Trump, to do it. And to watch these old geezers complain about it, these guys have been like toy soldiers who walk in the wall and keep going. The examination was overdue in their time and it's happening finally now. 
INGRAHAM: Pat Buchannan was on radio with me, I guess it was yesterday, and he said, look, the days of the open border, endless trade deals with no amendments, that day is over. Endless wars, those days are over. So it's the last gasp in many ways of that old political establishment. That was a bipartisan cabal in many ways really geared against the people, weren't listening to the people. And they were both two-term presidents, but on the blue collar issues that we care about, manufacturing, jobs, trade, immigration, they were both total disasters. 
D'SOUZA: Where I find amusing is people focus on the injustice of illegal immigration to natives, to people in America. But I'd like to point out the injustice of illegal immigration to legal immigrant. I'm a legal immigrant. It took me several years to go through the immigration process. Many of us don't come from countries where you can just jump over a wall or swim across a river. It's very difficult to get to America and there's a line. So the illegal immigrant is actually jumping the line against the interest of the legal immigrant who is standing in lined. That aspect of the injustice of it is rarely pointed out. The Democrats, and we see this also with Clinton and Bush, they're conflating legal and illegal immigration as if they amount to the same thing. 
INGRAHAM: He did that. He did that all day long at the event in Arkansas. And George W. Bush, again, a very nice man, I like him personally, but he just gets it wrong on immigration every single time. But he's just utterly -- he throws out words out like "nativism," "isolationism," protectionism." They just trip off his tongue without any reference to the current political dynamic. And Dinesh, this is what he said today, or yesterday, I guess, about the immigration issue. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUSH: I'm disturbed by the debate that's taking place because I think it undermines the goodness of America. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So Dinesh, you're a bad person if you don't agree with the Bush, more open borders, amnesty plus idea of the world. You're a bad person. That's very Christian. 
D'SOUZA: This immigration debate is so filled with cliches, most of these cliches happen to be wrong. Even the people who say that America was in a sense created by immigrants, that's a half truth. America was actually a country created by settlers. Settlers are the people who create the original country that immigrants subsequently want to move to. Immigrants are attracted by the kind of society that settlers build. They find it preferable to their own society. That's why they immigrate. But that distinction, again, is often lost by people who say America was created by immigrants. 
INGRAHAM: Dinesh D'Souza, looking forward to your film. Thank you so much for being here with us. 
And I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I saw some of the headlines out of Boston this week. Check this out, speaking of immigration. The city council held a hearing this week on whether to grant voting rights to some noncitizens in local elections, voting rights. The measure is reportedly at a standstill because some of the councilmembers are getting flooded with calls and emails from residents who are understandably quite angry about the idea, what a surprise. 
Joining me with reaction about this and a lot more, Pam Bondi, Florida's Republican attorney general. Pam, we have seen this issue pop up in California where there's been a push for, of course, full health care benefits for illegal immigrants and driver's licenses, and everybody has driver's licenses, concern about voter fraud. But in Boston it would be people with green cards but lots of categories of people who are illegally in the country but not yet citizens. What do you think about that? 
PAM BONDI, R-FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: That's right. Well, we're obviously a nation of laws. They're doing this in Maryland, too. They've started it in various cities in local elections in Maryland. It's not illegal in local elections but it is in state and federal. So Laura, just talking about the voter fraud, my gosh, how do you distinguish in Florida on the ballot, you have multiple races. So how do you know that people -- first of all, what kind of I.D. are they going to use. And then what are they going to use, their green card to come vote. And then are they going create separate ballots to ensure that they don't vote in state and federal races, because if they do they could go to prison or be deported. So I don't even know from a practical standpoint how they're going to make that work. 
INGRAHAM: It reminds me of some of the push for legalized marijuana. You start with, oh, it's OK, it's medical marijuana. Then it's the door was open and all of a sudden you're in Colorado, which I love, but lots of people think it's a dooms day. 
I have got to move on to what they're doing to Brett Kavanaugh. The Hill had a piece today saying that Murkowski and Collins, two more pro-choice type Republican senators both look like they were inclined to view his nomination favorably, I guess perhaps to support his nomination. Tat would kill the Democrats' chances of derailing Kavanaugh. This is just great, now they are trying to get him by association by this Me Too movement by saying a judge he clerked for, Alex Kozinski, on the ninth circuit, himself was charged abusing or accused of abusing clerks. How did Brett Kavanaugh not know about this? This is how low it gets. Tell us about the story and where you think this is going to go. 
BONDI: I think these are the extremists of the party and they have nothing 
 on Judge Kavanaugh, so that's why they're going to go after him with 
 everything they got. This ridiculous rhetoric, they started off right away 
 saying he threatens American lives by his opinions is ridiculous. 
Let me tell you about my senator, Bill Nelson in Florida. Bill Nelson, before -- after President Trump said four people, gave us four nominees, said he would blanketly oppose all four. How absurd is that, when he previous had supported one of them to be on the bench? So it makes no sense. And these Democrats can either stand shoulder to shoulder, Bill Nelson can, with the extremists of his party, or they can follow the laws. Elections have consequences, and this is our nominee. 
The three things I always say are so important in a judge and especially a justice, are intelligence, integrity, and humility. He's brilliant. You and I know he's beyond reproach. And I got to know him, you know him much better than I, but I got to know him on person level because I hired his law clerk as my solicitor general. And getting to know him, what was impressive to me about Judge Kavanaugh is his humility. He is a real guy. 
INGRAHAM: What they're doing is pathetic, it's transparent, and it's sickening and it's not going to work. So that's all the good stuff. Pam, have a great weekend. We really appreciate it. 
And next up, a group of young interns, speaking of interns, claim that they were refused an Uber service because of what they were wearing, and they're going to be here to tell us the whole story, and it's good. Don't go away. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Three Republican interns were reportedly kicked out of an Uber car this week after the driver noticed what they were wearing. To tell us what caused this expulsion from Uber we're joined by the 20-year-old Matthew Handy along with fellow Congressional interns Elijah Allison and Adria Barrington who were also in the car at the time. First of all, isn't it fun to be an intern in Washington in the summer? Come on, guys. This is the coolest thing to do. Congrats on getting the internships. 
Let's start with you, Matthew. What the heck happened? I'm getting a hint because of what's in front of you. Where were you going, by the way? You're all together. Where were you heading? 
MATTHEW HANDY, CAPITOL HILL INTERN: We were headed to the D.C. MAGA meet up. So at the Trump hotel every month, second Tuesday, they do a D.C. MAGA meet up.
INGRAHAM: Make America Great Again meet up. 
HANDY: All the Trump supporters get together. We mingle, we exchange business cards and then just talk about current events. So that's where we were going. And we called the Uber, and he shows up at George Washington University where we're staying. And he sees us and he's like is that a Make America Great Again cap? 
INGRAHAM: Were you wearing it? 
HANDY: No. We had them in our hands like this. So he couldn't see anything. 
INGRAHAM: Very observant. 
HANDY: So he's like, is that the hat? And we're like, yes. And so he's like I can't do this ride. And so we're looking at each other because she was in the car and he was trying to get in, and I'm standing to the side. And so we're like, this say joke. And he's like, I'm serious, I can't do this ride. 
So I had this happen -- so last month the same thing happened but the Uber was joking, so that's why we didn't even try to pursue anything. 
INGRAHAM: Adria, I've got to get you on this. This is just wild. 
ADRIA BARRINGTON, CAPITOL HILL INTERN: Yes. 
INGRAHAM: People get into Ubers with bare feet. I'd rather have someone with a hat I disagree with than someone wearing some of the clothes I see people wearing out there on the streets of D.C. But as an African-American woman, as a conservative Republican, apparently you're not allowed to think certain things, that's what goes through my mind, you're not allowed to think certain things, otherwise you don't deserve to be in the car. I find that to be reprehensible. It's funny to joke about it, but it's not funny in another way. What was going through your mind? 
BARRINGTON: Well, I was frightened, I was angry, but what I was thinking afterwards was how many times has he done this and gotten away with it? Would this be the new norm where we are judged by the way we think? That's the same as being judged by your religion, your gender, or your race. So I was very upset. 
INGRAHAM: Did you get his name? 
BARRINGTON: We did. 
INGRAHAM: I bet you did. We're not going to reveal it, but Elijah? 
ELIJAH ALLISON, CAPITOL HILL INTERN: I would say he made a decision, and I respect it. I didn't question him or ask for an explanation because I didn't want things to escalate --
INGRAHAM: Good for you. 
ALLISON: -- like we've seen in the recent moves of senator -- I believe it was, I can't think of his name. 
INGRAHAM: McConnell. 
ALLISON: Yes, Mitch McConnell. He was ran out of a restaurant, and then his wife also faced some protesters, so I didn't want anything -- 
INGRAHAM: You have cabinet officials, we have Stephen Miller, Sarah Huckabee. Look at this. This is a Kirstjen Nielsen episode at a Mexican restaurant, I guess because if you believe in enforcing the U.S. border, you cannot eat Mexican food. This is where we've gotten. 
So you see this, but you said you respected his decision. I would respectfully say to you, I don't respect his decision because it is not up to us to judge people based on whether -- you can say I disagree with you. You're a Trump supporter, or get a funny comment, but to say you're not worthy of a ride, you're not worthy of a ride, I mean, I think of they'll great civil rights leaders who struggled for people to be able to be who they are without regard to skin color and gender, and now it's your mind. You can discriminate against someone for their mind, for their opinions. Matthew? 
HANDY: Of course, I was ticked off. For this to happen, and you always hear about these things so with Sarah Huckabee and all the others, and I'm like, this would never happen to me because, first, I'm not in the public eye, and there's really no reason for this to happen to people like us. And so it took a while for me to calm down. So I sent a tweet. 
INGRAHAM: We have it. I requested an Uber to go to a monthly D.C. MAGA meet up at a Trump hotel, held my faithful red MAGA hat in my hand -- I don't think the hat can be faithful.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: Sorry. I'm a Conan the grammarian. Looked at me and rudely said I cannot take this ride. He had no right to refuse service especially after the payment was accepted. Uber, unacceptable. 
Uber responded by saying, we take this seriously. Send us a direct message with your email address so we can connect. Did they connect with you? 
HANDY: They did, and they were no help. They sent the same generated responses, and every time I said you can just call me because I did send my cell phone number along with my e-mail. They never did call, and so I'm like, do they really want to help? 
INGRAHAM: We should ask Uber right now, does this apply to individuals who are pro-life, who are Uber drivers who don't like a Planned Parenthood t-shirt, and maybe it's an older woman who needs a ride somewhere. No, we can't take you. If that's the Uber policy, that's fine. Let's just know what that is, you can discriminate on their basis of thinking, their political opinion, and their mind. Adria, I've got to say it doesn't surprise me. You had that horrible thing at Starbucks where you had African-American men who were I think treated unfairly, and that got a lot of coverage. We'll see if we can get some coverage for this. You guys have a great summer, OK? Great to have you in. Let's go hand out with them after the show. We'll be right back. Stay there. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: That's all the time we have tonight. Just another quiet week in the news business. We have a huge show planned for Monday when President Trump faces off with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. 
Until then, Shannon Bream and the "Fox News @ Night" team are next. Have a great weekend, everyone. Fly your flags. Good night from Washington. See you back Monday.
