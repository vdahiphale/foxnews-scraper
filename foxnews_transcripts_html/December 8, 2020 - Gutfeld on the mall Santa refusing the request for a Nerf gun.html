DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  The White House hosting a summit on the
Coronavirus vaccine, and we will continue to monitor it for any big
developments. In the meantime, hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, with
Jesse Watters, Geraldo Rivera, Dagen McDowell, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00
in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.

President Trump says America is just days away from the first COVID
vaccine. The president also signing an executive order and making sure
Americans will have first priority on any vaccine made inside the country.
Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are just days away from
authorization from the FDA, and we are pushing them hard, at which point we
will immediately begin mass distribution, sign an executive order to ensure
that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the
vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations.

The work that's been done is incredible, and it will be incredible for the
next administration, and hopefully the next administration will be the
Trump administration.

(END VIDEO TAPE)

PERINO (on camera):  And the media being criticized for not focusing on
vaccine progress, but instead, asking the president questions like these.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

UNKNOWN:  I'm wondering what your message is to the American people given
all the increase in cases right now.

UNKNOWN:  Across the street, you've been holding parties with hundreds of
people, many not wearing masks. Why are you following different behavior to
the American people?

UNKNOWN:  Why not include members of the Biden transition team as part of
this summit you're hosting today?

(END VIDEO TAPE)

PERINO (on camera):  And while some Americans are pushing back against new
COVID restrictions, President-Elect Joe Biden touting his own plan for the
pandemic by calling on Americans to do this.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My first 100 days
won't end the COVID-19 virus. I can't promise that, but, but, we did not
get into this mess quickly. We are not going to get out of it quickly. My
first 100 days is going to require -- I am going to ask for a masking plan.
It will start with my sign in order on day one to require masks where I
can, under the law, like federal buildings, interstate travel on planes,
trains, and buses.

(END VIDEO TAPE)

PERINO (on camera):  Geraldo, I thought I would start with you today and
just maybe take a look at the bigger picture at vaccine development and how
this incredible -- this progress has been. When the mumps vaccine was, you
know, rushed, it took four years to get done. And so there's been a lot of
advancements, and this is quite an achievement that America can talk about
today.

GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST:  It's a spectacular achievement, Dana. And I
am really torn. I have a feeling of elation on the one hand, of course,
that they have done this Operation Warp Speed. And we now have two vaccines
ready to go. By the end of this week, Americans will begin getting their
inoculations.

And on the other hand, Dana, I feel a tremendous sense of regret and
melancholy. My elation is that the vaccine is there. My regret and
melancholy is the fact that Donald Trump is not going to get credit for it.
If this thing had been six weeks ago, we would've had an entirely different
presidential election. He drove this engine.

He pushed these people. He was relentless. Maybe he was doing it in part
for his own political fortunes, but he was the engine of the pace of this
remarkable breakthrough. And now all of us, if we are just patient, the
vaccines are coming. You know, I saw the President-Elect Joe Biden talk
about his three-point program, Dana.

And one of the points is he wants to deliver 100 vaccines in the first
three months. Guess what, the Trump administration, their team just
announced 20 million in December, 30 million in January, 50 million in
February, 20,30,50 add up to 100 million. I wonder where Joe Biden got that
figure from. I don't mean to be petty or partisan.

I just want you to know that as his friend, even if he may not be speaking
to me right now because of my position on the election being over. But I
think that -- I insist that we have to recognize the role he played, the
45th president in defeating a pandemic that has been so devastating to
America and the world, Dana.

PERINO:  Absolutely. And in fact, while the summit was going on today,
Greg, I heard about Joe Biden saying that he wanted to do 100 million doses
within the first 100 days. And I thought, how does that match up against
what's currently planned, it turns out I can actually do that simple math.
I know you could do it more quickly than I could.

Because you are pretty amazing at arithmetic, but it was the same dose. And
we've been saying for a while that even if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were
to win, they are going to be the recipients of this program, and they are
going to be able to carry it out out.

GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Biden is just a slogan in a suit. And I think
Geraldo is bringing up a really important point. Why was Trump uniquely
qualified for this particular achievement? Nice guys don't do this. Nice
guys make a request, not nice guys demand it and expect it. Biden could
never have marshaled this effort. He lacks the interest.

He lacks the imagination and he lacks the will. But let's face it, he's a
lot of fun. He's a barrel of laughs. He'll pat you on the back. He looks
good in Aviators. The media, to show their selfishness, prefers the nice
guy who cannot solve the big problems over an abrasive brawler who could.
But here's the question.

To Geraldo's point, will history care who is naughty or nice to Don Lemon?
History will remember the deeds, but the personality traits will fade. And
history will have a lot of deeds to look at. I mean when you think about
it, once you remove the emotional hysteria of the media and you are 30
years down the road and you see Middle East peace plans, a crushed ISIS.

The invention of the Space Force, which is going to be bigger than you
think, reduction of the North Korea threat, and now you have Operation Warp
Speed. Any one of those achievements would be the apex of an eight year
run. Trump did all of that in under four, which is pretty good for a big
meanie, and that gets to my point.

Trump's a phenomenon, don't want to get greedy with a phenomenon. You kind
of wanted four more years. You got 12 years out of Trump, right? He gave
you 12 years, and you know this because the media is so relieved that he's
not the president-elect, because he showed that he was greater than them
that they couldn't control him.

You can judge the impact of a figure, a historical figure, by the
frustration he causes in the media. And I think --  maybe you saw it with
Thatcher but you will see it here.

PERINO:  Over to you, Jesse?

JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, I mean, I can't believe we are just
not talking about what Geraldo just said, and that is that Geraldo and the
president are no longer speaking with each other. That seems like pretty
juicy gossip to me.

RIVERA:  He didn't take my calls the last two times I tried.

WATTERS:  I mean, that is some salacious gossip right there. I do want to
say that I think all of America should get vaccinated. I just looked at the
potential side effects. They are trivial. Listen to these side effects.
Fatigue, I'm tired, muscle pain, check, joint pain, all over my body
already, chills, throw a sweater on, a headache, I mean, it can't be worse
than a hangover.

That seems small in terms of side effects to something that is 95 percent
effective against Coronavirus. And the Democratic politicians seem
downright giddy about the lockdowns. Now they are, like, reveling in the
show of force to send goons to arrest pub owners and salon owners and
things like that. So I mean, how many industries are you going to let the
Democrats destroy?

They have already destroyed the coal industry, the car plants, the steel
plants. You're going to letting them go after restaurants now, 20 percent
of restaurants have closed in this country for good. Where are we going to
go out to eat? Going out to dinner is like the greatest thing about being
an American. You want to cook. How did that go during the pandemic? Not
well.

I mean, you go to a restaurant, you get apps, the bread is free, drinks,
another round of drinks. You got dessert, I mean, it is one of the greatest
pleasures of the American experience. And if they start closing restaurants
down, I just don't know how much longer people are going to be able to take
this, and Biden has no plan to help these restaurants recover.

PERINO:  Dagen, let me give you the last word.

DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  I don't even know where to go with that.
But I do know that the Democrats are in a huge pickle, because they hate
the drug companies. They hate the very companies that have developed these
vaccines. And then also, it happened under President Trump. This is what --
you know, Trump voters were mocked over and over again about saying I voted
for him because he's a businessman.

I voted for him because he's not a career politician. He came from the
private sector. Well, this is what happens when you have somebody who has
not spent his whole life in government. He reached out, the administration
did, and worked with these companies. If you watch today, and I am the
nerdiest dork and a dorkiest nerd, I was tearing up watching a
demonstration of boxes that these vaccines are going to be delivered in.

I was just blown away by it, and I am usually glass half empty. Like, you
know, a sunny day is a bad thing, but I'm glass half full. I I want to
point this out really quickly. We found out today that with the Pfizer
vaccine, after the first dose, the vaccine is already 52 percent effective,
boom. We are coming out of this. We are saving lives and livelihoods, and
that is President Trump.

PERINO:  Dagen, you are my very favorite cynic. Thank you so much,
everybody. Coming up, many Americans aren't going to be happy with Nancy
Pelosi over why she says the Congress still has not passed new Coronavirus
aid. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

UNKNOWN:  It will help the country to help us. We are always overlooked
anyway, and now even more so. We need help. We need help right now.

UNKNOWN:  We have no federal money coming in. Our servers, our staff, they
have very little unemployment that's available to them. There will not be a
restaurant industry to reopen.

UNKNOWN:  We cannot survive. My staff cannot survive, and we need your
help. We need somebody to do something about this.

(END VIDEO TAPE)

WATTERS (on camera):  Democrats now admitting they screwed over average
Americans like those business owners for pure political purposes. Nancy
Pelosi says she held up Coronavirus aid simply because Trump is president,
and she doesn't regret it.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES:  That's OK now because we
have a new president. That was not a mistake. It was a decision, and it's
taken us to a place where we can do the right thing without other, shall we
say, considerations in the legislation that we don't want.

(END VIDEO TAPE)

WATTERS (on camera):  And now, Bernie Sanders is calling out Democratic
leaders for stalling the entire process.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)

UNKNOWN:  The Democrats walked away from that bill because they wanted 2.2
trillion, and they walked away from 1.8 trillion. Was that a mistake?

UNKNOWN:  That's what I'm saying. That's exactly what I'm saying. Here was
the proposal, much, much larger. Democrats said no, that's not good enough.

(END VIDEO TAPE)

WATTERS (on camera):  All right. Greg, the Democrats have always fought for
the little guy. They have always fought for the mom-and-pop shops over the
big industries. They've always fought for waitresses and dishwashers. To
hear them talk about the minimum wage and health insurance, and now when
they really need it, they are MIA.

GUTFELD:  Especially when going to restaurants, Jesse. It's the most
American thing you can do. Here's what you need.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD:  I think people do go to restaurants in Italy and Spain. But
anyway, here's what you need to know. Before the election, before the
election, they walked away from almost a $2 trillion deal. After the
election, they are getting a $1 trillion deal, around there, and we are
getting the liability immunity, temporary. So what was bad before the
election suddenly became OK.

How is this not a story worthy of investigation for our great investigative
reporters in every network? You have party leaders confessing to a pretty
devastating crime, which is withholding relief from suffering people to
gain political advantage. Right or left, you've got to admit admit this is
awful. Carl Bernstein, how is this not a thousand times worse than
Watergate?

We know Pelosi is a political ghoul, but the media has blindly accepted
this, because they, too, hated Trump. Therefore, they refused to
investigate what is clearly a blockbuster of a story. I mean, this is, like
-- think about all the lives that the Democrats and the media had to use to
delay this bill. They kept saying the bill wasn't good enough.

Everyday, they were lying while people were dying. There's a rhyme there
that they could've used, but they used on Trump instead. So how do you know
that the bill was fine? That they are doing it now, and it's not as good as
the bill as before. This is a pretty huge deal. It almost feels like a
criminal act.

WATTERS:  Dagen, do we need a special counsel now to investigate a worse
than Watergate scandal, as Greg laid out?

MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely. And I hope it lasts four years, because let's
remind -- actually, it only needs to last two years because that's how long
Nancy Pelosi is going to last in that job. Let's remind the voters over and
over again that she did, at a very bare minimum, put her own politics and
greed for power above the well-being of the American people.

Her calculation was that it would hurt Donald Trump if she withheld that
money. The suffering of the American people be damned. I -- do you know Mr.
Creosote, Meaning of Life, Monty Python? I would rather watch Mr. Creosote
on a loop than ever look at that woman again.

WATTERS:  Geraldo, do you think this cripples Nancy Pelosi?

RIVERA:  I think Nancy Pelosi is a colossal, colossal failure, and this is
one of the worst political moves ever. But I have to, with regret, announce
that the spring cord (ph) has done as I expected, as all legal scholars
expected them to do. They have denied the last minute attempt by Trump's
allies to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania.

So there will be other lawsuits, but remember today's Safe Harbor Day. I
think that this is essentially it. The Supreme Court, this is the first
case to get to the High Court, and they have denied -- they have denied the
last-minute attempt by President Trump's allies to overturn the election in
Pennsylvania, back to you.

WATTERS:  Yeah. We are hearing the Texas lawsuit is still on the docket,
though. All right, Dana Perino, Nancy Pelosi, not good. But I don't know if
she will ever be held accountable by the media. I mean, I guess you did see
a little bit of that on CNN, but I don't think most of the American people
even realize what was done to them.

PERINO:  I don't think it matters if she's held accountable in the media as
much as it matters if she's held accountable by voters. And I think that
people who, you know, basically break their backs in order to run
businesses, to have places of establishments where you can go to the most
American thing and go and eat at a restaurant, they are not going to forget
this.

They're just -- I really do think that there is a whole new generation of
people who -- maybe they are not going to call themselves Republicans. But
they remember this, and they will remember that government. And I took to
heart what Geraldo said yesterday about the complexities for what people in
elected leadership positions and the responsibilities they have to keep the
hospitals from being overwhelmed.

But I think that we should have a basic principle. If the government is
going to take away your job, that is a taking. And therefore, if you are
not going to have a job, you are going to have money. That seems like a
pretty simple thing for us to be able to do. My last point on this is that
Mitch McConnell, who the Democrats cannot stand, he climbed down from two
things today.

He said that he would accept some direct payments to people. He also said
that he would be willing to give up on liability protection in this round
if the Democrats come down from the state and local government money that
they want to put in this bill. Tonight, just breaking news here, the
Democrats have rejected that as well, so I don't know what they want at
this point.

WATTERS:  Wow. That's pretty big, because that was kind of the linchpin for
the Republican position to keep those restaurants out of the hands of the
trial lawyers. All right --

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO:  I still think something is going to happen but, you know.

WATTERS:  All right. Thank you, guys. Coming up, Joe Biden's cabinet picks
causing major controversy like his choice to run Health and Human Services
who has no experience at all in health care, so how did even get the job?  

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RIVERA:  Joe Biden taking new heat over two new cabinet picks, the
president-elect choosing California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, to
lead Health and Human Services. Critics say that he has no health care
experience. The Wall Street Journal panning the move, saying quote, "Joe
Biden checked two Democratic boxes, Hispanic and lefty.

On Monday, by tapping California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to run
Health and Human Services, progressives are ecstatic. But Mr. Becerra's
views and lack of health care experience are cause for close Senate
confirmation scrutiny," end quote. And Biden's pick for Defense Secretary,
retired four-star Army general Lloyd Austin, also drawing scrutiny for
reportedly calling ISIS a flash in the pan in conversations with Obama
White House officials.

Not thinking (ph) reportedly led then-President Obama on 2014 to call the
ISIS terror group a J.V. team. You know, Dana, one of the big beats is that
this is identity politics, that General Austin is a black man, and Becerra
is a Latino, and that it's somehow inappropriate because of their racial
background. But, you know, this is a diverse country. Half of the country
is -- are people of color, what's wrong with that?

PERINO:  I think that presidents should be able to have the team around
them that they want. And the Senate has the opportunity to do a check on
that, right, to advise and consent. Like, should we confirm these people?
Do we think they are a strong character? Can they carry out the job? Now,
Biden what has really done is they are playing what I call Democratic
coalition bingo.

So like, OK, I've got this group taken care of. I got that group taken care
of, and now this group is taken care of. All I care about are the
qualifications. And I think that's what the majority of Americans care
about, but he made some promises to a lot of these different groups within
the coalition.

And I sort of feel like, you know, the Lloyd Austin one is pretty
interesting. Because the idea with the Founders was that you had civilian
control over the Department of Defense, the military. There was a waiver
provided to General Mattis because he had not been retired more than seven
years. He came in more than General Mattis did.

The first thing he did was get to doing what President Trump wanted, which
was to destroy ISIS. I think that General Austin is probably a great
person. I know he has a great reputation. But I do think that the Democrats
who objected to Mattis getting that waiver are going to have some questions
as to why are we doing this again. They had a very qualified nominee in
Michele Flournoy, but apparently her bingo card did not come up.

RIVERA:  Meaning that she wasn't a black woman or a Latina.

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO:  Whatever it might be. She is a woman.

RIVERA:  Whatever it might be.

(CROSSTALK)

RIVERA:  Austin did a pretty good job. Hold on. General Austin, when he had
-- Central Command did a pretty good job supervising the awful war in
Afghanistan, and when he had the 10th Mountain Division, also, Jesse. So,
he's a pretty good soldier. Dana's point is he's not civilian enough. But
George C. Marshall, the commander in World War II became Secretary of
State, he was -- you know, he didn't have that, you know, division from the
military, either. It's been done. You know, we're big enough and mature
enough, aren't we, Jesse, to allow a general to be a Secretary of State or
Defense Secretary.

WATTERS: Certainly, I am big enough and mature enough, Geraldo. I don't
know about the rest of you insecure people out there. I don't like to
attack people that are much braver and stronger than I am, so I'm not going
to say too much about Austin. And I will say that it would be a huge
achievement for a Black American to become Secretary of Defense.

PERINO: Absolutely.

WATTERS: I do know two things about him. He did oversee those really
loyally rules of engagement with regards to ISIS, which dragged that battle
out for way too long. And he did oversee that half a billion-dollar Syrian
resistance training program. Remember how many soldiers they trained? Six.
So, I don't know. We'll see how that plays out.

Javier, they say, is like the Hispanic Joe Biden. To me, he looks like the
Hispanic Bernie Sanders. The guy is far left. He's for complete government
takeover of health care. He's pro-lockdown, pro-gun grab. The guy is sued
nuns to force them into covering contraception. He tried to throw pro-life
activists in prison for exposing the Planned Parenthood was trafficking
baby body parts.

And remember, he was the guy that was the chair of the House Democratic
Caucus when that mysterious Pakistani American IT guy hacks the server. He
was really silent about that. So, I don't really know about Javier.

RIVERA: Javier Becerra. Dagen, you know, is it --

PERINO: Are you getting arrested, Jesse?

GUTFELD: They're coming to get you. They're coming to get you, Jesse.

RIVERA: But Dagen --

WATTERS: Is it Javier or is it Xavier?

RIVERA: Javier. But isn't the -- isn't the beef about him specifically
ideological, it's not competence. They're saying that, you know, he doesn't
have medical experience as, if the head of that agency performed operations
in the emergency room for goodness sake, Dagen. It's an ideological
objection. It's the Democrats' turn, liberals. Of course, they're going to
pick a pro-choice person, for example.

MCDOWELL: No, it's not the -- it's not ideology, it's the walk that Becerra
has walked. The Wall Street Journal editorial refers to him saying his
claim to fame is suing the Trump administration. He has repeatedly tried to
confiscate the patents of drugs that were developed by pharmaceutical
companies. So, he's going to bully drugs -- bully drug companies, so we
don't get access to medicines at a time on a day that we're celebrating the
innovations of these drug makers? How does that make sense in this world?

Oh, it does make sense to a Joe Biden who opposed the Reagan arms buildup,
oppose the first Gulf War, was in favor of the Iraq war, and then turned
around when the tide turned, when he was against getting rid of Osama bin
Laden. That's the man who makes a decision about putting Javier Becerra
heading HHS.

RIVERA: Are you worried, Greg, that Jim Clyburn, the influential South
Carolina Congressman who played a big role in picking General Austin as
Defense Secretary?

GUTFELD: No. In fact, that's the first time I've ever thought about that. I
will say this, that saying that ISIS is a flash in the pan is like on par
with saying, you know, Boston isn't much of a college town, a little shout
out to spinal tap.

I think that what we should be looking at is you're going to -- you got to
get used to how the media is going to report these things because Gone are
the deep dives into people's pasts or their personal past or their tweets.
Instead, you're going to get this form of -- it's a catch or at least kind
of news bulletins, where they report this something that Joe does, and then
they take a nap, because their work is done.

So, it's like -- you know, it's like, they hit the -- they hit the news, he
just got this nominee, and then the news coverage will suddenly become
actual, believe it or not, this is a good thing, the news coverage becomes
actual news coverage, because it's a Democrat. So, the hyperbole suddenly
disappears.

And you just have so and so -- Joe Biden just nominated so and so for this
and that. It'll simply be that. It won't be anything about his ex-wives or
ex-husbands or the stupid thing he said on Twitter. What happens is the
reporting -- the reporters will return to the basics of their jobs minus
the emotionalism and then, I guess, I'm happy for it, but it's also kind of
gross.

RIVERA: OK, we got it. We got it. Up next, you know, Joe Biden's husbands -
- no, I'm kidding. A surge -- seriously, a surge in violent crime not
stopping one D.A. in one of America's biggest cities from outlining
sweeping criminal justice reforms. Cops there are warning it could have
deadly consequences.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MCDOWELL: Growing fears that far-left policies in Los Angeles County could
unleash a new crime wave. The new district attorney promising a series of
radical criminal justice changes like ending cash pail for minor offenses.
He also won't prosecute trespassing, disturbing the peace, driving without
a license, prostitution, and resisting arrest.

The L.A. Police Union saying this move is dangerous. Greg, this person is
going ahead with this despite the fact that we've seen what happens when
you implement these policies, nearly doubling in shootings in New York and
just 11 months.

GUTFELD: I think right now, he's doing this as there's a 20 percent
increase in homicides in Los Angeles. The problem with this whole thing is
the list. They make these things appear is equal, specifically bearing the
most heinous of them all which is resisting arrest. Resisting arrest is the
key that opens the -- that unlocks the door to society upheaval.

If it's not a crime to resist, then there's no point not to resist. And
resisting likely will result then in escaping and reoffending. So, you're -
- basically, you're telling criminal criminals that crime is just a game of
tag and you'll never be it. So, it's that's the -- that's the scary part.
The prostitution thing, I'm fine with it. Drug Possession, I'm fine. This
thing is huge, resisting arrest.

MCDOWELL: Yes. Geraldo.

RIVERA: I think that we have to remember America has more people in prison
than any other nation, as far as I know. Maybe China exceeds us, but that's
in secret with the -- with the Muslim population there. But it's -- we've
got to do something. And we have to support cops. They have the hardest
job. To minimize them or to go after them or permit attacking them, I think
that's where society falls apart, when the thin blue line is attacked by
people who are allegedly law-abiding.

But we've definitely had to look at criminal justice reform. The President
has -- to his credit, President Trump has taken a giant step in that
direction.

MCDOWELL: But this actually hurts people who are attacked, Jesse. What's
happened in New York is undone literally several decades in crime-fighting
because they turn their backs on the police officers in the citizens.

WATTERS: Yes. They had a guy in New York that was robbing four banks,
finally got arrested, got let out on bail, no bail, and then pop two more
banks. And the NYPD had to ask the feds to call him because their hands
were tied. And you know who the biggest donor this LA prosecutor is, George
Soros, $2.25 million.

And this guy's going to just run rampant over there. LA County's population
is bigger than the whole state of Michigan. Geographically, it's bigger
than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. So, we're about to witness a
massive spike in crime.

I like the idea of letting people hit rock bottom. And rock bottom for me
would be getting arrested for public intoxication or trespassing and go
into jail and having to pony up bail. If you don't prosecute that, then
rock bottom goes from here to here. And you don't even want to know what
you have to do to get that far down.

MCDOWELL: Dana?

GUTFELD: I don't think that's going to be your rock bottom.

WATTERS: That's my rock bottom at least.

PERINO: I'm just going to find a way to -- I'm going to find a way to bring
this back to the Georgia runoff elections. How? Well, Governor Newsome of
California and Los Angeles County Democrats yesterday were tweeting about
how important it is to get Mitch McConnell out of a job and elect Democrats
in Georgia.

Now, think back to what Senator Schumer said. First, we take Georgia, then
we change America. And I don't think that Georgians would want to import
this idea from Los Angeles into its state. They're a big -- the resisting
arrest thing is a terrible thing for cops, for citizens, for safety. It
absolutely should not happen.

MCDOWELL: It's the dogma of liberal zealots who never have to experience
the consequences of these decisions, and they don't care about the
outcomes. Ahead, Santa Claus gets politically correct. Find out what
happens after old St. Nick shut down a little boy's request for Christmas.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: So, boys and girls, here's a little secret for getting more
presents for Christmas than you could ever imagine. Ask for one from a
politically correct shopping mall Santa and then film the response.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you want for Christmas?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe, I want a nerf gun.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no guns.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's just a nerf gun.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, not even a nerf gun. No, if your dad wants to get in
for you, that's fine, but I can't bring it to you. What else would you
want? What do you think?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's OK, buddy.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's OK if your dad --

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's OK. It's OK.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: So, just to be clear to the kids watching at home, that was not
the real Santa. The real Santa got a cold and didn't want to spread it to
the kids, so Santa trusted the shopping mall to find a reasonable
substitute. The problem was it was on short notice and they ended up with
this glum fellow who spreads Christmas cheer the way I spread sobriety, not
well.

And so, instead of Santa Claus, they got a Santa Cause. But sorry, dude.
The little boy didn't ask for an AK-47, he asked for a toy nerf gun. If you
can't tell the difference, you deserved to get stuck in a chimney behind
Joy Behar. Thank God he had asked for a G.I. Joe the warmonger, or a gas-
guzzling Hot Wheel, or maybe an elf on a shelf. I tell you, I'm not for
sale.

Now, here's the good news. Millions of people have likely seen this PC
Santa reduce the boy to tears, which means given that this is America, the
greatest, most generous country on Earth, you could bet that little tyke
got more nerf guns than the Portland Police Department has, who by the way
are only allowed nerf guns. Heck, maybe the real Santa may pay him a visit.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we're so sorry to bother you. I heard about this
from the North Pole.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I (INAUDIBLE)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is crazy, this thing.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD: There you go. And as far as social justice, Santa, well that video
went around the world faster than Donner or Blitzen, which means all he's
getting for Christmas is coal also delivered by the real Santa. And you'll
know it's him because of the huge carbon footprint.

All right, Dagen, I'm going to say one thing in defense of the shopping
mall Santa. It might have been a policy. It could have been a policy of the
mall. Who knows?

MCDOWELL: No, it wouldn't have been a policy of the mall. And that mother
had an infant with her. She had to put the infant down to console the
little boy. In the meantime, if I had been a bystander, I would have taken
a dive across that desk and broken that fat ass' glasses.

GUTFELD: We don't know if he's actually fat. Don't fat shame. Hey, Jesse,
do you know the other big story about this? The enduring quality of nerf
products that we are still talking about nerf products. We've had nerf
products since we were like four.

WATTERS: Yes. I mean, I asked my parents for a nerf gun for Christmas and
they said no too because they're far-left. And look how I turned out. I'm a
Fox host, mom. I mean, that backfired, didn't it? But I mean, when I heard
this -- I heard your monologue, which was a great monologue, when I heard
this today, the first thing I did was look up how much mall Santas make,
obviously. And they make between $30.00 and $100.00 an hour.

So, in December, they can clear five to 10 grand. If I'm getting paid five
to 10 grand is sit there, that kid could ask for anthrax. I'm ho, ho, ho,
whatever you want, kiddo.

GUTFELD: Anthrax. I think that was a rejected reindeer name. Geraldo, what
do you make of this? You think any sympathy for the poor Santa?

RIVERA: You know, ever since the Billy Bob Thornton movie Bad Santa who
played a drunken reprobate Santa, I can't -- I can't get into Santa
anymore. I wouldn't let any small child related to me near a jolly old elf
and who knows what's in those red velvet --

GUTFELD: I was a shopping mall Santa. I was -- I was like the King of
Prussia. You've heard this story.

RIVERA: You were? Why am I not surprised by that?

GUTFELD: Yes. I was actually -- I was reprimanded for drinking wine at
lunchtime. Dana, you're -- you like -- you're more like a Smurf than a
Nerf.

PERINO: I think the shocking news here is that you are a Santa's not an
elf. Is that right?

GUTFELD: How dare you? That's true. You know what? Forget it. "ONE MORE
THING" is up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: It's time now for "ONE MORE THING." Greg.

GUTFELD: It's time for Greg's Christmas Sweater News. It's the only thing I
really like about Christmas. Check out this awesome sweater. It combines
two things I love, sweaters and the Melvins, the greatest metal band ever.

You have like -- you have deadly -- you have deadly ticks on the side. You
have like a killer demon beast on the front. And then you have -- it goes
all the way the back. It's got -- it's like all the way up there. There's
its feet. It's absolutely beautiful. You can find it at. I have
-- they have a new album coming out in a while, but this is the best
holiday sweater ever.

PERINO: I was thinking about you today when I did one of those peloton
holiday rides, all that Christmas music is so fun.

GUTFELD: That sounds like the opposite of fun.

PERINO: Jesse, you're next. Jesse.

WATTERS: All right, so one of the things I learned from being a television
producer is the way to hold an audience's explosions. Let's go to Russia
where New Year's Eve came three weeks early. That's right, a fireworks
warehouse caught on fire and that's all she wrote.

But the favorite part about this video for me, the video was released by
the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations. What a great ministry. I wish
we had a ministry like that here, the American Ministry of Emergency
Situations. It would probably have to be Senate approved though, and that
could be fun during those hearings.

PERINO: Yes, emergency situation, broadly defined indeed. Geraldo.

RIVERA: Melancholia day for me and millions of music lovers. Exactly 40
years ago today, my friend and neighbor John Lennon was shot dead in front
of his home in New York City. He touched my life in unforgettable ways. He
performed his last full concert for my charity to benefit the disabled.

A couple of years later, I was proud to testify on his behalf, fighting a
grotesque attempt to throw him out of the country because he opposed the
war in Vietnam.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RIVERA: John Lennon was a once in a lifetime friend, a wonderful, wonderful
person. Our friendship was really solidified when I became one of their
expert witnesses. I was very proud to be one of their four witnesses in the
immigration trial. But that's really what solidified the true bond.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RIVERA: John was just 40 years old when he was killed. His son Sean was
just five.

PERINO: Wow. That's interesting and a great story too. Dagen.

MCDOWELL: I will be brief. What happens when you test positive for COVID on
your wedding day? You get married anyway wearing full head to toe PPE.
That's what this couple did in India. And then they -- right after that,
they went into isolation, so good luck to them.

PERINO: Good luck with them indeed.

WATTERS: What about the honeymoon?

PERINO: That was like, great.

MCDOWELL: Well, make that work.

PERINO: We were not granted access with our cameras to the honeymoon,
Jesse. We couldn't get in there.

WATTERS: All right. Too bad.

PERINO: All right, I will do my "One More Thing" tomorrow. It had to do
with a bear. But right now, that's it for us. "SPECIAL REPORT" is up next
with our own Bret Baier. Hi, Bret.
