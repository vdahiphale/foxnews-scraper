SHANNON BREAM, HOST: Just about guaranteeing we will. That's Sarah Huckabee Sanders just moments ago at the White House. Let's bring in our panel to discuss, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the "Washington Examiner," Karen Tumulty, opinion writer for the "Washington Post," and Marc Thiessen, fellow at the America Enterprise Institute. Welcome, all of you.
MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Good to be with you, Shannon.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
BREAM: All right, Bryon, the president tweets out a big announcement regarding the border at 3:00 p.m. eastern tomorrow. What do you make of it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": Let's stipulate that none of us know what it is.
(LAUGHTER)
BREAM: I don't know. You guys don't know. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
YORK: What we do know is that both sides are trying to put pressure on each other and trying to keep this alive and going. And we just had this appalling encounter between the president and Nancy Pelosi in which the speaker actually disinvited the president from the State of the Union, and the president retaliated by canceling her trip to Afghanistan. But now that's receding into the past. So he'll have to do something tomorrow to keep things going.
BREAM: Karen, five minutes and we're on a new news cycle.
KAREN TUMULTY, OPINION WRITER, "WASHINGTON POST": If I had to guess, which is what I will do, there is the possibility he declares a state of emergency, and essentially it's the offramp. The other possibility is that he puts a specific compromise on the table -- give me money for the wall and I will give you money for thing x that you really want, and just essentially tries to get the talks jumpstarted that way as opposed to this kind of cold war or whatever this is we have going on now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BREAM: And he did use the word specifically "humanitarian crisis." Maybe he is going to send more aid, more troops down to the border. Who knows? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: We don't know. I hope that it's plan b that you just laid out, that he does offer a compromise of some kind, because I think the president can actually win this fight if he continues to portray himself as the person who is willing to compromise while the Democrats are being intransigent. There was a Harris poll that showed that 72 percent of Americans want both sides to compromise on this, including 61 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Republicans. So everybody in both parties want both sides to give. Right now the president is the only one who is willing to compromise. He is the only who used the word "compromise" in those dueling address to the nation. So he would be very wise to put a compromise down on the table and say, OK, I want $5.7 billion for the border. You get $5.7 billion for one of your priorities, or DACA, or something else, and show himself as being reasonable and win over those persuadable voters in the middle who can come over to his side.
BREAM: In the meantime, they are still going back and forth over the semi- disinvitation to the State of the Union and her plane and all CODELs apparently now being grounded from military transport. Her teams says this, her spokesman says, "In the middle of the night the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the president announcing this sensitive travel had significant increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security and other officials supporting the trip. This morning, we learned the administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The White House unequivocally saying, not true. A senior White House official saying "When the speaker of the House and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decided to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, world is going to find out. The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat-out lie." Karen, sometimes we see a little massaging of the words. They didn't leave any room there.
TUMULTY: "The New York Times," however, is reporting that it found out Thursday night about the commercial flights, and it is saying that its source was someone close to Trump. Now, that world is pretty big or small depending on the day of the week. So it does appear somebody last night was talking about it to "The New York Times." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BREAM: Byron, a lot of folks in this country don't put a lot of stock in the "New York Times" these days. That's how they feel about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
YORK: This whole situation, you have to remember the reason that Democrats felt the confidence to leave now is that because they feel confident in their poll numbers. They think they are winning. We had a number of polls a few days ago that showed significantly more Americans blame President Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown than blame Pelosi and the Democrats.
And so a number of observers, including me, thought that if the Democrats continue to be intransigent, perhaps those numbers would even up a little bit, but so far they haven't. And Democrats, I don't think they would be acting this way unless those polls showing them that so far they are winning this standoff. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BREAM: I want to make sure we touch on this big story that broke just before our 11:00 show last night, we had these headlines about "BuzzFeed" saying President Trump directed his attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower project. Today, you have got some folks saying, listen, we believe our sources but, no, we haven't seen this for ourselves. Rudy Giuliani on behalf of the president says "Any suggestion from any source that the president counseled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false. Michael Cohen is a convicted criminal and a liar. Today's claims are just more made-up lies born of Michael Cohen's malice and desperation in an effort to reduce his sentence." Marc? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
THIESSEN: Say what you mean.
BREAM: How do you really feel?
THIESSEN: Let's caveat a few things. First of all, we don't know if this is true because, after all, this is "BuzzFeed." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BREAM: They've been wrong before. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
THIESSEN: And they have been wrong before. And the Mueller team hasn't really leaked very much during this whole process. So it is a little bit unusual. And certainly if this is just Michael Cohen's word, then, as the president says, he is a proven liar and it's not going to go anywhere.
What's worrisome for the president is that this story seems to suggest that there are other documents, e-mails, other witness interviews. Cohen apparently had recorded his conversations with the president. So if there is something else like that, then all of the sudden this is a big deal. And if there is evidence that this is true, that's an impeachable offense. Remember that the Republicans impeached Bill Clinton for perjury, and suborning perjury is no different than committing perjury. So this would be very serious if it ended up being true and it's probably be the end of the Trump presidency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BREAM: And Karen, Michael Cohen has been invited to come back and testify again on the Hill since he admits he lied when he did it before. But today Lanny Davis, his attorney, said he is rethinking it, he might not do it.
TUMULTY: Again, this has so changed the dynamic. And of course, there is an old joke in journalism that the worst thing possible is a scoop that remains a scoop. So I think every other news organization is now chasing this. I think we will know in a few days whether this is one of these things that we've seen so many times where today's explosion is tomorrow's ripple. Or it could be, in fact, a turning point in all this.

BREAM: We are back with our panel to discuss this as we get word now, confirmation from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, saying this, "President Donald J. Trump met Kim Yong-chol for an hour-and-a-half," that was at the White House today, "to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February. The president looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date."

Byron, there has been a lot that's happened between the last time that they talked and now people saying they never really got rid of anything. The satellite is telling us something different. What do you make of this next chapter?

        }
      
BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": I think it's a good thing in this sense. The stated goal of the last summit and the whole process, whatever it has been since then, has been North Korean denuclearization, which we haven't had. So it hasn't happened, hasn't worked.
On the other hand, they haven't been testing. The sort of ascent, the intensity that was happening before that summit has really calmed down. So the idea that maybe not much happens if you just keep talking, no, we haven't gotten to a final goal. But that's better than the opposite.

BREAM: A lot has been made about the impact on their economy, although, Karen, we know that there are major players who have gotten caught not exactly helping to enforce the sanctions they voted for at the U.N., thinking China, possibly Russia and others.
TUMULTY: And I think it is always better to talk than not to talk. But I think one of the things that they really need to do this time around is get more clarification. What exactly does Kim mean by "denuclearization" for starters? And also, apparently, the North Koreans have a bunch of demands about sanctions that they want to bring to the table.

MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: From the White House to your house, life is winning in America once again. We gather here today because we know we still have much work to do. So we urge you to stand strong, stand with that love and compassion.

BREAM: He talked about the federal judges they've had appointed to the bench, some wins they've had at the state level. Very encouraging to the folks out there today.
THIESSEN: Absolutely. People always ask the question on the left, why do Christian conservatives stick with Donald Trump despite Stormy Daniels and all the other stuff, and if you want the answer, this is it. Donald Trump is the most courageously pro-life president that we've had in our history. This is a man who just put a new rule that any clinic that performs abortions or refers people for abortion can no longer receive federal family planning funds.
He's had a record number of conservative judges. He's allowed states to defend Planned Parenthood. He defunded the U.N. Population Fund, which is pro-abortion. He expanded the Mexico City policy, and he also stopped the HHS mandate which was forcing religious believers from providing abortion contraception. So this is a record. And some of these things are things that people proposed in the Bush administration and couldn't get done. So today is a day to celebrate the fact that whatever other problems we have, whether it is the "BuzzFeed" news or Russia, if you are a pro-life American, this is a great presidency.

My loser is Theresa May, the British prime minister, just has messed up Brexit coming and going. This week, her plan to leave the E.U. suffered a crushing defeat. She barely survived a no-confidence vote. Things do not look good for her.

BREAM: Karen to you?
TUMULTY: My winner is Mueller. I think that having President Trump's nominee for attorney general put such a strong statement out there backing his professionalism was really important, and promising to carry through in this investigation. My loser, federal workers, again, yet another week.

BREAM: That's true. It is interesting around here in D.C., you really do see the trickle-down. I was at my nail place this morning, and my manicurist, who is a great friend, she said that she actually now socking away money because so many of the federal workers that come to her on a weekly or biweekly basis have canceling their appointments. So there are all kinds of little trickle down things that happen. Winners and losers for you, Marc?
THIESSEN: I'll start with my loser. It's Cardinal Donald Wuerl. He insisted he didn't know that Theodore McCarrick was abusing priests and seminarians. It turns out he knew in 2004 and he wrote a letter to his priest this week saying he forgot he knew. Right. So he is my loser.
My winner are the Dallas Stars. They teamed up with the make a wish foundation to make the dreams of 10-year-old Anderson McDuffie come true. This kid has had multiple heart surgeries, and his dream was for his youth hockey team to play the Dallas Stars. And they did. And not only did he score the game winning goal. He dropped the gloves and fought with John Klingberg. So good for the Dallas stars.

CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: If President Trump isn't going to stick up for American workers, we Democrats will.
SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: They claim to care about federal workers, but they have been so busy hanging out on the beaches of Puerto Rico and hitting Broadway shows.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: We would love for the Democrats to join us here. I know it's not Puerto Rico, but it is pretty out here.

BREAM: And that's just one week.
Now, it was also a special week for someone in our extended FOX family. Mae (ph) Castens (ph) is the grandmother of Colleen Kelley. She works on our satellite desk. We love her. Mae (ph) turned 100 years old this week. Here she is holding her second great, great grandchild. Happy birthday, Mae (ph), thank you always for watching and for giving us Colleen as well.
Don't forget, the president has a special announcement he says regarding the border and the crisis there at 3:00 p.m. eastern tomorrow. We'll keep tracking that for now.
