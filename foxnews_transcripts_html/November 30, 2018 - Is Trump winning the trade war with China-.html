DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. He's in a mood, guys. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
We begin with a Fox News alert, a powerful 7.0 earthquake causing what local authorities are calling major damage after striking just outside the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Trace Gallagher is standing by with the very latest. Trace? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: Dana, this was a big one. A number of roads in and around Anchorage have now been damaged including the Seward Highway. If you've showed pictures this is traffic backed up for several miles. The Seward Highway was shut down because of a rock slide. But a lot of the major access roads are either open and flowing or in the process of being reopened. A lot of the traffic that's coming in right now back into Anchorage, remember there was that tsunami warning earlier, that was listed but a lot of those people were told to go to higher ground. They're now trying to get back into their homes. And some bridges, the structural integrity of those has not been checked out, so a lot of the traffic is being diverted on to other roads. As for electricity, there are reports of at least 7,000 homes and businesses without power, but one of the primary substations has just gone back on line. And there are no reports of any powerlines down and that's very good news for the crews that are trying to get those electricity needs up and running again. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And here's the amazing thing, a short time ago the fire chief came out and said that they went and scanned around the city of Anchorage and found no major structural damage of any of the buildings, which is a very big testament to the city's very strict building codes. We should also note that Alaska Airlines is now back up and running, it is the region biggest carrier and flights are now going back to and from Ted Stevens Airport. And the airport is really emphasizing to people that it is open again. Earlier, the roads to and from were closed, but now they're saying the roads to and from the airport are open. The airport is open. The bad news is the train service across most of the state is not operating. The good news is that in Alaska most of the train service is freight. It's not passenger. This earthquake, imagine, 7.0, stronger than the San Francisco earthquake, the North Ridge earthquake, and the damage right now appears to be significant but not devastating, Dana. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: All right. Trace, thank you for that report. Let's go to Rick Reichmuth, he's in the Fox Weather Center for more on this massive earthquake. Rick?
RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS: Yeah, Dana. So they get a lot of earthquakes in Alaska, they also get a lot of really strong ones. Take a look at that first one, Prince William Sound earthquake in 1964, it's a 9.2. That was the second strongest earthquake we've seen anywhere on earth, at least, in recorded history. So they get very, very strong ones there. That last one here, the fifth one, the Unimak Island one that caused a storm surge -- excuse me, a tsunami all the way into South America. So, travels very far. The tsunami is not the case with this one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That is what we have the earthquake thing in the last 12 hours. Those yellow dots are the last 12 hours, the red dots as we get a little bit closer within the last hour. And you get an idea of all of the aftershocks here we've had in the last 12 hour. Lots of them, some smaller aftershocks here just within the last hour. But the proximity into Anchorage is why we were so concerned about potential damage from this, from a 7.0 earthquake, the first aftershock after that was a 6.6. Because of that we did had a tsunami warning that came out here just across the Cook Inlet, that expired though, so we're looking just fine with that. And as far as temperatures go, it is very cold right now, temps into the 20's, 28 degrees. Just about 2.5 hours more of daylight. Tomorrow once the daylight comes back, up temps go up to about 40 degrees. Dana?
PERINO: OK. Rick, thank you for that.

PERINO: And now to another story we're following. President Trump meeting with world leaders during a high stake G20 summit, President Trump set to face off tomorrow with his Chinese counterpart amid rising trade tensions. And earlier today, Trump signing a possible NAFTA replacement with Mexico and Canada.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The USMCA is the largest most significant modern and balanced trade agreement in history. All of our countries will benefit greatly. It is probably the largest trade deal ever made also. Many, many jobs are already planning to come back. Many companies are coming back. And we're very excited about that.

JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah, they've already convicted the guy and say he's a colluder, but that's fine. It seems like in the media every day they believe it's a last day of the Trump presidency. They've been saying that since the inauguration. I've been watching the Clinton affair on A&E and it reminds me when he was trying to knock out deals and protect the country and improved the economy, and he had this nasty special counsel on his back. And he kept saying over, and over, and over again, put this aside, let me go back to work for the American people. I have to work and help the country. And what did the voters say? At the end of the whole spectacle he had the highest approval rating ever because all he wanted to do was work hard for the American people.

If I were Trump I would do the same thing. I would just stop with the witch hunt texting and the tweeting. I'll say let me get to work. And look what he's doing, speaking of Clinton, his signature trade deal he's now rescinded it and repackaged it so American auto workers, dairy producers, energy, water, wine, all these industries are now in an improved position. He held firm on steel and aluminum. And it puts him in a really strong position. What he needs to achieve tomorrow over the China trade war, and we're winning that trade war right now. The Chinese economy is off 30 percent since that trade war started. They thought those retaliatory tariffs were going bring political pressure to bear on the president. That did not happen. Trump only lost one soybean district in the mid-terms. And if you look at the whole big picture, Greg always likes to say look at the results. The results are strong. You just have this really nagging special counsel on the other end which makes his life miserable.
PERINO: I think Greg might have a metaphor or sorts --
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Thank you for serving me up this wonderful opportunity. Might have use a metaphor.

GUTFELD: Trump is like an ice cream store with amazing flavors. You have wages and cream. You have gobs of jobs. You have economy crunch. You have optimism swirl. You have North Korea caramel. And where is the media? They're across the street feeding out of a garbage can. Their cheeks swollen with rotten fruits and vegetables because that's all they want is bad news. And that's what you saw in that montage, a bunch of -- they all have Trump success denial disorder. They can't bear it. The thing is, I've even admit, like I learned a lot about trade. I don't like where he was going with trade, but he forced it on me. I had to learn about these imbalances that I didn't want to learn about because, frankly, I'm an opinion person. I don't want to learn about trade. I just want to shout about it, but he forced me to learn about it. And I realize, you know what, the guy cares about it. The guy turns out he's right, he's getting stuff done. And instead, these other, you know, creeps elsewhere just too busy obsessing over the garbage can filled with rotten fruits and vegetables. Thank you.
PERINO: Thank you very much. Juan, do you think the trade war is working?

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, obviously not. I mean, obviously, you look at the stock market and, you know, most of the gains for the year have disappeared. And, obviously, you have stuff like G.M., you know, 14,000 jobs. That's a lot of jobs, Dana. And you have things like Harley Davidson carrier, they've left the country in terms of jobs, a great disappointment to President Trump. So, I don't think it's working. The question is whether or not, as Greg was saying, you look at the China deal, is it the fact -- or is it the case -- maybe I meant Jesse --

        }
      
GUTFELD: We look alike.
WILLIAMS: You do. Is it possible that, in fact, China whose economy is in a slump is now on the defensive and more willing to deal with President Trump? We don't know that yet. In terms of the NAFTA deal, let me just point out that a good conservative organ like the Wall Street Journal said this is just basically the status quo. It could have been worse given Trump's protectionist instinct. But you look at what is highlighted in terms of the NAFTA deal and that is dairy farmers. And you say, well, is it a much better deal for American dairy farmers? Well, it's a 1 percent - - or a little less than 1 percent increase in the quota of American dairy allowed into Canada. But there is now a situation where Canadian prices can't be dumped -- Canadian dairy can't be dumped in the United States.
PERINO: You know who likes that? Senator Chuck Schumer -- (CROSSTALK)

COMPAGNO: On Chuck Schumer, I will say that he obviously voted nay in 1993 against NAFTA. And what happened since, what did we've heard from him since? More shouting about it without substance. No offense that I've just pointed to you when I've said that. So, from him coming forward and saying, now this isn't -- this isn't doing us any good. He doesn't make any reference to the class seven pricing system being gone in Canada, and what things are achieved. And for me as an American citizen, I don't understand why compromise hasn't been achieved this entire time. Hasn't been reached. I don't want my elected officials to be standing and shouting for 20 years without anything accomplished because it's compromise that we're all sending them therefore because otherwise they're not serving us and they'll be absolutely nothing gained. On China, I think that, obviously, the trade war is significant, and there needs to be more leverage gained and mentioned of the IP theft going on, the erosion of quality, and also they're flooding our country, frankly, with illicit drugs. There's a lot of talks about southern border, physical penetration. It's also happening in the air supply and with the mail system. So I think there are overarching issues that need to be included in that conversation that, certainly, again, the elected officials they need to be a little bit more than whiners.

(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah. Your talking point has been turned on by our great daddy Greg.
GUTFELD: You know -- I think it is time for a new word. The problem here, it's not a caravan. A caravan is a deceptive term. It's a political orchestrated march. And you have to ask, where it started. It didn't start with Trump. This was a test of the border. It was a test to see what would happen, and if we didn't react a certain way, another one would come, and if we let that one, then another one. So it's obviously -- you have to put your foot down. And by the way, you know, I've never been to Tijuana, but they have their hands full with us. They have obnoxious spring breakers and bachelor parties. We're bad enough.

And then, I think what the mayor is asking for is possibly some help from the United States financially because $125,000 a day like that is a lot for Tijuana. But also you have a possible health crisis on your hand with the unsanitary conditions, T.B. This is a problem that Tijuana cannot handle on its own.

But then you get other former Obama people saying, gee, he reminds me of Obama. He's 46, I think Obama was 47 when he took office. Dan -- saying what an impressive guy. President Obama himself saying this is a guy who speaks authentically, he doesn't do poll tested type of speeches, and people react to him with great passion. What do you think?

I think it's probably too early to just count someone else and call them a loser because it seems to me moving forward it would behoove the Democratic Party to have really -- be based on substance. We just saw the parade of misfits happening. So, clearly, there's a million people that keeps saying they're thinking about running and not willing to be throwing their hat in the ring, so why not add Beto to it? Why not add one more misfit to the island.
WILLIAMS: Misfits. You're all misfits?
COMPAGNO: I mean, moving forward I think it will be an opportunity to see all of them individually shine. Let's hear what their platforms are. Let's see their substance. Let's see their fresh new ideas. Let's see them galvanize the millennials. Let's see them galvanize those voters that didn't turnout in the mid-terms even though people were canvasing out there.

WILLIAMS: She'll be great. So, Jesse, you have a situation here where it's potentially the case that people who are Obama loyalists are split between Joe Biden who is currently the number one pick of Democrats to be the nominee, and someone like a Beto O'Rourke.
WATTERS: That's a really good point. I think you're right about that. And it looks like Rahm falls in to the other camp. He looks like he's a Beto hater. He's probably very loyal to President Obama and doesn't like the comparisons. Maybe the comparisons rub him the wrong way. I think Obama was more substantive than he was. He definitely had a little more charisma. They both have similar sort of grass-roots appeal, very handsome and articulate. But I just don't see Beto catching the fire the way Obama did. I think he's too young. He's too green. And I don't think he has the sharp elbows.
Remember, Obama was pretty strong in those debates, and he had a pretty sharp tongue. I think Beto is too nice.
I will look at some of those other candidates. Julian Castro, he's got a good look. I think he could definitely go far. And Sher-ahd Brown or Sherrod Brown, whatever his name is, he's got that gravelly voice that kind of people listen to. So he could go far. There's going to be so many --
GUTFELD: Your in-depth analysis is amazing.
WATTERS: Very superficial.
WILLIAMS: I don't know, but this is his -- this is Jesse's theory that good-looking people go farther in life.
WATTERS: That's right, Greg. That explains where I am today.
PERINO: Oh, my God.
COMPAGNO: You were bullied for it earlier, remember? You said you were bullied for your good looks yesterday.
WATTERS: That's true.
COMPAGNO: So which is it?
WATTERS: You know, it's a burden that I bear. It is a burden that I bear.
And I just want to say one thing. If there's going to be so many candidates, that there's not going to be enough money to go around. So these guys are going to just drop out after the first couple of debates if they don't raise any money.
WILLIAMS: So Dana, I won't respond to Jesse, because I think it was 17.
PERINO: I have points to make.
WILLIAMS: But I want to say -- go ahead, because I was going to ask you a question.
PERINO: I would say a couple things. Well, one, before Rahm was an Obama guy, he was a Clinton guy. And the thing about Rahm Emanuel is he knows how to win.
So when the Democrats beat back the Republicans in 2006 in that midterm, Rahm was in charge of that.
WILLIAMS: That's true.
PERINO: And so then he goes and he's won twice in Chicago. The thing is, he knows now to win. He understands the Democratic base. Of course, it's changing, but there are more regular, straight Democrats than you have on the progressive side.
However, when he says that Beto O'Rourke is a loser, yes, but he came pretty close --
WILLIAMS: Amazing.
PERINO: -- in a pretty red state, and he raised a ton of money.
But here's the thing. I think what Rahm is also trying to say to someone like Beto O'Rourke is that you're going to have to earn it. You're not just going to -- it's not just going to be handed to you. You're going to have to come and court us and see if we will actually get on your side.
WILLIAMS: That's a great point.
PERINO: Thank you, I thought so.
WILLIAMS: So hey, Greg, I want to -- I want you to have some fun with something.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: So here are how the Democrats, you know, this -- what you call misfits, this lot of misfits is going out and writing books.
And one book by Elizabeth Warren is called "This Fight is our Fight." The book by Kamala Harris, "The Truth We Hold." The book by Bernie Sanders, "Where We Go From Here." I guess we can be expecting books from Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar.
GUTFELD: Cory Booker should have a Booker.
WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.
GUTFELD: Elizabeth Warren missed the -- the title should have been "No Reservations."
WATTERS: Ohhh!
COMPAGNO: Oh, God!
GUTFELD: You know, it's not an election right now. It's like a weekend 5- K fun run. You know, there's a whole motley crew of people showing up. There's about 150 of them. Ninety percent of them are not going to make it. Beto is cursed to be the one that showed up too early and is being talked up too early. It's like the first one interviewed at a beauty pageant.
PERINO: Like that means that he should run this time. Because if you wait too long, just like with Elizabeth Warren. She should have run this last time. Now it's past her buy. Beto O'Rourke, maybe he's got to seize the moment.
GUTFELD: I don't know.
WILLIAMS: You don't know?
So by the way, since all these Democrats are misfits and misbegotten, to Emily and Greg, what happened? What did you say about those 17 that were running for --
GUTFELD: No, that's -- and I've always been consistent in this, is that what -- you run the risk of having so many people that you'll have a contrast between similarities and one unusual person.
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: So what happened with Trump is you had 16 similarities, even including the women. But they were politicians. And then the one non- politician stood out.
So if they have 20 people, 19, 15 people --
WILLIAMS: So who's the one?
GUTFELD: I think it's Mark. I think it's Mark Ruffalo.
WILLIAMS: Mark Ruffalo?
GUTFELD: That is my prediction, that he's going to run as a progressive candidate, and he's going to win the nomination, because he's a -- he's a great Hulk.
WILLIAMS: Wow!
GUTFELD: He's the only likeable progressive.
WILLIAMS: I hope you have a good weekend, man, and calm down.
All right. Knickers, the giant cow, may have some competition. Is Delta Airlines going too far with its new facial recognition technology? All of that, so much more. Stay with us, it's ahead on "The Fastest Seven" on "The Five."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: FOX News alert. President Trump participating in a G-20 family photo just moments ago with world leaders. We're keeping an eye on that.
PERINO: That's a nice picture.
WATTERS: But now it's time for --
GRAPHIC: Fastest 7
WATTERS: -- "The Fastest Seven." First up. Payless fooling so-called fashion-savvy influencers with this clever ad campaign.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We built a fake luxury store in Los Angeles and filled it with Payless shoes. The guests at our grand opening party had no idea.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're elegant, sophisticated.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just think it's so classy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I could tell it was made with high-quality material.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These fashionista actually paid $200, $400 and even $600 for Payless shoes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Don't worry. The fashionistas did receive full refunds in this little experiment. The company' saying they just wanted to change people's perceptions about what luxury should cost.
Greg, I love this story.
GUTFELD: You know, the thing is, though, I would have -- I would have figured it out, because I wear nothing but Louboutins. They give a nice shape to my calf, and I can still run from the cops.
But you know who also tried to trick people was Claire McCaskill. Did you know what she did?
WATTERS: What did she do?
GUTFELD: She tweeted three segments from, I guess, CNN, MSNBC and FOX News, showing coverage of, I guess, the Mueller probe, and they showed "Animals Are Great" with the idea that that's what we were covering. Instead, the fact that we led the show yesterday on the Mueller probe and that Claire McCaskill is, in fact, a lying idiot.
WATTERS: You know what, Claire?
(SINGING): Animals are great!
GUTFELD (SINGING): Animals are great!
WATTERS: All right, Dana.
PERINO: They are great.
WATTERS: What do you think about the fashionistas?
PERINO: I love this story, too. I often think I'm overpaying for things. And I haven't been to Payless in a while, but I would go back now. And I think a lot of these influencers are total baloney.
WATTERS: Yes, what's an influencer anyway?
WILLIAMS: Oh, you know, it's like people who are fashion plates.
GUTFELD: You're an influencer.
WATTERS: Am I?
WILLIAMS: Not only that, you are an influencer --
WATTERS: That's scary.
WILLIAMS: -- because -- because you're on TV, and people would say, "Hey, that's a nice suit Jesse has on. Where'd he get that suit?"
WATTERS: Thank you. It's J. Crew. Send it over, guys.
GUTFELD: I don't think they will.
WATTERS: They hate me.
WILLIAMS: You know what this story reminds me of, is that on Sundays, when I, like, open the Sunday paper magazines, and they have fashions. I think who -- what women wear this stuff?
WATTERS: You still read a paper?
WILLIAMS: I do!
WATTERS: It's called the Internet, Juan.
WILLIAMS: I read newspapers. I read --
PERINO: I read hard copy of the Wall Street Journal every day.
GUTFELD: Of course you do, Dana.
WATTERS: After the book you finish.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Emily.
PERINO: I'm good with the books.
COMPAGNO: I love this. I thought it was brilliant marketing.
WILLIAMS: Yes, it's marketing.
COMPAGNO: And I feel like it's super emperor's new clothes, where everyone -- when you tell someone it is worth a million dollars, all of a sudden, everyone is like, "Oh, yes, and this is amazing." And it just kind of brings everyone back down to earth.
WATTERS: That's true.
All right. Up next, everybody hates waiting in long lines at the airport, including me. But would you be willing to do this to save a few minutes?
Delta launching the first facial recognition technology in Atlanta tomorrow. It's going to allow flyers to just breeze through security. And all they do is just show their face. But the new technology is raising some privacy concerns. But Delta says it doesn't store the images. Greg, do you believe that Delta doesn't store the images?
GUTFELD: Oh, but no, there's a bigger story to this. Because this is -- where this is going to ultimately lead is to face theft.
WATTERS: Ooh.
GUTFELD: OK. So how easy will it be for me to 3-D copy Jesse's face and then access his most private records and accounts with the face? Or I could just peel your face off and just put your face on mine, like "Silence of the Lambs" business and just go in there. Because people are going to start stealing rich people's faces and using them to get into their accounts. And it's so easy.
PERINO: Deep fakes. Deep fakes, that is possible. But OK, if you have an iPhone-10, you're already doing this, and you do it a million times a day when you look at your phone. You know what I mean?
WATTERS: So you're not as scared? This does not scare you?
PERINO: I'm for technology. Go for it.
GUTFELD: Me, too.
WATTERS: OK. But what if you're trying to, like, lie low? And then all of a sudden, you go somewhere --
PERINO: What do you know about that?
WATTERS: I'm just saying people try to set other people up, Dana. This is kind of a (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to that.
WILLIAMS: You know what you do, Jessie?
WATTERS: What?
WILLIAMS: Take a selfie. Remember, that was your solution? Take --
GUTFELD: Selfies.
WATTERS: That was before I go through security. Selfie.
WILLIAMS: It's me, it's me, it's me.
You know, look already, by the way, they've caught, like, 2 or 3 percent of people who didn't have the right passport and they were criminals. So I mean, it works.
But I would say, I'm with Dana. I think anything to get me through an airport faster, I'm saying go for it.
WATTERS: And this is supposed to shave off how many minutes?
COMPAGNO: Nine. So --
PERINO: I will take those 9 minutes.
WATTERS: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Sure. And I think in the aggregate, too, that's a lot. But I also think the downside potential is pretty huge here. And from what I understand --
WILLIAMS: What is the downside?
COMPAGNO: Well, from what I understand, a lot of facial recognition technology has issues identifying people of color. That there is not only the storage aspect but the hacking aspect. The fact that -- the fact that you're going from the curb to the plane without showing your passport at all. Would it be worth your 9 minutes back to know that there were multiple checkpoints so that you were safe on your plane?
PERINO: Oh, wow! Way to bring it down? Way to bring it down?
WATTERS: You know what I'm worried about? The deep state. That's what I'm worried about.
WILLIAMS: Spoken like a Trumpian.
COMPAGNO: That's probably happening already.
WATTERS: The deep face, I mean.
COMPAGNO: There's a lot of people working on facial recognition technology -- oh, working on facial recognition technology that have voiced -- that have voiced concern over this kind of technology.
WILLIAMS: What did he do to you?
WATTERS: Bunch of misfits.
WILLIAMS: What did you do, man?
WATTERS: Bunch of misfits.
All right. And finally, moove-over, Knickers.
COMPAGNO: Oh, wow.
WATTERS: Like that one, Greg?
GUTFELD: No. I would never have done that.
WATTERS: The massive 6'4" cow making headlines around the world apparently has some competition. A Canadian farmer claims his own so-called gentle giant --
PERINO: Wow.
COMPAGNO: Aww. Cute.
WATTERS: -- named Dozer is an inch taller.
PERINO: Wow.
GUTFELD: What if these are really -- wait, wait, wait. What if these are just really small people?
PERINO: Well --
GUTFELD: I mean, this could all be a total scam.
PERINO: If you were next to that --
GUTFELD: Exactly. But here's my thing. I would rather have -- forget big bovines. I'd rather have little tiny genetically-engineered cows so, like, they could be in your house. Like, you could be sitting on the couch and go, "Hey, Bessie." Runs up, jumps on there, and you squeeze out some milk. You have a glass of milk right there, just all the time.
PERINO: Would you do that?
GUTFELD: Yes, a little -- little genetically-engineered baby cow in your house. And you'd just have milk whenever you want.
PERINO: Remember when you had to milk that goat at the event?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Why go out for milk when you have the cow at home? Perfect, Greg.
COMPAGNO: I just love that they were saved. Both of these cows were saved by --
WILLIAMS: I think we should reconsider that.
WATTERS: Does that analogy have a different meaning?
GUTFELD: I don't know. Never heard of it. Never heard of it.
WILLIAMS: I think that's about human relationships, Jesse. Human relationships.
WATTERS: Oh, I'm thinking about milk, Juan.
PERINO: All right, all right.
WILLIAMS: All right, all right.
COMPAGNO: Yes, I love that both of these cows were saved. Basically, both of them were slated to be -- I almost said mass murdered.
WATTERS: Hurry up!
COMPAGNO: And they were saved. Their lives were saved. And I appreciate that, and I like that it's a gentle giant. I think that's sweet. Also, I think that you --
WATTERS: Oh, my God, you've had so much coffee. How much coffee did you drink?
WILLIAMS: Do you know what's going on?
COMPAGNO: Just a little bit.
WILLIAMS: You know what's going on?
COMPAGNO: What?
WILLIAMS: They are hazing you.
COMPAGNO: Oh! Did I pass?
GUTFELD: She's the faster talker on the planet. And to prove it -- to prove it, I don't care if this bites into --
PERINO: Fan mail.
WATTERS: -- fan mail.
PERINO: Just read one paragraph.
GUTFELD: Read -- it's from the Pence book.
COMPAGNO: Oof.
PERINO: This is Charlotte Pence's book.
WILLIAMS: You couldn't read --
COMPAGNO: (READING REALLY FAST)
WILLIAMS: This is like those ads for drugs. You know, at the end of the drug ad.
COMPAGNO: (READING SUPER FAST)
WATTERS: Oh my God. Speed reader.
COMPAGNO: A parlor trick.
WILLIAMS: I'll do it slowly for you. If you take this drug, and you have a problem after 4.5 hours, seek immediate help.
GUTFELD: By the way, you could make a lot of money doing that.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Wow.
COMPAGNO: It's just -- it's just my life.
WATTERS: All right. Unbelievable. Anyway, don't go anywhere. "Fan Mail Friday" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(MEDITATIVE MUSIC)
PERINO: It's time to calm.
GUTFELD: It's time to calm -- yes, it's massage music.
PERINO: Made me want to run to the restroom.
GUTFELD: "Fan Mail Friday." Small-bladder Dana.
All right. First question, "If you could steal any museum artifact and get away with it, what would you steal?" Emily.
COMPAGNO: Am I allowed to re-sell?
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: OK, then --
WATTERS: Practical.
COMPAGNO: Then the King Tut mask.
GUTFELD: Fantastic.
PERINO: That's a good one.
WILLIAMS: Yes, I like that one. I went to see that once.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: What's -- what's the name of that diamond?
PERINO: The Hope diamond.
WILLIAMS: The Hope diamond.
COMPAGNO: Smart.
WILLIAMS: There was one -- I always think, boy, that would be something. You have people over to the house, you know, Emily. Emily and Dana and Greg, Jesse come over. And there's the Hope diamond. They wouldn't believe it. See, they'd all say, "That's a fake one. Get that out of here." And I'd say, "No, real."
GUTFELD: Jesse.
WATTERS: I'm going to go with dinosaur bones.
GUTFELD: Nice.
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: Mona Lisa. Pretty boring.
GUTFELD: Mona Lisa, that's kind of obvious. Don't you think?
WATTERS: Not an artifact, Dana. Please.
GUTFELD: By the way, you know what? I would have to say I wouldn't steal anything, because what if you got it home and it smells? Because you never know. These things have been sitting around for a while. They probably have some weird stench.
PERINO: I don't think that diamonds smell.
WATTERS: You would not notice. You've got the cow there.
GUTFELD: I don't think a diamond is -- a diamond is like a commodity, right? Isn't it a commodity? I don't know. Let's move on.
Ooh, "What is your most essential appliance?" I think for Jesse, it's @FrenchiFirecracker. But what is your most essential --
PERINO: Hair dryer.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Hair dryer. You know, I never actually used a hair dryer until about six months ago, and it changed my life.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Changed my hair, changed my life. A coffee machine.
GUTFELD: Fantastic, yes.
Kerigs. Kerigs. How do we say them, Kwer-igs? Kure-igs.
WATTERS: I don't know what the brand --
GUTFELD: Keurig, there you go. Keurig.
Boy, I'm losing my mind, Dana.
PERINO: I'm going to go dishwasher.
GUTFELD: Interesting.
PERINO: Because I don't want -- I don't like to wash dishes.
GUTFELD: I find it therapeutic to wash dishes.
PERINO: Oh, really? How many dishes do you wash?
GUTFELD: None. I find it therapeutic to watch other people do it.
WILLIAMS: I think she -- I think she called you out, buddy.
GUTFELD: Juan. Essential appliance?
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I was thinking. I like hot and cold. So I like, like, microwaves and refrigerators, because then you can eat whenever you want to eat.
GUTFELD: That is true.
WILLIAMS: But lately I really am into my water pic.
GUTFELD: Interesting.
WILLIAMS: You know what water pic is?
PERINO: For brushing his teeth.
WILLIAMS: Yes, you go -- ssshhhhh!
GUTFELD: Jesse, it's for your mouth.
WATTERS: I've never heard of it.
COMPAGNO: For me, it's not my most essential, but it's my favorite. I have a -- like a buttery --
GUTFELD: A gun?
COMPAGNO: Yes, it's shaped like a gun. It's a drill. It's a grill, and it's a pink gun.
Right? Do you know what I am talking about?
GUTFELD: It's a drill.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
GUTFELD: It's a drill.
COMPAGNO: And it's in the shape of a pink gun.
GUTFELD: Thank God you said pink gun.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
GUTFELD: All right. The most essential appliance, for me, is the bed! Because I like to sleep.
WILLIAMS: That's not an appliance.
PERINO: Appliance.
GUTFELD: Mine is. It's got 37 speeds.
WILLIAMS: Oh, is that right?
GUTFELD: It moves up, it moves down. Moves to the side.
WATTERS: You have one of those?
GUTFELD: Yes, it's amazing. You should come over.
WILLIAMS: He is cute!
GUTFELD: All right. "One More --"
WATTERS: I won't go to either of your houses.
GUTFELD: "One More Thing" up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for "One More Thing" -- Juan.
WILLIAMS: Friday fans, do you remember this woman? That's Rosie Ruiz. She famously cheated by taking a shortcut to the finish line of the 1980 Boston Marathon. Well, if you wait long enough, everything comes back around.
COMPAGNO: Oh, wow.
WILLIAMS: This time half a world away, take a look at this tape.
WATTERS: Whoa.
WILLIAMS: Yes, several runners pulled a Rosie Ruiz at the Shenzhen half marathon. As you can see, they cut through the woods, shortening the distance they had to run.
But that's not the worst of it. Others hired replacements to run whole sections of the race while they were resting.
WATTERS: Nice.
WILLIAMS: As a result, 237 cheaters have been banned from the race for the next two years.
PERINO: Wait, where was that?
WILLIAMS: Shenzhen in Hong Kong.
PERINO: Yes, OK. Well, I think that President Trump ought to bring this up tomorrow.
GUTFELD: What does that look like?
PERINO: Cheaters.
GUTFELD: No.
PERINO: The border?
GUTFELD: It looked like the border.
WILLIAMS: The border?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.
GUTFELD: All right, all right, all right.
Oh, tomorrow, great show that we've got, "Greg Gutfeld Show" at 10 p.m. I've got Terry Schappert. I've got Mike Baker. I've got Kat. I've got Tyrus. It's going to be a lot of fun.
Now, you know what it's time for.
WATTERS: Yes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (SINGING): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: This one is dedicated to a Claire McCaskill, who's clueless and now out of office.
All right. Look at this.
PERINO: Oh, I like him.
GUTFELD: It's a little, little dog, and behind him, he knows -- he just knows something is going on behind him. He's not sure what it is. The cat is not doing a damn thing, but the dog is like, "What the heck is going on? I know something's up." His spidey senses, little pug senses, going, "There's a cat behind me." I don't know. And you know what, there he goes.
And you know, it just goes to show you, Claire --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (SINGING): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: And Claire McCaskill isn't.
PERINO: OK. "One More Thing," that's where we have all the fun, and of course, you've enjoyed "Animals Are Great." It's been in your ear all week. It's the ear worm that won't go away. I've decided to join in on the fun. Check this out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO (SINGING): Jasper is great! Jasper is great! Jasper is great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: OK, check out this one. Check out this Jasper video. He's at the park. He's running around. He got to do his figure eights. He goes every morning at the park for an hour and a half. That is why. You know what we have to say next.
COMPAGNO (SINGING): Jasper is great! Jasper is great!
PERINO: Thanks for FiveFanPhotoshop for that little joke. We won't bring it up again.
WILLIAMS: You promise.
PERINO: Jesse.
WATTERS: All right. Take that, Claire McCaskill.
All right. In other -- "Jesse's Eyebrow News."
GRAPHIC: Jesse's Eyebrow News
WATTERS: There we go.
GUTFELD: Claire is going to tweet about this.
WATTERS: I'm setting myself up big. All right. Feeling festive? Christmas tree eyebrows are the new --
PERINO: No. No.
WATTERS: -- rage. Yes, look at this. They're decorating them with art and glitter and glue, little bobbles for the holiday season. Isn't that Christmasy? That is the war on Christmas.
PERINO: You like it?
GUTFELD: That is grotesque.
WATTERS: I love it. I would do that for a shoot. Not another shoot, but I would do that.
PERINO: Oh, great, we're going to do it on next Tuesday.
WATTERS: Also, "Watters' World," look, we have Willie Robertson from "Duck Dynasty," Jerry Falwell Jr. Wow. And Diamond and Silk. What a mix!
WILLIAMS: Yes. Like the bottom of the barrel.
WATTERS: And I interview a migrant from the caravan. Migrant from the caravan comes into "Watters' World," 8 p.m. Sunday.
PERINO: OK. We only -- we only left 15 seconds for you, Emily, but you talk fast.
COMPAGNO: That's good. On a full Thursday afternoon, Ohio's Norton Fire Division received a call of a dog that had fallen through the ice into a pond. The firefighters quickly spring into action, rushed to the dog's location. They found him struggling in the frigid waters. One firefighter bravely jumped into the water, broke through the ice --
PERINO: Amazing.
COMPAGNO: -- towards the scared pup. He was able to reach the dog.
PERINO: That is it for us.
COMPAGNO: Adorable.
PERINO: We'll see you here on Monday. Emily will be on "FOX & Friends" Saturday and Sunday. You won't want to miss that. "Special Report" is up next.
