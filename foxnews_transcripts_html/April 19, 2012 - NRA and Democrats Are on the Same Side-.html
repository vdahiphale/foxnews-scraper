Government watchdog groups, Republicans, and even a top Democratic senator are all slamming a Democratic campaign-finance bill that carves out a disclosure exemption for the National Rifle Association, the NRA.
The Disclose Act is a response to the January Supreme Court decision that overturned limits on corporate and union contributions to political campaigns. Back then NRA president Wayne LaPierre called the ruling, "a defeat for arrogant elitists who wanted to carve out free speech as a privilege for themselves and deny it to the rest of us." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But Wednesday's Wall Street Journal editorial board writes, "look who's arrogant and elitist now," saying the special treatment, "reveals an NRA that is unprincipled and will be weaker for it in the long run." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein called the deal bad policy and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lashed out at the so-called backroom dealing that won the powerful lobby's support of the measure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Last Samurai
BP executives were grilled during a House hearing Tuesday, but Louisiana Republican Congressman Joseph Cao minced no words after one of his colleagues asked BP America's president to resign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Cao "went medieval" as the New York Daily News put it, saying, "In the Asian culture, we do things differently. During the Samurai days, we'd just give you a knife and ask you to commit harakiri." Harakiri is of course Japanese ritual suicide.
Secondhand Smoke 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');

A 28-year-old British woman unknowingly received a double lung transplant from a donor who had smoked for three decades. The operation happened in February of 2009 and five months later the woman died of pneumonia. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Her family says she would have been horrified had she known of the origin of the lungs. In Britain's government-run health care system, the top transplant official defended the surgery, saying patients should be told they aren't getting what he called a brand new organ and then he insisted that lungs from a smoker can work perfectly normally.  </pre>
