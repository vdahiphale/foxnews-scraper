SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News Alert. Welcome to "Hannity" tonight. Now, we start with major breaking news. That's all coming up. Ari Fleischer, Monica Crowley, Kellyanne Conway, Sara Carter, Joe DiGenova, Lou Dobbs, Pam Bondi are all here with reaction. 
But first, the destroy Trump media is absolutely losing it all across the country tonight, continuing to lie about the president and his firing of James Comey. Tonight here on this program, we set the record straight. And that is tonight's "Opening Monologue."

All right, the destroy Trump propaganda media continues to do the Democrats' dirty work by pushing insane tin hat conspiracy theories and making ridiculous and factually inaccurate historical comparisons to President Trump kicking James Comey to the curb. Watch this big lie!

JEFFREY TOOBIN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, CNN: I have not seen anything like this since October 20th, 1973, when President Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: Just like Donald Trump didn't want to talk a lot now, Nixon didn't want to talk a lot. When Nixon did come out of the woodwork, he said -- that's when he famously said, I am not a crook.

HANNITY: The level of ignorance here is breathtaking! Now, as we've been telling you this week, the liberal crackpots in the media, they're now unhinged. They are totally suffering from a syndrome, Trump derangement syndrome. And as we have seen time and time again, they're willing to say anything, no matter how crazy it sounds. They want to damage this president, get him out of office, delegitimize him.
Now the real reason that President Trump fired James Comey is because the former FBI director was incompetent. He failed to faithfully execute the laws of this country and follow the principles of equal justice under the law. And for not doing that, that made him a failure and that meant he needed to be fired.

HANNITY: Now, the president, he really didn't have a choice here because Comey was a complete and utter failure. Now, he disrespected the Constitution. He made a mockery of the rule of law. He did nothing while 4th Amendment privacy rights in this country were being violated day in and day out.

And of course, the most dangerous part of what he's been doing, he created a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary, one for Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of us. 
Now, just take a look right there on the side of your screen. These are all the laws that Hillary Clinton broke with her private email server scandal. And along with the Clinton Foundation, which is another big issue -- well, Clinton's server had, let's see, top-secret information, special access program information on it, classified information on it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Remember, she deleted -- you can't delete 30,000-plus emails! Now, she claimed they were personal about yoga, a wedding, a funeral, grandchildren and emailing with her husband, who doesn't email! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

And even James Comey described her conduct in that 13-minute closing argument where we thought he was going to indict her, as "extremely careless." Now, the legal standard is gross negligence! Can anybody tell me what the difference is? 
And back during the campaign, we learned that there was a very high chance that up to five foreign actors had hacked into Hillary's server. She totally compromised America's national security and he did nothing. And by the way, that likely put operatives in the field and their lives in danger. 
On top of all of this, you have the Clinton Foundation. Now we have the pay-to-play scheme. The Clintons were literally lining their pockets with millions and millions of dollars while Hillary was serving as secretary of state! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
You might remember, Clinton signed off herself on giving the Russians 20 percent of America's uranium, that horrible Uranium One deal. Remember, she had to sign off personally on that. And many of the people that were involved or in and around that deal donated millions and millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Moscow was doubling Bill Clinton's speaking fees.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, that's just the beginning of Comey's many, many mistakes. Now, most recently, Comey stood by while your 4th Amendment privacy rights were being trampled on with the Obama administration unmasking American citizens caught up in foreign surveillance incidentally. 
Now, the one law that we do know was broken in this whole Russia-gate conspiracy theory advanced by the left -- well, the one law was broken was against General Mike Flynn. OK, so he was incidentally picked up. Then they unmask General Flynn. And then classified information, top-secret classified information, was released. That is a crime. That is a felony. That is a violation of the Espionage Act.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as we've been saying, Comey got what he deserved. And frankly, kind of lucky that the president let him collect a paycheck for as long as he did.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Now, of course, the propaganda destroy Trump media and the Democrats, well, they don't want you to know any of these facts, and they're not reporting these facts. And they're expanding on their lies like saying, "Oh, Comey asked for more money." That turned out not to be true today.
And that's why you're only going to hear about these issues, frankly, right here on this show. And by the way, instead what you have from the left and Democrats, they're now feigning selective moral outrage. They're pretending to forget that just a few short months ago, most of them were calling for Comey to be fired.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER, OCT. 31, 2016: He owes not only Secretary Clinton but the American people an explanation for what appears to be an appalling action.

He's got a big burden of proof, so to speak, on him for why he did what seems to be such an appalling act that goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. It was -- when I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this. 
What Comey did -- I just respectfully disagree with my opponent. What he did was appalling, and prosecutors from one end of America to another know it.

Now, of course, "Crying Chuck," well, he wasn't done there. Just days before the election, he went after James Comey yet again by saying, quote, "I do not have confidence in him any longer. To restore my faith, I'm going to have to sit down, talk to him, get an explanation for why he did this."
And now that Donald Trump is president, the king of hypocrisy, "Chucky Schumer," is now singing a much different tune about James Comey. Interesting how politics plays a part in how you think about any one individual on any different day. Take a look.

SCHUMER: Well, Mr. President, the dismissal of Director Comey has raised a bevy of troubling questions over the last few days. 
This is about one of the most sacred things we believe in as Americans -- rule of law. Rule of law being threatened here.

We know Director Comey was leading an investigation on whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense.
Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president? The dismissal of Director Comey establishes a very troubling pattern.

Now, I want you to set your DVR. In the very next segment of this show, we're going to show you a montage of every major Democrat trashing Jim Comey. You don't want to miss it and how they've now changed their tune.

Joining us now first, though, with reaction is former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, conservative columnist Monica Crowley. Good to see you both. Let
All right, let me start with you. I -- hypocrisy obviously is on display here. But way beyond the hypocrisy -- and we have played this so often -- there has not been -- since the Russia conspiracy theory has started, not a single shred of evidence that there was any collusion with the Trump campaign, that any vote was impacted at all by any actions that Russia was involved in -- as a matter of fact, just the opposite was told us. 
So how is it these major networks -- you dealt with all these press outlets. How do they keep reporting one big lie conspiracy, night after night, day after day?
ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, and you can add to your list the accusation that the deputy attorney general threatened to resign. He was asked that (INAUDIBLE) Capitol Hill. He said he did not threaten to resign. So add that to the list of false reporting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But Sean, I think there are several levels to this, and let's start with the Democratic hypocrisy. It's -- it is -- that's what's appalling. They should change the name of the Democratic Party to the hypocrite party. You know, I saw one person say -- this was a columnist -- that this is a coup. Well, that's cuckoo. I saw another person say it's a constitutional crisis. The only crisis here is in people's heads. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is the hyperventilating about all things Trump that has made people like me, who are open-minded and want to see things a little more towards the middle, totally turn against what the Democrats are saying because I don't think they have credibility on these issues.
And of course, there should be no special counsel. If there is evidence that leads to the attorney general (INAUDIBLE) the deputy attorney general to believe that, he'll take that action. But there's been no evidence suggesting that it's necessary. 
HANNITY: It's so important what you're saying... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
FLEISCHER: ... the Democrats behave. They're the ones out of line. Now, there is other things to this, and I want to come to that later.
HANNITY: All right, and Monica, two huge breathlessly reported lies in just the last 24 hours. Ari mentioned one of them, that the deputy attorney general threatened to resign. That's false. Number two, that the FBI had just asked days before for more money to investigate the Russian conspiracy. That turns out to be false.
Every single major newspaper, every cable outlet, every broadcast channel, news report -- they expounded on those lies, and I doubt they'll correct the record tonight.

        }
      
MONICA CROWLEY, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Yes, I doubt that, too, Sean. Don't hold your breath on that. Look, we have had decades of leftist bias coming out of the mainstream media. Ari knows this. He went through it with President Bush. It goes back for a long time. So this is nothing new. 
But what is new is two things. The level of activism on the part of the media in creating fake news, perpetuating these lies, not ever correcting the record. 
And the second thing that is new is Donald Trump. Donald Trump is an alien organism that's been injected into the body politic by the American people to reform that system. And therefore, the entire political ruling class -- all of the ruling elites -- and that includes the media, Sean -- are doing everything possible to reject him, to push him out of the system. That includes lying about him. It includes lying about his team. It includes lying about his record. 
And I hope that this president understands what he's up against here. He is not considered a normal president by the ruling class, again including the media. And therefore, he must not be allowed to succeed!

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We had a very nice dinner. And at that time, he told me, You are not under investigation, which I knew anyway.
HOLT: That was one meeting. What was the -- what were the other two?
TRUMP: First of all, when you're under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything. I knew I wasn't under. And I heard it was stated at the committee, at some committee level that I wasn't, number one.
HOLT: So that didn't come directly from him.
TRUMP: Then during a phone call, he said it. And then during another phone call, he said it. So he said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone calls.

HANNITY: Now, meanwhile, earlier today, President Trump called out Democrats for now feigning outrage over Comey's firing. Now, Trump tweeted out, quote, "The Democrats should be ashamed. This is a disgrace. #draintheswamp." And then he linked to this very funny, sad but powerful video.

NADLER: The president ought to fire Comey immediately. And he ought to initiate an investigation.
CHUCK TODD, MODERATOR, "MEET THE PRESS"/NBC: There needs to be restoration and credibility of the FBI.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That pretty much tells it all, and that's not all. President Trump also retweeted something that Rosie O'Donnell posted back in 2016. She wrote, "Fire Comey." Now, Trump retweeted and he wrote, "We finally agree on something, Rosie."
Here with reaction, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway is with us. You know, it's such hypocrisy on such a high level. Chuck Schumer is the worst. Nancy Pelosi not far behind. Harry Reid is right in there with the rest of them. And Bernie Sanders -- you know, poor Bernie, and all of this, you know, he should be the most angry at Hillary Clinton and James Comey, if you ask me.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What's your reaction to the way the left is creating these bizarre conspiracies? 
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: They once again show, Sean, they have absolutely no message. The message is resist, obstruct, deny, insult, insinuate. And you know, I was looking back at a poll that was taken in March by the Harvard Harris poll survey. And in March, 41 percent of Democrats said they had an unfavorable view of Jim Comey to 12 percent of Democrats who said it was favorable. Why was it 41 unfavorable? Because Democratic leaders were out there trashing this guy all through the fall. And now they want to make him a martyr. 
I would out to you today that in addition to what the president himself said, which is most important, in the interview with a different network, that Mr. McCabe, the acting FBI director today, under sworn testimony, said that the firing of Jim Comey does not impact their ongoing investigations at all and that they have sufficient resources.
The media print the opposite. They said that they had asked for more resources. He said, We have enough of them. Somebody, a single source, quote, "somebody close to the White House" -- I don't know if they mean at the sandwich shop or the coffee shop across the street -- but quote, "somebody close to the White House" said that Mr. Rosenstein had tried to - - had threatened to resign. The Department of Justice today said that's simply not true. 
So there's such a rush for -- to judgment. There's such -- this presumptive negativity. And it makes these people lose their minds and become hypocrites.
HANNITY: Well, look, this is all fake news, I mean, because the report was -- and you're right, what he said earlier today was absolutely true. The investigation continues. The president says he wants it to continue.
CONWAY: Yes! The president wants it to continue and to conclude. And leader McConnell was also right. He said yesterday, Sean, that you just -- the House and the Senate are investigating this. Just let it keep going. The FBI's investigating. Let's just forge ahead. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Right, and -- and by the way, we know this has happened in past elections, and we have been told by intelligence officials it'll happen in future elections. I think one of the greatest examples, though, of selective moral outrage happens to be that Barack Obama even used State Department dollars. If influencing elections is bad, why did Barack Obama use his State Department and political operatives to try and unseat one of our greatest allies, the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu? If it really -- if impacting elections, influencing elections is so wrong, how come nobody seemed to care about that, one of our closest allies?
CONWAY: Yes, people forget all about that They have selective amnesia when it comes to was done in the past and what they've said in short order. 
So I think, look, the president made a decision this week. It was his decision to make. He was resolute and decisive, exactly what we've seen in past decisions in his early administrations, Sean, and people who are questioning that just need to listen to him in these interviews. He said he had thought about it for a long time and he made the decision and it's final. But also, the acting FBI director says that he can still go forward with everything as is. 
The other thing I just wanted to mention is because it gets no coverage -- you know, the president is also talking about the economy and jobs, what's next on health care. He signed an executive order today on cyber security. He's doing so many things. He's preparing for his first foreign trip with five different stops. 
And I would also point to you that polls -- the good polls don't get picked up. This Morning Consult political poll that shows vast majorities of Americans support so many of the pieces of the spending that went through last week. Nobody talks about that because it's positive of the president. By 7 to 1, 77 to 11, Americans support these...
HANNITY: Last question...
CONWAY: ... these health benefits for the coal miners.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You know, all these fake news networks -- because they really are fake news -- have been trying to come up with this liberal talking point and making comparisons that this is Nixonian. This is the equivalent of the Saturday night massacre, when in fact, Nixon was trying to stop an investigation and a special prosecutor. This president is not stopping it. There was no requests for extra funds. That's another media lie. And he's requesting -- he wants to get answers, and he set up an executive order, commission to look into this type of fraud and other issues involving elections as well today.
CONWAY: That's right. He did that today. Usually, people want to do that after they lose an election or right before an election. He's doing it with -- after he won the election decisively and long before he's up for reelection. He's doing it because he believes in ballot integrity and the fairness of the process.
But look, people who are completely losing it over this just have to stop and look at the facts and listen to the sworn testimony today from the acting FBI director. Listen to the president himself in this interview.
But there's so much good news coming out of here that does not get covered because it's not -- you know, it's not titillating. You've got -- you've got these other polls that just show that he is -- he's got very good approval ratings and favorability scores, Sean, on how he's handling veteran issues, how he's handling the economy and how he's handling terrorism. 
The president promised accountability, safety and security, prosperity. It's already happening. Look at the jobs numbers. Look at the manufacturing numbers, all these indicators that matter to people who are actually looking for news and not listening to noise.
HANNITY: All right, thanks so much, Kellyanne Conway, counselor of the president.
And coming up on this busy breaking news night tonight right here on "Hannity"...

That's next. 
And also tonight...

PETER ALEXANDER, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NBC NEWS: You obviously have been very critical of James Comey in the past. You said that he had no credibility. I assume that you support the president's decision then to fire him as FBI director?
WATERS: No, I do not necessarily.

JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening and live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York. 
President Trump signing an executive order to create a commission to review alleged voter fraud. The White House says it will look into allegations of improper voting and fraudulent voter registration. Trump has contended without citing evidence that three to five million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. 
Former Florida Congresswoman Corrine Brown found guilty on 18 fraud and tax evasion charges. Brown, a Democrat, was accused of illegally siphoning $800,000 from her charity into her own bank account. Brown blames her former chief of staff who pleaded guilty to corruption charges and testified against her. 
Unemployment claims falling by 2,000 last week. The overall number of Americans now collecting unemployment checks is down to 1.9 million, the lowest number since November of 1988. 
I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to "Hannity." For all of your headlines, logon to FoxNews.com. Have a great night.

TRUMP: Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. So she gets a subpoena, she gets a subpoena, and after -- not before -- that would be bad -- but after getting a subpoena to give over your emails and lots of other things, she deleted the emails. She has to go to jail. 
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was then candidate Donald Trump going after Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail for her private email server scandal. Today, Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is reporting that a veteran former FBI agent told her the agency could in fact reopen the Hillary Clinton email probe now that James Comey is gone. 
Here with reaction, from Circa News, Sara Carter, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe DiGenova. Joe, we have, we'll put it up on the screen, we have identified as many as 16 felonies she may have committed. And we will put them up on the screen again. But we know for a fact -- look at this, bribery, acts impacting financial interests, conspiracy, false statements, certainly gross negligence in the handling of classified information, certainly destroying information, 30 some odd thousand emails. She definitely could be -- a grand jury should be set up, shouldn't it, in this case if we're going to have equal justice under the law?
JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: I think one of the most appalling things about the last years has been the conduct of the Department of Justice under the Obama administration and the FBI which was complicit in basically covering up an array of crimes that were committed by Mrs. Clinton, the Clinton Global Foundation, the Initiative, and all of that. 
When you put together all of the pieces of the monies that was paid to the former president Bill Clinton while his wife was secretary of state, millions of dollars from foreign companies and countries clearly designed to create influence with her as secretary of state, and when you look at the things she did in office by way of licenses, the granting of favors to companies related to those speeches, both foreign and domestic companies, it is an appalling array of criminal activity which was ignored by the director of the FBI and two attorneys general in the Obama administration. 
It requires -- if you want to have an independent commission for something, there ought to be an independent commission to examine why federal grand juries were not -- 
HANNITY: Republicans will not fight, Joe. Republicans are weak.
DIGENOVA: You don't have to convince me. I've been watching it for too many years. But there should be a thorough investigation of why none of this was pursued. 
HANNITY: And Sara, you have done such a good job. As I mentioned in my opening monologue tonight, the one crime we know was committed was the incidental surveillance, fair enough, that's not a crime, but the unmasking, and then of course the leaking of intelligence, General Flynn. He didn't pursue it. And we even heard from Sally Yates this week. She was never even asked a question by Comey about it. 
SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: That is absolutely true, Sean. That's the one crime that everybody points out was the leaking of that classified information and that conversation that was private between Lieutenant General Mike Flynn who was then serving for the president, and Kislyak, and ambassador Kislyak from Russia. So those are really important questions that need to be asked of the Justice Department. Why did the Justice Department, or why has not the Justice Department called on the FBI to start an investigation into the leaks? Maybe they have, but as far as I know right now and from our own investigations, they have not. 
HANNITY: All right, so they have not there. Then I can add, Sara, the Clinton Foundation, all the people surrounding the Uranium One deal, 20 percent -- want a Russian conspiracy, 20 percent of America's uranium, she signs off as secretary of state, goes to Vladimir Putin, and the people in and around that deal giving the Foundation millions of dollars. To me in my little world, that is called a quid pro quo in selling out your office for personal gain. 
CARTER: It's definitely enough to start an investigation, right, Sean. If you're looking at it, it was roughly $2.4 million that she received between 2009 and 2013 from Uranium One when that deal went through for the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Global Foundation -- the Clinton Foundation. And also the money that Bill Clinton received for his speeches which totals to half a million dollars. 
HANNITY: Double his fee.
CARTER: Yes, exactly. And they were connected to the Kremlin. And the people that actually gave that money were connected to promoting Uranium One. 
HANNITY: Unbelievable. 
CARTER: That's enough. That's enough to start an investigation. 
HANNITY: Joe, between the email server scandal, what Sara just mentioned on the Uranium One deal, the increased speaking fees, those around funneling millions to the Foundation, the unmasking and releasing of intelligence in the case of General Flynn, to me, we have overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence in every case that Hillary Clinton committed felonies. Am I wrong? 
DIGENOVA: I think there's reason to believe that very serious crimes that were committed. They should have been investigated. The only one that we know was investigated with the email server. And we know that the FBI director falsely stated with the law was at his July 5th news conference in order to give her a pass. 
It is inconceivable to me that any good U.S. attorney, Justice Department lawyer, or FBI field agent would not begin investigations into the Clinton Global Initiative and the Foundation. There is overwhelming evidence that bribery occurred and that official acts were given as a result. 
HANNITY: And 18-USC-793 talks about gross negligence is the legal standard. Comey said in his 13 minute closing argument that sounded like he would indict her that she was extremely careless. Is there a difference between extremely careless and gross negligence? 
DIGENOVA: No, they are identical. And in fact one of the grave sins that Comey committed during that July 5th news conference besides usurping the function of the attorney general, was to misstate the law, to misapply it to her, and to make believe that nothing was legally actionable. He was wrong. He knew it, and he did it for political purposes. 
CARTER: Can you imagine, Sean, can you imagine this, if people just moved classified information in and out of their home and sent it to their private servers and they don't get charged? 
HANNITY: Five foreign intelligence services got intelligence, got our top secrets. 
Guys, good to see you both. We will have you back. We will follow this until we get to the truth. 
Coming up next on the busy breaking news night tonight on "Hannity" --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: The intent to continue to come at this country, this is a Paul Revere moment. The Russians are coming. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The Russians are coming. Democrats continue to peddle these bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy theories about Russia costing Hillary Clinton the election. Up next, reaction to this liberal lunacy from our friend Lou Dobbs. And also tonight --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(CHEERS)
CROWD: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President Trump supporters not shy about their desire to see Hillary Clinton locked behind bars. Now that James Comey has been fired, will be FBI reopen their investigation into her private server? We will check in with the Florida attorney general Pam Bondi later tonight.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So it has been two days since President Trump fired the FBI director James Comey. Naturally Democrats, they totally lost it and are losing lit. Now, some of their public comments are becoming downright laughable. This includes Senator Cory Booker who apparently sees himself as the modern day Paul Revere. The British are coming! Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOOKER: We have to get back to the focus of what's going on right now which is really a moment in American history where we have had an unprecedented attack on our election. And how are we as a nation going to respond? Donald Trump clearly has not taken this seriously. In what should be a Paul Revere moment for our country where people are talking about the Russians are coming, they are intending not only to attack this past election but intended to continue this behavior, what will our response be? 
The Russians, we see this from the French elections, we see this from what's happening -- they intend to continue to come at this country. So this is a Paul revere moment. The Russians are coming. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. And my favorite, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who has been calling for President Trump's impeachment for months, yesterday the Congresswoman's hypocrisy was on full display. This is almost too funny to believe. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDER: You obviously have been very critical of James Comey in the past. You said that he had no credibility. I assume you support the president's decision then to fire his FBI director? 
WATERS: No, I do not necessarily support the president's decision. 
ALEXANDER: So if Hillary Clinton had won the White House, would you have recommended that she fire FBI Director James Comey? 
WATERS: Let me tell you something. If she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her and what he tried to do, she should have fired him. Yes. 
ALEXANDER: So she should have fired him but he shouldn't have fired him. This is why I am confused. 
WATERS: No, you're not confused. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The only person confused seems to be Congresswoman Waters. Here with reaction with the Fox Business Network, Lou Dobbs. So if Hillary is president, yes, I justify the firing. I don't justify the firing if Trump does it. 
LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Maxine Waters has her own perspective, as you and I both know over the years. But Cory Booker is the fellow -- Sean, I swear. Doesn't he realize that the Democrats missed their Paul revere moment altogether when the FBI was knocking on the door of the DNC to tell them that not only on the Russians coming, they are there, and they have broken into your servers, and were told to go away by the dnc. We still don't know why they got away with that. 
HANNITY: Exactly. How did they get away with not letting the FBI not look at their servers and they bring in their own people? 
DOBBS: Aren't you shocked that the Dems aren't demanding a full on special prosecutor, every kind of investigation to find out why the DNC could get away with telling the FBI to go away, people? We are not going to worry about the Russians and the integrity -- 
HANNITY: Here's another thing. How do you give an immunity deal to two people and then, Lou, I have never heard about this. Maybe you've heard about it in all the years we've been broadcasting together -- and then let them destroy their laptops, the evidence in the case? When is that ever happened before?
DOBBS: I suppose you could make the case, Sean, that if you're going to do one, you might as well do the other. I mean, who are you going to prosecute? 
(LAUGHTER)
DOBBS: If they destroy 13 handheld devices, laptops going every which way. They do find discover one, and it's Anthony Weiner's laptop just stocked up with all sorts of unclassified data, but we don't want to bother anybody so we will just move on. 
HANNITY: Yes, we don't want to bother Anthony. I think it would be a horrible assignment for any FBI guy to look through that thing. But she now, does this now open up the possibility she is going to have a real investigation? 
DOBBS: I think absolutely, because I don't care, whomever President Trump puts in as head of the FBI, if the purpose is to restore the integrity and trust of the American public and that great agency, the first thing that has to happen is, as we heard today by Andrew McCabe in testimony, the rank and file agents wanted her prosecuted. It's time to reopen the case and come to a conclusion that says justice for all in America. 
HANNITY: Every FBI agent I know said that to me privately in person. Lou, good to see you. Thank you.
DOBBS: Great to see you, Sean.
HANNITY: And up next tonight on this busy breaking news night here on "Hannity."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(CHEERS)
CROWD: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: "Lock her up." For months, Donald Trump supporters have wanted to see Hillary Clinton behind bars. Now that James Comey has been fired, will be FBI now reopen this investigation, if we have equal justice under the law? We'll ask Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Although we did have a lot of fun fighting Hillary, didn't we? Right? 
(CHEERS)
CROWD: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was President Trump back in December during his thank you tour. The crowd again started chanting "lock her up." Now that the former FBI Director James Comey has been fired, should the president grant supporters wish? It's really not his decision. That will be up to the attorney general and others in this case. 
Joining us now, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. OK, do you have any doubt the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible, and I will put up the laws that I believe she has violated, that she broke the law, committed felonies, Pam, on this? 
PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Sean, you have laid the case out multiple times. I think we all know not only did she get a pass, it wasn't negligent. It was criminal, everything that she has done. The president however now -- we have a separation of powers, and he is clearly respecting that. As the president of the United States, what has he said? He has said it would make it more divisive. We need to move on. He is focused on policy. He's focused on not polarizing our country any further, working together, creating health care law, doing all the positive things he wants to do. 
Every time you show the clip of Hillary Clinton condemning James Comey for her losing the election, she should be writing him a thank you note that she's not in prison right now. Frankly, she should be writing two. She should be writing you a thank you note that you are not director of the FBI, because if you had been, she would have been in prison, Sean. 
HANNITY: Attorney General Bondi, this is really important. The president doesn't have a say in this. And I think he disappointed some people when he said after the election let's move on, I'd rather not get involved in this. But it is not his decision, is it? 
BONDI: Exactly, Sean. Exactly, Sean. And that's what he's doing. He is being presidential. It's his job to create policy. That's what he is doing. He is moving forward. Andrew McCabe who is now acting director of the FBI was working with James Comey. Whether they decide to go forward against Hillary Clinton, that has got to be up to the FBI and the great prosecutors in the Justice Department. 
And frankly, we shouldn't be knowing what's going on as it's happening. It should be a criminal investigation if they choose to go that direction. And, frankly, that's the president's job. 
HANNITY: And 18-USC-793, the legal standard is gross negligence. James Comey called talked about extreme carelessness. Is there any legal distinction in your mind as an attorney general? 
BONDI: No. I think it is clearly gross negligence. Any time you talk having classified information, that could jeopardize lives. Sean, you and I know, and really we should've started this off by saying there are so many great men and women around this country in the Federal Bureau of Investigation who do great work every day. And hopefully they will have a new permanent leader soon. They have Jeff Sessions at the helm of the attorney general's office. And they are going to continue to do great things, and it's going to be up to them to investigate it and not the White House. 
HANNITY: Pam Bondi, good to have your back and your insight and analysis. We appreciate it. 
When we come back, we need your help. A very important question of the day as "Hannity" continues. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Time for our "Question of the Day." And should the FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server? Absolutely. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. 
All right, that's all the time we have for this evening. Thanks for being with us. Sorry we didn't have time for the "Hannity" hotline. See you back here tomorrow night.
