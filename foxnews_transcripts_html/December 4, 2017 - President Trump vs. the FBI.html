SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MARYLAND: I think it is critically important that we 
 respect the independence of the Department of Justice and the FBI. No one 
 is above the law. Let Mr. Mueller do his investigation without 
 interference from the president.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: We put all of our 
 faith and confidence in the Department of Justice and the FBI knowing there 
 should be no bias there. He is making the point that we need to make sure 
 there is no bias.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
REP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y.: The essence of police work, the essence 
 of our executive branch is you can have private opinions and do your work 
 unbiased. If you want to say that there was something wrong with the 
 investigation by Mr. Mueller and others, you are entitled to say that, but 
 you have to show some evidence of bias at work.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

DOUG MCKELWAY: While many of you are busy with perhaps some last-minute 
 shopping or picking up relatives at the airport or wrapping presents, the 
 president was busy tweeting right up until Christmas Eve on the what he 
 believes is a compromised FBI investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's take a look at the series of tweets that the president issued on 
 those days. First of all, "How can FBI Director Andrew McCabe, the man in 
 charge, along with leaking James Comey of the phony Hillary Clinton 
 investigation, including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails, be given 
 $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton puppets during the investigation?" 
 And another here, "FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to 
 retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!" "And another, "Wow, FBI 
 lawyer James Baker reassigned according to Fox News." And lastly, "Fox 
 News, FBI's Andrew McCabe, quote, "in addition to his wife getting all of 
 this money from M, (Clinton puppet)," Terry McAuliffe he's referring to 
 there, "he was using allegedly his FBI official email account to promote 
 her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who 
 were investigating Hillary Clinton." 
Let's bring in our panel now, Daniel Halper, contributing editor to "The 
 Washington Free Beacon," Charles Lane, opinion writer for the "Washington 
 Post," and Tom Rogan, commentary writer for "The Washington Examiner." 
 Chuck, let's start with you. A lot of people say it is not wise to be 
 tweeting this when you are under investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: It isn't, although I 
 would say it's especially unwise because of the tone it sets, I am sounding 
 like a broken record, for the president of the United States. It's not the 
 kind of language a president uses in general, much less when discussing a 
 criminal investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The bigger problem here, and I think it was foreseeable, there is no 
 authority in America given our polarized politics, given how partisan 
 everyone is about everything, there is no authority in America who is going 
 to be generally accepted as capable of doing an objective job on this 
 matter. Mueller seemed to be the closest thing we had and he came in with 
 a lot of support even from Republicans. And now that seems to be going 
 away in part because there is such a strong effort to discredit him on the 
 one hand from Republicans, and also, I regret to say, unwisely, some of the 
 people working for him were saying things privately that suggests they have 
 an animus against President Trump. 
MCKELWAY: Indeed. Daniel, that seems to be the case there, and this goes 
 beyond, in many of these examples that we have seen, beyond mere political 
 leanings into political activism of an extreme sort. 
DANIEL HALPER, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: There is clearly evidence of 
 that. We have text messages, we have relationships. There is insight into 
 that. And there seems to me to be three possibilities here. There is 
 either rank corruption within the FBI, which some are suggesting, or at 
 least some sort of ineptness. There's a -- either the president is trying 
 to work the refs, or there's some combination of the two. And it seems to 
 me that's the most likely outcome, rather. There are people who aren't 
 acting appropriately, and yet the president who himself is under 
 investigation via the special counsel is not focusing on himself per se but 
 plenty of people around him, and he's clearly concerned that it will touch 
 him, is clearly trying to work it in a way that may sour the outcome or may 
 help the outcome in this case.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCKELWAY: And Tom Rogan, just an example of the dangers of this kind of
 tweet, I'm going to read this tweet from Ted Lieu who said "@POTUS has 
 tweeted quite a bit about career FBI official Andrew McCabe who could be 
 called as a witness against Trump in an obstruction of justice case. 
 Trump's twitter feed is the gift that keeps on giving. Merry Christmas 
 Robert Mueller." 
TOM ROGAN, COLUMNIST, NATIONAL REVIEW: I don't think obstruction of 
 justice is going to do anything bad for the president. I think if it comes 
 to it, it will be in the position of Russian funny money and links to the 
 Trump organization.
But I do think on this issue there clearly have been mistakes, and Deputy 
 Director McCabe in hindsight probably should have recused himself in terms 
 of that connection point, in terms of money and politics. I suspect the 
 reason now that he seems to be stepping down is to try to insulate his 
 organization from the pressure. But I think that there's a good point that 
 the president of the United States, the exceptionalism of American 
 democracy right back to the founders is the credible independence of the 
 judiciary and the coequal branches of the government. The president is the 
 chief executive of the United States. As someone who lives in his own 
 power and confidence, he does no service to the nation that should be 
 serving or to his own personal credibility as a leader by being quite so 
 visceral and quite so broad-based in his criticisms of this agency.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCKELWAY: How compromised is the investigation given this political 
 activism? Impeachment, should it come to it, is an innately political 
 thing. Is there any recourse that the course could have in an impeachment 
 investigation?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LANE: Well, look, the founders of the country never envisioned prosecution 
 and investigation by this kind of organization of the president. They 
 thought wrongdoing by the president would be taken care of in Congress 
 through the means of impeachment. We're a long way from that. 
I think the threat to our democracy, if there is one in all of this, there 
 are many, one that worries me a lot is the shear politicization of this 
 semi-clandestine national investigative police that we have called the FBI. 
 The bane of every society in the 20th century has been a partisan secret 
 police or a partisan national police force. That's what has brought down, 
 destroyed democracy in many countries. And we are dangerously, I think 
 dangerously near a situation where all partisanship of all kinds is 
 starting to creep into the FBI and organizations like that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCKELWAY: And before we leave this segment, I just want to alert that the 
 president has tweeted again in the last few moments. "I hope everyone," he 
 says, "is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it's back to work in 
 order to make America great again which is happening faster than anyone 
 anticipated!" This evening, the Trumps are providing hundreds of Christmas 
 meals to the Secret Service, the White House military office, and Palm 
 Beach sheriff's deputies. 
Up next, global hot spots.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
