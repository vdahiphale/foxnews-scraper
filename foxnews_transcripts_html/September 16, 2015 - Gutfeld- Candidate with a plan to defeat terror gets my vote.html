When it comes to preventing terror attacks, we need specifics 
In a short speech billed as a national security address, Donald Trump didn't mention ISIS, but he said other stuff. Now, where did I leave that montage? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });

DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to be building up our military. We're going to make our military so big and so strong and so great. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It will be so powerful that I don't think we're ever going to have to use it. Nobody is going to mess with us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We're not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and they're still there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The leaders of Mexico, Japan, China, and every other country that we do business with, they're smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders.
I have the smartest people in this country lined up. I know the smartest. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Now, he said he'd make the military so big we'll never need it. OK. Size does relate to readiness, which is a real concern. But size doesn't matter to the terrorists planning attacks here. And when it comes to preventing them, we need specifics. You have got to go deep. President Reagan understood the communist threat when he took it down. Does anyone have the same handle on terror? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You can't assume a leader will learn in office, not when one error spells ruin. To defend 317 million lives, insults aren't going to work. George Will isn't the guy who is chopping off those heads. Maybe Trump will have specifics tonight. We need them -- not just from him, however, but from everyone. For right now, we have a president who let terror spread because he's too consumed by climate change. But as he frets over incremental increases in Celsius, the capacity for mass death grows in leaps and bounds. A fraction of a degree in heat means little, as the power of a killer rises exponentially. Call this "terror change": The relentless expansion of threat based on the marriage of terror and technology. Fewer bad men can do far more awful things using available tools every single year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The first candidate to talk about how to fight terror change gets my vote. We have a new far deadlier enemy and we need a leader who gets it. Not electing one makes that new enemy our own stupidity.  </pre>
