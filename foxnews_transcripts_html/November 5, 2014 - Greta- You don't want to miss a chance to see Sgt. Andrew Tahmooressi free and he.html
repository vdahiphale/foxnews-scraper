Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Let me give you some behind the scenes. Last night, as I was settling into a joyous night watching election results come on, I got a surprise call telling me Sergeant Tahmooressi was ready - ready for me to interview him. The next thing I knew I was on my way to Florida, arriving after midnight, and then, early this morning, the moment I really have been waiting for, I saw Sergeant Tahmooressi in person out of that Mexican prison.
Now, I was so happy to see him in person and get to welcome him home. For the first time, you're going to hear directly from Sergeant Tahmooressi about his ordeal, how it felt being stopped at the border after making a wrong turn.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SERGEANT ANDREW TAHMOORESSI, MARINE FREED FROM MEXICAN PRISON: I was thinking hopefully these guys are going to be considerate and caring, and understanding. But you know I started feeling the things just something shifted there. You know, they were very helpful, and then shifted and I know you know this could be bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

And Sergeant Tahmooressi was so right. It was bad. For 214 days, he was behind bars in Mexico. And after trying to escape, our American marine endured a brutal beating. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

TAHMOORESSI: They started hitting me. Hitting me in the face with open palms, nothing full blown but, you know, just like -- that was actually joyful to take that beating. I was happy about that beating. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VAN SUSTEREN: Why? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TAHMOORESSI: I knew the beating was coming. They were telling me stories about the guards. About how, you know, if someone acts up or does something wrong, they get beat. So I already knew it was going to happen to me. So I was glad as can be to take that beating. I was like bring it, just bring it on. I was just there joyful knowing that I got away from that place. So the beating didn't bother me.
