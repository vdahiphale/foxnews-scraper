NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, Billy, thank you very, very much.At the corner of Wall and Broad, optimism right now that not only is onevaccine on the way, but available doses into the millions, and by the endof next year, over one billion are on the way as well. And it won't be justone company participating, possibly a few, good enough for the corner ofWall and Broad to see record after record.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is "Your World."And that, what you were peeking at the Dow, is the highest it has everbeen, the S&P 500 the highest it has ever been, the Nasdaq the highest ithas ever been, and all buoyed by optimism that, even with a potentiallybumpy start, the rollout in states for getting doses of vaccine to dealwith COVID-19, the plans are being made, the layout is already beingdetailed.We heard it from Ohio's governor yesterday. We're going to hear it fromArkansas' governor today.But first to Aishah Hasnie on the rollout and the deadline for thosedistribution plans -- Aishah.AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. Yes, that's right.Right now, states across the country are working on their last-minuteupdates or last-minute changes to come into compliance with the latest CDCguidelines, basically prioritizing two different groups, those health careworkers and nursing home patients.Want to show you a list right now, not a complete list, though, of thestates that have already submitted their plans. Many, like California,Washington, New York had already placed those two priority groups at thefront of the line. Other states, though, are now revising their plans andalso trying to balance the new guidelines with their own dire economicneeds.So, in Nevada, for example, Neil, nursing home patients were previouslyincluded in phase three. They were actually behind retail workers there.The tourism hot spot is now, of course, moving them to the top of the list.In Arkansas, where poultry is a huge part of the economy, poultry workerswill be among the second group of essential workers to get the vaccines.Colorado is placing ski resort workers in phase two to try to revive its $6billion industry.Now, choosing where these vaccines go just got harder for these states, asPfizer is expected to ship only half the predicted number of doses.Here's the latest from the FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, who is nowreally trying to defend the agency's vetting process of that Pfizervaccine. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. STEPHEN HAHN, COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: I'm feelingpressure from the urgency of the situation and the thought that we have asignificant pandemic in this country. The American people do depend upon usto do this job right.And that is our promise we will do this right. We will get it right for theAmerican people. And we will look at the data very carefully so that theycan have confidence.(END VIDEO CLIP)HASNIE: And, Neil, it's one thing to roll out the vaccine. It's anotherthing to get folks to take it.We have been talking about these possible mandates out there. Will peopletake the vaccine?Here's an interesting note from Texas. Governor Greg Abbott has said thevaccine there will only be given to folks who voluntarily choose to beimmunized. Very interesting -- Neil.CAVUTO: Very interesting, Indeed.Aishah, thank you. Great reporting on this, Aishah -- Aishah in New YorkCity on all of that.Now, yesterday, we talked to Ohio's governor about how he was very mucheagerly anticipating thousands of doses of that Pfizer vaccine if and whenit becomes available via a checkoff from the FDA. That is said to behappening in a matter of days.Asa Hutchinson also with us right now, the Arkansas governor, who is veryeagerly awaiting that and getting it all distributed.I guess, first, Governor, to health care workers.GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): That's correct.We, hopefully, with the FDA approval on the 10th, which is next week, weexpect our first shipment to arrive within 24 hours. It will go as wedirect to hospitals around the state, as well as pharmacies, so that ourhealth care workers can be immunized.As has been pointed out, there's not enough in the anticipated volume thatcomes with the first shipment to cover all the health care workers. And sothere's going to have to be some decisions made within the health carecommunity as to the priority.Obviously, it would be -- go first to those that are having direct roles intaking care of COVID patients and direct care with patients as well.But those are going to be some refining points to our plan that has beensubmitted. But we're ready to go. Obviously, it takes performance andexecution. And while the federal government has a very good plan, they haveworked on it, they have table topped it, we are anxious to actually see thewheels roll and having that vaccine distributed, because it does giveeveryone hope.CAVUTO: Do you need, Governor, to wait until formal FDA approval?It's been granted, certainly, in the United Kingdom by their counterpart tothe FDA here. But, without that, can, even on an emergency basis, it begiven to your residents?HUTCHINSON: No, we cannot give it to our residents until we have emergencyyouth -- use authorization, if I'm getting your question right.(CROSSTALK)HUTCHINSON: And so, we're awaiting the 10th.We hope that that approval comes, that it goes to the medical care doctors.In terms of the broad population, it's more a -- we're ready to give it tothem whenever the volume is here and we have the FDA approval, but theemergency use authorization will be adequate.Now, in terms of whether we're going to -- we're not mandating everyone totake the vaccine either. That's why it's a public relations campaign. It isconfidence-building, so that the citizens will have confidence. I want toset the right example.If the FDA approves it, I have confidence in it. And we have to have thatlarge amount of participation. But I don't expect the mandates to followthat.CAVUTO: You know, president-elect Biden has said that the vaccine, that itneedn't be mandatory. What did you think of that?HUTCHINSON: Well, I don't think it'd be appropriate.Generally, we have some mandates for immunization of schoolchildren. Butthat is somewhat controversial, in and of itself. This is a vaccine that isreally the product of one of the greatest research and operations inAmerican history with the development of this. The FDA is going through theright process to approve it.And so it's not a matter of mandate. It's a matter of confidence, and that-- and selling it and making sure people feel comfortable with it. Andwhenever you start with our health care workers, and then it will go to ournursing home residents and staff, we're going to see the results of it asyou go along.And they're going to continue to be able to evaluate it. I expect and hopethat the confidence will continue to build, so by the time that it gets toour essential workers, the broader population, that there will be a hugeacceptance of this, because it takes that kind of acceptance for it to beeffective.And so we need to have that. And it's for sure that we want to get beyondwhere we are right now and have a brighter next summer, a brighter 2021.CAVUTO: There's a concept.Governor Hutchinson, thank you very much, sir. Very good catching up withyou on this, Asa Hutchinson of the beautiful state of Arkansas.Let's go to Susan Li on what was a beautiful hat trick for the marketstoday, the Dow, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 all just easily jumping into recordterritory.What was going on?SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's talk about jobs, because wesaw a seventh consecutive month of gains, but the jobs recovery obviouslyis slowly, as COVID cases spike and new restrictions are put in place.We saw November with 245,000 new jobs created, much less than economists'forecasts, who were calling for 469,000. The jobless rate came down,though, to 6.7 percent, and a bright spot, where wages accelerating fromOctober.Now, close to half the new jobs in the month were in transport andwarehousing, as we head into the holiday shipping period, professional andbusiness services, including tech, also hiring, as is health care. And thehousing boom means demand in construction. Manufacturing had a strongmonth, and jobs still coming back in leisure and hospitality.So that means that the U.S. economy has now recovered 12 million out of the22 million jobs that were lost at the onset of COVID. But, with risingcases and more business restrictions being put in place, we do have workersdropping out of the work force in order to care for children or justdiscouraged from looking, the participation rate now near 50-year lows.And this latest report card makes it even more urgent to pass a newstimulus bill using a $900 billion bipartisan Senate package as a startingpoint, which is a far smaller amount than Democratic leaders said -- saythat they might -- will accept.Now, at her weekly press conference, we had House Speaker Nancy Pelosiasked if it was maybe a mistake to turn down the previous White House offerof $1.8 trillion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I'm going to tell you something.Don't characterize what we did before as a mistake as a preface to yourquestion, if you want an answer. That was not a mistake. It was a decision.And it's taken us to a place where we can do the right thing without other,shall we say, considerations in the legislation that we don't want.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI: But, Neil, as you heard from Joe Biden earlier, he said that whatevermight be agreed to now is just a down payment for something even bigger inthe new year.CAVUTO: Susan Li, thank you very much for that.I want to go to Peter Doocy, because he's been following team Biden inreaction to the jobs report and all this stimulus and how much and how soon-- Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Neil, as the president-elect wasexiting the stage, I managed to get a question in. I shouted out to him.Does he think the COVID vaccine should be mandatory for all Americans?And he said, no, he does not think it should be mandatory when it isavailable, but that, like masks, he would do whatever it -- whatever he canwith the power that he has, once he is president, to convince people to, inhis words, do the right thing.He also says he thinks it will go a long way in getting people to get thevaccine if they see him, along with Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and GeorgeBush, getting the shot, so that people in certain communities -- hespecifically singled out the black community here in Wilmington -- don'tfeel like they are being given the shot first.And the word that he used to describe the concerns he is hearing is peopledon't want to be guinea pigs. So, he is going to go to the front of theline to try to ensure confidence.Something that he said, though, about the briefings that they have beengetting about Operation Warp Speed, he says that they still haven't heardfrom the Trump administration how exactly the U.S. government andpharmaceutical companies are going to take the raw vaccine, the actualliquid, and get it into a syringe that can then be given to somebody as ashot.That is something Biden said he is still waiting to do, and it is going tobe very expensive. He is also calling on Congress to act very quickly tohelp people who are hurting right now by no fault of their own. Listen tothis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT: If Congress and President Trump fail to actby the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemploymentbenefits they rely on.Merry Christmas.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Biden was asked multiple times during a Q&A session after hisremarks about the jobs report, which he called dire, whether or not he'sactually spoken to Mitch McConnell yet, and he did not give a direct answerwith any of the chances that he had -- Neil.CAVUTO: Peter Doocy, thank you very, very much.Well, as Peter intimated, tomorrow is going to be a big day in Georgia,where the president of the United States will be campaigning on behalf ofthose two Republican senatorial candidates who are in very tight races,according to the latest polls.There is the distinct possibility the Democrats, both of them, could pullthis off. Then what?We're on it -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, President Trump will be in Georgia tomorrow arguing onbehalf and campaigning on behalf, as his vice president, Mike Pence, wasearlier today, for the two Republican senators in that January 5 run-off inthe Peach State.But let's say there's a lot of intramural problems within the RepublicanParty that could make this, I don't know, maybe a little problematic.Steve Harrigan in Atlanta with much more.Hey, Steve.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You're right, Neil, a lot ofquestions about how this is going to play out.It is the president in Georgia tomorrow, but, today, it's the vicepresident. He's in Savannah, campaigning with David Perdue and KellyLoeffler. Here's the vice president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need the Peach State todefend the majority, because the road to the Senate Republican majorityruns right through the state of Georgia.(END VIDEO CLIP)HARRIGAN: President Obama also conducting a virtual rally for the twoDemocrats.There's been a lot of accusations and a lot of debate about potential fraudin the general election, especially some video that's gotten a lot ofattention, security video from Fulton County, prompting the electionsystems manager of Georgia to respond on Twitter: "The 90-second video ofelection workers at State Farm Arena purporting to show fraud was watchedin its entirety, hours, by Georgia secretary of state investigators. Showsnormal processing."Of course, the president going to Valdosta, Georgia, tomorrow. The thing towatch will be how much of his focus will be on presidential claims of fraudin the general election and how much will be focused on these two Senatecandidates, really the battle for control of the U.S. Senate -- Neil.CAVUTO: Steve, thank you very much, my friend.To Charlie Gasparino.It's not just only Georgians watching this and political types. So areinvestors and big honchos in the financial community, who are gettingincreasingly concerned, I guess, huh, Charlie?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, they areobsessed with this race.I mean, never before have I heard so many Wall Streeters, C level types, Csuite level types, Neil, talk about two Senate seats in Georgia.But the -- there's obvious reasons, and there's policy implications here.If the Senate stays Republican majority, it puts a cap on a lot of the taxincreases, including maybe that corporate tax increase, that Biden -- thatpresident-elect Biden wants to enact when he gets in office.So, if there's Republicans controlling the Senate by one or maybe twovotes, raising the corporate tax to -- from its current level of about 20percent to 28 or 30 percent, is probably a nonstarter. Same with a lot ofthe other tax increases that Joe Biden has pushed for during the election,during the campaign, and same with some other measures involving Green NewDeals and lots of spending plans.I mean, it's going to be -- it's a different fiscal policy ball game, as itapplies to investors, who may not face capital gains tax increases,corporations, who may be able to keep their current corporate tax ratewhere it is now, and in terms -- and even in terms of some regulations,which need to go through the Congress, if the Republicans maintain thatseat, those two seats, or at least one of those seats.But corporations, as they are -- at least they're telling me, based on whattheir lobbyists are telling them, are getting scared. And the reason whythey're getting nervous, Neil, is because they believe that Donald Trump --President Trump, in his continuing to attack the voter system down in --particularly in Georgia, calling into question the Republican secretary ofstate and governor, that he's going to request voter turnout, that peopleare just not going to turn up.They're going to think it's -- the election is rigged. And some of thethings that he said and some of the things Rudy Giuliani said and someother lawyers that were associated with this effort have said is reallyscaring corporate executives to think that there's a chance that theRepublicans, even though they should win these seats -- we should point outthat Jon Ossoff, the Democrat that's running against David Perdue, ReverendWarnock, the Democrat running against Kelly Loeffler, they're pretty farleft.Georgia is not quite a right-wing state anymore because of demographicchanges, influx of people from the North. But it's not -- it's clearly nota far left state. And these are two candidates that would be verycomfortable with AOC and Bernie Sanders in leadership roles in the Bidenadministration.So -- but Georgia voters generally are out there. That's why they split theticket in this -- in this election. Remember, Perdue won, didn't get 50percent, but won more votes than Ossoff.So that's what they're worried about, depressing GOP voter turnout. MaybePresident Trump could turn around this Saturday -- back to you, Neil.CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend, very, very much.We will be looking at that, by the way, in Georgia. We will be speakingwith the secretary of state there, who has had his differences with thepresident of the United States. He will be joining me tomorrow on mySaturday show at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on FOX.In the meantime, I should also let you know and explain something thatCharlie mentioned. Republicans would have to lose both these seats forDemocrats to take control of the Senate. Democrats can't rest with winningjust one of them. They have to take both of them. It's an uphill battle.But some polls show that both races are close enough that it could happen.So, don't take anything for granted. And that's why the president of theUnited States will be there.In the meantime, I should let you know about overall concerns aboutlockdowns and all of that in California, which you have heard a good dealabout. Now we're hearing that health officers in most of the San FranciscoBay Area are issuing their own stay-at-home orders, because hospitalcapacity is running to a bare minimum.ICU beds continue to fill. And capacity there at hospitals in and aroundthe San Francisco area is such that they didn't want to take any chances.And the better part of valor is to issue these stay-at-home orders forhospitals.Now, how many people adhere to that? We shall see.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: We just might have COVID-19 stimulus coming our way.A top Republican senator who says it looks more likely now than it didlittle more than 24 hours ago. What changed? Who changed? And what's instore for you?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Can a governor go ahead and shut down private schools as well toward off the COVID-19 spread in his state?That's the issue before the governor of Kentucky, and no less then, well,Associate Justice Kavanaugh was demanding an answer by the end of today toa lawsuit filed by the attorney general of Kentucky as to the doublestandard there.I had a chance to speak to Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky attorney general,about this, and the premise of the case that says you can't treat twoschool systems differently.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DANIEL CAMERON (R), KENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL: The fact of the matter is,is that he's infringing upon the First Amendment rights of parents allacross the commonwealth who simply want to send their children toreligiously affiliated schools.Meanwhile, gambling parlors, retail shops, movie theaters all continue tostay open. But he has found it necessary to close down religiouslyaffiliated schools. That is a direct infringement upon the First Amendmentrights we all hold so dear.As the attorney general, it's my responsibility to stand up for thoserights.CAVUTO: So, when the governor is saying that this is not tilted toward justprivate schools, that this crackdown that favors more virtual than in-person learning applies to everybody, you said that's not the case?CAMERON: Well, look, the larger context here is the fact that he has closeddown schools, specifically religiously affiliated schools, but opened upthe other things that I just mentioned.What I have advocated and what parents all across the commonwealth inKentucky have advocated is the simple fact that the schools need to be ableto apply with the CDC guidelines.You take Danville Christian that spent nearly $30,000, Lexington Christianthat spent nearly $400,000, all in an effort to keep people safe during themidst of this pandemic.CAVUTO: Now, what's happened, as you know better than many, AttorneyGeneral, is that where there have been cases where public schools have beenshut down, parents have been just shipping their kids to private schoolsand registering them there.I would suspect the same phenomenon was going on in Kentucky. And thatcould have something to do with all of this. What do you think?CAMERON: Well, I think that's certainly a part of it.Look, we just want our religiously affiliated schools, again, to have thesame opportunity that we have given retail shops, that we have given movietheaters, that we have given gambling parlors. They should have the sameopportunity.And, Neil, you know this. Dr. Fauci just this past weekend was ontelevision talking about the importance of getting our kids back in school.The CDC has even put forth statements to that very same point, that verysame fact that schools have not been the super-spreaders that a lot hadfeared.It's important that our children get back to school. It's important thatparents in the commonwealth have the right and the opportunity to sendtheir children to these religiously affiliated schools, because not only isthe curriculum important, but it's also learning the story of the Bible,learning the story of faith, again, that is protected by the FirstAmendment.We're going to stand up for that here in the commonwealth. And that is myresponsibility, as the attorney general.CAVUTO: Now, Brett Kavanaugh has asked the governor to respond to this, torespond essentially to your lawsuit by the end of today.I'm no lawyer. You're very good one. What if the governor does not? Thenwhat?CAMERON: Well, it's still left up to Justice Kavanaugh what the next stepsare. He can either consider this by himself, or he can consult with theother eight justices on the bench.This is a really important case. I hope they will take carefulconsideration of it. Obviously, the diocese case came out last week in NewYork that basically said there can't be specific limits placed on the freeexercise of religion on in-person worship services.I think this case is very consistent with that. And I'm hopeful that wewill get a favorable decision that allows our parents to send theirstudents, their children back into the classroom in our religiouslyaffiliated schools.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO: All right, Kentucky's attorney general.We have reached out to Kentucky Governor Beshear. He has not responded toour calls. And, as far as we know, he did not meet Justice Kavanaugh'sdeadline to respond by this afternoon to the charges in the lawsuit filedby the attorney general.We will keep you posted.Also keeping you posted on these crackdowns in California, includingrevisiting what amount to the toughest shutdown requirements we have hadthat date back to the height of the pandemic. Some business owners aresaying, enough is enough.Meet one -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, well, they're not quite lockdowns yet in the GoldenState, but, increasingly, better than 40 percent of counties in Californiaare experiencing some tough restrictions that will limit public activityand exposure to businesses, even restaurants or outdoor dining and a hostof other things, lives on the vine.For businesses protesting all of this, it's just more insults along theway, and something that could tip them into outright bankruptcy.Ryan Choura joins us right now. He is the -- organized March for SmallBusinesses behind that in California today, has had to make some toughdecisions and lay off folks himself in the face of all of this.Ryan, good to have you.Where does this stand right now in your state? It looks like things aregoing from bad to worse.RYAN CHOURA, CEO, CHOURA EVENTS: They're getting so terrible.You -- in Long Beach specifically, you walk around to the differentrestaurants and retail shops, and you see so many of them boarding them upand having to close down. And it's just -- it's just a terrible sight tosee.CAVUTO: Now, I have heard as well about the latest crackdown in SanFrancisco, given the fact that hospital capacity is down to next tonothing. I don't know how accurate that is. But that obviously will spurstill more restrictions.Are you worried that this is going to get even worse, if that's possible?CHOURA: Well, I think so many people just feel helpless. And it feels likethe goalpost continues to move.And we -- everyone thinks they do this, and then something else happens.And when I -- when you look at cities like San Francisco, who would everwant their city to look like San Francisco? And that's how we feel on LongBeach.We're one of the three cities in California to have their own healthdepartment. And our city, instead of utilizing their own health department,continues to utilize L.A. County. And L.A. doesn't look much different thanSan Francisco, which both are looking very sad.CAVUTO: I'm just wondering, what do you do, Ryan? I mean, you're a businessowner yourself. You could face this reality.You hear across the other side of the country what's going on in Washingtonabout a possible stimulus measure. Maybe that could help small business.Maybe that could help guys like you, maybe not.What do you think?CHOURA: You know, the thing that I think politicians, until they get a paycut, they don't get it.I had to lay off 180 people in my business. And I'm just one of thousandsof small businesses that have had to do that. And I think of the manyworkers, the servers and the people that work in the kitchen, the busboys.And what do you do? I mean, the only thing I could do in my community wasto organize a really positive march. Instead of burning down businesses,we're about building businesses back up. But it feels like politicians,specifically in my city, are just so out of touch with reality.CAVUTO: Obviously, your governor has come under criticism number, a numberof your mayors have, that preach one thing and do quite the opposite forthemselves.Their hypocrisy notwithstanding, is it frustrating for you asking for andnot getting help?CHOURA: Yes, it's interesting.When we did our march, the city came out, and they said they would give$250,000 or something like this to fund the employees of restaurants. And Ijust said, $250,000? Why do you need to do that, when you could openrestaurants up today?Maybe you limit the capacity. Maybe you drop outdoor capacity to 50percent. But a complete shutdown cannot be our only answer. And why I thinkthat is, is, they're just so interested in optics vs. science.And when you -- when you're driving through political optics, you don'tcare who you hurt. You're just concerned with your next position or whereyou're going.And so I see, specifically in our city and surrounding cities, smallbusinesses will continue to go out of business until the politics change.CAVUTO: I wouldn't hold my breath for that, Ryan, but I -- hope springseternal.Thank you. Hang in there, my friend.CHOURA: You got it.CAVUTO: We will be watching it very closely.If you don't mind, we'd love to check back with you and see how things aregoing.CHOURA: Thank you.CAVUTO: No, thank you, Ryan Choura, on all of that.Well, help is on the way, maybe not in California, for California, but inWashington for the rest of the country, as Republicans and Democrats seeeye to eye on a pretty big stimulus package.But what's in it, and can it pass?We will talk to Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I think it would be better if they had the $1,200. And I understandthat may be still in play. But I'm not going to comment on the specificdetails.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: All right, Joe Biden responding to some positive developments inWashington that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, areinching closer to what could be about a $908 billion relief bill in lightof COVID-19.The president-elect was asked directly about those $1,200 stimulus checks,whether we'd have something akin to what we had in the beginning of this aspart of this.He did sort of hedge on that, saying that, whatever they come up with now,he would come up with something later, when he takes office.Bill Cassidy joins us, the Louisiana Republican senator.First off, on progress here, Senator, on a measure, how likely is it, youthink?SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Well, Neil, actually, I have another call that Ihave to decide right now, in which we're negotiating different aspects ofit.We're working over the weekend to build out our framework to come up withmore specific language in proposals. But I'd like to -- I'm hopefullyoptimistic. I say that because there's a lot of Republicans who have beenagainst previous proposals who are for this one, and similarly forDemocrats. If they had looked at our proposal, they were against it.They're for this one.Nothing passes unless it's bipartisan. This is bipartisan. Again, I'mcautiously optimistic.CAVUTO: Do you have an understanding from the president as well that, asthings stand now, Senator, he supports this, as it stands?CASSIDY: He said he would sign a $908 billion package. He pulled back alittle bit and said he meant Mitch's. But Mitch's is not $908 billion. Oursis.CAVUTO: Right.CASSIDY: And ours is the only one with the chance to get to his desk.So, I, again, am cautiously optimistic. And I do see his comments ascontributing to the momentum that we can get something done.CAVUTO: The $1,200 checks that a lot of folks got in the beginning of thepandemic, extension of unemployment benefits beyond just what seem to be alimited number of weeks right now, can you enlighten us? What's happeningon those fronts?CASSIDY: Yes, this is not a stimulus package. That was part of a stimuluspackage.This is a relief package. Now, it may be a stimulus package comes later. Iwill say, though, if someone's unemployed, and you have given them a $300supplemental payment a week, that money is going to be spent. So, of courseit stimulates the economy.But what we're attempting to do is bring relief to those who are ingreatest need.CAVUTO: Senator, the president's going to be in Georgia tomorrow. He isshoring up support for the Republican candidates, who are in pretty tightraces themselves for that run-off election January 5.I had your colleague Chuck Grassley here from Iowa the other day, and hewas saying he hopes the president kind of sticks to script, doesn't mentionabout the voting irregularities, some of the other stuff. He understandsthe president's upset, but this is about getting those two senators back inWashington.Do you agree with that?CASSIDY: I totally agree with that.And whether he's the president or Joe Biden's the president, you want aRepublican Senate. And that is common ground for all Republicans right now.And so I want Perdue. I want Loeffler.If you're in Georgia, go vote. Hey, vote by mail, vote on the day,whatever. Make sure that you vote for Loeffler and for Perdue.CAVUTO: Senator, as you know, the president's been very critical ofRepublican leadership in the state, going so far as to say he'sdisappointed in the governor and the secretary of state.Do you think that is helping these Republican senatorial candidates?CASSIDY: It's hard for me to say. I'm not looking at polls. I don't know ifthat's top of mind.I just went through a reelection, and most voters right now are focused onthe economy. How do you get coronavirus under control? Delta isheadquartered in Atlanta. Our bill has $17 billion to help airlines keepkind of going. And so that may be an issue.So I just find voters are focused on coronavirus and the economy and, ifthey're unemployed, on how they pay their bills, if they're a smallbusinesswoman, small businessman, how do they keep their doors open andkeep their people employed.I think that's probably more top of mind than other things.CAVUTO: Senator, do you think Joe Biden is the president-elect?CASSIDY: You know, Joe Biden -- I have spoken to this.When Michigan certified their results, he has 270 -- 270 Electoral Collegevotes. The 12th Amendment of the Constitution says that whoever has themajority of Electoral College votes is either reelected or president-elect.So, by that criteria, he would be.CAVUTO: So, when the president presses his case -- and the president-electwas asked whether the president should appear at his inauguration.He seemed to say in a CNN interview last night, that, well, it's not,personally, a matter for him. He thinks it would be good for the country.I'm really paraphrasing it, Senator, but that the president should be thereto show a peaceful change of power, a peaceful transition by being thereand for the American people to see that he's there. What do you think?CASSIDY: Yes, I agree with that.This is about our country. And we -- I voted for Donald Trump. I worked forDonald Trump. I wish he had won. And if there's evidence of widespreadfraud, and courts are convinced by it, by golly, bring it forward.On the other hand, at the end of the day, it is about our country and aboutpeaceful transition. That's what separates us from other countries. I wishto continue to be separated from those other countries.CAVUTO: Senator Bill Cassidy, very good catching up with you, the Louisianasenator, pushing for this bipartisan COVID-19 measure that could be morelikely than not, which is a big change over the last 24 to 48 hours.Thank you, Senator, very much.CASSIDY: Thanks, Neil.This has just come into our newsroom, by the way. I want to pass it along,because it does concern big pharma and all of that. Right now, the industryis filing lawsuits against the Trump administration over a drug pricingrule.The lawsuits claim that the rule would tie government drug payments tolower prices abroad. In other words, the lowest the prices are abroad, youhave to sell the drugs at the same price here. Well, the drug industry issaying that goes beyond the White House's authority, and they're suing.We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Well, remember when, during the presidential campaign, Donald Trumpwould constantly mention how he was going to slash drug prices and requirethe drug industry that oftentimes sells the exact same medications abroadfor a fraction of the price, that U.S. consumers should take advantage ofthe same price allowances, given them, that, in other words, no one couldbuy their drugs for less anywhere else but the United States.It sounded like a good plan but the industry coming up with a one-two powerresponse. Big pharma, some biotech industry groups are filing two separatelawsuits against the Trump administration over this drug pricing rule.They claim that would tie government drug payments to lower prices, andwhat they argue should be the same for everybody, that it's not realistic,in fact, that it's illegal, and that it exceeds the White House's authorityto do so essentially by executive order.I think I got the gist of it.But Andy McCarthy knows far more about the legal matters than I ever will.He joins us right now, the former assistant U.S. attorney, FOX Newscontributor.Andy, they're saying the president went too far. Legally, did he?ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You would have -- what you would haveto do, Neil, is take a hard look at what the congressional statutes arehere and how much authority they give the president.My sense of this is that this does go far -- too far on the part of theadministration. This is an issue that is, as you know, constantly debated.And on the one hand, the president has sounded almost like a Democrat attimes talking about this, using this leverage to bring the prices down.On the other hand, the big pharma guys say, if we're going to innovate andget all the advantages that we have from our system, they have to be ableto price accordingly. And, usually, this is the kind of thing that needs tobe worked out by legislation.We're at the point, in the end of the administration, where I imagine thata lot of things the president hasn't been able to get throughlegislatively, he may take a shot at doing by executive order, which willat least make it a little bit difficult to roll back in the coming months.But I don't know if this will hold up.CAVUTO: He did bring -- that is, the president -- of this startlingreality, and it was a startling rally for a lot of Americans, that the samedrugs they're taking here, you can get them a lot more cheaply abroad. Andthat did put the focus on the industry as to why it does so.Now, I talk to a lot of big pharma CEOs and the like. They say, well, it'sa different market and a different beast here, and we have to amortizethese costs out, yadda, yadda, yadda. I get that.But it did call into question whether they're fair in this. I guess youcould extend it to, why are iPhones more expensive in Japan than they arein the United States? I understand that argument as well. But is there apoint to be made about examining how companies price their products, chargeAmericans more, presumably because we're wealthier, than others becausethey're not?MCCARTHY: I think it's important, Neil, not to look at price in a vacuum,because there's a lot more that goes into it.So, for example, we may pay more, but the drugs are also more readilyavailable and more widely available in the United States. If we paid less,we might have the same restrictions on availability that you see in Europeand other parts of the world.So, I always think that, when you have something that's got a lot of movingparts to it, it's really a mistake to look at one as if it existedartificially in a vacuum. And, here, that one would be pricing. I thinkthere's more to it than that.CAVUTO: So, you're a fair and balanced attorney, besides, so that's a neatconcept.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Let me ask you this while I have you, my friend.MCCARTHY: You haven't gotten my bill yet.CAVUTO: Oh, I know. Man, oh, man, I can't afford it.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But let me ask you a little bit about this legal battle the Trumpcampaign continues to wage to change the election results.It's legally been smacked down in state after state. Where do you thinkthis is going right now?MCCARTHY: Well, Neil, we're only four days away from the federal safeharbor day, which is December 8. And what that means, as a matter offederal law, is, if the states have certified under law that existed beforethe election took place, then that's the end of the matter as far as thefederal system is concerned.And that's in there for a reason. The idea is, we need to get all of thestate disputes, whatever they are, wrapped up in an early point, so you canget whoever is going to be the president January 20 up to speed and readyto go to defend the interests of the United States beginning on January 20.So, the election is very important. But to repeat what I just said in adifferent context. It's not the only thing that's important. It doesn'texist in a vacuum.CAVUTO: Got it.And it's got to compete with the other interests we have of getting a newpresident up and running and ready to go.CAVUTO: Andy, you ought to stick with this law thing. You seem to knowquite a bit about it.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: So, thank you very much, my friend, in guiding me through thesetwin developments.Andy McCarthy, no matter what you throw at him, no matter when you throwit, he's ready to catch it and throw it right back at you.All right, we are live tomorrow, remember, with the secretary of state ofGeorgia, as the president prepares for a big arrival there, presumably tohelp those two Senate candidates.
