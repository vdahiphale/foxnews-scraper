NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  We are moments away from seeing Donald Trumpimpeached yet again in the House of Representatives.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.Two hundred and seventeen votes, that's what's needed to approve aresolution that calls this an incitement of insurrection, a single chargeagainst the president of the United States that he gravely endangered thesecurity of the United States and its institutions of government, ofcourse, referring to the rate on the Washington Capitol just one week ago.We already know of at least a half-dozen Republican congress men and womenwho are going to be part of that, including Liz Cheney, who arguedforcefully for the president's impeachment here, saying that this wentbeyond the pale, paraphrasing here, and that the situation around thisrequires that he immediately be leaving office.Again, given the fact that there are 433 members there -- two are not there-- you need 217 votes to make it pass. The votes are easily there. Where itgoes after this is anyone's guess.While Mitch McConnell has left open the possibility of voting to convictthe president of the United States, he has urged Republican members thathe's not made up his mind on the matter. He has reportedly made up his mindon the timing of all of this, and that the Senate won't even be taking thisup until at least January 19.Let's get the read right now on where this particular part stands with MikeEmanuel with the latest from Washington.Hey, Michael.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, Goodafternoon.The debate is over. All we are waiting for is the final vote count, HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi making the case President Trump must go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  The president must be impeached. And I believethe president must be convicted by the Senate, a constitutional remedy thatwill ensure that the republic will be safe from this man who is soresolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, criticized PresidentTrump, but stopped short of impeachment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  The president bears responsibility forWednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediatelydenounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.These facts require immediate action by President Trump. Accept his shareresponsibility.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  Other Republicans say this taking place exactly one week afterthe Capitol riot means it's being rushed and is unfair.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  If it continues, it won't just be Republicans whoget canceled. It won't just be the president of the United States. Thecancel culture will come for us all.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  At least seven Republicans are in favor. We await the final votecount. Democrats are expected to have the votes to pass this impeachmentarticle for incitement of insurrection.Their tone is serious.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX):  Today, we not only demand accountability forhis gross misconduct, but, more importantly, we declare to the next Trump-like aspiring tyrant, not in America. We love our democracy too much.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  And Steny Hoyer saying today he plans to send that article ofimpeachment over to the Senate. He would like to send it as soon aspossible.Timing for action in terms of a Senate trial is unclear. Majority LeaderMitch McConnell says he is not planning to bring the Senate back beforenext week -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Mike Emanuel, thank you very much.Bret Baier joining me right now.Bret, if he holds true to that timetable, that is, Mitch McConnell,impeaching the president in the Senate would obviously be a Herculean timeleap, but what are you hearing?BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Yes, I think that's right, Neil.Good afternoon. In the House, Nancy Pelosi will cobble together the votes,with some Republicans. We don't know yet how many Republicans. But rememberthat the magic number is 217. So, once they reach that number, we will beable to say that the House has the votes to impeach President Trump for thesecond time, the first president to face that.In the Senate, you're right. It's a lot of question about process andtiming and whether this is a fair process. Critics are calling it a snapimpeachment, without due process for the president, without committeehearings, without witnesses, without an effort to defend himself, thepresident of the United States.And supporters of it are saying that his actions were so egregious thatthey need to do this before he leaves office, or even after, some say. Idon't think the votes are going to be there, Neil, but the Mitch McConnellback-and-forth has been interesting to watch.CAVUTO:  Yes, I caught some of the things he had said to CBS News, I guess,Bret, and maybe others, where he held open the possibility that he mightconvict, or that he tried to clarify to Republican members that wasn't hisintention. He just wants to see how this all lays out and then make adecision later.But regardless of the timing of a Senate move to take this up, if one evenavails itself, there's obviously a sign that, if there ever was a bloom onthe rose, it's gone now between Mitch McConnell and the president of theUnited States. What do you think?BAIER:  One hundred percent.And he's telling privately people that he's extremely angry with thepresident, that the president has put Republicans broadly in this boat. Andafter Wednesday, what happened on Capitol Hill, there's a lot of anger andefforts to figure out how to go forward, not only as a party, but as acountry.And I think you're seeing a lot of that on the floor of the House, andyou're seeing a lot of it in backrooms in the Senate.Neil, I don't think they're going to have the votes. Remember, you have tohave the requisite votes to impeach, and then to try and convict. That's abig mountain, even if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is one ofthose votes.CAVUTO:  You know, I'm just curious.There's this effort. A lot of people said part of speeding this effort,trying to see the president get impeached in the Senate would be to cementforbidding him from ever running for office again.Do you know, Bret, that, barring that, that it doesn't get to the Senate orit's rejected the Senate -- I would think you need 17 Republican senatorsto go along -- that the president could run for office again?BAIER:  He could.I mean, in the current -- if the Senate does not convict, there is nothingto prevent him again from running. And there is some behind the scenes thatsome Republicans are hoping to do that.There's a balance here. There are some people saying, we just want this --that, from Wednesday, all of the power that he's lost, and it was reallydevastating, not only for the Trump political machine, but also for a lotof supporters who were in the middle and voted for the president.They were disappointed. The biggest emotion was sadness. But could he cometogether and run again in 2024? It's possible if they don't convict him.CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, Bret, that the president remains a force withinthe Republican Party? He might not Garner the 74 or 75 million votes he didin the electorate a couple of months ago, but he certainly has a formidablelock on a strong plurality of Republican voters, or is that toosignificantly waning?BAIER:  I think it took a major hit, a major hit last Wednesday. Andwhether -- what percentage of the 74 million are still in the president'scorner, I don't know.But it really took a major dive, I think. And how he has dismounted herehas raised the question of how powerful he is.But think about the other side, which is an impeachment that's called asnap impeachment by critics, social media that shuts down his ability tocommunicate on social media, and then suddenly there is this whip-back of,he has become a political martyr of sorts to some people.And that is the balance, the calculation that Republicans are making up onCapitol Hill.CAVUTO:  All right, they have exhausted the time remaining. And do theyreset the clock, then, essentially, Bret, so that the vote can continue?We're obviously shy of the number needed to make this happen. But is thissort of one of those...BAIER:  Right.CAVUTO:  ... just administrative details they tend to and reset it?BAIER:  Yes, the clock is never the clock on Capitol Hill.CAVUTO:  Yes.BAIER:  It's just a thing that runs to zero until they get the votes.There are people coming in. COVID makes it a little bit different, Neil, inthat they have to...CAVUTO:  Right. Right.BAIER:  ... come in, in different waves.Again, 217 is the number. And you see "the not yet voted" 137. So you havea lot of people yet to vote. Probably around, I'd say, 4:30, we would getto about the number.But you see 149 for the positives on this resolution.CAVUTO:  Now, we know that there could be a half-a-dozen Republicans thatwould be on board, as it's indicating right now. It could be more. There'stalk that that could lead or encourage still more Republicans to followsuit, but this would be a bipartisan impeachment effort in the House,lopsided though it may be.But that is how it's going to be signaled, as different from the lastimpeachment vote, certainly in the House, 13 months ago. How is that goingto be impacted?BAIER:  Well, that's significant.And I do think Liz Cheney's statement her decision to vote for impeachmentchanged the dynamic for some Republicans. And while you say it's six rightnow, I think you could be heading towards 10. I'm not sure.I have talked to some Republicans that it's 20, but still significant, inthat the first impeachment didn't have any. So there is a distinctionbetween those two. And, really, the question is how it goes forward, if itgoes forward in the Senate.The other thing to consider here, Neil, is that the Senate -- the Bidenadministration wants to get on the right foot with the Senate, and theywant to push, ideally, stimulus and COVID through the Senate as fast asthey can.How this cobbles that together and screws up the time frame also factorsinto all this.CAVUTO:  Finally, one last question.I mean, it seemed like, as you indicated, that even to get to a vote in theSenate, regardless of the number of Republicans who might, in fact, vote --Lisa Murkowski comes to mind, Ben Sasse comes to mind, even MitchMcConnell, possibly -- but leaving that aside, this idea of holding it off100 days, so that Joe Biden would have a chance to do what he's got to do,I can't even imagine the Joe Biden would welcome that.BAIER:  No.I mean, at that point, to go back to a president who's already left office,to convict him, it's tough to connect those dots politically, let alone thesubstance of it.And, remember, I mean, this isn't impeachment that does not have thetraditional setup.CAVUTO:  Right.BAIER:  So, you would get criticized from the beginning.I think it's going to be a tough -- a tough road.CAVUTO:  Bret Baier, thank you very, very much, my friend. We will bemonitoring your coverage of all of this tonight.But this is where we stand right now, as Bret said, this vote that wouldrequire 217 congress men and women to, for the second time in little morethan 13 months, impeach the president of the United States, this on asingle article of impeachment, an incitement of insurrection, specificallysaying that the president gravely endangered the security of the UnitedStates and its institutions of government.Nancy Mace joining us right now, the South Carolina Republican. It was herfirst time arriving in Washington, D.C. And, boy, what a welcome, with allthat craziness over the last week.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Congresswoman, you were not a fan of this impeachment move.REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  Right.CAVUTO:  But you were for some sort of action against the president.I don't know whether that would be censuring him or what, but could youupdate me?MACE:  Right.In the House of Representatives, I gave my first floor speech today. It wasnot my intention to do a floor speech in my first week as a member ofCongress. But the House of Representatives does have every right to impeachthe president.But the way that they're going about it today, the lack of due process,bypassing the Judiciary, and doing articles of impeachment in a few hoursof debate on the floor in one day, is -- is reckless, and it isunconstitutional.And it puts due process really at risk. There was a bicameral, bipartisaneffort in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House to look at censure as anoption. That would prevent the president from holding office again, andwould condemn him for what happened last week.But, unfortunately, because impeachment was politicized, largely by SpeakerPelosi, she wouldn't allow censure to come up for a vote or a debate oreven have that as an option.So, that just wasn't simply an option. But I do know there were Democratsand Republicans that were working very hard this week to try and make thathappen.But, unfortunately, impeachment was the only option. And with impeachment,articles of impeachment, they only get to the U.S. Senate until January 19.And Biden is sworn in on the 20th.And, from my understanding, I read this morning that, if the president isnot an office, then there cannot be an impeachment trial. So, then what isall of this effort for? Is it moot at the end of the day?CAVUTO:  Congresswoman, do you believe the president incited that crowd aweek ago, that, if he had not done that, it wouldn't have turned into thetragedy it ultimately did?MACE:  I do hold him responsible for much of what happened last Wednesday.I also believe that there were members in Congress, members of my ownparty, who also contributed to it. If you look at the rhetoric, thetranscripts, the speeches of the rallies even leading up to that, Ipersonally was concerned that Sunday nightI had my kids up there with me for my swearing-in. And because of virtualschool, because of COVID, they were supposed to be out there all week forme -- with me.But because of the rhetoric I was seeing, the way things were being talkedabout online, I was worried about violence days beforehand. And I put mykids on the first plane home on Monday morning. And thank God I did,because I would be beside myself if they witnessed what I witnessed onWednesday.And rhetoric does have consequences. And I do believe people do need to beheld accountable. And, unfortunately, it was a sad day in America. And thisis another sad day today.CAVUTO:  Congresswoman, do believe the president has a future in theRepublican Party?MACE:  I do not.I don't know how you go forward and defend the indefensible. What happenedlast week was a national tragedy. People violently attacked the halls ofCongress, our United States Capitol. And I believe that everyaccomplishment that Republicans and the president had -- and I was a bigsupporter of the president over the last four years and worked for him onhis campaign -- but I believe that those accomplishments were wiped out.We had a great economy pre-COVID. We had low -- low tax rates. We hadOperation Warp Speed during the pandemic, so many enormous gains. I thinkthat the principles and ideas that he espoused are things we're going tohave to champion in the future, but without -- without his support, hisbrand or his name. It's tarnished.I don't know how you -- I don't know how you defend what happened lastweek, by any means.CAVUTO:  Congresswoman, I know you're new, and talk about a baptism byfire.MACE:  Right.CAVUTO:  You have been very brave throughout all, in how scary it was,certainly with your little girls and all.But I'm curious...MACE:  Right.CAVUTO:  ... about your intentions next week for the Joe Bideninauguration. I assume you plan to attend. But are you anxious? Are youworried?MACE:  I am.And, originally -- and I said a couple of days ago I was intent onattending. But I have heard there's chatter on something happening onJanuary 17, and there's potential violence on the 20th.I'm not sure I am going to attend now, because it's just -- it's a sad daywhen you have to worry about your safety to go to an event or to go towork, that -- what might happen.And last week was a real wakeup call for us. And part of my speech on thefloor today was talking about not just the violence we saw last week, butviolence we have seen all across the country for the last nine months.Rhetoric by Republicans and Democrats, by the fringes of the far right andthe far left have contributed to the division, the divisiveness we have inthis country.And I asked my colleagues today to take a step back, take a deep breath,one, acknowledge that we have a problem in this country, two, takeresponsibility for it. It's all on us to do that. And, three, stop beingpart of the problem and start being part of the solution.And I have a real problem with both -- fringes on both sides. I have a realproblem with QAnon conspiracy theorists leading us through this crisis. Tome, it's indefensible.And I want to be part of the solution moving forward. And I intend to dothat in the days, weeks and months ahead.CAVUTO:  Congresswoman, thank you so much, Nancy Mace, the South Carolinanewly elected Republican congresswoman.I'm sure she did not have this in her planning for arriving in Washington,D.C., but she handled it very calmly, very adroitly.With us now, James Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat. He's the Housemajority whip.Congressman, good to see you.This might not go anywhere after the House. Does that concern you,Congressman?REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  Thank you very much for having me again.No, not the least bit. We're doing our jobs here in the House ofRepresentatives. It is our job to impeach. And once the impeachment isdone, it's up to the Senate to decide whether or not to convict.Now, if you recall, when we were here the last time with an impeachment,please remember the closing comments made by Adam Schiff, when he says, ifyou don't convict this man, we will be -- he will not stop. He willcontinue to do what he's been doing all of his life.And here we are back to another impeachment, because he continued to dowhat he's always done. And what he did last week was the worst thing anythe president of these United States ever -- has ever done. To that, hedeserved to be impeached. and, quite frankly, he should be convicted andforever barred from holding any office of honor in this country for therest of his life.CAVUTO:  Well, the only way I guess that could happen, sir, is if theSenate were to take up this measure. It wouldn't look like it would happenso soon, before the inauguration, when they come back.So, I know another idea has been pushed. And I think you're for this,visiting it 100 days into the Biden administration. But that would be goingafter a former president at that point. Are you still for that?CLYBURN:  We won't be going after him. The impeachment still stands. TheSenate can take it up whenever they want to take it up.But there's also another option here. It's resting in the 14th Amendment.CAVUTO:  Well, do you understand, sir -- I'm sorry.Do you know whether Chuck Schumer, who will be the Senate leader, wouldindeed support that move to take this up, again, if the Senate doesn't actnow, before the inauguration -- that seems unlikely -- to take it up in theBiden administration?CLYBURN:  I have no idea what he will do. But, as I said, I'm not too sureit's up to Schumer if we were to take the 14th Amendment route.And I would have to say, I always equate the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendmentswith the institution of slavery and its aftermath. And it's kind ofinteresting that we are dealing with that here, after a group of peopledescended upon this Capitol, fanning the flames of racism.That's what was going on, on last Wednesday. And that's what's been goingon with this president for a long time. It would be good to use the 14thAmendment to bar him from office.CAVUTO:  So, you played a very key role, in fact, I think you wereinstrumental in making Joe Biden the president of the United States. Yoursupport in South Carolina turned everything around. I think it's fair tosay you were a kingmaker there, still are.So, when you hear from Biden people, sir, who wonder that this fixation onthen impeachment, if it goes into the Biden administration, might rob himof getting his agenda through, doing the things that he wants to do, whatdo you say to them?CLYBURN:  I would say that's a good concern to have, because I have thesame concern.But you have to prioritize things. And I think the priority here is thepreservation of this democracy. This democracy is worth saving. And I thinkI have said here on your show that this country is a great country. It'snot in need of being made great.I would like for somebody to tell me, when is it that the country was ever-- has ever been anything but great? It was great enough to get beyond theinstitution of slavery, great enough to get beyond Jim Crow, great enoughto make it possible for people like me to be a part of this government,after such an inhumane condition of 244 years called slavery.And that's what we have been trying to do. But there seem to be some peoplewho would like to turn this clock back to relive some of that stuff.And when I hear some of the speeches being made, and when I hear a formermayor of the biggest city in this country saying let's have trial bycombat, when I hear a member of this House using all kinds of profanelanguage, egging people on to come up here and to participate in aninsurrection, when the president of the United States...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Congressman, I don't mean to interrupt you, sir. I don't mean tointerrupt you, sir.But the president has formally been impeached in the House ofRepresentatives; 217 votes was what you needed. He's now -- they havegotten that much, at the very least, and a number of votes to come,including talk that we could get anywhere from a half-dozen to, when all issaid and done, maybe up to 10 to 12 Republicans.Your thoughts on the number of Republicans who are part of this and agreewith this, Congressman?CLYBURN:  Well, as I look at the board, it's now nine Republicans out ofthe 222.I have been saying between five and 10. I have got a staffer that tells meit's going to get beyond 10. And I'm going to see if he has to buy me anice cream cone.(LAUGHTER)CLYBURN:  Well, it's now at 10.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Finally, the president today put out a statement...CLYBURN:  I may have to buy him two ice cream cones.CAVUTO:  ... denouncing violence, doesn't want to see violence, doesn'twant to see any problems for the inauguration.What do you think of those remarks to sort of tamp things down?CLYBURN:  Well, I don't think anybody takes this president's remarksseriously.He has not said anything in the last several weeks, that -- anything akinto the truth. And he's very seldom told the truth since he's been inoffice. So, I don't pay any attention to what the president says.CAVUTO:  Finally, I just spoke to your newly elected and sworn-inRepublican Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who isn't quite sure she's going to goto the inauguration next week. It wasn't a political statement, as much asa safety one. She's concerned.Are you, I assume, going? But do you hear a lot of talk like that fromcongress men and women, senators who are leery and worried about how safeit's going to be in the Capitol next week? Do you share their concern?CLYBURN:  Yes, I do.I have talked to a lot of members over the last several days. And withinthe last 24 hours, I have seen a reversal in their attitudes. Members arenow very, very apprehensive about next week.I'm going to be spending sometime this weekend. As you know, I hold anhonorary position as chair of the Inaugural Committee. I'm not making thehard-and-fast decisions as to what should or should not be done.I am offering my suggestions. I am encouraging all of my constituents tostay at home and watch it on television. They had a pretty good experiencewith our national convention. I think they're going to have the same kindof experience watching this inauguration on television.So, I have been discouraging people from coming to Washington. The mayor ofWashington have asked them not to come. I think that what we ought to do isstay in the safety of our homes because of COVID-19 and because ofimpending dangers, because so much of this surrounds the celebration ofMartin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, which is on Monday.So, you hear them saying they're going to be here on the 17th and come backon the 20th. I think a lot of this has to do with the symbolism of theweekend that we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.CAVUTO:  Finally, sir, the president, as you know, will not be at JoeBiden's inauguration. We don't know where he will be or what he will bedoing. What do you think of that?CLYBURN:  Well, I think that that is indicative of who and what thispresident has been since he's been in office.He has very little respect for the noble traditions that have kept thiscountry together. If you just think about what we were doing lastWednesday, we were really formalizing an effort to get beyond an election.As you know, these elections are certified in the states and the oneterritory of Puerto Rico, and they come up here in mahogany boxes. We gothrough a ceremony on the floor of the House of Representatives. It'sbasically ceremonial. We're actually counting up the votes from each state.They have already been tallied at the state levels.And then what we try to do is say, this is an effort of letting the wholeworld see what the transfer of power look like. Look, Al Gore had just losta very contentious election, but, as vice president and president of theSenate, he stood on that floor, he did the transfer of power in one of theclosest elections ever in the history of this country, lose about 580-and-some-odd votes,Here's a guy that loses by seven million votes, and he wants to overturnthe traditional process.Al Gore was a classic -- a class guy back in 2000. It's a pity we don'thave that in this president.CAVUTO:  You curious at all, one little bit, where Donald Trump is going tobe on January 20, where he's going to go, what he's going to do?CLYBURN:  I have absolutely no idea where he's going to go. I suspect hedoesn't have an idea either.CAVUTO:  Congressman, thank you very, very much, James Clyburn, the Housemajority whip.CLYBURN:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  Very good seeing you again, sir, on this historic day.For those of you who are just tuning in here, you can see those numbers,more than enough right now for the House of Representatives, for the secondtime in 13 months, to impeach President Donald J. Trump on a singular countof inciting insurrection and violence in the nation's Capitol.Chad Pergram on what happens now -- Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, good afternoon,Neil.This House vote is still open, but they're going to close it any minutehere. So far, 10 Republicans have cast their ballots in favor of impeachingthe president of the United States. For the first time in history, Neil,the House of Representatives has impeached a president of the United Statestwice.For only, the second time, the House has impeached the same governmentfigure twice. For President Trump, the House has now impeached him twice in13 months. There have been 21 successful impeachments in House history, andtwo of them are of Donald John Trump, the president of the United States.That's where we stand with history.Now what happens in the next couple of days? The House of Representativeshas to pass some sort of a resolution to send over the articles ofimpeachment to trigger the Senate trial. You might remember, in late 2019and early 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held the ball. She did not sendover those articles of impeachment for 28 days.Now, just a couple of moments ago on the House floor, the impeachmentmanagers, the prosecutors essentially who Nancy Pelosi has tapped topresident the House's case on this article of impeachment in the Senate,they all met on the floor. She's already named them. She announced themlast night. And they are formally set up to present that case.But we don't know what the situation is, whether or not the Senate -- theyhave special authority where, under emergencies, they can come back intosession. And if that's the case, if the House, in fact, votes to send overthat article of impeachment, then you have to probably start right away.January 15 last year is when the House voted to send the article ofimpeachment across to the Senate. They started the Senate trial the nextday. That's where you formally president the articles of impeachment beforethe Senate. The impeachment managers are there. People are sworn in, andthen you get going a couple -- a day or two or two later here.We don't know if that will be the case, if they can work out a deal.There's some people saying, well, can you continue with an impeachmenttrial after President Trump leaves office?Yes, there is precedent for that. You had that with William Belknap, whowas the secretary of war in 1876, who was impeached, and was in factacquitted, even though he had resigned, in his Senate trial.You had this happen with the very first impeachment, the only other personother than President Trump who's been impeached twice. This was WilliamBlount, who was a senator from Tennessee, in the 1790s. And he had left theSenate, but they still went ahead and at least had a Senate trial in hisinstance there.So, this is up in the air and which side you want to do this on. Just thisafternoon, a couple of hours ago here, Mitch McConnell, for now, the Senatemajority leader has indicated that he would not announce whether he wouldvote to convict President Trump, but there have been intimations fromMcConnell that he is open to all of this.He is very displeased with the president. He believes that the presidentcost Republicans the Senate. He is very upset at what happened up here tothe legislative branch, and he, as the majority leader, is kind of one ofthe guardians of this branch of government.He thinks that maybe the president, this was a bridge too far. And so heseems to be open to that process. But keep in mind that it takes two-thirds, a supermajority, to convict.Now, earlier, I know you were talking with Bret Baier about what couldhappen to President Trump later. You have to pass some sort of a resolutionoften after you have convicted somebody in the Senate to make sure thatthey don't hold public office. It talks about this in the Constitution.It's there.But I will give you an example where they didn't do kind of this auxiliarymotion in the Senate, in the case of Alcee Hastings, the Democraticcongressman from Florida. That tells you enough right there. He has been amember of the House of Representatives since 1993.He was impeached and convicted and removed from the federal judge as a --in an impeachment trial in the Senate in 1989. They didn't do thatsecondary resolution. And that's why Alcee Hastings is a member of theHouse of Representatives and has been for almost 30 years now. So, that'ssomething to look at.But, again, you know, what the mechanics are here, can they actually startthis, is it beneficial for Democrats to start this process right now? Is itbetter to wait until they have the majority, once you have sworn in thesetwo new senators from Georgia, and you have Vice President Harris on boardhere, and you technically have 51?Is this machination between Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader fornow, and Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is this part of them may betrying to work out some sort of a power-sharing agreement? You're going tohave a 50/50 Senate. Nowhere is it written down that just because it's50/50 that the party with the vice president has the majority.And what you had had happen 20 years ago, when there was a 50/50 Senatebetween the Republicans and the Democrats, Tom Daschle, the Democraticleader, Trent Lott, the Republican leader, they worked out a power-sharingagreement where you had -- Trent Lott was basically the majority leader,but Tom Daschle had some rights. You had a 50/50 Senate there.That has to be approved. Could that be part of this?And let's just say they agreed to say, OK, let's go ahead, let's haveemergency authority, let's start this trial. Under the Senate rules -- andwe saw this happen with the Senate rules in the impeachment trial last timearound -- you meet every day, except Sunday, at 1:00.The chief justice presides. There's some question whether or not thiscontinues past when President Trump's term, whether or not John Roberts,the chief justice of the United States, would preside. We have had thepresident pro tem, the most senior member of the majority party, presideover other impeachment trials of lower figures.We had that with a couple of federal judges in 2009 and 2010. So there aresome tremendous questions right now about how they proceed. But make noteof this. There were 10 Republicans who so far have voted for impeachmenthere.I was told that it was going to be somewhere between about five andprobably 20. So we're somewhere in the middle here. We have had a couple ofmembers come on board that we didn't know last night. Peter Meijer, who isa Republican freshmen from Michigan, has voted to impeach. You also hadAnthony Gonzalez, Republican congressman from Ohio, who voted to impeach.Those are some of the new ones today, Dan Newhouse from Washington state.So that kind of tells you that this is a bipartisan impeachment -- Neil.CAVUTO:  So, if it ever did get to the Senate -- and that's an uphillclimb, I get that -- I could see a Lisa Murkowski voting for impeachment, aMitt Romney, a Ben Sasse, maybe a Mitch McConnell?And he's -- if you buy by some of these reports of conversations he's hadthat he supported what the Democrats are doing in the House, but you wouldstill need about 13 more. Is that doable?PERGRAM:  That's right.Neil, let me just interrupt you for one second. I will answer yourquestion.But it sounds like they're just about to close the vote. Nancy Pelosi is inthe chair here, and she's going to announce the vote total. She's justasking right now if there's anybody else who wants to vote here, so, rightnow, 231 yeas, 197 nays, five members have not voted.And remember that they can vote by proxy. So let's listen here for aminute.CAVUTO:  Just to let you know, the vote is now final; 231 U.S. congress menand women have voted to impeach the president of the United States. Thatincludes 10 Republicans.That number was going up throughout the day, and a bigger margin that didnot go strictly along party lines, as it did in the House 13 months ago.They're calling this over now. As this now moves to the United StatesSenate, the timing is the issue here.Mitch McConnell has already indicated that it is probably unrealistic forthe time being to get them to move before the 19th, the day before theState of the Union. Let's listen.PELOSI:  On this vote, the ayes are 232, the nays are 197. The resolutionis adopted. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon thetable.CAVUTO:  All right, back to Chad Pergram.There you have it, and the House voting to impeach the president of theUnited States for the second time in little more than a year.I was mentioning about the next stop, the Senate, if that ever gets thatfar, Chad. Even allowing for the possibility that they can meet and dosomething, how many Republicans would likely vote to impeach the president?They need about 17.Would they get close to getting there?PERGRAM:  Right.And this is reflective of the fractured nature of the Republican Party.There are some members, obviously, on the Republican side who would like toconvict him. There are others who believe that Donald Trump still has somejuice in the Republican Party.They have been reluctant to get crossways with him, despite what happenedwith this melee here at the Capitol the other day. We're seeing some ofthat moving right now. There are some who believe that going down this roadwith a trial in the Senate for President Trump, that this kind ofmartyrizes him. That's something that some Republicans want to try toavoid.So, these are the types of conversations that Mitch McConnell has to have.Mitch McConnell has been known very well for keeping his conferencetogether. You started to see attrition that on the COVID bill, when thepresident initially balked at signing the coronavirus bill and said, wait aminute, I'm not going to sign it unless you add $2,000 checks to that.So, you had Republicans all over the map on that. There certainly has beenattrition in support for the president naturally, because his term iscoming to an end. Number two, there are many Republicans in this buildingright now who are apoplectic at the president over his conduct last week,and just how malignant that was, and what happened to the legislativebranch of government.So, that is a bit of a moving target. People don't really know what's goingto happen there. And, again, as you say, it's two-thirds. It is a high,high bar.Now, Neil, as I'm listening here, I'm listening to Betty McCollum, theDemocrat from Minnesota, who presided over the debate. As far as I couldtell, they did not approve that other resolution. So, what that means isthat we're in a very similar position here where, at least for now, theyare holding the ball.So, the 15th is when the House of Representatives comes back. We don't seeany indication that they would send this directly over. Again, we haveasked aides and people all over the building for a couple of days what theprocess is here, because we have only done this now 21 times in Americanhistory. It doesn't always work out the same way.And we don't have any indication that they passed that separate resolutionto trigger the trial. So, if they just went out of session, that tells methat Nancy Pelosi is holding the ball.After President Clinton was impeached in late 1998, about 10 minutes afterthe impeachment vote, there were two articles of impeachment that he was --that they voted out of the four. There were four total articles ofimpeachment with President Clinton. And they approved two.They approved that second resolution and sent it over to the Senate about10 minutes later, and it included who the impeachment managers were. Youhad Henry Hyde, who was the top manager for that Senate trial.You also had -- Lindsey Graham was a Republican congressman in those days,and he was one of the impeachment managers for that. But we know who thoseimpeachment managers will be. Jamie Raskin will lead the charge this time.It was Adam Schiff last year.And, Neil, regardless, here's the other thing. This is where I was talkingabout Schumer and McConnell getting together and trading horses. Whathappened in the Clinton trial in 1999, again, Lott and Daschle got togetherand worked out an agreement that was approved by the Senate to set up theparameters as to how they were going to handle the trial, how much time,how much time that the prosecution, the House managers would have, thedefense, the president's counsel, what the conditions would be forwitnesses, if they ever got to that stage.They didn't really have a similar ground framework back in about a year'stime ago here. So, that is very important, that you get to some sort of anagreement. And if you don't, then those Senate rules kind of apply, thoseSenate impeachment rules, which they updated in the mid-1980s.CAVUTO:  All right, amazing, Chad. Your mastery of detail was stunning,Chad Pergram, again, talking about the historic nature of this and whathappens now, a separate resolution to begin sort of the trial particularsto go to the United States Senate.That's a whole 'nother can of worms here. As it stands right now, while theU.S. Senate would be the next stop regardless, it's a timing issue. And wehave already heard that the Senate majority leader for the time being,Mitch McConnell, has rejected this emergency session, in other words,bringing the Senate back earlier than the planned returned on January 19,the day before the inauguration, that, because of that, it seems unlikelythat action could be taken in the Senate.There's a separate effort to see, well, maybe, in a Biden administration,with a Democratic Senate, could they take this up then, and therein anaction against a former president? There is precedent for this sort ofthing when it comes to senators and judges. It's never been tried with aU.S. president, in this case, a former U.S. president.Let's go to Tom Dupree, the former deputy assistant attorney general.Tom, so many legal possibilities here. But assuming that things stand asthey are, that the Senate will not have an emergency early session or takethis up any time before the 19th, at a minimum, where's all this going?TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, I suspect that thisis going to be question number one for the new Biden administration and forthe new Senate that comes into office.They are going to have to decide whether they want to move ahead with atrial on the impeached former president and, if so, whether it's going tobe something that will dominate the agenda for the first few weeks of thenew Biden administration, or if they will try two-track it.So they might in the morning have a trial of the former President Trumpand, in the afternoon, address new Biden Cabinet appointees. But itdefinitely throws a curveball into the works. And I suspect that we'regoing to hear a lot of debate in the days ahead about whether the Senateeven should take up this resolution.CAVUTO:  The other issue then becomes taking it up against a formerpresident, Donald Trump, and whether there would be much appetite for that,allowing for the possibility, as I even raised with Jim Clyburn, a closeBiden confidant, that, yes, it could muck up his 100-day action agenda ashe takes office.But it could happen. What would have to happen?DUPREE:  Well, I think what would have to happen is, first, the Senate orthe Senate leadership would have to get comfortable with the idea ofcontinuing these proceedings against a former official.There is precedent in our nation's history for doing it, although it's notsomething that's ever been sorted out definitively one way or another bythe courts. The next thing they would have to do is, will this approximatea trial?We have seen that before. We saw that in the prior impeachment of PresidentTrump. We saw that in the Clinton impeachment, where you actually haveevidence, you have prosecutors presenting a case, because, if they do that,I suspect that will consume days and days of Senate time in order for theSenate to reach its ultimate verdict.CAVUTO:  So, let me just ask you a couple of just general legal questionshere.It would take a Senate impeachment to prevent Donald Trump from everrunning for office again. So, as things stand out, this is the final stop.And this is as far as it gets. He technically could run for office again,right?I left him -- just no, no.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  We had a video problem there. But, again, that is the issue.You hear a lot of talk back and forth about, what is more likely here andwhat is the environment that would warrant taking the president out ofrunning for any office ever again? And it does seem to be found andconvicted in the United States Senate.I think Tom is back with us.Tom, what do you think?DUPREE:  I was saying that, if they elect to move ahead with a trial, theonly possible consequence for former President Trump would bedisqualification for holding future office.Obviously, removal would be a moot point at that stage. So, they reallywould just be holding the trial for purposes of disqualifying him fromholding office in the future.CAVUTO:  So, let me just be clear. One last thing, Tom. The -- we're goingto uncharted waters here, at least regarding a U.S. president or a formerpresident by that time.But it does raise a lot about what actions you could take against a formerpresident and how long it would take to go after a former president, to saynothing of how each side sets up their legal teams and what have you. Iwould imagine that would last a while.Now, I know I heard from Clyburn, the House majority whip, saying, look, wecan, that old line, walk and chew gum at the same time. But the history ofCongress is oftentimes, no, they can't.So, I'm just wondering if this becomes all impeachment all the time, andnot in Joe Biden's interests.DUPREE:  I think impeachment does have a tendency to become all-consuming.I suppose they could try to do impeachment in the morning and confirmationof Biden officials in the afternoon. But that's a very tall order.CAVUTO:  No way.DUPREE:  And, look, you're right.The way these impeachment trials work in the Senate is, they are like atrial procedure. You have prosecutor. You have evidence. You often havetestimony. It's not something that you can really just do for an hour ortwo a day. You need focused, lengthy amounts of time to hear the case andmake an informed decision.So, although it's possible to walk and chew gum at the same time, I think,in this case, it would be a real challenge.CAVUTO:  Are you surprised -- and maybe -- this is maybe a more politicalquestion, so you don't have to take this, Tom -- but that so manyRepublicans were on board?Because leadership was not giving them any guidance, more or less saying,vote as you feel. And that seemed to be some of the signals Mitch McConnellwas sending to Republicans in the Senate, commending what the House wasdoing and Democrats were doing, not necessarily indicating he supports it,but was fine with it, that they raised a number of very good, solid issues.He has sent out reminders to Republicans he has not made up his mind onthis, but he seemed to signal, if it ever got to them -- and this is metaking the leap here -- he's not telling him to vote for or againstsomething, that it's their call.What do you think?DUPREE:  That's exactly right, Neil.And, no, I'm not surprised at all. I think the reason for the Republicanvotes that we have seen so far are attributable to two things. One is thefact that leadership has not sent a strong message that they need to fallinto line behind the president here.We have seen, in other cases, for instance, with Supreme Court vacancies,when Leader McConnell gets out in front the moment news breaks, signalingto his people how he wants them to vote and to make public statements. Hehasn't done that here. He's left people to vote as they see fit.The second thing is, I have gotten a strong sense from public statementsand from talking to people both in the House and the Senate, a lot ofRepublicans are incredibly inflamed by what unfolded last Wednesday. Theysaw it as an assault on the citadel of our democracy. They take itpersonally. And they have very strong feelings.So, even if leadership were to tell them to vote one way, this is a casewhere I think a lot of people are going to be voting their conscience.CAVUTO:  Yes, there's a lot of anger the U.S. Senate, to your point, Tom.I think, as one senator was telling me, because of the president and hisactions, particularly in Georgia, and questioning the vote again and againand again, he grabbed defeat from the jaws of otherwise easy victory.We shall see.Tom Dupree, thank you very, very much. Sorry for the technicaldifficulties.I want to go to John Roberts at the White House.John, any response as yet from the president to this?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we had awritten statement earlier today. And I will get to that in just a second.Right now, the president is in the throes of trying to put together a videomessage that the White House will put out on some platform that will hostit. There aren't a whole lot of those left, but the president earlier todaytrying to de-escalate the situation, particularly given the fact that theFBI says that there are violent protests, armed protests that are plannedfor all 50 state capitols some time between now and Inauguration Day.The president, in a statement earlier today, saying -- quote -- "In lightof reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be no violence,no lawbreaking, and no vandalism of any kind. This is not what I stand for,and it is not what America stands for. I call on all Americans to help easetensions and calm tempers. Thank you."The president is hoping to get that statement and whatever video statementthat he puts out hosted on some of the big social media platforms, likeTwitter, like Facebook, like Instagram, all of which have banned him rightnow.An adviser to the president's telling FOX News' Brooke Singman,FOXNews.com, Brooke Singman -- quote -- "President Trump is asking allAmericans to join with him in ensuring that there is an orderly andpeaceful transition next week. President Trump is also asking that the bigtech companies join with him in this effort."And the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, putting out her own statementearlier this afternoon, saying -- quote -- "Violence has no place inpolitics, period. Let me be clear. Anyone who has malicious intent is notwelcome in Washington, D.C., or in any other state capitol. The peacefultransition of power is one of our nation's founding principles that isnecessary for our country to move forward."Now, the president has been impeached for a second time. That's historic.He becomes the first president in American history to carry with him thatparticular designation.Now the attention turns toward whether or not, Neil, there will be a trialin the Senate. I am told that the president's aides have reached out topossible outside counsel. It's highly likely that the team who supportedhim the first time around, including Pat Cipollone, Patrick Philbin fromthe White House Counsel's Office, Jay Sekulow, the president's outsidecounsel, and Pam Bondi and Marc Kasowitz, likely will not be involved.It is possible, though, that Alan Dershowitz could re-up if this thing evergets to the Senate. But White House aides are telling me today that, thefurther away from Inauguration Day this thing gets -- if CongressmanClyburn is correct in saying that they might hold these impeachmentarticles until after 100 days to send them over to the Senate, then thepossibility of a conviction really becomes less and less likely.And if you're not going to get a conviction, you're not going to preventthe president from running again in 2024, what's the purpose of evensending it over to the Senate?CAVUTO:  Right. Right. Very good point.John Roberts, thank you. We will wait to see if we do get a video statementor anything like that from the president of the United States.Want to go to Jennifer Griffin. She's been looking at how the Capitol isgetting ready for next week's inauguration, amid ample security concerns.Thousands of National Guard are troops already in the city, more to come.They have beefed up police forces and the like.They're ready, I guess, Jennifer, for anything and everything.(LAUGHTER)JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  They certainlyare, Neil. And what a difference a week makes.We have been seeing dozens of platoons, if you will, of National Guardwalking the perimeter here, some of them armed with him M-4 rifles. Theyhave been briefed, we're told, that there could be a vehicle-borne IEDs, inother words, word truck bombs brought into the Capitol in the coming daysto disrupt the inauguration events.They are being given the same kind of briefs they would be given if theywere going to a war zone. I think it's notable that there are more NationalGuard troops right now on Capitol Hill than there are in either Iraq orAfghanistan.And by the time that the National Guard deploys the 20,000 troops that havenow been approved to come to the Capitol over the next coming days, thatwill be more than three times the number of U.S. troops in Iraq andAfghanistan combined, so, things very tense in the city, no sign of reallylarge protests right now, but the threat level very high, according to theD.C. police chief and also the attorney general and FBI alerts.That is why you are seeing the Capitol Police asking for reinforcement, andyou see all of these National Guard troops inside the Capitol. We saw someof them sleeping with their rifles last night. We're told they won't besleeping in the Capitol. They will be staying in lodging nearby.But they are on alert. There is barbed wire going up; 12,000 feet of fencehave been put around the entire Capitol Hill complex in anticipation of theinauguration. And there are roadblocks across the city, with more to come.Tunnels and bridges will be shut down in the coming days. It'll be verydifficult. The mayor is saying, do not come to Washington for theinauguration. They do not want outside visitors, given the current threatlevels -- back to you.CAVUTO:  Yes, even some congress men or women aren't too keen on it.I had Nancy Mace, the newly elected South Carolina Republican, who said shewas not inclined to come. It's a safety issue for her. She has two youngdaughters. She just doesn't want to go. And I'm wondering if there areothers like her.GRIFFIN:  I think, right now, Neil, the real concern -- the Capitol will besecure. I have spoken to senior officials at the Pentagon and elsewhereresponsible for security who are involved in coordinating. The SecretService will be in the lead.There will be a massive federal law enforcement and National Guardpresident in the Capitol. But the threat, according to the FBI, is also onthe 50 state capitols. There are armed protesters threatening those statecapitols. And so they will need National Guard. They will need lawenforcement to protect them.So, again, this is a very hardened target at this point. It looks like theGreen Zone in Baghdad. It does not look like the U.S. Capitol.CAVUTO:  All right, Jennifer Griffin, thank you very much, my friend. Greatreporting, as usual.We are getting a statement from Mitch McConnell again, what would comenext."Given the rules, procedures and Senate precedents," he writes, "thatgovern presidential impeachment, there is simply no chance" -- again, thisis from about Mitch McConnell -- "that a fair or serious trial couldconclude before president-elect Biden is sworn in next week."He goes on to say: "The Senate has held three presidential impeachmenttrials. They have lasted 83 days, 37 days, and 21 days, respectively." Evenif the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no finalverdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office.All right, so reaction now from Phil Wegmann of RealClearPolitics.So, the Senate thing, at least this go-round, under this president, seemsunlikely, Phil.Your thoughts?PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  I think we're going to learn a lot ofcivics lessons from Chad Pergram in the days to come, as he explains a lotof these intricate rules in the Senate.(LAUGHTER)WEGMANN:  But what we saw from Mitch McConnell right now is that, yes,while there is a 50/50 split in the U.S. Senate right now, he's not goingto bring the Senate back with an emergency session.And we can't forget that, frankly, there's not a lot of love lost betweenMcConnell and the president. There are a lot of Senate Republicans whoblame the president for losing the majority.And, look, even if McConnell was not to vote to impeach, certainly, hecould give a signal to the rest of his caucus that they can go ahead andvote their own consciences.CAVUTO:  You don't, Phil, if you think about -- I know you and I discussedthis before -- it is a stunning fall from grace.I mean, if you think about where we were right after the election, it was aclose election. The president, of course, protested a lot of what he saw.But it quickly morphed into, we were robbed, stolen, chicanery, and all ofthat was shot down in one legal case after another, even administered byjudges appointed by Donald Trump that dismissed it as well.And then, last week -- and I'm just thinking of a figure who did get 74, 75million votes, who could have been a credible threat on the national frontas a conceivable candidate for president four years from now, even if theSenate doesn't move on any of this, and thereby negate that possibility.I wonder if it's even a possibility now. What do you think?WEGMANN:  Well, listen to Representative Nancy Mace that you had on theprogram just a second ago.She was a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.CAVUTO:  Right.WEGMANN:  And, as we heard, she said that his accomplishments, from taxcuts to the vaccine to other things, are wiped away.And other Republicans that I have talked to have shared similar sentiments,because the conversation about Trump will start and end with what happenedlast week. So, yes, this is a debate about whether or not President Trumpshould be impeached, whether or not he should be barred from running foroffice again.But I think the subtext here is also about whether or not President Trump'ssort of brand of populist conservatism, whether or not that remainsorthodoxy in the GOP. And, right now, his stock is down.CAVUTO:  It might be down, but even allowing for the possibility -- let'ssay he's lost half those supporters who voted for him -- that might be astretch -- it's still tens of millions of people who like him, admire him,respect him.I don't know. It's like a Teddy Roosevelt Bull Moose Party there that isjust ready to be remade and re-visioned, but I wonder. What do you think?WEGMANN:  Look, I think that Donald Trump surprised the political world in2015 and 2016. He might have more surprises in the future.But I think that Republicans, at their own peril, dismiss the Trumpsupporters, because, even if you disagree with some of their views -- and,obviously, Republicans, to a member, condemn the attack on the Capitol --you still, as an elected member of Congress, need to understand theirthinking and need to understand their concerns, while, at the same time,condemning violence, because we have been saying this for a long time.Even if the populist president is gone, the populist sentiment stillremains. And Republicans are going to have to grapple with that, even ifTrump's personality is not on the table.CAVUTO:  Phil Wegmann, very good catching up with you, my friend, PhilWegmann of RealClearPolitics here.So, for those of you just tuning in, the president of the United States hasbeen impeached yet again, the second time in a little more than 13 months,this time by a wider margin, though; 232 congress men and women voted toimpeach, and that included 10 Republicans.That is unprecedented, in and of itself. That number was growing with earlysigns Liz Cheney was not a fan of the president's actions last week and howthey triggered the violence and what she called the insurrection thatevolved just hours after.It is a whole new political landscape. We have yet to hear from thepresident of the United States. He will probably provide a videoannouncement what he makes of all of this.But he's been impeached yet again.Here comes "THE FIVE."ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
