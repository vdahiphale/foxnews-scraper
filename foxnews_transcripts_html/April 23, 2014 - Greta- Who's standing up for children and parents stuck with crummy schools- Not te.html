'Off the Record', 4/23/14: Don't count on teachers unions to help children and their parents. They're only about themselves and protecting their jobs, not education

Let's all go "Off the Record" for minute. Who is standing up for children and parents who are stuck with those crummy schools? Anyone?
Don't count on the teachers unions. In fact, they're are big parts of the mess. I said teachers unions, not teachers. Big difference. I know teachers want to teach. But teachers' unions are not about education. They don't use political muscle for kids for education, but only for themselves, period. Not teaching, not kids. Just protecting their jobs. Sure, you can find instances where teachers' union has done some good, but step back, think about this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Many public schools in this country stink. And they really stink in poor minority neighborhoods. The schools are absolutely disgraceful. And because we want those kids to have a chance like others and get a college education, and also we want to add to the enrichment to colleges by having diverse student bodies, we have had affirmative action. Affirmative action softens admission standards for students from those lousy schools. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that's a band-aid from a systemic problem. If we really wanted to solve the problem and do the right thing, we would head the problem off at the path and fix, really fix, those crummy rotten schools in those poor neighborhoods. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, let's face it, the unions that have lots of power they don't want to help. They are not interested in education. Unions are only in it for themselves. Don't believe me? Do I need to mention the union support of the porn teacher in Wisconsin? I think not. You get the picture. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
