BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Jesse. Animals are great.Thanks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This may be the mostimportant speech I've ever made. This is not just about honoring the votesof 74 million Americans who voted for me, it's about ensuring thatAmericans can have faith in this election and in all future elections.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, that is a portion of a video released by the White House ashort time ago in which President Trump lays out his case, insisting hewill continue to challenge last month's election results. And gives hisstrongest indication yet that he does in fact plan to run again in 2024 ifhis efforts fail.Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. The most expansivestatement from President Trump since the November balloting usually aspeech like this that the president called as you heard, likely one of themost important of his presidency would be covered by the White House presspool, covered live or on tape and played back with an editorial presence inthe room. This was not done like that. The White House press pool was notinvited in.This was a White House edited video, there was no option to take it live.It was posted on Facebook and a little piece on Twitter about an hour ago.Also tonight, a hearing at this hour in Michigan with presidential lawyerRudy Giuliani testifying before state lawmakers about alleged electionfraud. We'll go there live shortly.But we begin tonight with his speech and with correspondent Kristin Fisherlive on the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. This was a 45-minute long video posted directly to Twitter andFacebook by the White House. The White House press pool was not evennotified that these remarks were about to be released.And President Trump said that this may be the most important speech that hehas ever delivered, even though most of what he said is at odds with whathis own Attorney General said yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose thetremendous voter fraud and irregularities which took place during theridiculously long November 3rd elections.We used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days,weeks and months. And lots of bad things happened during this ridiculousperiod of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing toexercise our greatest privilege, the right to vote.As president, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and theConstitution of the United States. That is why I am determined to protectour election system, which is now under coordinated assault and siege.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): Under coordinated assault and siege, quite the claimfrom the President of the United States, especially when you take intoconsideration what Chris Krebs who was the former Trump administrationcyber election -- cybersecurity election official who was fired by thepresident for saying that he believes this election, the 2020 election wasthe most secure in U.S. history.You also have to consider what the Attorney General Bill Barr said justyesterday, he said, and I quote, "To date, we have not seen fraud on ascale that could have affected a different outcome in this election."And a little bit later on in this video, President Trump continued to takeaim at Dominion Voting Systems that company that manufacturers so manyelectronic voting machines across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: And on top of everything else, we have a company that's verysuspect. Its name is Dominion. With the turn of a dial or the change of achip, you could press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden, whatkind of a system is this? We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer,but the only secure system is paper.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): Now, the Attorney General also said yesterday that theDepartment of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security looked intothese claims specifically about voting irregularities with these Dominionvoting machines. And the Attorney General said that they sought nothing tosubstantiate those claims.You also have the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency puttingout a statement a few weeks ago saying that there is no evidence that anyvoting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any waycompromised.Finally, and this was a long 45-minute address by the President, so I'mtrying to consolidate it, but the other entity or people that the presidentattacked in this video were the judges who are hearing so many cases, somany different lawsuits that have been brought forward by the Trumpcampaign. Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It was about many other things. But above all, it was about fraud.This election was rigged, everybody knows it. I don't mind if I lose anelection. But I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don't wantto do is have it stolen from the American people. That's what we'refighting for. And we have no choice to be doing that.We already have the proof; we already have the evidence. And it's veryclear. Many people in the media, and even judges so far have refused toaccept it. They know it's true. They know it's there. They know who won theelection. But they refuse to say, you're right. Our country needs somebodyto say you're right.Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result. And Ihope that Joe Biden is as well. But we already have the proof. We alreadyhave tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all ofthese states that we're talking about. This is an election for the highestoffice in the greatest country in the history of the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): Now, let's go back to that one line from PresidentTrump where he said the judges have refused to accept it, refuse to acceptthe evidence that his campaign has presented in court.I can't go case by case again, because there are so many lawsuits in somany states. But let's just take that really big case in Pennsylvania,which was tossed out by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and those threejudges, those three judges on that appeals court, they were all appointedby Republican presidents and the judge that wrote that opinion, who saidthat the Trump campaign had brought forward this lawsuit, that those claimshad no merit whatsoever, that judge was appointed by President Trumphimself.But Bret tonight, President Trump making it clear in this 45-minute videothat he is not giving up this fight and appears no closer to conceding.BAIER: Kristin, great job consolidating that in a very short time, notknowing that it was coming to begin with, we appreciate that.FISHER: You bet.BAIER: We will have more with the panel which we'll bring up to the frontof this show on this. Breaking right now, you can see here president --presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani testifying this hour before statelawmakers in Michigan about what the Trump campaign contends as voter fraudthere in last month's election. Voter fraud they say that could change theoutcome of that state's results.Correspondent Mark Meredith is live tonight in Lansing. Good evening, Mark.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening toyou, Bret. Rudy Giuliani claims that there were multiple instances offraud, especially when it came to mail and balloting during last month'selection. That's what he's expected to tell state lawmakers when he headsinto a hearing here behind me, a little bit of (INAUDIBLE) now it soundslike he's coming in right now.But already, this seat has certified its results, meaning that Joe Biden isgoing to get the state's electoral votes, likely that's not going tochange. But Giuliani said late today he remains undeterred.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYER: The president does not intend togive up. The president has seen more than enough evidence that this was amassive fraud all over the country. We are going to prove it. We're goingto prove it to the state legislatures, we're going to prove it to thecourt.MEREDITH (voice over): Giuliani won't be the only one speaking tonight,he's expected to invite other people who claim to be eyewitnesses tosuspicious behavior around polling locations, especially out in Detroit.But the Republican chairman of the State House Oversight Committee told ustoday, this is not about taking back Biden's win.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The goal of this is not to overturn the election. Thegoal of this is to find new laws that will help restore trust in electionsin Michigan.Also, our goal today is to allow people who have witnessed fraud to bringtheir case forward.MEREDITH (voice over): But Democrats say this is all a waste of time. Theytweeted, COVID-19 is surging in Michigan and state Republicans are too busytrying to soothe Trump's sore ego with sham hearings to do anything aboutit.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEREDITH (on camera): Republicans insist that they can focus on more thanjust one thing at a time. And a live look here, you can see the crowd veryexcited to see Rudy Giuliani as he heads into this hearing. It almost feelslike a mini Trump rally from what we used to see back on the campaigntrail.I'm told this is going to last no longer than three hours, but Bret, let'ssee what the night brings. Back to you, Bret.BAIER: That's exactly right. We'll follow up Mark live in Lansing,Michigan.We have new information tonight about some of those alleged ballotsirregularities in last month's election. Looking into a lot of them, wehave since the very beginning. Correspondent Kevin Corke looks at some ofthe claims and whether they hold up against the facts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over): A barrage oftweets and a cacophony of charges, all stemming from an intense electionintegrity debate.PHILL KLINE, DIRECTOR OF THE AMISTAD PROJECT, THOMAS MORE SOCIETY: Thisevidence demands investigation. This evidence demands answers.CORKE: The latest lamentations from the conservative leaning AmistadProject of the Thomas More Society, which has provided testimony fromwhistleblowers who've accused Postal Service workers of backdating,tampering with or tossing out ballots ahead of the election.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People have been destroying ballots right and left, wehave shredded ballots.CORKE: But one of the many other voter fraud claims being made across thecountry, many of which had been made by sworn affidavit. While AttorneyGeneral Bill Barr said yesterday that the DOJ hadn't concluded itsinvestigation into voter fraud during this election, concerns abound takethe popular claim that there were numerous Biden ballot dumps on electionnight.And while it is true, the president did lead late in the evening onelection night. And yes, there was a massive increase of Biden votesreported overnight. Even Kentucky Senator Rand Paul wondered about that.The fact is, many state officials say the surge was merely a reflection oflarge city and county votes coming in late and more early vote beingtallied.Another claim, voting from the grave, a claim that is still beinginvestigated. Though Michigan State officials say it's important toremember that people do die after casting absentee or mail-in ballots, andsometimes people who are here to be voting while dead simply share adeceased person's name and birthday.And Pennsylvania official said, for some, placeholder dates of birth onvoter rolls like January 1st 1800 are intentionally listed that way toprotect the identity of victims of domestic violence.And while the voter participation rate in each of the swing states wasunusually high in 2020. By itself, that's not proof of a valid harvestingconspiracy. And for the record, the president himself earned in excess of11 million more votes than he did back in 2016.Dominion Voting Systems have also come under intense scrutiny. And whileFox News has been unable to prove widespread fraud by Dominion,vulnerabilities in its systems program were widely reported long before the2020 election.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE (on camera): And those concerns Bret were actually rekindled after aclerk error in Michigan gave Joe Biden thousands of votes which later hadto be returned to the Trump tally.As for the Amistad Project, I want to tell you this, that group claim saysas many as 288,000 ballots were "disappeared and vanished" after beingtransported to Lancaster, Pennsylvania from New York.Additionally, the project says it has obtained sworn testimony thatsuggests over 300,000 ballots are at issue in Arizona, more than a halfmillion in Michigan, 200,000 plus in Georgia and another 121,000 inPennsylvania.Again, not an exhaustive look at all the allegations of fraud, but a look,Bret.BAIER: And we'll continue that look. And we'll continue to digest thespeech tonight by the president. Kevin, thank you.CORKE: You bet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: -- challenge is fraud, it is important to know, the problems withmail-in balloting, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, andmost other states allowed anyone to get an absentee ballot and cast theirvote without showing any I.D. The voting took place entirely or the honorsystem, no identification of any kind was required.Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the countryverifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federalelections. This is a national disgrace.And on top of everything else, we have a company that's very suspect, itsname is Dominion. With a turn of a dial, with a change of a chip, you couldpress a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden, what kind of a systemis this?We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer. But the only secure systemis paper. Not these systems that nobody understands, including in manycases the people that run them. Although unfortunately, I think theyunderstand them far too well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Again, that is the president of the United States in the WhiteHouse. 46 minutes that speech, a White House video edited produced there.But again, posted on Facebook about an hour ago.We're going to bring in our panel early, expanded panel, Mo Elleithee, theexecutive director of Georgetown Institute of Politics. Susan Ferruccio,Chief congressional correspondent for The Washington Examiner. MatthewContinetti, founding editor of The Washington Free Beacon and we expect ourNew York chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner in justmoments.Matthew, let me start with you. First of all, the president, if you thoughthe was ready to throw in the towel here, 46 minutes tells you he's not. Healso clearly makes the case in these 46 minutes that if he does not prevailin his efforts, he is going to run again in 2024.MATTHEW CONTINETTI, FOUNDING EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON (oncamera): That's right, Bret. And I think the political implications of thespeech are much more significant than the legal ones.I think it's interesting to note the media in which the speech wasreleased. It was not a televised address; it went out over Trump's socialmedia accounts. And, of course, that's a direct feed to his most loyalsupporters.But the president also has, I think, a very um political tightrope to walkhere. He made one reference in the speech to the Georgia runoff electionsin January, which will be held the day before the Congress needs to certifythe Electoral College vote.And so, there's a real risk here that as he continues to challenge theelection, he will -- he will also delegitimize the electoral process in theeyes of many Republican voters, and that's possibly handing the Senate toJoe Biden and Kamala Harris.BAIER: Mo, I mean, the speech was pretty detailed at parts where he wentinto specific allegations from specific people that they have affidavitsfrom around the country. He went into specifics about how he's disappointedabout the Durham report not coming out before the election. And that whoknows, he says, if it's going to come out before he leaves the office.This is a president that is still fighting to the end. Kristin Fisher laidout the attorney general's comments, Chris Krebs, and others that havepointed the other way.MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, Idon't think he's fighting to the end, I think he's flailing to the end. Imean, look, this speech was, I mean, it's Festivus come early. It was anairing of grievances. But the problem is most of these grievances wereweren't true.Look, if I was a Trump supporter, I would be very frustrated right now. Hekeeps saying there is allegations of -- there's evidence of fraud. Hedidn't bring it to the attorney general who has said there isn't any. Hedidn't bring him to court, in fact, judges many of whom were appointed byhim or several of whom that were appointed by him said there's no fraudhere.And in fact, asked Rudy Giuliani and other -- others from the president'slegal team, are you alleging fraud in under oath? They said, no.So, whatever the theatrics, whatever they're saying these theatricalproductions, under oath, they're saying, no, we're not alleging any sort ofwidespread fraud that could have changed the election.So, this is -- I think it's -- if I was a Trump supporter, I'd be veryfrustrated by all this. And I think, Matthew's point is really, reallyimportant. What the president is doing is undermining the credibility ofthe electoral process, just as he is trying to mobilize his supporters toparticipate in a special election.He's supposed to go down to Georgia. What's he going to do when he goesdown there to campaign? Is he going to actually talk about the Republicancandidates or is he going to use it as another platform to talk about howthe election was rigged and turn his voters off from participating in theprocess? He's doing a lot of damage here to the country and to his ownparty.BAIER: Yes. Mo, I want to take you live to Michigan. We have Rudy Giulianisitting down, ready to do this presentation in front of state. Lawmakersthere, it's something we saw similar to what happened in Arizona where webrought you sound bites from that presentation, there Jenna Ellis as well.Sometimes the president has called into these presentations live and madesome statements for that as well.Susan, just to clarify what Mo said about the attorney general,specifically what Barr said is to the A.P., to date, we have not seen fraudon a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.In other words, it's not that he hasn't seen fraud, it's that he hasn'tseen it on the scale that could determine the election. What the WhiteHouse said today is that it hasn't gone through his desk, and maybe they'resplitting Harris here, Susan, but that's what Kayleigh McEnany said fromthe press briefing room.SUSAN FERRUCCIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER(oncamera): Right. I think, you know, the anecdotal stuff, it is reallyconcerning and the things that the president and Rudy Giuliani are talkingabout should be looked into.Well, there's always some forms of election fraud every election. I thinkthe case that the president's making is that there was a mass coordinatedeffort to overturn this election and hand it to Joe Biden and steal it fromhim.And he bases it on the fact that the night on November 3rd, it looked likehe was headed to a win, and then, the next day, all the votes shiftedtoward Biden. And, of course, that has a lot to do with the way the voteswere counted and the different types of votes that came in: mail-in, earlyvoting, absentee. All of that uncoordinated because every state has theirown process.And what President Trump has done though really is undermine Biden's winfor his base. They will see Biden as an illegitimate president, much theway that Democrats saw the president as an illegitimate president becausethey believed he coordinated with the Russians to win office.BAIER: Right.FERRUCCIO: So, it's more of this partisan back and forth undermining ourelectoral process.BAIER: Yes.FERRUCCIO: And then, you have Bill Barr saying, I don't see anything hereat this point. And I think that's probably where he's going to end upultimately.BAIER: Right. I want to bring in Byron York, we got the gremlins figuredout. Byron, let me just talk for a second about the logistics here. Ifyou're trying to get this message to the most people out there, why notbring the White House press pool in with the live capabilities?I mean, Fox would have taken it live, other channels probably wouldn'thave, but we would have. Why not do that?BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Well, the first thingis, he really wouldn't want to answer questions about this. And thepresident who was enormously accessible to the press before the electionhas not been accessible to the press after the election. So, I think that'sone reason.But, you know, the time is just running out here it's been quite a whilesince the election. In 12 days, the Electoral College will meet. The majorstates have certified the results of their election in Georgia. There hasbeen a hand recount and a machine recount.He would need to overturn the results in not one, not two, but threestates. And, you know, most Republicans have to have moved on past this,and they're concerned mostly about winning those two Senate seats inGeorgia, and not about somehow miraculously changing the results of thispresidential election.BAIER: Yes, we're covering all of it. Panel, thank you very much. See you alittle bit later in the show.Coming up, an emotional day on the Senate floor. Plus, what is next withCOVID?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The world has just passed the 64 million mark in coronavirusinfections.

And eventually, all get taken care of.INGLE: As the nation looks ahead to what may come next, Dr. Anthony Fauci,says if a majority of Americans get the vaccine by the middle to the end ofApril of next year, that's when we could see things really start to turnaround.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: Which means you'd have herd immunity that would allow you tosafely get people back to the kinds of works that would otherwise bedifficult as you get to the middle and end of the summer.INGLE: Just hours ago, the CDC officially released revised guidance onquarantine time for those who may have been exposed to the coronavirus andhave tested negative.

Raffensperger, who passed awaytwo years ago.SERRIE:  In an effort to exploit divisions among Republicans, a progressivepolitical action committee has purchased ad space on nine billboards,stating senators Perdue and Loeffler didn't deliver for Trump, don'tdeliver for them.GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIAL:  Discouraging people fromvoting is not the right way to go about this. Fight about your values,argue, engage, persuade.SERRIE:  The billboard campaign comes amid ongoing legal challenges byTrump loyalists alleging widescale voter fraud.

Biden keeps calling on Congress topass COVID relief in the lame duck session, but he still hasn't spoken toMitch McConnell.BIDEN:  My hope is that'll be able to help in a short order, but thatdepends a lot on our friends in Congress and the other side who areprepared to take the action that has to be taken.(END VIDEO TAPE)DOOCY (on camera):  Whoever Biden nominates to run the Interior Departmentwill not be his first choice because sources close to the transition aretelling us that New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham was offeredInterior and turned it down. This is the first known instance of Bidenbeing turned down during the transition. Bret?BAIER:  OK, Peter Doocy live in Wilmington, Delaware. Peter, thanks.Up next, the panel on President Trump's continued fight to try to reverselast month's election results, and if that fails, his apparent desire torun again in 2024.This is a live look at the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani talking towitnesses about voter fraud he says alleged to state lawmakers in Michigan.Let's listen in as we head to break.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Can you hear me now?RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  Can everyone hear her clearly?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can hear you.GIULIANI:  OK. Now, the supervisor -- the supervisor you originally hadwhen you were first there, did you observe her coaching voters to vote for-- (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's been an amazingfour years. We're trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I'll see youin four years.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Some cellphone video there from one of the many Christmas partiesstill going on at the White House. The president saying if it doesn'thappen this time, he will see you in four years.Let's bring back our panel, Mo, Susan, Byron, and Matthew. Matthew, he islaying the groundwork here. The question is, if its efforts fail, as a lotof people suspect they will, what does it look like from now until wheneverin two years? Is he still the daily obsession for most of the media if heis out there in this kind of limbo place?MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, "WASHINGTON FREE BEACON":  A lot ofthat depends on the media, Bret. And the media is going to have to makesome editorial decisions about how they covered this ex-president. It'sgoing to be very hard for them to ignore Donald Trump. I went back in thearchives. As late as December 1979, there were articles appearing in "TheNew York Times" making the case for ex-president Gerald Ford to run in the1980 Republican primary. So I expect the shadow of the potential Trumpcandidacy will loom over the GOP for years to come.BAIER:  Meantime, there is this back-and-forth in the Democrat Party, Mo.And this is former President Obama about defund police.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  If you believe, as I do, that weshould be able to reform the criminal justice system so that it's notbiased and treats everybody fairly, I guess you can use a snappy sloganlike "defund the police," but you know you've lost a big audience theminute you said it, which makes it a lot less likely that you're actuallygoing to get the changes you want done.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Some progressives pushed back on that. What does that look likeinside the Democratic Party heading into 2021?MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  Ithink President Obama articulated what a majority of Democrats think,including the president-elect, including Joe Biden, that reforming policesis one thing, that demanding accountability is one thing, but defunding isnot something where a majority of the party is.And look, there is going to continue to be a little bit of a push and pullbetween progressives and the new administration. But so far, Joe Biden hassort of drawn lines where he disagrees with them and has said don't expectme to cave on a few of these things. Whether it was defunding the police orstanding up against Medicare for all, he has come out and said, look, I amnot for these things. So let's see where we can agree. But you are notgoing to push me on these things. And that's how he campaigned, and I thinkthat's where he is now.BAIER:  He had this interview with Tom Friedman in "The New York Times,"Mo, and he seemed to suggest that he could cave on Neera Tanden, if itdoesn't go well or if she's not going to get through. He said, sometimesthey are going to take a few off your list. Do you believe that?ELLEITHEE:  I think what he saying, if I read that correctly, was there aregoing to be a couple of people out there that Republicans are just going tofight on just to take a stand. But he's standing by her. And it's up to theSenate, and that's why Georgia is going to be so important.BAIER:  All right, Susan, this NDAA, this is the National DefenseAuthorization Act, the president tweeting, "Section 230, which is aliability shielding gift from the U.S. to Big Tech (the only companies inAmerica that have it -- corporate welfare) that is a serious threat to ournational security and election integrity. Our country can never be safe orsecure if we allow it to stand. Therefore, if the very dangerous and unfairSection 230 is not completely terminated as part of the NDAA I will beforced to unequivocally veto the bill when it's sent to the very beautifulResolute Desk. Take back America now. Thank you."Susan, obviously, it's still going forward. This is the defense bill.SUSAN FERRECHIO, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Right. And it sounds like theremay be enough Republicans potentially to override a veto. James Inhofe, theArmed Services Committee chairman, today said that he is keeping thatlanguage that the president desires out of the bill. He thinks it belongsin the Commerce Committee, not the Armed Services Committee.And Congress does not like when extraneous things get stuffed into thedefense bill, because the military likes to plan, they like to have thatauthorization measure done on time. Congress is very sensitive to that. Andso I think the president has run into some real opposition in his ownparty, even the Republicans largely agree with him that Section 230 needs acomplete rewrite for a variety of reasons. A lot of Democrats feel the sameway. This just isn't the place for it.BAIER:  Right, it is a big issue. Byron, finally, the COVID stimuluspossibilities, there is now three up there. Any possibility?BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Youwould think that there would be given that there is bipartisan support forsome amount of aid. And we're entering this period in which the number ofcases seems to be going up so quickly in some parts of the country. I thinkwhen the history of this period is written, people will be absolutelyastonished that you had a pandemic of this seriousness that had this mucheconomic effect on people, and Congress didn't do anything for such a longperiod of time. And at some point, they will all have to answer to that.BAIER:  Yes, that's a big, big issue. Panel, thanks, and thanks for thehustle, getting to the A block. We appreciate it.When we come back, a look at sports and healing.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, supporting each other. It is a busy time of theyear for delivery drivers, but when FedEx driver Aubrey Robinson noticed11-year-old Elijah Maines playing basketball and a rusty old hoop, shedecided to give him an early Christmas present. On her day off, Robinsonbought him a new hoop and basketball. Well, that's cool.And in England, Zach Bliden (ph) is jumping for joy and a cause. After fourmonths of chemo treatment, the seven-year-old is in remission. Followinghis battle, he raised thousands of dollars for Oxford Hospital charity bybouncing on his pogo stick, a lot. Keep bouncing, congratulations.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. And that is it for theSPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. I'll be off for the nextcouple of days dealing with a family health issue. Thanks for all of yourprayers and your good wishes. Tune in Sunday for Martha's coverage of thedebate down in Georgia.
