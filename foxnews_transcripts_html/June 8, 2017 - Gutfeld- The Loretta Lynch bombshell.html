Remember when you were a kid and you got an ice-cream cone and it dropped to the cement right as you licked it? That's how it must feel today to be a Democrat. Here you think Mr. Comey was going to deliver Donald Trump on an edible platter and instead, you get Loretta Lynch.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Comey told under oath that President Obama's attorney general asked him to call the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal, "a matter" not an investigation. Roll it, Francis:

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

        }
      
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY: The only other consideration that I guess I can talk about in an open setting is, at one point, the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me. But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude, I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It confused me and it concerned me. I would file that under "wow." And it raises more questions than my question-raising farm.
First: When does the hearing on this revelation begin? Lynch gave campaign language to Comey to cover up an investigation to help Hillary's campaign. That's inappropriate. We're talking Al Franken in a mesh thong inappropriate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And how great is it that Hillary is still causing the Democrats fits? The Loretta Lynch thing is only an issue because she had to deal with the Hillary "matter." Hillary really is the Democrats' unrelenting mother-in-law who comes to visit when they least want her. 
So, in a hearing meant to hammer Trump, the previous crew gets nailed. It's like when a stink bomb goes up before you have time to throw it, you end up smelling bad the rest of the day. Which is what happened to Lynch, Hillary and yes, even Comey. His decision to obey undermines this persona of a folksy everyman just trying to do his job. But it seems he'd do just about anything to keep his job, including look the other way.  </pre>
