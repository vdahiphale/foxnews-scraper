Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Remember this?

REP. NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: There is actually a way on women. We can speak great authority on that subject.

Well, that's Leader Nancy Pelosi blaming Republicans for a war on women. You have heard lots of Democrats say that and Leader Pelosi is one of the most vocal. She has raised lots of money by accusing Republicans being awful to women.
Well, speaking of that war on women, let's talk about Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth. She is a Democrat, a veteran who while serving our nation lost both her legs when helicopter shot down in Iraq in 2004. Representative Duckworth about is also about to be a mother, expecting a baby next month. Her doctors have told her not to travel back to D.C. during the late stage of her pregnancy. That means she can't vote in person in the next week's House Democrat leadership election. That's like the student council. So, Duckworth asked her fellow Democrats if she could vote by proxy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What did House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi do for this pregnant member of Congress and what did her fellow Democrats do? They said no. No proxy.
Let me get this one straight. It's not those evil women-hating Republicans who are blocking a pregnant congresswoman from voting in their student council -- who also incidentally is a war hero -- but her fellow Democrats, the same ones running around raising money and trying to get votes by saying how bad Republicans are to women. Crazy, huh? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There is a war on women in the Democratic party on Capitol Hill led by a woman. Go figure. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
