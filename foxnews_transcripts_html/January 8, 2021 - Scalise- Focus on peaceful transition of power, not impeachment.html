MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bret. Good evening,everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and tonight, this is The Story as onceagain the House of Representatives turns to impeachment proceedings. NancyPelosi says she's ready to fast track it on Monday if the president doesn'tresign before that.Now, keep in mind, an impeachment would prevent President Trump from everrunning again. It's kind of like being disbarred if you're an attorney.John Roberts says there is some support on the Senate side. Not clear howmuch tonight, but is this truly the path to stability for these tumultuoustimes? Do these politicians care about the country or their next weapon?Given the fragility of this moment, is this what's best for America?What action sends the most strengthening message to countries around theworld who are watching us very closely right now? Would it be a marchtowards a peaceful transition, a productive process of coordination betweenincoming and outgoing administrations or a news cycle consumed by yetanother impeachment? How about all sides focusing on an immediate 10-daynationwide vaccine push? Wouldn't that be a bigger help to the country onthe whole? You bet.74 million people have voted for the president, 80 million who voted forJoe Biden. What would be the best for all of them? Would that send amessage that the government is truly putting its citizens and its economyfirst for everyone? So today, the president-elect said that the presidentis not fit to serve. He added that he would be glad if President Trump didnot attend the inaugural.Vice President Mike Pence has not confirmed that he will attend. But Bidensaid that he believed that the VP's presence would be helpful. He wasnoncommittal though, on impeachment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: And my job now in 12days, God willing, I'll be President of the United States of America. So,we're going to do our job and Congress can decide how to proceed with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, where's all this going and what is best for America? Let'sget right to it.We're joined tonight by House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.Representative, good to have you with us tonight obviously. It's been quitea week for the country. So, let's begin with this impeachment push. Is thisgoing to happen on Monday? And what's your read on how Republicans in theHouse feel about this as a way forward?REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Martha, it's good to be with you. And just avery disturbing week in a lot of ways. But what we all need to be focusedon right now is, is toning down the rhetoric and uniting the country again.Really, that should be the focus between now and January 20th when JoeBiden gets sworn in as president. I don't think anybody can look and say animpeachment of this president is the thing that's going to help unite andbring our country together. I think that's where our focus needs to be. Andthere is a lot of work that needs to be done in that regard.MACCALLUM: So, do you think that they will proceed with that on Monday? Anddo you think that there - how much - do you have any feel for how muchsupport there would be for that in the Senate?SCALISE: Well, unfortunately, you've seen that that would be the main focusof Nancy Pelosi's speakership for the last two years, and I wouldn't besurprised if they went down that road. But I don't think it's a road that'sgoing to help unite this country right now.MACCALLUM: What about support in the Senate, how much you think there is,Lisa Murkowski called on the president to resign. She also hinted thatshe's not sure she's in the right party, which would be quite a story aswell as we head into a Democrat controlled Senate.SCALISE: Again, look, everybody has got high emotions right now. We justlost a Capitol Police officer last night and my heart goes out to hisfamily and all the other officers, there were dozens of officers who wereinjured in those anarchistic mob attacks of the Capitol just a few daysago. And so, I spoke with a lot of Capitol Police officers yesterday, andwe ought to be keeping them in our prayers, but also be looking at what weneed to do to make sure that doesn't happen again.Clearly, there have been a lot of conversations in the last few days aboutfortifying the Capitol so that something like that can't happen againbecause I know our adversaries around the world. Some we're watching that,thinking they might be able to do the same thing. It's not the kind ofplace we want to be in this country. We need to secure our institutions ofgovernment.MACCALLUM: Yes, there's no doubt we watched so many of our institutions gethardened after 9/11, it was amazing to see that it was as easy as it wasfor people to breach those walls and get into the Capitol building. Andobviously, it's going to be a very, very different place from now on. Andwe share your sympathies for the Capitol Police officer who lost his life.It's a tragedy. We're going to talk more about the violence that we saw ina little bit.With regard to the president, the Wall Street Journal called on him toresign, saying, if Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his bestpath would be to take personal responsibility and resign. This would be thecleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties overto Mr. Pence. And it would give Mr. Trump agency Richard Nixon over hisfate. If you could speak to the president right now, what course of actionwould you recommend for him tonight?SCALISE: Well, I think it is, first of all, a strong understanding of justwhat happened Wednesday and how words that that he gave Wednesday didn'thelp and in fact caused a lot of real division that didn't need to bethere. I'm very troubled by what happened Wednesday on a lot of fronts.But again, we all need to check how the rhetoric plays into that. And Ithink that's one of those things where it should have been an unequivocal,just complete, unequivocal calling out of what was going on at the timewhen people were storming the Capitol to say without any equivocation thatit was wrong. It shouldn't be happening. It's not who we are as Americans.And to call it out without any condition. And that didn't happen.MACCALLUM: Do you believe that he should resign because of that, or do youthink he should stay in office for the next 12 days?SCALISE: Again, look, right now, I think we need to have a focus on apeaceful transition of power to do all we can to make sure that January20th is a day where the country can heal in a way where we're not - we'restill a very divided country right now. And everything we do between nowand then should be focused on how to heal those divisions and how to calmthe temperature down. The temperatures way too high right now. And whathappened with boiled over Wednesday, should have never happened. But weneed to dial it down, not be doing things to ratchet it up right now.MACCALLUM: OK. Last night, I spoke with Representative Crenshaw, DanCrenshaw from Texas, and he was very fired up about what he says were thelies that led to that emotion that we saw on January 6th. I want to play abit of what he said because it got a lot of attention today. I think itmade a lot of people think and some people were angry at him for what hesaid, and some people were supportive. So, let's watch this and I want toget your thoughts on the other side, Congressman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): They lied to people and they said, go fight, gofight, because everything's on the line. That's what they said. And whenpeople fought, they came to fight and then they fought Capitol Police andnow people are dead and those same members of Congress who called people tofight, well, they were nowhere to be found because it was all fun and gamesto them. They never knew what a real fight was. Real fights are scary,bullets flying, that's scary. The glass breaking, that's really scary. Theywere nowhere to be found. They scattered.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He's talking about your colleagues. Do you agree with him?SCALISE: I'm not sure who he's trying to mention there. He sounds like he'strying to be specific, but at the end of the day, anybody who inciteviolence is at fault because violence isn't the answer to the divisions. Wehave real divisions in our country. We saw it before this election. It'sbeen going on for a long time. But we don't resort to violence to solve ourdifferences in America. That's what separates us and clearly, that brokedown.So, anybody can point fingers, but at the end of the day, we need to befocused on ratcheting the temperature down right now. Those bullets I'veseen bullets fly before, and it's not a pretty sight. I saw what ourCapitol Police did. And in the best of what Capitol Police is, was again ondisplay where you had people risking their lives, police officers, but theywere being attacked. And anybody who attacked those police officers whoparticipated in storming the Capitol ought to be held accountable. Theyneed to be held accountable and send a message that it won't be tolerated.MACCALLUM: Congressman Steve Scalise, you have seen that kind of violencetoo close in your own life, and I think everybody still kind of processingwhat we saw on Capitol Hill this week. And it's good to speak with you,sir. And as we all say, our thoughts and prayers are with the CapitolPolice officer's family who lost his life this week. Thank you very much,sir. Good to see you tonight.SCALISE: Thanks, Martha. God bless us this great country.MACCALLUM: You bet. Thank you. Amen to that. So, coming up, we're going totalk to Victor Davis Hanson and Steve Hilton and Charlie Kirk on thebreaking news that Twitter has now permanently banned President Trump.He has said that that vehicle is one of his most important voices to thepeople of this country and now they have shut him down. And next, Joe Bidencriticized for saying that BLM rioters would have been treated verydifferently if they had been behind the mob storming the Capitol this week.Let's remember, though, that a woman was shot and killed by the CapitolPolice. So, where are the voices against that police brutality? Is that howyou see this? We're going to talk about that with the Roy Murdock when wecome back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: No one can tell me that if had been a group of Black Lives Matterprotesting yesterday, there wouldn't have been - they wouldn't have beentreated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed theCapitol. We all know that's true.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The DOJ announcing an investigation into the death of CapitolPolice Officer Brian Sicknick tonight. Now the fifth person to die as aresult of Wednesday's mayhem on Capitol Hill. The incoming administrationand others say that the disastrous fallout would have been much worse if aracial double standard did not exist in our country. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: But I got a text from my granddaughter. She said, pop, this isn'tfair, no one can tell me that if had been a group of Black Lives Matterprotesting yesterday, there wouldn't have been - they wouldn't have beentreated very, very differently.SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wesaw one that let extremists stormed the United States Capitol and anotherthat released tear gas on peaceful protesters last summer.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Police orchestrated much of the mob mentality.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As you saw at the Capitol Building yesterday, VanillaIce was literally almost given milk and cookies.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Deroy Murdock, National Review Online contributing editor and aFox News Contributor. Deroy, good evening to you. Thanks for being heretonight. What goes through your mind as you listen to the comparisons thatare made there?DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's astonishing. First ofall, let me once again condemn the atrocious violence and the appallingattack on our beautiful U.S. Capitol, we all witnessed on Wednesday. Icondemned online on radio. Now, let me do it on television, first.Secondly, I really wonder what footage these other folks were watching. Iwatched that whole horror show unfolds live, and I saw the Capitol Policebravely trying to keep these people on the other side of the perimeter.They fought them, they hit them physically. They sprayed them with teargas, in fact, pepper spray, et cetera. And eventually at some point, theyjust got overwhelmed. They couldn't hold them back. They knocked over thebarricades. These people went in and attacked the Capitol very stupidlywhile the House and Senate were debating the very challenges the ElectoralCollege that Trump supporters wanted made no sense to do this.And they tried to fight them off as best they could. I've seen footage ofthem inside fighting these people. As you said earlier, they opened fireand they killed that poor woman who is now dead and 14-year Air Forceveteran. So, the notion that they were welcoming Vanilla Ice in is absurd.What I saw. I wish they'd been able to keep them outside. They sure foughtvaliantly, do so, unfortunately, overwhelmed by such a huge, huge, huge,very active and energetic mob as it was.MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, I think of the video of that one lone Capitolpolice officer as people are storming up the stairs towards him, I'm notsure what color the people's skin was who was running towards him mattered.He was completely overwhelmed. There was absolutely no way that he couldfight back in that situation. Listen to this comment, though, by SenatorKirsten Gillibrand of New York. I want to see what you think about this.All right, so she said, I think we've got it. Do we have it?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): They would have been shot, so let's beclear, we treat black people in this country and white people in thiscountry differently. Yes, and in fact, this one writer was breaking awindow trying to break into the Capitol. She was warned several times, ifyou continue, you will be shot. Our Capitol Police held their ground, didthe right thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: I'm not sure what point she's trying to make there. What do youthink?MURDOCK: This is why U.S. Senator folks, sorry about that. Look, they didshoot somebody. She's dead. Is she happy? Is Senator Gillibrand thrilledthat this protester shot? How many more people would she want shot? Andthis is the same crowd that we've heard since George Floyd saying thepolice need to back down, they need to be defunded, they need todeescalate. We need social workers to come in and deal with this sort ofthing. And here's Kirsten Gillibrand, a woman of the Left saying open firegunned them down, which is it?So, she wanted people shot. All right. That's one shot. I guess maybe shewanted more dead bodies in the U.S. Capitol.MACCALLUM: I want to ask you about your anger about what happened, becauseI read the pieces that you wrote about this, Deroy, and I want to give youan opportunity to express your frustration over what you see as a lot ofpositive accomplishments of this administration that got eaten up in a bigway this week.MURDOCK: Yes, it's been very frustrating, very upsetting to me. And I'msure a lot of other people on the right, conservatives, and supporters ofPresident Trump, to see this appalling thing happen and for it to be doneby people essentially on our side. Now, obviously, it wasn't the majorityof people who showed up for that peaceful rally on Wednesday and to hearthe President of the United States speak. But an uncontrolled group ofextremists went in and did this.And as I say, stupidly did this at the exact same time that the House ofRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate were debating objections to theElectoral College votes from Arizona, raising actual physical evidence ofvoter registrations that were basically approved after the statutorydeadline to do so. Congress is doing exactly what those of us have beenasking to do for weeks, which is to look at actual evidence of votingirregularities in the November 3rd election. And rather than sit back andlet these people do so and protest peacefully outside and they've beenoutside for hours, protesting peacefully, this would have been a greatthing.They went in and shut that down, stopped that process, and then completelytarred President Trump and his four years of excellent accomplishments inthe economy and overseas and now their calls for him to resign or beimpeached or kicked out under the 25th Amendment. I've never seen such astaggering act of political self-sabotage in my life.MACCALLUM: Deroy Murdock, thank you very much. Good to have you heretonight, Deroy.MURDOCK: Thank you very much.MACCALLUM: So, late this evening, Twitter took action and blockedpermanently President Trump from the platform that he has used throughouthis presidency to speak his mind. Victor Davis Hanson, Steve Hilton,Charlie Kirk, all here on that and where the party of President Trump goesfrom here. Big, big question right now. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Very big story tonight that's going to provoke an enormousbattle. Twitter has canceled President Trump's Twitter account, citing,quote, the risk of further incitement of violence. This follows thetemporary blocking of his account earlier this week, as well as a move byFacebook yesterday to ban President Trump's account, quote, indefinitely.President Trump's term ends in just 12 days. 74 million Americans voted forthe incumbent and many remain staunch supporters.So, what is the impact of the past couple of months? And can he rebuildafter this week? Veteran political reporter Mark Halperin wrote this today.Trump has turned himself into a smaller king on a smaller hill, but he isfor now still the king of the most important hill for tens of millions andno one else in his party can say that. Here's the president in his twotaped appearances this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I know your pain. I knowyou're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslideelection, and everyone knows it.I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that ourincredible journey is only just beginning.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,Steve Hilton, host of The Next Revolution, and Charlie Kirk, founder, andpresident of Turning Point USA. Good to have all of you with us tonight,gentlemen. Charlie, I want to start with you. And I want to show everyone,because the president doesn't have a Twitter account anymore, Don Jr., hisson does, at least for now. We'll see how long that lasts.But let's take a look at what he tweeted because I think it's important. Hesays so the Ayatollah and numerous other dictatorial regimes can haveTwitter accounts with no issue, despite threatening genocide to entirecountries and killing homosexuals, et cetera. But the President of theUnited States should be permanently suspended. Mao would be proud. Charlie,what do you think?CHARLIE KIRK, PRESIDENT, TURNING POINT USA: It's completely outrageous.It's predictable. Twitter has been kind of building up to this moment for acouple of months now in kind of an ironic turn of events. Twitter should bebanning President Trump. They should be giving him a dividend of the stock.I mean, when Twitter was - at four or five years ago, Twitter was $18 ashare. It closed it over $50 a share, large in part because President Trumpmade the platform relevant again. And this is a very, very disturbing turnof events when the current President of the United States, as we aretalking right now, is restricted from communicating to 88 million people.Some could argue, it could potentially be a national security risk. Buteven beyond this, this is something that the Left has wanted to do forquite some time. They are using the events that no one is supporting in anyform whatsoever from a couple of days ago as an excuse for a massivecensorship campaign that I'm afraid is not going to stop. I'm currently upon Twitter right now. I hope to continue to be, but this seems to now be anout-of-control pattern from the masters of Menlo Park that wants to silencedisagreement. And they got the big one.MACCALLUM: So, Steve Hilton, Twitter, their argument is that the presidentincited the violence that we saw at the Capitol and that this has giventhem the opportunity I think they've wanted for some time to pull theaccount down.STEVE HILTON, HOST, THE NEXT REVOLUTION: Yes, that's right, by the way, I'mhere I am in Menlo Park, that's where I'm speaking to you from. Perhaps Ishould go down the road and complain directly myself. I think the issuehere is that we can all agree that Twitter, Facebook, that privatecompanies, they can do what they want. They've clearly made a decision toweigh in on one side of the political argument. They are now clearly andunambiguously saying, they are supporting the Democrats. They are anti-conservative, anti-Republican. That's what they've decided to do.Fine. They can do that. The problem is when there's no competition whenthey have a monopoly over information. That's why I've argued for a longtime now that we need to break up Facebook, not just through the Section230 change that not people have to consensus around, but break up thesecompanies so there's competition.And therefore, in a way, the more disturbing story I think, is that Appleis saying to Parler, which is an alternative to Twitter, that people canuse, conservatives can use, Apple is saying to Parler, we are going to kickyou off unless you do what we want in terms of censoring conservatives. Nowthat is really frightening. The answer to all of this is competition and wemustn't allow Apple or anyone else to crush it.MACCALLUM:  Victor, what do you think about all of this and what do youthink about their future of conservatism of Trumpism in the United States?VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE:  I think there is areign of fear going on, Martha. I think people in Twitter and Facebookunderstand that with the Senate and the House and the presidency and thehard left in control, they want to preempt that danger and they want tomake -- they want to have a deal with the powers that be. They are afraidthe left is going to be angry at them that they even let Trump expresshimself.The other -- the bigger irony is that these issues were adjudicated in the19th century when we said that railroad companies and oil companies, theywere private companies but they use the public domain and that peopleneeded to be, needed a railroad to get from one place to another. Or theyneeded a telegraph to communicate with another, or telephone.And we decided that these were public utilities, and we have publicutilities come in. And then these companies came in and they took over thatrole. You communicate through these new public utilities except they arenot public utilities, they are private companies and they use their powerfor political and partisan agendas.And whether that's Google searches that are worked to reflect thepredetermined result, or Twitter having no consistent policy. I mean, weare talking about Joe Biden speech on race. Raz Simone, an African Americanself-described warlord, took over an area of downtown Seattle. Four peoplewere shot. There was no police reaction. They exceeded the territory, theautonomy of the whole downtown area to him and his followers. And what --and did they suspend his Twitter account? I don't think they did.So, I mean, there's no systematic policy here and it's not going to standbecause this sort of fervor that we're in now, the Salem witch trialmentality to destroy people to ask senators to quit. To cancel bookcontracts. There is a McCarthy-esque scary smell to it all, and I thinkthat people need to wake up and take a deep breath and say do we reallywant to turn the United States into Salem Massachusetts because that'swhere we are going.And we -- these are the robber barons of the 19th century and there was aprogressive ironic, a progressive movement that said you know what, theyare monopolies and they are trust and we've got to stop it. They've got toomuch concentrated power and wealth.MACCALLUM:  Yes.HANSON:  And now the progressives are saying let's give them more as longas they work for us.MACCALLUM:  It's going to be interesting to see what happens to all thosepeople on Twitter. The ones that are left a lot have already moved to theParler but all of this is going to be unraveling.So, about 30 seconds each. To Charlie Kirk and Steve Hilton. The future ofthe party, is President Trump done? That's the question that Mark Halperinraised today. Charlie?CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, TURNING POINT USA:  No. And the MAGAdoctrine that he started is only going to continue to grow. You look atIowa, Ohio, and Florida. Those used to be battleground states, thinks thatPresident Trump those are deep red states. You got some amazing leaderslike Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis be able to show leadership under thisTrump movement.Philosophically, I believed he has changed the Republican Party for thebetter. Ending the endless wars, renegotiating trade deals, challenging andtrans corporate interest and giving a voice to workers across the country.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Steve Hilton, he could have focused on all those things onthe accomplishments, you know, right after the election to try to lock inthat legacy. But he has frittered away a lot of the last two months, a lotof people think, in a way that has been destructive to that legacy.HILTON:  Well, I think his supporters in their millions would agree withthe way Charlie just put it and that would endure way beyond the past twomonths or the next two months because actually real power in politics isnot the office you hold. Everyone loses that eventually. That's even yourpolicies, they'll be overturned.It's whether you change the way people think. President Trump did that in abig, big way and that will endure for many, many years.MACCALLUM:  Yes. He gave voice to the way that a lot of people thought, andhe did a lot of that on Twitter. So, all of this is up a piece.Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good to have you all here tonight.HILTON:  Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, with Democrats soon to be in control of Washington, themoves Republicans feared are already underway starting with the growingpush to make D.C. a state, an idea that Joe Biden has backed and one thathas massive implications for a lot of things and in a big way for thebalance of power in the Senate. Marc Thiessen on "The Story."(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D-WA):  We must get statehood on the president's deskwithin the first 100 days of the 117th Congress. Congress must immediatelytransfer command of the District of Columbia National Guard from thePresident of the United States and put it squarely under the command andcontrol of the mayor of the District of Columbia.(END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM (on camera):  So here we go. Democrats this week citing delaysover National Guard mobilization to renew the push to make D.C. a state. Ifsuccessful, the implications would reach far beyond security. Potentiallyhanding the party two Senate seats in the heavily blue district and withBiden about to take the home statehood just stand a chance after this tweetthat he sent out in June. Quote, "D.C. should be a state. Pass it on." SaysJoe Biden.Marc Thiessen joins us now. American Enterprise Institute scholar and FoxNews contributor. Marc, always good to see you. Your thoughts on --MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  -- this tonight. It was one of the things that was widelydiscussed during the course of the presidential election, that this was apath that could happen and that it could add two more blue seats to theSenate. What do you think?THIESSEN:  That's exactly it. I mean, look, this is not a matter ofprinciple. This is not no taxation without representation and all the restof it. This is a pure power grab. The reason they want D.C. statehoodbecause it's two more guaranteed Democratic seats. Because apparently, theswamp doesn't have enough representation in Washington, so they need theirown two senators for the bureaucracy.And the reason they are doing this is because they know that it's going tomake it more difficult for Republicans to take back the Senate in twoyears' time. They reason they going to want to do this. Because if they getD.C. statehood that means they've eliminated the filibuster because you'renot going to get pass -- you're not going to get 60 votes to make D.C. astate.If they eliminate the filibuster, they are not going to stop with the D.C.statehood, they are going to pass the courts, they are going to -- they aregoing to raise taxes, they are going to unleash a miasma of spending usingCOVID as an excuse. They are going to pass some version of the Green NewDeal. They are going to pass some version of Medicare for all and theradical -- all that radical agenda. They are going to launch a war onfossil fuels.And what's going to happen if they do all that, if they get -- if they --you know, this is the far-left unleashed. With the filibuster beingeliminated there's going to be a backlash. They are going to be on thedefensive going into the midterm elections in 2022, and so they want to padtheir chances in the Senate. They want to give themselves two more seats tomake it harder if not impossible for Republicans to take back power whenthe American people rise up in protests against the inextricable shift forsocialism.MACCALLUM (on camera):  Yes. You know, here's Gerry Connolly from Virginiaon the no taxation without representation issue. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA):  We had 700,000 people who are unrepresentedentirely in the United States Congress. They are Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  So why is that OK, Marc?THIESSEN:  Well, OK, is he for statehood for Guam in the Marshal Islands?Those are heavily military populated areas that would probably voteRepublicans. Why don't we have four Democratic senators from the MarshallIslands in Guam. I don't hear anybody talking about that.They're not really all enthusiastic about Puerto Rico statehood by the waybecause there is good -- the Republicans are actually fairly competitive inPuerto Rico and there might be a few Republicans senators from Puerto Rico.So, it's only D.C. statehood. Why is that?MACCALLUM:  All right.THIESSEN:  Because that's where the perimeter of bureaucracy lives. That'sa guaranteed vote.MACCALLUM:  We'll see where the movement from Guam comes. I don't want tolet you go without asking you to respond to the president's Twitter accountbeing shut down. This is -- this is a big story tonight. What do you think?THIESSEN:  Yes. I don't believe in censorship, I just don't. And nobody hasbeen more angry at the president of the United States that I have been inthe last few days. I was a strong supporter of the president and wanted himto get reelected and he's just disappointed me so much with his behaviorsince the election. I blame him for losing control of the Senate inGeorgia. I think that he incited the riots yesterday, but I don't believein censorship.I don't believe that social media companies should be censoring speech.Just like I don't think they should have censored the New York Post andstop that when it turns out that that story -- the Hunter Biden was beinginvestigated by the FBI. I just don't believe in censorship.MACCALLUM:  All right. Marc, thank you. We've got continuing coverage ofthis Twitter story tonight as the president is silenced in a big way thisevening. And also, with millions of Americans anxiously awaiting theirfirst shot in the arm, outrage tonight over the bureaucratic breakdown indistribution with reports that some doses in New York City have been tossedin the garbage.Dave Rubin and Charlie LeDuff on that. They're also going to weigh in onthe president's Twitter account being shut down, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY):  Our seniors, our elders, those we love whoare in danger, the single most vulnerable population right this minute inNew York City, and the state of New York will not allow us to vaccinatethem.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  And it is just unbelievable. Millions of seniorsand everyone else for that matter waiting for their turn of the vaccine,bureaucracy has grinded to an agonizing halt. Some clinics in New Yorkactually threw vaccines in the garbage after they let them expire, ratherthan just giving them to anybody at that point who wanted them.Millions more sit in freezers and warehouses while schools and restaurantsstay closed. Ask yourself how any of this make any sense?Joining me now Dave Rubin, host of the Rubin Report, and Charlie LeDuff,Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and host of the No B.S. Newshour podcast.Gentlemen, thank you for being here. I want to get you to weigh in onTwitter as well tonight, a very big story. But first of all, thebureaucracy that has, as I said, ground to a halt, Dave Rubin. And it'sjust mind-boggling. Operation Warp Speed was so aggressive and now this.DAVE RUBIN, HOST, RUBIN REPORT:  Look, I don't know why anyone would thinkthat a state run by probably the worst governor, although I am here inCalifornia with Gavin Newsom, but talking about Andrew Cuomo in New Yorkand a city, you know, the mayor of a city, that was once the greatest cityin the world now basically now in ruins.Bill de Blasio. I don't know why anyone is surprised that the stuff doesn'twork. Big government bureaucracy simply doesn't work. They put nice nameson things, they say they are going to do things but if you put people ingovernment who have never actually accomplished anything, who just say theyknow how to do stuff, instead of actually having done it and having runthings and made systems that can do things efficiently, then this is whatyou are going to get.Cuomo should be embarrassed. I mean, I signed the recall here in Californiafor Newsom and I hope they are doing it for Cuomo in New York because thisis pathetic.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Charlie, what do you think?CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, SH*TSHOW:  It's managing by press release. Whenit's at the federal level you are going to attack the government, when itgets to you, you're going to attack the federal government. What I see inmy state of Michigan, same problem. What I see is a bunch of 27-year-oldspopulating the state capital. They have very nice law degrees but no ideahow to move a box.This is supposed to go to old people first. We've got 300,000 of them ininstitutions, right now, 8,000 of them have gotten the shot and the statedoesn't even know where these vaccines are. That's the bottom line here.MACCALLUM:  There are 22 million vaccines out there, seven million of themhave made their way into people's arms. They need to just, you know, pullback and have drive-through situations where people can pull up and show anI.D., say I'm 65 or over and get a shot on your arm. I don't know how this-- why this is so difficult, I genuinely don't. So, we just got word --(CROSSTALK)LEDUFF:  Can I say for America just that --MACCALLUM:  Go ahead.LEDUFF:  -- what is going on, fix it.MACCALLUM:  Yes, what is -- it's unbelievable. I hear it everywhere I goand it's pathetic and ridiculous.LEDUFF:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  On the Twitter story, Dave Rubin, Google just blocked Parlerfrom their Play Store. So, this is the battle that upon us now.RUBIN:  This is unbelievable. This is the battle, not a battle. This is thebattle of our time. There is a war on reality. We are in an informationwar. We now have a superstructure that exists above government. Governmentshere, we have a superstructure that exists above it.Now, I would say God is above that but the superstructure that exist thereis that big tech, a group, a small group of sort of unknown people havedecided that they can let you know who can talk and when they can talk andnow they have taken out the President of the United States.It does not matter what you think of Donald Trump, it does not matter whatyou think of the last few days. The fact that the big tech oligarchs candecide who can speak, who feels more powerful right now, is it Donald Trumpwho can't get any messaging out or is it a bunch of big tech people likeMark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey of Twitter? This is an absolute disaster.And everyone -- I try not to pull the outrage card, and I actually do thereverse of that usually. Everyone should be absolutely outraged right now.MACCALLUM:  Charlie?LEDUFF:  Are you talk. OK. Talking to me?MACCALLUM:  Charlie, what do you think?LEDUFF:  I would say -- I'm trying to think of something new here. Trumpwas a great for Twitter when Twitter was dying, and he is the President ofthe United States. Did it dawn on anybody that now that he's not going tobe the president of the United States, they don't want him tripping andundermining the new administration now that his convenient is gone? Maybethat's the reason.But I've had friends can't offer less than what he did so I don'tunderstand the powers at social media.MACCALLUM:  Yes. The bottom line is that there is freedom of speech --(CROSSTALK)RUBIN:  They want control. Control. It's as simple as that.MACCALLUM:  -- in the country and this is the format for speech in a bigway. And you can't shut it down, regardless of whether or not you don'tlike the message.Gentlemen, thank you. Charlie and Dave, good to see you both tonight. Moreof The Story after this. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Finally, tonight, a good news story to end a verytough week. Ninety-six-year-old Margaret Klessens, a World War II veteran,just received her second dose of the COVID vaccine. So that worked and thatwas good, after she became the first V.A. patient in the country to receiveround one. Margaret joins me now. Margaret, great to see you tonight. Howare you feeling after your second dose?MARGARET KLESSENS, WORLD WAR II VETERAN:  No repercussions at all. Fine.MACCALLUM:  Good for you. So, tell me -- I'm so glad to hear it. Why didyou want to be first, and what's your message for other people out thereabout taking this vaccine?KLESSENS:  Well, I really didn't know I was first. I went down, and thewhole group is in the whole way up, and they gave me the first inoculation,and I asked them at the time, I said, should the man have this honor? Youknow, because I think of the men who were, you know, and they've sort of alittle taken aback, and they said no, so I got it. And I didn't know thatall this -- at my age, I got a whole new life here.MACCALLUM:  So, you served in World War II when you were 19 years old. Youwere stateside. Tell everybody what you did.KLESSENS:  When I was 19?MACCALLUM:  Yes.KLESSENS:  What did I do?MACCALLUM:  When you were serving during World War II.KLESSENS:  When I was 19, yes. Let me see. We did clerical work. I see atthe coast guard or any place you go now, military installation, the womenare carrying guns, and to me, that really is astounding, when I see them,they have guns that reach right to the (Inaudible), and it's really -- andthey wear the camouflage outfits. We never did that. We didn't haveanything like that.We wore a little khaki shirt, skirts and a little khaki top and a littlehat, a bucket hat. And we did clerical work, you know. That's what thewomen did then, believe it or not. Of course, they have --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  Now lot has changed. Yes.KLESSENS:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  It's amazing. We have, you know, women who are fighter pilotsnow, it's extraordinary. But you did your part when you were 19 years old,and we thank you for that. And we are glad that you are brave and you gotyour shots and we hope that you stay well and healthy. Margaret, thank youso much for being here tonight. It's good to have you with us, ma'am.KLESSENS:  Thank you all.MACCALLUM:  Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Be well. So, that's The Storyon this Friday, January the 8th, 2021. What a week. Right?
