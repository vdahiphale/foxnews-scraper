'Off the Record,' 6/17/15: My assistant is leaving to become a TV news anchor in Panama City Beach, Florida - and I could not be prouder

Let's now go "Off the Record." This is a bittersweet night for me. My assistant, Jenn Holton, after completing her two year commitment to me, is leaving "On the Record." She is heading to Panama City Beach, Florida to anchor the noon and 5:30 p.m. newscast for WECP.
I could not be prouder. She has really worked hard for this. She earned it. Now, I'm not easy to work for. I'm extremely demanding. So, I have a deal with my assistant: Work hard for me, put up with me, even if means answering my same stupid computer question for the fifth time. Be loyal, and after two years, I agree to likewise work hard for them and help them get their dream jobs, to launch their careers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Jenn, she wanted to be an anchor. You have seen her reports on GretaWire. They are fantastic. So, yes, of course I hate to see her go. I'm going to miss her, but I'm so excited for her. This is the beginning of a great adventure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, by the way, my other assistants are huge successes - two lawyers, three producers, an on-air correspondent. I'm proud of each one of them. They are smart, hard-working, and so decent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, tonight, bittersweet for me, sad to see my assistants go. But that is so outweighed by how much fun it is to see their success. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
