'Off the Record', 1/13/14: A Southwest Airlines flight's landing at the wrong airport in Missouri is only the latest in recent strange and scary incidents

Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. What is going on with our airlines?
I bet there are a lot of close calls that we only hear about them when the airlines get caught, and sometimes catastrophically. Try last summer. A huge Asiana flight missed the runway at San Francisco's airport, crash landed, killing three and many seriously injured. How do three professional pilots with all that technology in the cockpit miss the runway at San Francisco Airport? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And how about November? A Boeing Dream Lifter cargo jet landing at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas. Luckily, it didn't run off the runway and crash into something and kill someone. But landing on the wrong runway too short with that size aircraft to take off with great risk, that's really stupid. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That brings us now to last night. Southwest flight 4013, a 737 filled with passengers -- and that can be you -- also landing at the wrong airport and, once again, on a dangerously short runway for that particular aircraft. That cockpit likewise loaded with navigational equipment. With all that equipment in the cockpit, you almost have to go out of your way to miss the right runway. But it gets worse. It's not just one pilot putting all those passengers at risk. There was a co-pilot sitting right there. What was he doing, watching movies with his iPad? What's the point of a co-pilot if he isn't monitoring what the pilot is doing you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, I know, when you heard that story today, you might have laughed a bit, glad you weren't on Southwest 4013. But this is very serious. Many lives were at risk. And if they are making that many mistakes as they land, what are they doing at 35,000 feet that we never even hear about? Scary, isn't it?
Southwest Airlines has a lot of explaining to do. This is not funny. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
