HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  This is MEDIA BUZZ. I am Howard Kurtz.President Trump is escalating his attack on the election result despite aseries of legal setbacks, the latest one last night in Pennsylvania, eventalking through Republican lawmakers who might flip their states by namingpro-Trump electoral delegates.And media are ramping up their attacks over his blocking a transition withJoe Biden's team over Rudy Giuliani's wild press conference, and over Trumprepeatedly declaring victory.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I won by the way, but youknow, find that out. Almost 74 million votes, we had big pharma against us.We had the media against us. We had big tech against us.UNKNOWN:  Trump's continued insistence that the election was fraudulent,his willingness to fire a top official who dared contradict him on it,well, it gives encouragement and coverage who his supporters were trying tosabotage results.UNKNOWN:  My mouth agape when I was watching this. Rudy Giuliani wasrambling on about wild conspiracy theories.UNKNOWN:  It's time to tell the president that he and Rudy and theirconfederacy of dunces need to stop making fools of themselves, and let thenext commander in chief get ready to protect and defend this country.UNKNOWN:  This is a president, this is a nation, that has just been wrongmightily. Only an idiot would try to claim that there were noirregularities that there were no anomalies.UNKNOWN:  The president wants to take a few weeks, count every legal vote,investigate every claim of fraud and abuse, and media acts like the worldis ending. Obviously, with amnesia the last four years. (END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Guy Benson,host of the Guy Benson Show on Fox News Radio. In New York, Liz Claman,host of the Claman Countdown on Fox Business, and Harold Ford, formerDemocratic congressman from Tennessee. Guy, the media are in total openrevolt of against President Trump's tactics in refusing to concede thiselection.Chuck Todd, Meet The Press this morning, Trump is conducting an assault onour democracy, Jake Tapper CNN's State of the Union this morning, Trump istrying to undermine democracy. Is this fair?GUY BENSON, THE GUY BENSON SHOW HOST:  I think that the president deservesa lot of credit the way that he and team are handling this election loss.Some of the sound bites that we just heard there from a number ofcommentators, I agree with. Count every vote, make sure they're all legal,cross every T, dot every I, pursue legitimate questions and irregularitiesor allegations.But that is different than declaring victory repeatedly. And alleging massfraud, of which there simply is not evidence, and that is not me speaking.That is the Trump's legal team in court. I think the canyon between whatthey are saying in theatrical press conferences versus what they're sayingin court under oath where they're at least some, you know, professionalissues that arise or legal issues that arise if you don't tell the truth toa judge. I think that that gap is pretty telling.KURTZ:  And on that point, Liz Claman, look, we in the media have anobligation to cover every lawsuit filed by the president and his team. Last night, federal judge in Pennsylvania tossing a suit, saying they aretrying to disenfranchise seven million voters based on strained legalarguments and speculation unsupported by evidence.Also, a lot of media criticism when the president fired his DHScybersecurity chief, Chris Krebs, saying that he didn't agree with Krebs'conclusion, that there is no widespread fraud, so what is your take on themedia coverage?LIZ CLAMAN, THE CLAMAN COUNTDOWN ANCHOR:  Well, the media has been showingup to every event, from the four seasons total landscaping event to ofcourse Rudy Giuliani's news conference. I have to say that when you look atthe judge from last night who threw out that case, this was a Republicanjudge who is a member of the federalist society.So this isn't some Republican, you know, center left or, you know, theycall them rhinos, Republican in name only. This is a very respected judgewho looked at this evidence said you guys have brought together some veryill defined conjecture, and there is a scarcity of, you know, legallyacceptable evidence that you are presenting that you are supposed to beforea judge.And when you have, Howie, the president's own lawfirms, from corner rightto Jones (Inaudible) saying we are out. We can't do this anymore because wedon't see an even possible attempt at winning here. That is a problem. Imean, that is -- since when do we see lawyers who don't want to take money,since they look at evidence and say there is no this there, there.So that becomes the issue. The media covered it. And when I say the media,let's just bring that out, and that is Fox News, Vox, New York Times, left,right, everybody.KURTZ:  Harold Ford, the president went on a tweet storm last night aboutchallenging the election results, different ways in which he thinks he canwin, including the media are just as corrupt as the election itself. So myquestion is are the media basically reporting the facts of all the pressconferences and litigation, or are they using this period to indulge intheir resentment and sometimes hostility toward President Trump?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE CONGRESSMAN:  First, thanks for havingme on. I think that this based on Liz's comments. She found a range ofmedia making the case that Mr. Trump's lawyers are making. And the resultsare getting all that's been as reporting it -- the news media's reportingit. Thomas Jefferson at the founding of our republic said with freedomcomes responsibility.We Americans have a responsibility to Thanksgiving, as we think aboutCOVID. And the president and his team has a responsibility of the law -- asthe facts and the law collide in order to make decisions. I am hopeful thatat a minimum this week the President Trump team will allow the GSAadministrator to begin sharing of information from COVID to China to Russiato North Korea to the state of affairs, economically for everydayAmericans, particularly main street.So if and when this is done, and I think the president knows he's lost, butwhen he concedes, we have a peaceful transfer of power (Inaudible) this newadministration to lead --(CROSSTALK) KURTZ:  Well, let's turn to this 90 minute rather wild Rudy Giuliani pressconference that has gotten a lot of attention. Here's a brief clip of himtaking a question from a reporter from a certain network.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  What publication are you?UNKNOWN:  CNN.UNKNOWN:  It's to go around the outrageous iron curtain of censorship andget facts to the American people that if you are a fair and honest network,you would have been reporting for the last two weeks.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Guy Benson, so Rudy has gone from alleging fraudirregularities in various state lawsuits, talking about an internationalconspiracy to steal millions of votes from Trump to Biden. And my questionis -- and calling the Biden's crooks, by the way. My question wouldn't youexpect a lot of media pushback on that?And what would the conservative reaction be if a President Obama or Clintonhad -- was in this position and making these kinds of arguments?BENSON:  We would be going apoplectic. I mean, that's obvious. I would saythis as to that quip about CNN everyone starting laughing that the questionwas coming from CNN. You can ask fair and legitimate questions right now,especially based on what the Trump team is attempting to do and what theyare saying without basis and fact.And that can come from any news organization. The issue that CNN has isthey have been so relentlessly hostile to this president for four years. Imean, to a point that has been almost comical, right? It's been almostcartoonish how much they hate him. And I know they claim that they're justa straight news network.They don't have an opinion programming. I think their programming beliesthose slogans, so they do not have a lot of credibility with anyone who isremotely sympathetic to President Trump given their editorial hostilitytoward him four years. So I think that when everyone is going to an 11 outof 10 all the time for an entire presidential term where they're outragedabout everything.They might become, you know, the boy who cried wolf where when there istime to really raise serious concerns, many people tune them out. So Ithink it is up to other people who have been more fair to the president totell the truth.KURTZ:  Well, Liz, at that same Giuliani presser, he also pushed back hardagainst a question from reporter for the conservative Daily Caller, so thisdoesn't always break down as a left right debate in the media.CLAMAN:  Well, sure. And Fox, let's talk about the 800 pound gorilla in theroom. The president has lashed out at Fox News, but let's be very clearabout something. I am going to defend Fox News very hard on this one. FoxNews, aside from the prime time opinion shows in some opinion shoes on theweekend, Fox News is a news operation.They have covered this case. They have looked very fairly at much of it.And when you have reporters, top reporters, Eric Shawn, Jonathan Hunt,Steve Doocy, all of these names, and Peter Doocy, you know, and JacquiHeinrich. They're doing yeoman's duty here as a news organization, and whatdo they see? They see Rudy Giuliani coming out, talking about quote, "hackjudges".He referenced all kinds of things like a Venezuelan dictator, saying theywere behind and one of them is dead. One of them is alive, and then no hardevidence. And as they look at it and demanded Tucker Carlson the othernight demanded the hard evidence from Sidney Powell, the Trump attorney,did not did not get it.What is a reporter doing here? They are looking at this. I don't know. RudyGiuliani, Jedi master level effort at self destruction on a national stage,Howie, and saying we have judges who are Republican who are kicking thisout. We have attorneys. We have, you know, a lot of legislators right nowwho are saying forget it, and they are covering the story as it proceeds.KURTZ:  Well, that is what a news organization does. And I know some peoplethink that Fox should back President Trump no matter what, but we have tofollow facts. We're a little short on time here so we're going to ask forshort answers. Harold, Reuters poll says that 68 percent of Republicans saythey are concerned the election was rigged.That is a word that President Trump often uses, so his message is gettingout, at least to his party.FORD JR.:  Look, this is what happens at the end of races. I remember in2000 when the 2000 race was contested. I was one of the first if not thefirst in Democratic congress to congratulate George w. Bush. I was a hugesupporter of Al Gore. I was criticized by some Democrats for doing it then.I think Republicans have to step forth, too.The question around media, any media person can ask a question of apolitician or someone making a claim and they ought to defend theirposition regardless of the media organization. That is not what ishappening here. I hope that Joe Biden is able to remove those poll theother way, Howie, that you talked about. We unfortunately entered era wherewe think a Republican judge is supposed to side with Republicans.A Democratic network is supposed side with Democrats. We need to get backto regular order, as some would say in Washington. And I believe that JoeBiden might be -- all people the right person at this time to help us dothat.KURTZ:  All right. And Guy, on a whole new level here, President Trump'staking a lot of heat from media for inviting top Republican lawmakers fromMichigan to White House. And part of an effort, he comes out says to getthem to flip their states. And they came out and said no, no, we think thevote count was fine.Are the media right or wrong in saying that this is pretty unprecedentedand rather troubling?BENSON:  It is troubling, and people are going to be mad I say that, butour job is to tell the truth. And it is troubling. The good news is andthis is on the record before the meeting ever happened. Some of theRepublican -- top Republican legislators, the leaders in some of thesestates that are contested had come out, to my knowledge, unanimously andsaid we aren't going to cave to any sort of pressure.The people have spoken in our states, and the winner of our states will getour legislators. That is the way it ought to be, and that should not be acontroversial thing to say.KURTZ:  Right. You know, it's also stranger that since election, PresidentTrump usually talks to the press all the time, hasn't taken a singlequestion from reporters in nearly three weeks. All right, when we comeback, many in the media demanding the president give Joe Biden and his teamtransition briefings because of the pandemic. And later, Sharyl Attkissonon MEDIA BUZZ.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Donald Trump, Jr. is the latest high profile person to testpositive for the Coronavirus. This is the American death toll passes the250,000 mark. The president is drawing media flak for focusing far more onthe election battle for not cooperating in the transition, and thatcriticism is starting with Joe Biden.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  More people may die ifwe don't coordinate.UNKNOWN:  There has been no effort by the Trumpers except to put Trump'spolitical health first, not your health. Literally, Trumpers are riskingthe fates of so many of you because Trump is upset about his own fate.UNKNOWN:  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they have a lot of work to do afterthe months of fear-mongering about a vaccine. Essentially, if they don'tturn this around and start talking positively about these vaccines, theyare essentially killing people.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  With some Democratic officials, not to mention the CDC,urging people to cancel their holiday plans for fear of spreading thevirus, a conservative counter attack is casting this on a war onThanksgiving.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  Liberals who worship at the altar of Fauci have no problemreaching into your homes and demanding that you behave in a certain way. Ifyou had Thanksgiving plans, they want to shame you into cancelling them.UNKNOWN:  So politicians have now decided they have total power over you.They can literally decide who comes to Thanksgiving dinner at your houseand where they can stand. Let's lunatic -- it's never happened in Americanhistory before.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Liz, there were 198,000 new COVID cases on Fridayalone, to the extent that people are being urged not to travel forThanksgiving. Should that be portrayed as an assault on civil liberties?CLAMAN:  I'll go to Congress -- sorry, Senator Ric Scott who testedpositive on Friday, Republican from Florida. He issued a statement aftertesting positive, and in essence he said listen to the public healthexperts. Translation, you really do want to be awfully careful. And perhapsby saying something that is that serious and that focused and pinpointed.It really shows that there are a lot of people who are rational andthinking about this, not necessarily, you know, Dr. Fauci, but people likethese representatives and these senators who tested positive. Again, why aRepublican has to go and get out there before people listen to it. That isjust the state that we are in right now.But I would say that the American Medical Association, Howie, AmericanNurses Association, they have all really gotten concerned about this, andwe've got a terrible number --(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Guy, it's frustrating to be told don't go visit your grandma. Don'tgo visit your parents for Thanksgiving. It doesn't help when Californiagovernor Gavin Newsom, we've seen the photos now, throws a swanky birthdayparty with no masks, a lot of people sitting together. And for a lobbyist,do you see an emerging war on Thanksgiving?BENSON:  I think the selective shaming is really frustrating to a lot ofAmericans. And you mentioned Governor Newsom, that is just one, right?There is Speaker Pelosi at the salon. There were various Democratic mayors,you know, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C., making exemptions for themselvesto their rules.There were photos over weekend of Democratic political fund-raisershappening indoors in New York City where they've closed schools, which isagainst the best scientific evidence. So a lot of normal people sit athome, see this hypocrisy, see the media loving the crowds of peoplecelebrating Joe Biden's win, and then shaming the MAGA rally.It feels like a lot of it is political, and it should not have to feel thatway. But that is on leadership. That is, I think, on the media to a certainextent. And just to be transparent, Howie, as soon as this show is over, weare driving up for Thanksgiving to see my family, smaller group. We havebeen isolating. We got tested. We're wearings about masks.We're socially distancing, but we're making smart and I think safe choicesfor our family, which is what public officials should be encouraging andgiving us tips rather than all this finger wagging and shaming which seemsto not always apply to everyone.KURTZ:  I hope you enjoy the food. And the double standard you pointed outa fair point. Harold, the media debate seems to be Democratic officialslove lockdowns and Republicans care more about struggling businesses. Butis that rather out moded now that you have Republican governors in placeslike Utah, North Dakota, or Ohio issuing ask mandates, issuing curfews andother restrictions in light of this fall surge.FORD JR.:  Look, we don't need another lockdown. And we certainly alsodon't need a patchwork system to deal with this. We need a national systemand a national strategy. I would push back a little bit with some of thenarrative in the last few minutes. We do have some numbers, 195,000 peoplecontracted the virus. I know that Americans are going to be safe.I know that Americans are going to be vigilant. But it certainly doesn'thurt public health experts and the infrastructure to encourage it in thestrongest of ways. Remember, the people have take care of people who comedown with the virus and face awful, awful health situations are frontlineworkers, I mean, nurses and others who fought back in March and April andJune.I thought we might be in a better position now. So I can only hope thatwhatever you may do this Thanksgiving, and I am normally hosted 40 peopleat my home, my family and my wife's family. We're going to be (Inaudible) Iwould assume a lot of Americans will be. And I wish Guy and his family ahappy Thanksgiving and hope that they do very best in being safe andsocially distance.KURTZ:  Yeah.(CROSSTALK)BENSON:  I agree with that.KURTZ:  All right. Liz, Joe Biden has now been ratcheting up his rhetoricthis week about how President Trump needs to authorize a transition so heand his team especially can get up to speed on these Pfizer and Modernavaccines that he will be in charge of distributing. And let's face it. Themedia basically agree with him on this point.CLAMAN:  Well, so on the business channel, on Fox Business, we coveredsupply chain challenges and things like that. Howie, I can tell you, thisis a bear of an effort ahead. You've got to move this vaccine, millions andmillions doses of it. Scatter it throughout United States. And by the way,a lot of the spiking cases are in red states the moment and rural areas.So you've got to work on that. You've got to get national coordinationwith, you know, freezers that that go down to 90, you know, minus 90degrees. So you're looking at a very big challenge here. And there has tobe coordination, and with the GSA kind of MIA. And Emily Murphy who is theone in charge and not really kind of making that happen that is of concernto every American, I would say.KURTZ:  We got to do. Huge challenge, thank you all, Liz Claman, GuyBenson, and Harold Ford. Up next, we will drill down on the charges made atthat Rudy Giuliani press conference, including his attacks on the press.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Rudy Giuliani made some far-ranging conspiracy allegations at thatrambling news conference that featured tense exchanges with reporters, andsome of the claims were a bit hard to follow.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  You should have asked me -- and you should be more astounded thatour votes are counted in Germany and in Spain by a company owned byaffiliates of Chavez and Maduro.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us now, Fox News correspondent, Griff Jenkins.And Griff, when Giuliani talks about the late Hugo Chavez, when he talksabout George Soros, when Jenna Ellis also on the legal team talks aboutcommunist money financing widespread election for -- what are they talkingabout and are they providing evidence?GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  They're not providing any evidence.Good morning to you, Howie. And look, these are what they are, baseless,unsubstantiated, wildly conspiratorial and serious allegations PresidentTrump's former cybersecurity chief that he just fired, Chris Krebs, calledit the most dangerous hour and 45 minutes in American television history.But here's the thing. I just got off the phone with Jenna Ellis, a part ofthat have legal team and said what do you have to say about these claimsthat you have no evidence for. She says that, look, they do not intend tofile at any point in the coming days in court a complaint or lawsuitrelated to these charges of a massive global conspiracy related to thisdominion voting system.However, Ellis did tell me that they intended to push very hard on theircases, particularly in Pennsylvania where they believe they have thestrongest case. Of course, we just had a judge yesterday rule that -- threwout the Trump lawsuit, threw it out, saying that it didn't have merits. Butshe says that it was a lawsuit that was not handled properly.And they will be back, and they intend to carry this in the courts inPennsylvania and elsewhere, perhaps Michigan between now and December 14th.But to be clear as it relates to Venezuela and Maduro and this Sorosconspiracy, they do not intend to legally challenge it.KURTZ:  Well, thanks for that updated reporting, Griff. Earlier, we playedsound bite of Rudy Giuliani kind of laughing at a CNN reporter. Here he isresponding to a question from a reporter for conservative Daily Caller.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  We're not going to drag it out. I mean, this is ridiculous foryou to say we are dragging it out. Our witnesses don't want to be exposedto the tender mercies of the vicious press.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  I just wanted to say it's not all liberal media. Youhave Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan,  National Review's Rich Lowrytalking about Trump's ugly exit. They're mad at a lot of people in themedia right now.JENKINS:  You know, look, this is becoming a bipartisan media issue witheveryone pointing it out. Liz Claman earlier was telling me, Howie, that,you know, Tucker Carlson is even saying, look, Sidney Powell, if you don'thave evidence of this conspiratorial stuff, then get rid of it. And we sawearlier today on some of the Sunday shows. You saw people like Chris Christie, big supporter of President Trumpsaying, look, this is getting to the point now that it's going to beembarrassing. You have an obligation to either present the evidence or, youknow, get rid of this and stop making this claim because it is going tohurt serious reputations. KURTZ:  Yeah. And when Rudy says he has secret witnesses but can't sharethem with what he calls the vicious media, I have to say it's very hardthen for the press to confirm these allegations. Griff Jenkins, thanks asalways. We really appreciate it. After the break, former CBS reporterSharyl Attkisson says the media are more interested in pushing slantednarratives than pursuing the truth. And later, we'll talk to Geraldo.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  We'll talk to Geraldo.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ (on camera):  When Joe Biden took questions from handpicked reportersin two sessions this week, they mainly asked about Donald Trump and why hewon't cooperate. NBC's Geoff Bennett set the tone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEOFF BENNETT, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT:  What do you see as thebiggest threat to your transition right now given President Trump'sunprecedented attempt to obstruct and delay a smooth transfer of power?UNKNOWN:  What is your message to Republicans who are backing up thepresident's refusal to concede? How many (INAUDIBLE) do you think are atrisk here if this transition remains stalled?YAMICHE ALCINDOR, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  What do you sayto Americans, especially immigrant Americans who came to the United Stateslooking for political stability and seeing all the things that thepresident is doing?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us now to talk about the media is our oldfriend Sharyl Attkisson, author of the new book "Slanted: How the NewsMedia Taught Us to Love Censorship and Hate Journalism." A lot of people dohate journalism these days.Sharyl, based on those questions you just saw and some were about futurepolicies, which is totally appropriate, many were gold-plated invitationsto attack Donald Trump, do you believe the press is starting to hold JoeBiden to the same standard as the incumbent president? SHARYL ATTKISSON, AUTHOR:  There is no doubt that that is not the case andprobably not going to be the case.I think beyond how this impacts a candidate or a political figure, there isgreat harm being done to our industry and the public's ability to trust thethings that we report and trust that we are coming at news stories with aneutral viewpoint and a fair analysis of what is going on rather thantrying to take one side or the other.I think that is the problem when it comes to hard journalism.KURTZ:  Sharyl, you've interviewed President Trump. In fact, he retweetedyou just this morning and you criticized the media's negative coverage ofhim in many ways. Have the last four years radicalized you and your view ofthe press? ATTKISSON:  Well, I think I've just continued along a continuum that Istarted looking at couple of years back when I saw political incorporateinterests really influencing the topics we do and don't cover on the news,and then I tracked how they became commonplace in our news. In fact, westarted to hire some of these special interests, not just kind of do whatthey say, but they are us now, in my view.And then in 2016, I tracked with a lot of facts and footnotes andcitations, how the news media took leaps and bounds forward down thisdevolution, as I call it, away from the standards and practices we havelong tried to follow to at least give a semblance of a firewall betweenopinion and fact.And we threw it out the window proudly and even cheered on by non-profitnews watchdog organizations, journalism schools, journalism professors --KURTZ:  Right.ATTKISSON: -- the New York Times, as if we were proud to do this. I see itas a dangerous --(CROSSTALK)ATTKISSON:  -- public confidence and the things we report. Obviously, thepeople see that differently but that is just from where I sit.KURTZ:  Well, we want your take. Let me quote your book. You talk a lotabout the power of media narratives. You write, Trump is the vehicle thatthe media at large has used to unleash its furor and redefine journalism.What do you mean by that?ATTKISSON:  Well, when you talk about me being critical of negativecoverage of Trump, I would word it a little differently. I have beencritical not that he has gotten negative coverage. I have been critical ofthe double standard and the mistakes and the false news that has beenlobbed at him unquestioningly and unskeptically by a press that is veryanxious to take a side when it comes to this president uniquely likethey've done as far as I've seem to no other.And I think this is something that if we step back, we would understandthis is harmful to us as a profession and the public confidence -- theconfidence the public has in what we are reporting and what we are doingwhere since we appear to be taking sides so vehemently in many situations,they come to distrust everything we report, even when we are telling thetruth or not taking a side, and then we turn around --KURTZ:  Are you seeing that happen? Are you seeing that happen with whatmight be considered legitimate reporting in this post-election period withthe president's tactics in contesting this election? Do you think themedia's loss of credibility is making people not believe even our straightnews reports?ATTKISSON:  Some people, yes. You know, I think that there would have beenno harm for straight news reporters to not take a side in this, to let itplay out instead of saying one side is being ridiculous.And lying and unpatriotic could not the neutral press that simply said,here is what they say. And let the public determine what they think aboutthat. They may think it is ridiculous. They can think for themselves. Andthen report what is known --KURTZ:  Mm-hmm.ATTKISSON:  -- about the other side and hold off on putting your ownopinions and disparagement because then, the press doesn't trust -- thepublic doesn't trust in some cases the rest of what you say. They don'tknow where the line is drawn because they think that you've got a horse inthe fight. KURTZ:  Right. Two more things I want to get to. One is early in thepandemic, early this year. The New York Times branded you one of five topcoronavirus doubters. You asked for retraction. What happened?ATTKISSON:  Well, they misquoted me. They put false information in there.It was outrageous. I had only done some factual reporting, actually verylittle about coronavirus at that point in time. It mirrored much of whatthe Times itself had reported. But there was clearly someone trying to geta narrative out for some reason against me and other people, maybe ahead ofwhat they thought we might be covering.And I had to hire a lawyer because the Times dug in their heels, didn'tcare that there was false information and false quotes. The lawyer was ableto press them and get multiple corrections. Of course, many people don'tsee the corrections. They only see the original report.And as I write about in my book, that is mission accomplished for those whotry to press a narrative. They know that if they get the word out thereeven if it is not true, by the time it is corrected --KURTZ:  Yeah.ATTKISSON:  -- a lot of people will never see that. KURTZ:  Just briefly, you once worked at CNN. You quote one time CNN anchorLou Waters as saying I can't watch CNN, Walter Cronkite would roll over hisgrave. And you contrasted the way you anchored there many years ago withAnderson Cooper after a Trump news conference on his meeting with VladimirPutin. Explain.ATTKISSON:  Yes. You know, we would wrap up a news conference with thepresident and not even think about whether we liked him or not or agreedwith what he said. We would simply repeat factually a summary of what hesaid compared to Anderson Cooper coming out of a Trump news conferencesaying something like that was the most ridiculous, outrageous thing I haveever heard. KURTZ:  Disgraceful. ATTKISSON:  And it just shows how far CNN has changed, how different it isfrom what it was in 1990. We talk about that in the book with a lot ofinterviews from CNN (ph), executives, news executives from the broadcastnetworks who are as concerned as some of the rest of us about the turn newshas taken --KURTZ:  Right.ATTKISSON:  -- not just at CNN but across our industry.KURTZ:  Yeah. Cooper actually used the word disgraceful. The book isslanted. Good to see you, Sharyl Attkisson. Thanks so much for being here.ATTKISSON:  Thanks.KURTZ:  After the break, Geraldo Rivera weighs in on the Trump electionbattle and his conversation with his old friend. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Joining us now from Cleveland is a longtime friend of Donald Trump,Geraldo Rivera, the veteran Fox commentator --GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE:  Hi, Howie.KURTZ:  -- and reporter. And Geraldo, hi there. You spoke to the presidenta little more than a week ago. You said he told you that he was -- quote --"a realist and would do the right thing." Is he doing the right thing nowby continuing to claim that he won this election? RIVERA:  Well, when we had the conversation, Howie, it really did seem tome that he was grudgingly coming to the conclusion that he had lost theelection and that if the various lawsuits, etcetera did not play out, thathe would go along with the traditional process. That was totally myimpression, that he wouldn't be clinging to the resolute desk in the OvalOffice, that he would concede the election or at least go through with thetransition.That was on a Friday, week ago Friday. On Saturday, if you recall, he wentto play golf and he drove through the crowds of supporters that hadgathered almost spontaneously there in Washington, D.C.It just seemed to me that the love and the determination of his supportersthat was demonstrated there as he drove through the crowd, as he waived toeverybody, strengthened his resolve or at least changed his mind in the waythat made him much more defiant and much more resistant to what seemedincreasingly obvious, that he had lost the election, Howie.KURTZ:  Well, you wanted him to win. There is no question. You describedhim in this conversation as being angry, as being dissolution, as beingsomewhat wounded. Do you think that your old friend now should graciouslyconcede this election?RIVERA:  Well, yes, I do. You know, I want him to show grace and goodmanners and honor the tradition. The election of 2020 is lost. I felt veryembarrassed watching another old friend, Rudy Giuliani and his team, SidneyPowell and the others, in what seemed a bizarre and disconnected pressconference raising allegations that -- we are from the far side of the moonas far as I was concerned.I met Hugo Chavez. He couldn't make the traffic lights work in Caracasduring the time I knew him before he passed away. And George Soros, thatold (INAUDIBLE) again and, you know -- it just seemed the Clintonfoundation. I said, come on, this is this is silly stuff.And I think that what it did was, you know, lower, in my view and I thinkthe view of many people who love the president, the whole position of anoble well thought contest in which he defied the odds, he defied thepollsters, he wounded the Democratic Party in a way that was very historicprofound even --KURTZ:  Yeah.RIVERA:  And when the circus came to town, it just seemed to me to be adiversion from the noble image that I would like my friend to have as heleaves office. KURTZ (on camera):  Geraldo, let me play for you a clip that has got a lotof attention, Fox's Tucker Carlson talking about his dealings with Trumpattorney, Sidney Powell.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  We invited Sidney Powell on the show. Wewould have given her the whole hour. But she never sent us any evidencedespite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page. When we keptpressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Sidney Powell told Fox Business's Tucker was beingrude. He says even other Trump lawyers haven't seen her evidence. What isyour take on this latest twist?RIVERA:  Putting aside Tucker's rudeness --(LAUGHTER)RIVERA:  -- I think that is a different issue, I totally agree with himsubstantively. Sidney Powell in that press conference was as disconnectedfrom reality as Rudy Giuliani was. In a way, they were enabling each other.I thought when you -- I am a lawyer. I have been around. When Pennsylvaniadropped one of their suits in Michigan and the other legal dominoes startedfalling, it became obvious pretty soon that we were not going to reversethe results of the election. We are not Belarus. We are not Uganda.We don't reverse presidential election unless there is some obvious andeasily provable reason for it to bring in this whole notion of, you know,these mysterious forces, changing computes and -- it just -- it seemedalmost like, you know, a UFO kind of story, Howie.KURTZ:  Right. I was just quoting Sidney Powell in terms of her dealingswith Tucker. By the way, you are getting a lot of mockery, as you know, forsuggesting that the vaccine that will finally come on to market should benamed after President Trump. I will give you a chance to respond.RIVERA:  Well, my wife says that she is a Democrat, that we should name itthe Fauci.(LAUGHTER)RIVERA:  I -- I -- you know, maybe I said it happened just when I said thatit should be called the Trump. But here is a guy -- at least it is aconsolation prize of some sort. There is no doubt that he was the drivingforce behind Operation Warp Speed. Maybe his motives were political, thathe wanted it in time for the election so he could be see, I got you thevaccine, I cured this awful global pandemic.It did not happen. I think the politics did influence the timing of theannouncement of the vaccine. He should get some credit for it. I don't careabout mockery. Why do I care about Brian Williams and his opinion or DonLemon? They never said anything nice about me in the 51 years I have beenon and I am still on.KURTZ:  All right.RIVERA:  I mean, my 20th generation of (INAUDIBLE), and I am still here.KURTZ:  I got it. I got 20 seconds. The Washington Post says the presidentis talking about giving speeches, writing a book, maybe starting a network,maybe running again in 2024. Do you think he knows that ultimately he haslost this election?RIVERA:  As I said, as he said, quoting him, he is a realist, he knowseverything we know. He is also a very proud man. He will come around. Youknow, Thanksgiving is a good week for it to happen.I think that all will be well. Biden will get all the info he needs if hehasn't it already. We will go on. He will be the 46th president. We willlive happily ever after until -- don't think you have heard the last ofDonald Trump.KURTZ:  All right.RIVERA:  If you do, you don't know the man very well.KURTZ:  I would never suggest that. But for now, we have heard the last ofGeraldo. Thanks very much for being here.RIVERA:  Right. Thanks, Howie.KURTZ:  Still to come, Christiane Amanpour sort of regrets her latestattack on the president. Andrew Cuomo gets very testy with reporters. Andthe White House press corps erupts at a COVID briefing. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ (on camera):  We told you last week that CNN's Christiane Amanpourhad outrageously compared the Trump presidency to Kristallnacht, the Nazis'murderous rampage against Jews 82 years ago. After a fierce backlash, shesaid this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is theevent that began the horrors of the holocaust. I also noted PresidentTrump's attacks on history, facts, knowledge, and truth. I shouldn't havejuxtaposed the two thoughts. Hitler and his evil stand alone, of course, inhistory. I regret any pain my statement may have caused.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Sorry, but regretting any pain I may have caused is notan apology. Amanpour's words about Hitler will be on the pale yet to alittle media coverage and no public comment from CNN.Andrew Cuomo became a media hero in the early days of the epidemic forthose bland and sometimes witty daily briefings, but New York governor istaking a lot of heat for the pressure this week in which he scoldedreporters beginning with The Wall Street Journal correspondent who askedwhether he would intervene to close New York City's public schools the nextday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  First of all, let's try not to be obnoxious andoffensive in your tone, because you are 100 percent wrong. We did italready. That is the law. An orange zone and a red zone. Follow the facts.UNKNOWN (voice-over):  I'm just still confused.CUOMO:  (INAUDIBLE) confused?UNKNOWN (voice-over):  I think Jimmy is correct in asking that question. Idon't think it's obnoxious at all.CUOMO:  Well, I don't really care what you think.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Cuomo is known as (INAUDIBLE) as the toughest nailspolitician who pushes back against the press and we just got a glimpse ofthat side of him.Now, Cuomo, who disputes criticism that his policies contributed to nearly7,000 nursing home deaths, has been awarded an international Emmy for hismasterful use of television at the briefings, which seems pretty odd untilyou consider that this group is also under such liberals as Al Gore, NormanLear, and Oprah Winfrey.Vice President Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force held their firsttelevised briefing in months after growing criticism in the White House.And when they left without taking questions, the White House press corpserupted.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROSSTALK)UNKNOWN:  All of you need to answer this.UNKNOWN:  Why is it that --HUNTER WALKER, YAHOO NEWS REPORTER:  What is going on? You are not workingwith the transition. You are all part of not recognizing democracy. You areall undermining the democratic election, every one of you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  That was Yahoo's Hunter Walker shouting you're allundermining the democratic election. Look, I think they should have takenreporters' questions. But some of that shouting didn't just look bad. Itsounded pretty partisan.Rachel Maddow returned to MSNBC after self-quarantining, revealing that herpartner, Susan Mikula, had a very bad case of the virus and how much it hadshaken her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:  Susan has been sick with COVID these pastcouple of weeks. At one point, we really thought that there was apossibility that it might kill her. Whatever you are doing, however youcalibrated risk in your life, don't get this thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Well, I'm glad it turned out well. And yes, that adviceis spot on. Please, every one, please, take every precaution you can toavoid this virus.We are out of time. Thank you for watching. We try to get as much in on thepandemic and the election and everything that we can to you. We are backhere next Sunday at 11:00 Eastern.
