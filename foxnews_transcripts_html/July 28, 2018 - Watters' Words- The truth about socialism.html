JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to "Watters' World." I'm Jesse Watters. The truth about socialism, that's the subject of tonight's "Watters' Words." There was a big blow up on "The View" this week, Meghan McCain and Joy Behar in a shout fest over socialism.

WATTERS: Now, let's look at the facts about socialism, shall we? Venezuela -- a rich country blessed with bountiful natural resources is now a hell hole. Look what the experiment with socialism has wrought. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. Starvation -- the average person lost 24 pounds last year, and they are not trying to diet. Sick people are taking dog medicine.

There is a massive toilet paper shortage and it's now the murder capital of the world behind El Salvador. 
If Democrat want to be bring socialism to America, it makes me wonder, do they want to destroy America? Now, they're going to say, "Oh, no we mean Scandinavian countries, that's where socialism works." Democratic socialism, like Sweden. The Scandinavian socialism success story is a liberal fantasy. You know a country that's doing better than Sweden? Switzerland because it's a capitalist power house. 
Sweden isn't even really a truly socialist country anymore. Sweden was going off a cliff until about a decade ago when conservatives took over and implemented pro-capitalist reforms. Plus the Scandinavians nations are teeny and homogenous, they don't even compare to America.

This Cortez individual says she wants free healthcare, free housing and free college. Free healthcare alone costs $30 trillion. You raise taxes on everyone in America and that won't even make a dent in paying that bill. 
And if socialists don't trust Trump, why give the Trump administration more power over your life? You want Trump in charge of your healthcare. You want Trump as your landlord. You want Trump running our colleges? I thought didn't like Trump University.

The Federal government has a hard enough time taking care of our vets, securing the border and protecting us from hackers. The Obama administration couldn't even launch a website, and you want to give the government more responsibility? 
So when you hear people talk about socialism, just ask them, where has socialism ever worked?

Here with reaction, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk and the host of CRTV's "Michelle Malkin Investigates, " Michelle Malkin. All right, Michelle, let's start with you. What do you think about this socialism experiment within the Democratic Party?

MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, "MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES": Well, I think that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is everything that's wrong with overpriced liberal ivory towers plus extreme radical identity politics plus a slavering liberal media advocacy machine that is waiting for you the next savior. 
And Ocasio-Cortez really is like the logical fruit of the radical progressivism that we survived under Barack Obama. I mean, this is the man who said you didn't build that, who at some point you've earned enough money. And so of course now, we have this progeny, Ocasio-Cortez who is so economically and historically illiterate, Jesse, and thank you for giving that overview in your opening points there because you don't get that most liberal universities. 
I mean, she is so clueless. This is somebody who graduated with an economics degree from Boston University, she claims, who doesn't even know what the unemployment rate is.

CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: She must have missed a couple of classes. Only in the university could you learn some of the nonsense that she is spewing. I find it funny, if socials professors really believed the nonsense that they profess, why don't they teach for free? Why do they sell the books back to the kids and why do they charge so much per credit hour?

If they're such benevolent and wonderful communitarians and socialists, just do it for free. Get rid of the profit structure. Be a true example of that which in a Marxist society -- but of course, it's really interesting, those people that hate America, which I believe this is rooted in anti-Americanism. 
WATTERS: I do, too.

        }
      
KIRK: And what's so unique about America, we are the only country in the world, in the history of the world where even those who hate it refuse to leave. I always notice that the biggest proponents of socialism aren't those waiting in bread lines. 
WATTERS: You don't see a lot of people in Venezuela, Michelle, coming over to this country and advocating for socialist reforms, and just look at the news this week. You have 4.1 percent GDP growth. Record low unemployment. The EU trade deal starting to move forward. The remains of Korean War veterans are finally returning from North Korea. Things are going pretty well, and it seems like the socialist left wants to stop the progress.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MALKIN: Yes, that's right. They can't stand it, and so I believe, so much of the radical left which is the mainstream of the Democrat Party doesn't only hate America. They hate the fact that we are founded on this principle of unleashing the great potential of hard working ambitious people.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And under Obama, we had eight years of wealth shaming and success shaming, and it's only going to get worse under the Ocasio-Cortez regime which is again, taking over the mainstream of the Democratic Party. 
Here is what I want to say, which is very important because these people are peddling an ideology that is based on dependency and coercion. And these things are the most anti-progressive of values. They are regressive. There are not enough people in the media who want to tell the stories, and I have people all the time over the last 25 years who are like me -- who are children or grandchildren of immigrants who love this country because of the potentials that it promised them. It was not a guarantee. It was not an entitlement. 
It was simply the opportunity that which we enjoy. Look, I have been in this business for 25 years. I've started three web ventures. I am a proud unapologetic capitalist quote-unquote "of color." And the only color that we care about really of course is green, not because we are greedy, but because we are trying to put find our table and other people's tables.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });

        }
      
I have been able to employ dozens of people, and every one of these businesses is based on voluntary associations of people mutually pursuing their self-interests. That is the beauty of American exceptionalism that people like Ocasio-Cortez have never ever experienced in their lives. These are people only who have signed the back of a paycheck, and not the front of a paycheck. 
WATTERS: That's right and I think Meghan McCain, Charlie made the point, if you want to pay your taxes, there's a little box there that you can say, "Check," and you can voluntarily give more money to the government, but just picking up on something that Michelle just said, since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 and 1981, worldwide poverty has gone from like 70 percent down to 10 percent, and incomes have risen almost over 100 percent worldwide. That's not because of the spread of socialism, that is the spread of free market capitalism. 
KIRK: Right, so free market capitalism has been the greatest wealth creating engine in the history of the world. Life expectancy in the year 1900 was a little over 40 years. Now, we are living late into our 80s. We have an abundance problem in the west. We throw away more food than we consume.

We have an obesity epidemic, not a starvation epidemic. Now, mind you, it's very important, you can look at human migratory patterns as the best argument against Marxism. No one ever flees free market capitalism to go back to Marxism. They are leaving Havana for Miami, they're not leaving Miami for Havana.

WATTERS: That's a great point. I mean, that's a great point. Michelle, when you hear people denigrate the American system like Cortez does, when we talked about importing socialism into America, do you really believe she thinks socialism can be successfully implemented in America and people can thrive? Or do you believe, and I am starting to have my doubts about this, do you believe they want to bring socialism here because they want to slow down America? 
MALKIN: Well, I think that they are -- as their ultimate goal, trying to bring down everything that made this country great in the first place. You can only do that if you are untethered from reality, and history and economic principles, how they actually work in real life, and that's why it's such a meme. I mean, it's an internet joke when you have these socialists and try to argue with them about the real world pragmatic impact.

KIRK: I love Allie. She did a great job there, and look, if you actually look at -- you look at Ocasio-Cortez's real interviews, it's not far off. She thinks the unemployment rate is dropping because people are taking two jobs. She thinks that Israel is illegally occupying Palestine. What was the other gem she said the other day? Oh, yes, socialism hasn't been tried despite it being tried over a hundred times in the last hundred years and over a hundred million people dead as a result of it, so.

MALKIN: Go for it. Go for it, and I do want to give a shout out to Allie Stuckey. She is a colleague of mine at crtv.com and the insanity around the reaction to that shows you a couple of things, one is the double standards of course. They love those same techniques when to Stephen Colbert uses them every single week, and they can't stand the fact that conservatives, whether it's Charlie Kirk or me or you, Jesse, or Allie actually has fun bringing down these people and exposing them for how vacuous and moronic they really are. 
And so, what do you have here? The bottom line point here though is that just like with Barack Obama, they are propping up these empty vessels because it's all they have. It's moral bankruptcy. It is historic and economic bankruptcy and it's going to fail. Look, the Democratic Party slogan sounds like it's ripped off from Maduro or Chavez in Venezuela. For the people, right, we get it. We know. Crumbs for the people. That's what it's really about.

WATTERS: Oh, man. All right, well listen, Michelle, Charlie, we're just trying to educate people out there. I don't think a lot of people know about socialism. I don't even think Cortez knows about socialism. Maybe she is watching and she could take some notes. Guys, thank you, guys very much.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR, NEW YORK, DEMOCRAT: This administration is on a crusade against people who they do not consider original Americans. What they have done at the border is an example of it, what they have done in Puerto Rico, and they are on a jihad to deport as many people as they can who they believe are not in the United States legally.

WATTERS: Tom Homan, recently retired as acting ICE director under President Trump and he joins me now. So, Tom, what is your emotional reaction when you hear comedians and politicians denigrate the men and women who protect our country at the border? 
THOMAS HOMAN, RETIRED ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: That's the greatest insult to the men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE. Look, the comparison to terrorist organizations, does this comedian understand that ICE investigates terrorist organizations? We are the largest participant in the joint terrorism task force. We have presence in over 30 countries across the globe, what we call the visa security program. We have prevented nearly 8,000 people from getting a visa to come to this country that our intelligence show they will come to this country to do harm. 
So, for the men and women that serve this nation probably every day, that's an insult. She doesn't know the first thing about serving our nation.

I want to show you some video of the guest we had just before you, Charlie Kirk was down there riding around with an ICE agent at the border. And they were talking about some of these kids, the minors that they had briefly separated from their parents or so-called parents. And here is what he had to say. It's pretty interesting. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These kids are like -- they are hard -core. They will take your lunch money when you're five. 
KIRK: Yes. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Immediately after we separated them, they established a hierarchy within the area that they were separated in. So there was one child -- a child.
KIRK: Like eight years old? Nine years old? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was running the entire team there and telling other kids what they needed to do and taking their cookies -- it was weird. Taking their cookies and stuff like that. We had another separation where they were having sexual relationship through the chain link fence.

WATTERS: Now, this week, I believe finally, the Trump administration has reunited officially under a court order, the families -- so-called families-- the ones that actually were families, but I just want to get your take on some of these people down there. Yes, there were innocent children that were separated and that was very a hard thing to watch and experience. But some of these people weren't their parents. Other people were human smugglers, drug traffickers and some of these minors -- 16, 17, 15 -- some hard-core people. 
HOMAN: Of course, I am going to talk about Governor Cuomo real quick what ICE has done on the border about family separations. He needs to learn the difference between Border Patrol and ICE first of all. You want to (inaudible) an agency for something that another agency does. 
I support what the Border Patrol did. I believe in family separations because if you get arrested and get prosecuted for a crime just like any American family, you're going to get separated. But getting back to these kids, Operation Matador, an MS-13 operation that ICE did in New York on Long Island, New York last year, 40 percent of the MS-13 people we arrested entered this country as unaccompanied alien children. 
WATTERS: You're kidding me. 
HOMAN: No, no. So, some of these children I feel bad for them. I feel bad for the plight of some of these people, but when you violate laws in this country, you've got be held accountable. 
But understand, when we talk about separating the children, the vast majority of these children are between the ages of 15 and 17. These aren't toddlers we're talking about.

WATTERS: And I just think that people that are watching this need to understand the realistic scenario down there at the border. It's not a bunch of kids with popsicles coming across in strollers. It's a very vicious and dangerous situation, and we're trying to be humanitarian, but at the same time, you're trying to protect the country. 
Now, Nancy Pelosi says the Democrats are the ones that are really protecting the borders. And guess what she'd called 9/11. Listen to this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: When we had the 9/11 incident and the Commission was formed and made the recommendations, they made recommendations to protect America. But the Republicans would never take them up, and some of it was about our borders. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: I don't know what's more preposterous, her calling 9/11 an incident or her claiming the Democrats are stronger on border security. 
HOMAN: I was asked about this earlier this morning and my first response was, what color is the sky in her world? I've seen her make a lot of preposterous statements, but come on, I mean, does she support the border wall?

        }
      
WATTERS: No. 
HOMAN: And that's going to affect her replace-ability. Do they support shutting down the loopholes on immigration? Let's talk about why family separation. You know why families are separated? Because her and a lot of people that are with her, fail to fix the loopholes that cause these families to come to the border. 
So, I've said it a hundred times. I'll say it a hundred times more. There has been nobody that has done more for border security and public safety than President Trump and I've worked for six presidents. I respect them all, but nobody has done more than this administration and President Trump. That's just a stone cold fact from a guy that has done it for 34 years. 
WATTERS: All right, Tom. Well, thank you for your service, and President Trump needs a little help on Capitol Hill if he wants to get everything straightened out down there. I appreciate you coming in. 
HOMAN: I appreciate you, sir. 
WATTERS: All right, the so-called tolerant left out of control. Ready? A black gay Army veteran who has had enough of their bullying tactics has now come out as a Republican. He'll be here next. 
MARIANNE RAFFERTY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Marianne Rafferty. Family members now confirming that three people missing in a northern California wildfire have died bringing the death toll to five since flames broke out on Monday.

And the Trump administration saying it has met the deadline to reunite all eligible children aged five to seventeen with their families at the border, but that there are about 700 children who do not qualify for reunification due to safety concerns like a parent's criminal history. The government is also saying that more than 400 parents have been deported and that officials said they would work with the courts to figure out a process for reunification. 
I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to "Watters' World." 
WATTERS: Trump derangement syndrome among the liberals is out of control. This week, a vandal destroyed President Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickax. Two years after another vandal defaced it, and this comes just weeks after an innocent 16 year old boy was attacked in a restaurant for wearing his "Make America Great Again" hat. And a protester climbed the Statue of Liberty all in the name of illegal immigration. 
What's wrong with the so-called left? I thought they were supposed to be tolerant. My next guest is a black gay Army veteran who was a Democrat. He became so fed up with the outrageous bullying from liberals that he switched parties and became a Republican. Rob Smith joins me now. 
All right, so Rob, you grew up as a Democrat. 
ROB SMITH, ARMY VETERAN: Absolutely. 
WATTERS: What made you switch parties to become a Republican?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SMITH: I think that for me, I got so sick of the lies. Specifically what they were telling black people. So, when you are a black person you get these messages from Democrats, it says that you are a victim. It says that you need us to succeed, you need us to achieve, you need this ever expanding welfare state to be able to make something of yourself. 
And for me, I got so tired of it and I got sick of that message that I needed them, and I got sick of that message of victimhood that they continue to push to black Americans over and over and over again for the last three decades of my life. 
WATTERS: Now, I believe the reason that the Democratic Party does that to people, that even are curious about leaving the Democratic Party, they need strong party discipline. They can't allow their base, whether it's Hispanics, whether its blacks, whether it's young women or young millennials, they can't allow them to think outside the box and even entertain becoming a Republican or even listen to Republican ideas because they need those votes come November. 
SMITH: They need those votes come November and also what they want to do is they want to keep people in line. I think democrats use identity politics to keep people in line, to keep black people in line, to keep Latinos in line. To keep gay people in line. I'm black and buy gay, and I have seen them use the same tactics for black people as they do for gay people. 
WATTERS: Was it harder for you to come out as a Republican or harder to come out as a gay American? 
SMITH: Well, here's the thing, I never lost -- I didn't lose friends when I came out as gay. I've lost friends since coming out as a Republican. People do not understand it, and these are the left that's supposed to be so tolerant and so inclusive, and these are the people that were the first to shun me when I came out as a conservative Republican. 
WATTERS: We have some messages, I guess on social media. This one guy says, "Look at all the approval you are getting from white people. Is this why you do this for? Black people need to stop saying what white people want they want to hear and come together and deal with our issues as a people, not sell out to the people who caused them harm in the first place."  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When you read something like that, how does that make you feel? 
SMITH: It doesn't make me feel great. I mean, I have been called everything but child of God since I came out as a Republican. They call you sell out, they call you Uncle Tom, they call you all these things, but I think that the idea is why can't I have different ideas? Why can't I be free thinking? Why can't I have a victor mentality? Why do all of these things that I am thinking of that I think could benefit me and other people that look like me, it doesn't always have something to do with white people? It could just be that there are different ideas that I'm connecting to more. 
WATTERS: All right, speaking of different ideas. We are just going to play this because it's just kind of interesting to watch. Roseanne Barr was on Sean Hannity's show the other night. We all remember what Roseanne said and how she was fired and why she was fired. Well, this is the first TV interview that she did since that firing from ABC and here is what she had to say. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ROSEANNE BARR, AMERICAN ACTRESS: America is a place where I, a loud mouthed, old, gorgeous, Jewish woman comedian am allowed freedom of speech. They were saying it was racial when it's political. I wish I had worded it better, but I'm not going to let them tell me what I meant. I'm not a racist and the people who voted for Trump, they are not racist either, and Trump isn't a racist. Sorry. 
When things are going too far right, I'm going to go a low left, and when things are going too far left, I am going to go a little right. I like the middle opinion that balances two extremes. Most people in America I think, think like that. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Well, she never should have said what she said or tweeted about Valerie Jarett the way she did that was really, really bad, but what do you think about her explanation and her asking for forgiveness? 
SMITH: I completely accept it. Look, I am one of the few black people who did not think that she should have lost her job after those comments.
WATTERS: Why not? 
SMITH: For me, because I don't think that they were racist. To me, when you look at Valley Jarrett, it's not too far outside of the realm of possibility for somebody to think that Valerie Jarrett is white. There are a lot of people that don't know she is very ambiguously ethnic. So, I didn't take that -- it's a very negative comment and it was a nasty comment. I don't know if it's necessarily racial. That's not how I took it, but then as Americans, do we give people an opportunity to apologize? Do we give people an opportunity to be contrite? 
But no, they didn't give her that opportunity. They wanted to shut her down and what I think the left does, what I think Democrats do is they use accusations of racism. They use those words to shut people down and get rid of those people, and by the way, the same people that wanted Roseanne fired are the same people that are rallying behind James Gunn. 
WATTERS: Right, the other guy that made all of those horrible pedophiles.
SMITH: That made the horrible pedophile jokes on Twitter, so the same people that call for Roseanne to be fired are the same ones that are rallying behind James Gunn and saying that it wasn't correct that he got fired. 
WATTERS: All right, Rob, thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
SMITH: Thank you. 
WATTERS: The New York Times has posted its summer fun guide, but if you're a white guy, don't even bother. Wait until you hear what they said right back from the break. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're drunk in Midtown doing cheap coke off of your laundry card, I have just the place for you. New York's hottest club is garish and fired by true events. This one with CBS which became a choice bank and then became a CBS again has a familiar yet, troubling feel, like when Larry King would play himself in a movie. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: The New York Times has come out with their list of the hottest events for the summer called, "The Ultimate Guide to this Fabulous Summer" including man-free zones, a leather weekend, a trans pageant, a bunch of witches meeting in the woods, and a Two Spirit gathering. 
But don't bother if you are a straight white man, you probably are not going to be welcome at several of these events. They actually say that. Liberal commentator Cathy Areu is here to fill me on what's been going on and what I've been missing out on -- I mean, I'm probably not welcome to some of these stuff, but what is witch camp? And why does the "New York Times" want you to go to witch camp? 
CATHY AREU, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: I don't know if they want you to go, they are just letting you know about it. But you learn about witch craft and everything to do with potions and. 
WATTERS: Potions? 
AREU: Yes, yes, things that are a little bit anti-male and pro-woman and yes. 
WATTERS: Potions. Witches are anti-male. 
AREU: Well, this witch camp in particular I think is for women only. 
WATTERS: Are you going to be going to witch camp? 
AREU: No, I don't need to go. 
WATTERS: No? 
AREU: No. I'm fluent in watch. 
WATTERS: You ride around in your broomstick and cast spells. 
AREU: Yes, I am comfortable. Yes, I am comfortable with that, yes. 
WATTERS: Okay, and so, they is also a two-spirit gathering in Montana. What is a two spirit gathering? 
AREU: A two spirit -- I think it's with the Native Americans. That's a non-binary meeting in -- is that the one? 
WATTERS: I mean, is Elizabeth Warren going to be there? 
AREU: She could be, yes, because she is part Indian, so part Native American. 
WATTERS: Okay, so she says. Not Indian. 
AREU: Sorry -- I know, I know. 
WATTERS: Cathy, it's Native American. 
AREU: Native American. 
WATTERS: Try to clean it up. 
AREU: I'm sorry. 
WATTERS: All right, and they also have things men can't go and I think in Sweden, only sis gender men. What is sis gender? 
AREU: Sis gender is how you identify yourself, so it could be as a man, not as a man, so it's your choice. 
WATTERS: So, I could identify as a woman and go, but if I go as a man, I can't? 
AREU: Yes, pretty much. 
WATTERS: Okay, that's fascinating. All right, let's talk about something that's even more fascinating. In the University of Minnesota, they are considering new guidelines. If you mispronounce someone, so if you say "he" when that person identifies as a she, you can get in big trouble. 
AREU: Or the other way around. 
WATTERS: Or the other way around. 
AREU: Or Ze or Zoe. There are many.
WATTERS: What is Ze and Zoe? 
AREU: Well, those are different pronouns, gender neutral pronouns. 
WATTERS: What does Zoe mean? 
AREU: Well, it could be what you want it to mean. I mean, that's the beauty of it. You can pick your own. 
WATTERS: What gender is Zoe? 
AREU: Well, it's the gender you want it to be. 
WATTERS: You can just make up the gender out of thin air? 
AREU: You could choose your own gender pronoun for yourself, yes. 
WATTERS: Well, how is the person addressing you supposed to know which pronoun to use? 
AREU: You would let that person know what gender you would want to be called and then you would have to respect that. So the university knows what its student population wants for a healthy learning environment and it's creating that community of respect and equality. 
WATTERS: And you support this? 
AREU: I think it's -- they know best. They know their students best. 
WATTERS: They do? 
AREU: Yes. So I support them supporting their students. 
WATTERS: Okay. 
AREU: Yes. 
WATTERS: Go Golden Goafers. Lastly, we have the war on straws, Cathy, so I guess, Santa Barbara City Council is saying straws are bad because they are plastic and if you run a restaurant and you hand out straws to your patrons and if you get caught doing that, handing out plastic straws, you can face fines and up to six months in jail for straws. 
AREU: For straws, yes. It's bad for the environment. So actually, it's bad for everyone. So this is helping everyone. It's for all of us. It's for all of our states. 
WATTERS: Okay, so they don't lock up criminal illegal aliens in California. 
AREU: Well, undocumented.
WATTERS: They lock up straw distributors. 
AREU: People, you mean? No one is illegal. 
WATTERS: When you come across the border illegally, that makes you illegal. 
AREU: Well, a person can't be illegal. It can be undocumented, but never illegal. 
WATTERS: Well, I am calling them illegal because they are breaking the law. 
AREU: But I am sure -- so I am sure they are tackling their immigration issues and they are tackling their drug issues and they are tackling other issues, and they are taking care of all of us by taking care of the environment. 
WATTERS: Okay, well I don't know if they have their priorities straight over there in California. That's all I'm saying. 
AREU: They are helping all of us. How can those priorities be wrong? 
WATTERS: Okay, Cathy, thank you. Coming up. See this girl right here? Her boyfriend dumped her. Want to know why? He wanted to play more video games. That's right. He broke up with her because he wanted to play more video games. Diamond and Silk react, next. 
A Georgia state lawmaker being forced to resign his office following a very disturbing appearance on "Borat's" show, Sasha Baron Cohen, the show is called, "Who is America." Watch what happens as Republican Jason Spencer meets with Cohen who he thought was an Israeli expert to film an anti- terrorism training video. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SASHA BARON COHEN, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Because of who you are, you could be the victim of kidnapping by ISIS. In America, there is one forbidden word. It is the "N" word. You have three seconds to attack the tension, go. 
JASON SPENCER, AMERICAN POLITICIAN: [Bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]. 
COHEN: You crazy -- the "N" word is looney, not this word. If your buttock touch them, it means they have become a. 
SPENCER: Homosexual. 
COHEN: We say in the Mossad, I mean, not in the Mossad, if you want to win, you show some skin. Go. 
SPENCER: Go, go. USA, USA. [Bleep]. 
COHEN: Okay, you show me your weapon, go. 
SPENCER: I'll touch you and make you a homosexual, you drop that gun right now. USA, USA. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Joining me now, Diamond and Silk. Ladies, you have got to have a better BS meter than that. I mean, come on. What was this guy thinking? 
DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: I can't believe he was so naive to fall for that. He is a lawmaker, so there should be some type of code of conduct where you don't drop it like it's hot, so people could see your derriere, nor do you use derogatory language, so I think that she should have stepped down because he doesn't have a sense of direction nor a sense of knowledge to know that certain things, you just don't do. 
But also, if he stepped down, other people should step down, too, like that one that keeps running around talking about, "We've got to impeach 45." 
SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: Impeach 45. 
DIAMOND: She should also step down, too. 
SILK: That's right. 
WATTERS: All right, ladies, did you hear me the other day, I forget what show it was on, I had a buddy who is out in California, and he ran into Maxine Waters at a $100.00 a head brunch at the Four Seasons, and she admitted to him that Donald Trump, because of the good economy was going to get re-elected in 2020. Can you believe that? 
DIAMOND: Oh, good for her. She knows it. 
SILK: Maybe she got a message from God. 
DIAMOND: Yes. 
WATTERS: She sure did. All right, next one, we have Elizabeth Warren as the President likes to call her, Pocahontas, and she made a pretty nasty accusation saying that the President is trying to turn races against each other. Listen. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ELIZABETH WARREN, US SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS, DEMOCRAT: Donald Trump identifies the real problem in America and that is a lot of folks are hurting. And then he takes a turn and says, and it's the fault of those people. People who don't look like you. People who don't sound like you. People who don't worship like you. People who are not the same color and who didn't speak the same language. Fill in the blanks. It is their fault. What he wants to do is pit working people against working people -- black working people against white working people. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: I mean, I don't see that. I do see this though, illegal immigration has a very negative impact on wages and it drives down wages for regular hard-working Americans blacks and whites, and legal Hispanics. I think that's what the President is talking about, not trying to incite a race war. 
DIAMOND: That's exactly what the President is talking about. But it's a shame that Pocahontas don't even realizes that what the President is doing is bringing our country together, following the law. Something that they are not used to doing. But remember now, she is a left-leaning liberal -- a Democrat. She don't have a message. They are a mess over there, so they will race bait in order to get a vote. That's what they always do. So we have to ignore them. We know what the president is doing and we are so happy that he's making this place greater than we have ever seen it before. 
SILK: And this is one of the tactics of these type of individuals. We call them the gate keepers, the dog whistlers. It's what they do. They try to instill some type of fear in people and push, push it off on somebody else, when actually, it's them that's doing all of the race baiting and being divisive. 
WATTERS: I don't think people are even buying it anymore. So moving on. There is a woman, I think her name is Yanet Garcia. She is a weather girl. One of the most of famous weather girls, I think in the entire world and everybody wants to date her. She is a very eligible bachelorette as they say, so she gets together with this guy. This guy's name is Douglas Martin. 
Douglas Martin is a video game player. He is a professional gamer. So, they are dating for a while and things are going great, and this guy Douglas dumps this woman here -- dumps, Yanet Garcia because he wants to dedicate more time to playing video games full time. Can you guys believe it? 
DIAMOND: Well, listen, any time a man wants to play a video game over you, that means he's just not that into you. 
SILK: That's right. 
DIAMOND: So, really, her rejection -- that rejection was probably for her protection, but what I can say is showing your goodies to everybody. Acting like you're just some bread on a shelf instead of a diamond behind a glass, that's probably why people keep dropping your you know what, so you might as well keep your goodies to yourself. You don't have to let the world see everything as a woman. 
SILK: That's right. For men, they like illusions instead of the real thing. 
DIAMOND: Right. 
WATTERS: Well, he likes "Call of Duty," the video game. I think that's pretty clear. All right, Diamond and Silk, everybody. Check out the Chit- Chat Tour taking over the country. 
Up next, late night hosts turn on James Comey. Unbelievable. Watch this. 
Time now for "Last Call." Late night turning on James Comey this week as the former FBI Director took to Twitter to urge Americans to vote for moderate Democrats, not socialists in the midterms. 
Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler had a little fun with that. 
SETH MEYERS, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Really, James Comey? You want to weigh in on things when there is an election is coming up? You feel like that's gone well for you in the past? It's like Michael Jordan saying, "I think I'm going to take another shot at baseball." I mean, really? 
AMY POEHLER, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Really? James Comey? You're worried the Democrats are going to move too far to the left? Really? I don't know if you remember, but we were just about to have a nice boring moderate Democrat for president until you decided to open your mouth a week before the election, you big dumb scarecrow. 
MEYERS: Really? 
POEHLER: Really? And as far as I'm concerned, the Democrats can vote for a bong in the shape of Che Guevarra and you've got nothing to say about it. Really? 
MEYERS: Really? I'll take your political advice as soon as I'm done with my Jeffrey Dahmer cookbook and my Harvey Weinstein fitness tapes. 
POEHLER: The idea of you playing adviser to the Democratic Party is kind of like the iceberg trying to join the crew of the Titanic. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Congratulations, James Comey, everybody now hates you. All right, so we did a little poll and it was about my hair and here are the results. The winner? What haircut? 34 percent of you didn't even notice the difference. Come on, guys? Shorter on the sides, pushed back to the side, Come on. 
Anyway, that's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. "Justice with Judge Jeanine" is next, and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.
