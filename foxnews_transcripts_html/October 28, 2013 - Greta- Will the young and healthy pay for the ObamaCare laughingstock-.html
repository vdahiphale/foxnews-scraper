'Off the Record', 10/28/13: How will the Obama administration convince the young, hip, healthy and tech-savvy to pay for the joke that is ObamaCare and HealthCare.gov?

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Now, this is not about whether you are for or against ObamaCare. This is about reality, about getting the money to fund ObamaCare. Where are we getting it? ObamaCare for the nation is not free. We had to find the money but where? Here is who the Obama administration is banking on, the young and the healthy.
President Obama believes the young and healthy will finance the old and not-so-healthy. Young people typically don't need much medical care since they have less wear and tear on their bodies. They are young. So, the hope is that the young fill the ObamaCare covers and take that money to use to pay the big medical bills of the older and the sick. Can we count on the young? Will they do this for us? What do you think? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, the White House is hoping the young will make up 40 percent of the new enrollees in the health care exchanges. But getting that many people to sign up, well, I don't think that's so easy. Right now, the young people are laughing at ObamaCare. Yes, laughing -- that doesn't help. Laughing at the amateur dotcom website the federal government put together, a website many of them may think they could create themselves and actually have it work. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that's not all. Many young are snickering at the "Saturday Night Live" spoof of HHS Secretary Sebelius and HealthCare.gov. If any young person happened to miss the SNL parody of Sebelius, he or she can log and watch it right now again and again and again. The video has gone viral. You know who fuels that -- young people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That proves they are watching that and a laughing. Of course, if young people stop laughing, we need them to get serious and do ObamaCare math. They are going to figure out the obvious. It is a fact. It is cheaper for the young to pay the IRS mandate penalty than to buy health care insurance.
Now, I'm not trying to be a wet blanket, but really, how is Obama administration going to convince the young people to pay more than they have to for something they probably don't think they need in the first place because they are so young and healthy? Now, no one should be laughing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
