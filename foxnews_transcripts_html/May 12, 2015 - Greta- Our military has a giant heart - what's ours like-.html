'Off the Record,' 5/12/15: Members of our military are always risking their lives to help complete strangers. But in return, vets still have difficulty holding jobs, face disconnect from employers who don't understand them

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I'm still thinking about it, the 70th anniversary of VE-Day. What a great reminder of the bravery and the sacrifice of our military. It's fun to admire them, isn't it?
But of course, there are also the sad days like today, with the news that one of our military helicopters vanishing in Nepal with six U.S. marines and two Nepalese on board. Those eight members of the military were on a humanitarian mission to provide relief to earthquake victims, helping people they never met. That is just another example of our military's giant heart, risking their lives for complete strangers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it takes a big heart do that. Do you ever start to wonder what about us, the civilians? What are our hearts like in return? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There is a new report from Volunteers of America in the University of Southern California that says veterans still have employment problems, that it can be hard for them to find and keep jobs. Our veterans are also facing a disconnect from civilian employers who have problems understanding them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, let me get this straight. The military risks their lives to protect and to help and when they come home, that's how we civilians treat them? I don't know about you, I'm embarrassed. Are you?
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
