SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, Bret, and thanks. Happy Thanksgiving toyou. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. I'm Sandra Smith in for MarthaMacCallum. And this is THE STORY.As millions of Americans hunker down this year for a socially distancedThanksgiving. Millions of others are hitting the road. In fact, the TSA isreporting the highest number of travelers since the pandemic began, despitethe CDC urging Americans to stay home for the holidays, but many aregrowing frustrated and in particular with state officials because theybelieve some measures just go too far. For example, in Pennsylvaniabusinesses cannot serve alcohol on Thanksgiving eve.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOM WOLF, PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR: The biggest day for drinking is theWednesday before Thanksgiving. It leads to an increase in the exchange ofthe fluids that leads to increased infection. SMITH (on camera): And in Oregon Governor Kate Brown urging people to callthe police if they see someone violating COVID mandates. KATE BROWN, OREGON GOVERNOR: This is no different than what happens ifthere's a party down the street and it's keeping everyone awake. What aneighbor do, they call law enforcement. SMITH (on camera): And in New York Governor Cuomo says law enforcementofficials that do not enforce mandates are dictators.ANDREW CUOMO, NEW YORK GOVERNOR: You don't have the right to pick laws thatyou think you will enforce, and you don't enforce laws that you don't agreewith. Right. That's not a law enforcement officer. That's a dictator. SMITH (voice over): And then there is this video out of Orchard Park, NewYork, business owner Robby Dinero defying state restrictions on gatherings,held a large protest in his gym with other local business owners who feelCOVID restrictions go too far. Then the Department of Health and local lawenforcement showed up and this happened. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've lost friends (inaudible) who killed themselves.I've seen clients die because they've lost their livelihood.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry to hear that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you are and I'm asking for you to get a sense ofcompassion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're just doing their job. You should all be wearingmask.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not doing anything wrong.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't worry about my health. My health isn't yourconcern.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're meant to be wearing a mask. It's the law.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Well, then write me off.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the law.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. But then take me to jail.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You get a warrant.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go get a warrant. Yes, you do.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come back with a warrant. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get out. Get out.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH (on camera): Robby Dinero is a business owner in Orchard Park, NewYork and he joins us now. Robby, good evening and welcome.ROBBY DINERO, NEW YORK STATE BUSINESS OWNER: Thank you for having me here.SMITH: You've got quite a crowd there behind you. I'll let you tell meabout that in just a moment. But what did we just see happen in that video?DINERO: I do. They're still coming in.SMITH: I've got you here live on TV right now, Robby, what happened in thatvideo that we all just saw DINERO: OK. I posted on Facebook Friday night that I wanted to gettogether, business owners and protest and fight the lockdown that I feel isinfringing upon our freedom. They showed up Friday night. We are about 20minutes into that meeting when some sheriffs and a Department of Healthofficial showed up uninvited. My business was closed. We were notconducting business. This was a protest. They walked in uninvited, a coupleof the patriots that were here with me said, hey Robby, there's somesheriffs here and Department of Health officials, what do you want us todo. And I said get them to leave.And while the video speaks for themselves, those patriots took it uponthemselves to stand shoulder-to-shoulder and tell them to get out. And wewere right because if we were wrong, they would have called for backup andcome back. But they didn't. They left. SMITH: It is our understanding though there is an update to this storytonight and the Department of Health did come knocking this evening, whathappened? DINERO: They did. My business is closed just like they - what they want meto. But I was here after hours and the sheriffs came again escorting aDepartment of Health official. I told them to get off my property. I toldthem that their procedures they need to follow. This is after hours andthey have no right to be on my property without a warrant. I told them tocome back. He said he wanted to deliver this piece of paper in an envelope.I said, no. Call and make an appointment. It's after hours. You can calland make an appointment. He taped it to the door. I finished kicking himoff my property and I opened it up and it is a fine for $15,000.SMITH: Robby, why do you feel these restrictions go too far.DINERO: Any infringement on our liberty goes too far. We were born withinalienable rights bestowed upon us by our creator. They are guaranteed bythe Constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights that the 1st through 14thAmendments specifically. Any infringement on our freedom for any reason istoo far. Our freedom cannot end where people's fear starts. SMITH: And I want to make everyone well aware that you are a native of NewYork. You've spent 14 years serving as an infantry officer in the UnitedStates Marine Corps. You've earned many honors in the military. You've gotfour children. And we know it's a tough situation. We see your supportersthere behind you. How far do you plan to go with this? DINERO: I plan to take it as far as I possibly can. I want to ask GovernorCuomo and Poloncarz. I want to ask them. It's a challenge to them. Come tomy dinner table, come to any of the dinner tables back here, look our kidsin the eyes and say, your father, your mother is an essential worker. Theydon't have the guts to do that.They also don't have the guts to answer why they get to draw a $225,000salary for Governor Cuomo and for Poloncarz, it's $103,000 salary. But theworking men and women doesn't get to earn. They get to take our money, butwe don't get to earn. They don't have the guts to tell us that, that's theworst kind of leadership.SMITH: Your story is getting a lot of attention. We thank you for yourservice and we'll continue to watch where this story goes. Thanks forjoining us tonight. And we hear the supporters there behind you. We will follow up on that story. And also, here tonight is Texas LieutenantGovernor Dan Patrick. Dan, can you react to what you just saw and heardthere? DAN PATRICK, TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Well, Robby is a patriot. Ourfounding fathers, they were upset over the Stamp Act and other actions bythe king. I would say a lot less egregious than what Democrats are doing tocitizens everywhere in this country. And this is a peek into the futureunder the Biden administration, Sandra.If they lock down this country, they are pushing Americans beyond wherethey want to be pushed. And Americans put up with a lot from theirgovernment, but they will not have their freedom and their rights takenaway. And that's what we try to protect in Texas, and we are here. SMITH: Lieutenant Governor, although we do know that we face a very serioussituation as a country. This virus is spiking, and it is not taking places.It is all over this country. What do you say to the 29 million residents ofyour state tonight, two nights before many will gather at the Thanksgivingtable? PATRICK: So, Sandra, I look at - let's compare Oregon to Texas if I can.Oregon, you have a governor there that says if you have dinner with morethan six people, I will fine you $1250 and send you to jail for 30 days. Bythe way, where you'll be having dinner with a lot more than six people forthe next month. And that's the kind of state that says we don't care whatyou smoke, we'll assist you in a suicide. We let protesters fill thestreets. We let people set up their own cities in the city. But you can'tshare cranberry sauce and turkey and prayer with your family.There's something wrong with that. You're not going to find that in Texas.In Texas, Sandra, we're saying to people, look, here's the facts. Here'swhat we recommend. Here's what we suggest. But I'm not about as lieutenantgovernor to tell the people in Texas that you can't sit down, pray, andshare a family dinner with your family, not about to do that--SMITH: But I do want to hear about that recommendation is, though, becauseit's important that they know where their leaders stand in that state asfar as being safe and helping at least stop the spread of this virus. Thisis the Arigona (ph) family of Arlington, Texas. They decided to create thisPSA. They said we are not like unlike other families, we've made mistakes.Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When we took my mom to the hospital, our hearts broke.We feel guilty for gathering. Please don't be like my family and ignore theCDC guidelines by staying apart, we can fight this virus together.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: And the CDC, Dr. Redfield, was on our air today saying that it isthese private gatherings in private homes where the spread really happens,not necessarily out in public. That family decided to use their familiesmistake as a teaching moment. They said that we let our guard down. 12people walked away from a private dinner on November 1st with Coronavirus,a serious situation. So, knowing that, what is your message to the peopleof your state? PATRICK: So, my message is social distance. Wear a mask, wear a mask out ofrespect to other people and to protect yourself. But I'm not - I'm going togive you all the facts. I'm going to give you all the information. I'mgoing to let you make that decision as an adult for yourself and yourfamily. I believe that the overwhelming majority of people know the riskand they know the rights.And so, in Texas, we believe giving you the information. And again, Irecommend being careful, being careful, making that decision. Maybe yourgatherings aren't as big as they are in the past. Maybe they're smaller.That's your decision. But these are your rights. And I'm not going to takeaway your rights and tell you what to do when it comes down to havingdinner with your family, praying with your family and just be smart aboutit. And that's what we tell you in Texas. We trust your judgment. SMITH: Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, thanks for joining us and HappyThanksgiving to you and yours.PATRICK: Thank you, Sandra. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. You too.SMITH: President-elect Biden introducing his first cabinet picks today,including a top post for John Kerry. Karl Rove and Marie Harf on what thatmeans. And White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro joining me to talkChina. And a record-breaking day for the Dow. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: As Joe Biden introduces his foreign policy and national securityteam today, it may have looked like a scene from the days of the Obamaadministration. Not only was President Obama's former secretary of state,John Kerry, front and center as Biden's pick for climate czar. But in fact,all of Biden's picks so far served under President Obama.Today, Biden and his nominees making it clear that their aim is to endPresident Trump's America first foreign policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: These public servantswill restore America globally, its global leadership and its moralleadership.ANTONY BLINKEN, BIDEN PICK FOR SECRETARY OF STATE: We can't solve all ofthe world's problems alone. We need to be working with other countries. Weneed their cooperation. We need their partners.JOHN KERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We will strengthen the securityof every nation in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: This after President Trump touted his record earlier in the day,noting the Dow traded above 30,000 for the first time ever on his watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The stock market justbroken 30,000, never been broken that number. That's a sacred number,30,000. Nobody thought they'd ever see it. That's the ninth time since thebeginning of 2020. And it's the 40th time that we have broken records induring the Trump administration. And I just want to congratulate all thepeople within the administration that work so hard. (END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: Joining us now, White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro. Peter,great to see you tonight. Welcome. PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: That was quite a - it looks likethe Miss Globalist pageant there that you showed in the clip there witheverybody ready to basically ship our jobs back offshore. That guy,Blinken, if I'm not mistaken has run kind of a consulting firm where hespecializes in getting market access to communist China. This is kind ofgoing to be interesting depending on how this election turns out.But I'm not impressed with the choices so far in terms of taking care ofblue-collar America, the men and women of America who work with theirhands. These are the people that President Trump cares about, who I'veworked for four years to get jobs for. So, a new world here.SMITH: OK, Peter, so let's talk about the stock market topped 30,000 today.And of course, both sides want to take ownership of that. Some are saying,well, it's in hopes of the Biden presidency. Some are talking about thevaccine, adding to the optimism. And, of course, the Trump administrationsays, it's a result of all the policies enacted over the past four years,rolling back regulations and lowering taxes. Can this stock market rallycontinue under a Biden administration? NAVARRO: I've got a little street cred on this, Sandra. I remember whenPresident Trump first got elected, the day after the election. I predicted25,000 on the Dow. And some months ago, I said we were going to get over30,000. We got there. It's all because of President Trump's deregulation,tax cuts, fair trade and higher defense spending and things like that.Here's a cautionary note. Here's what I'm really concerned about. And as I work across the street every day now, what I'm seeing is thiseconomy needing a bridge from the first three phases of the stimulusrelief, the stimulus and relief package to a phase four. And my concern,Sandra, is unless we provide that bridge, we should have done it two monthsago, to be honest, and there's a lot of people have already fallen throughthe cracks. A lot of small businesses have fallen through the cracks. Andonce they fall through the cracks, it's hard to get them back up.So, yes, we got great 30,000 on the Dow. I'd say its President Trump'spolicies. But if we have a 2021, that's economic stagnation and recession.Part of the big reason, Sandra is because today and for the last twomonths, we haven't been able to get a phase four deal that gives the PPPmore for the small business and stuff like that. SMITH: OK. All right. So, what we heard today from that new leadership,restoring America globally, global leadership, moral leadership, you justthrew around some of those words. You have continued to crack down and theTrump administration cracked down on China all the way into the final daysof this administration. Are you - is the administration consideringcracking down on China even further with the weeks that are left? NAVARRO: Well, I think we need a new drinking game. Every time they sayglobal in some sense, I'd throw another shot down or we'll be drunk by theend of the night. We did do a very nice order President Trump signed lastweek, which cuts off investment to any Chinese companies that build weaponsto kill Americans. Certainly, there's some other things underconsideration, but it's not for me to jump the gun on what the presidentmay or may not do. SMITH: Peter Navarro, thanks for joining us live from the White Housetonight.NAVARRO: You take care, Sandra.SMITH: Thank you. Also, here tonight, Karl Rove, former Chief of Staff toPresident George W. Bush, now co-founder and adviser to AmericanCrossroads, and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC and aformer U.S. State Department and CIA spokesperson. Both are Fox Newscontributors. Welcome to both of you. I know that you were listening to allof that, and Karl certainly saw what went on today and the introduction ofwhat is shaping up to be the new Biden team. What are your thoughts on it?What is this looking like to you? KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's going to be interesting,because these are people who have been around Biden a long time. They werepotentially advising him when he did things like came out against takingout Osama bin Laden, as Bob Gates, former secretary of defense, who oncefamously said Biden's been wrong on virtually every foreign policy issuesince he entered Congress. And these were the people advising him.But they are accomplished people. They're going to be his choices. They'regoing to be accepted. The big challenge is going to be this. Can they - thecircumstances in which they find themselves are new and different. Theworld is a lot different than it was four years ago and certainly eightyears ago. And are they going to be able to adapt to a much differentworld, a world in which there is an aggressive China, that it's a rival ofthe United States, far more aggressive since 2012, ever increasinglyaggressive.Are they going to adapt to a new world in which it's going to beimpossible, I think, to put back the Iranian nuclear deal? And frankly, thecalculus in the Middle East is far different with an emerging Sunni Israelifront against an aggressive Iran. Are they going to be able to deal withChina on trade issues as they did in the first four years of the Obama andBiden administration?Abraham Lincoln in 1860 said, as our case is new, so must we think and actanew. And that's going to be the challenge for the old members of the Bidenteam who've been with him, some of them for 20 years. SMITH: I'll put that question to Marie Harf while first saying, Marie, thatnot only do you know a lot of the folks that were on that stage today, youworked with them. And I'll remind everybody with this flashback to 2014,the late Senator John McCain taking issue with Tony Blinken's nomination tobecome deputy secretary of state under Obama. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MCCAIN, FORMER U.S. SENATOR: I rise to discuss in my opposition to thepending vote concerning Mr. Antony Tony Blinken, who is not onlyunqualified, but in fact, in my view, one of the worst selections.Mr. Blinken has been a functionary and an agent of a U.S. foreign policythat has made the world much less safe today.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH: Making it very clear that he was angry about the lack of help thatwas coming from the Obama administration for the people of Syria. MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTIRBUTOR: Well, Tony Blinken is an incrediblyaccomplished policymaker. He's gotten compliments from actually across thepolitical spectrum since his name was announced as secretary of state andaround the world. World leaders know him. And look, these are folks exceptfor John Kerry, who I worked proudly for at the State Department. The restof these appointees are not politicians. They're policy makers. They'reintelligence professionals. They've never run for office.And I think that that's really one of the things the Biden team wanted toput forward today, that this is an administration that is going back toexperience and back to expertise. I will agree with one thing that Karlsaid, and that's that the world today is very different than four yearsago.And when you hear people like Jake Sullivan, an incredibly young nationalsecurity adviser, that's about to take over the helm of that, when you hearTony Blinken, they know that. They know that we can't just go to Obamaaround 3 that too much has changed, and we need to work to create a newfuture where America is back in a leadership role. Not this America firstAmerica alone Trump policy. But I actually think the Biden team understandsthey can't just go back. They have to look forward. SMITH: It's an important point. And you mentioned Jake Sullivan for therole of national security adviser. Let's hear from him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE SULLIVAN, BIDEN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR PICK: We will be vigilant inthe face of enduring threats from nuclear weapons to terrorists, but youhave also tasked us with reimagining our national security for theunprecedented combination of crises we face at home and abroad. Thepandemic, the economic crisis, the climate crisis, technologicaldisruption, threats to democracy, racial injustice, and inequality in allforms. The work of the team behind me today will contribute to progressacross all of these fronts.(END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Doesn't sound like the national security adviser role in thetraditional sense. Karl, your thoughts? ROVE: No, not at all. In fact, it's too expansive and I think doomed tofailure as a result. How is the national security adviser going to solvethe problem of racial injustice in the world and economic inequality is hisjob really is to help advise the president on key foreign policy issues.And instead, we had - it sounded like a throwaway line.It sounded like I'm part of the Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden sort oftraditional Democrats. I'm part of the establishment. So, I've got to havesome progressive language in here to soothe the squad and the people on theleft of the Democratic Party. An adroit political statement, but I don'tthink particularly effective as a national security adviser. SMITH: Marie, I want you to respond to that, but also respond to a tweetabout your former boss, as you just mentioned, John Kerry. This is TomCotton, a senator very critical of the decision to put him in place as theclimate czar. John Kerry thrilled that prospect of returning to his dreamjob of living in Central European luxury hotels while negotiating dealsthat are bad for America. The New York Post this morning, Biden climateenvoy John Kerry is a lifelong joke. Your response? HARF: Well, Tom Cotton is not a serious person, and that was not a seriouscomment.SMITH: He's a U.S. senator.HARF: Climate change is an incredibly - well, he was not a serious U.S.senator. I will say that. Climate change is an incredibly important. One ofthe most important challenges we need to face as a country. John Kerry hasexperience working across the government to do so. And what you heard Jaketalk about and what I think John Kerry will be doing, they recognize thatdomestic policy and foreign policy are not separate. The trade wars, DonaldTrump has started overseas, and China has made economic inequality worsehere at home. They've hurt our farmers and--SMITH: I've got to wrap it there, but I want to give Karl 10 seconds tofinish up. Go ahead, Karl.HARF: So, that's what I think Jake was talking about today, Sandra. SMITH: Karl?ROVE: Well, we have to have an argument about what he was talking aboutbecause we don't know. I mean, this was a bunch of palaver, in my opinion.These are able people. Let's see if they can come up with some newthinking. I'm a little bit dubious. Count me reluctant to believe thatthese people are going to be able to adapt to the new conditions in whichthe world finds itself. I think they're going to go back to Biden-Obamaleading from behind, blame America first.SMITH: Marie Harf and Karl Rove, thank you. Good to be - both of you. Happyholidays to you. Up next, a startling new study showing a huge spike in thenumber of students failing in school due to remote learning. Former NewYork Times reporter Alex Berenson saw this coming and he will join us livenext. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH (on camera):  A new study shows the dire consequences from onlinelearning. Students in Virginia's largest school district are seeing failinggrades spike by a staggering 83 percent when compared to last year anddespite top government health officials reassuring the public that it'ssafe for schools to reopen, teacher's unions continue to fight back.In Virginia they have just petitioned the governor to send the few studentswho remain in class back home. Quote, "in schools that are already open,COVID-19 cases are increasing and employees report unsafe workingconditions. Fairfax County must transition everyone to virtual learninguntil it is safe.Alex Berenson will join us in just a moment. But first, one of the parentsfrom Fairfax County school district, Anna Buchanan. Anna, good evening,thanks for being here. All parents out there, we know how difficult thisis. What has it meant for you and your children? How's the challenge been?ANNA BUCHANAN, FAIRFAX COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL PARENT:  Thank you so much forhaving me on tonight. You know, this has been an extremely challenging timefor parents, certainly for our family. We have -- had a second-grader and afourth-grader in Fairfax County public schools. We've been doing virtualschooling since about March of last year. So, it's about five months.We made the hard -- very hard decision to withdraw our students fromFairfax County. It has just become what was obviously just an unworkablesituation for our kids. You know, being online, our kids would get on about9.15 in the morning and be on until -- given the day, 2, 2.30, sometimes 3o'clock in the afternoon and they would have breaks in their but it was anextremely challenging thing for them.You know, I know how I feel after a couple back-to-back Zoom calls and I'man adult, and so for them to try to stay focused for that long was reallyhard and it's emotionally exhausting for them to just have to stay focusedfor that long.So, my kids had headaches. They would be in tears often. And this wasdespite having tremendous teachers. I can't speak highly enough about theteachers at my kid's school and our school principal.They are going above and beyond, but I really believe that the reality isvirtual school is an unworkable situation and although teachers andprincipals are doing their best to try to make this into a workablesituation, kids don't learn well in this environment. And I think that'swhat the study really showed.SMITH:  Not to mention the economic impact for so many families balancingin some cases two-parent working families, single parent families. So manydifferent challenges out there.Final thoughts as we do know that there are many teachers who feelconcerned about the spread of the virus in schools. We hear otherwise fromthe CDC. But so many different ways to look at this.BUCHANAN:  Absolutely. You know, I think -- we have friends that are in acouple different private schools around the Fairfax County area and friendswho are in smaller public school systems elsewhere in the country that havebeen able to bring their students back, keeping them socially distanced,keeping them with masks on, able to keep their kids, the teachers, and thestaff safe. I think that we -- I think that we can do better than this forour kids.SMITH:  OK. Anna, I appreciate it and our heart goes out to you and you aredoing a great job. I feel like as parents we all have to --BUCHANAN:  Thank you.SMITH:  -- pat each other on the back. Because we never saw ourselves inthis world --(CROSSTALK)BUCHANAN:  Absolutely.SMITH:  -- as teachers.BUCHANAN:  Absolutely. Thank you for having me.SMITH:  And fair point, the teachers are doing a great job too. Many ofthem. Also, here tonight, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter andauthor of the newest edition of "Unreported Truths About COVID-19 andLockdowns" part three.Alex, thanks for being here tonight. It's devastating to hear what this isdoing to so many as far as grades and their ability to learn.ALEX BERENSON, FORMER REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Yes, Sandra. It'sterrible. I want to talk about that in detail, but I have to tell youraudience something about the new book, a little about "Unreported TruthsPart 3" which is that Amazon has once again censored me. They censored metoday, they are not selling the booklet. You can only get it on Apple and Ican't believe that they are doing these six months after they censored thefirst booklet and had to back down.You know, the booklet just basically lays out the case that masks areprobably not nearly as protective as we've been told and people can judgethat for themselves.SMITH:  OK. So, let's go off what we do know that the --(CROSSTALK)BERENSON:  I think that's crazy that -- but let's go back to schools. So, I-- so the fact is, schools have to be open. There is tremendous evidencethat what we are doing to our children is seriously damaging to them.There's actually a very long piece in New York magazine which is hardly,you know, a right-wing outlet today just talking about how damaging closingschools has been. It's damaging to teenagers. There's evidence that, youknow, overdoses are way up this year.You know, and although I haven't been able to confirm it with hard databecause we don't collect very good data on suicides, even in Fairfax Countyfor example, Virginia, there's evidence that there have been severalsuicides of teens this year.It's bad for little kids who really have a hard time focusing on -- youknow, and we don't want the kids in front of screens all day. It's bad forparents. It raises the stress in the household and frankly, it may even beone of the reasons why some hospitals are having staffing shortages.Because you know, if you have a situation where you're a single parent,you're a nurse, and you can't go in because your kids are stuck at home,that's going to affect hospital staffing. Schools have to be open.(CROSSTALK)SMITH:  So many communities too are trying to step in and help out withthose front-line workers so that they can remain at work with child care.We hope that as many communities that can do that do. I do want to put thisin your --(CROSSTALK)BERENSON:  That's right.SMITH:  Dr. Redfield from the CDC was on Fox News earlier today, Alex, andas far as the science and what it says about children spreading this viruswhen they are in the classroom, here's Dr. Redfield.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: We've seen that really the K through 12 schools have not been a source forsignificant outbreaks or significant acquisition. When we've gone intoschools to evaluate, the kids that are infected or the teachers that areinfected, it turns out the teachers got infected from the community. Thestudents didn't get infected in school. They got infected from theirhousehold or their community.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH:  It's really important to put that out there, because there's not alot of science or evidence that points to the spread in schools. That'swhen the kids are behind the Plexiglas wearing the masks, socialdistancing. That's where they are safest.BERENSON:  I mean, frankly, we don't need any of that stuff for kids inschools anyway. It's sort of absurd, but if it's the price we have to paywith this teether to get schools reopened temporarily, you know, we have toput up this Plexiglas and make them more shields, that's better than havingschools close.This has been clear since May at least, OK, that children are really notspreaders of this and don't get very sick when they do get infected, thatthey are more likely to get it from adults than the other way around. Youknow, there is tremendous evidence out of Europe on this.You know, as far back as early May, the Australian -- one of the seniormedical officers in Australia said schools should be open and it isdisgusting in the United States that we have allowed the teachers unions toblock this. And right now, there are communities where schools are sayingthey're not going to be open at least through April if not through the endof this school year --SMITH:  Yes.BERENSON:  -- which would mean that some kids are not going to be in schoolfor 15 months.SMITH:  Yes.BERENSON:  OK. I -- my -- I can't imagine that. Our two -- you know, withthree kids through with school age.(CROSSTALK)SMITH:  Well, we hope to see the vaccine here soon.BERENSON:  Yes.SMITH:  Dr. Redfield said the vaccine could be rolled out in the secondweek of December, so we hope that changes a lot. Quick thought.BERENSON:  You know, hopefully that will make a difference but the vaccineis going to be -- you know, the vaccine is going to take months to roll outand every day that kids are not in school, they are losing out and we arepunishing them for no good reason.SMITH:  tough situation for everyone. Alex, thanks for your time tonight.BERENSON:  Thanks, Sandra.SMITH:  OK. Straight ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO HOST:  They promised blockbuster stuff and thennothing happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH (voice over):  RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel response to thosecomments from Rush Limbaugh and outlines the party's strategy movingforward.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH:  For weeks, President Trump's legal strategy has been critique,criticize and dismissed by all the usual suspects who complain about a lackof evidence. His legal team said give it time. The evidence will come. ButRush Limbaugh says Trump supporters have waited long enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LIMBAUGH:  You call a gigantic press conference like that, one that lastsan hour and you announce massive bombshells, then you better have somebombshells. I understand -- look, I'm the one that's been tellingeverybody, this stuff doesn't happen at work speed, light speed the waycases are made for presentation in court, but if you're going to do a pressconference like that with the promise of blockbusters, then there has to besomething more than what that press conference delivered.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH:  Joining us now to respond to that is RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.Always good to see you, Ronna. Welcome.RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Great to be withyou. Thanks for having me.SMITH:  How do you respond to Rush?MCDANIEL:  I think we've seen a lot of issues, starting with the laws beingchanged in the name of COVID that allowed a more porous election andstripping away a lot of the safeguards to election integrity going up toelection day where many of our poll watchers and observers and majorDemocrat counties were unable to observe to now, as we are getting intothis recount situation and you see in Wisconsin, 243,000 voters said theywere indefinitely confined. Which meant that they didn't have to show voterI.D.That's four times the amount of voters that did that in 2016. In Georgia in2018, 200,000 ballots came in with a 3 percent rejection rate. Absentee.This time you had a million too with a .2 rejection rates --(CROSSTALK)SMITH:  But to Rush's point -- Rush's point, I don't think he was denyingany of that, that there have been discoveries, that there have been thingslearned through this process, but specifically he said if you're going todo a press conference like that, with the promise of blockbusters, thenthere's got to be something more than what was delivered at that pressconference. So, is the strategy just not working, Ronna?MCDANIEL:  Well that's the president's legal team and they are presentingthings based on affidavits and their research and they've got to have timeto present that, but what I will say is we still have recounts ongoing inWisconsin --SMITH:  OK.MCDANIEL:  -- and in Georgia, it was an audit but we didn't do thesignature match and I do think that's a valid point that you've got tomatch these signatures with that big change and the rate of rejection from2016 or 2018 to 2020. That's a huge difference.SMITH:  OK.MCDANIEL:  And the problem is, Sandra, it's like the car has broken downand you can't figure out what happened until you get a look under the hood.And that's what the canvas and certification process allows in some states,you can't do an audit or recount until after the certification, but we doneed to figure out where things went wrong in some of these states and whywe see such differences from 2016 and 2018 as to how basic laws wereapplied to ensure election integrity.SMITH:  As we all know there's a big emphasis being put on Georgia now andthose runoff races by both parties. Here's Frank's Lunt (Ph) -- Frank Luntzon the impact that the president will have on those Georgia races. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LUNTZ, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER:  If you continue todissolution voters by saying that the elections were rigged and that yourvote doesn't matter, this could have severe consequences for theadministration in trying to keep those two seats Republican.I would argue that what Donald Trump says and does over the next six weeksis going to determine the outcome of the Georgia Senate race.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH:  So how important is what the president does over the coming weeks?What does it mean, what impact does it have in Georgia in January?MCDANIEL:  Well I think the president is perfectly within his rights to askquestions about the election process and make sure that it was fair andtransparent and I don't think that affects voters at all.What I will say is he got 350,000 more votes in Georgia than he did in2016. This is a president with coattails. You look at what happened in theHouse with us picking up 13 seats. You look at the Senate, we're at 50. Ifyou look at the 135 legislative seats that we picked up across the country.This is President Trump bringing up the whole ticket and they're going towant him in Georgia campaigning with these two candidates.SMITH:  Will he?MCDANIEL:  I know that and he's going to be critical.SMITH:  Will he?MCDANIEL:  I'm sure. This is a president whose helped everybody. Everybodywho has asked on his Twitter account was win red with what he's done forthe entire party. He has lifted the party. He's brought out new voters. Ican't imagine that he won't go down and campaigned for those candidates.SMITH:  But has he said that he will campaign in Georgia? It's obviously --(CROSSTALK)MCDANIEL:  I'm not going to put words in his mouth.SMITH:  -- critical to day.MCDANIEL:  I can't -- I'm not going to put words in his mouth. You've seenthe vice president there, but the president is the leader of our party andI think he will support these candidates. He's been doing it all over hisTwitter and he's absolutely invested in those races.SMITH:  What's next for President Trump and what's next for the party?MCDANIEL:  You know, the Democrats were repudiated in this election. Theyhad mountains of money, this blue wave, this green wave of money that wasanticipated, the blue wave that was anticipated, we were supposed to bewiped out and President Trump lifted the ticket with 73 million voters, 10million more than he had in 2016, more Hispanic, more Asian.Look at the House races, women, minorities, veterans. Picking up 13 seatsand may be more on the horizon.SMITH:  OK.MCDANIEL:  Socialism, defunding the police and what the Democrats aretalking about, stacking the Supreme Court was repudiated and they will getthe exact same thing if they vote for Democrats in Georgia in the Senateraces.SMITH:  Ronna, great to talk to tonight. Thank you.MCDANIEL:  Thanks for having me.SMITH:  OK. Will the media be just as aggressive with Joe Biden as it waswith Donald Trump and what are the consequences if they are not?Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson with a glimpse into the future ofthe mainstream media. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  They want theratings. They are fantastic ratings. But at the same time, they don't wantto be talked about in a bad manner, right? But you have to talk about thembecause they are corrupt. They have to report the news. They are the enemyof the people. They really are. They are the enemy of the people.(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH:  That was President Trump slamming the media throughout hispresidency over reports he often claims are false.In my next guest's new book, she dissects these reports with a 25-pageindex of all the times the media got the story wrong. To name a few, in2017, CNN claimed Frank Sinatra's daughter was not happy her father songwas used at Trump's inauguration. However, she tweeted that's not true. Inever said that. Why do you lie, CNN?In 2018, a local newspaper reporter falsely tweeted that a newsroom shooterdropped his make America great again hat before shooting. And just thisyear Newsweek had to issue a correction after claiming a Catholic groupassociated with Trump appointed Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrettinspired the dystopian show "The Handmaid's Tale."Here now is Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter and author of"Slanted:  How the News Taught Us to Love Censorship and Hate Journalism."Sharyl, good evening. Thanks for being here.SHARYL ATTKISSON, AUTHOR, SLANTED:  Thanks for having me.SMITH:  Why did you decide to write about this?ATTKISSON:  Well, I consider this really the third book in a trilogy whereI've traced what I now have come to think of the devolution of the news aswe once knew it. Foretelling in the second book which was called "TheSmear" what was coming with the control that we are seeing today withsocial media.And I see that as an extension of the corporate and political interest whoreally have great success in the first two decades of this century inwielding control over what we report on the news, how we report it, thelanguage we use, the opinions that are censored, and the scientific studieswe are not to hear about and so on.SMITH:  Talk about what you called motivated reporting meant to lead theconsumer to a given point of view. Explain.ATTKISSON:  Well, this is a big change from many, many years ago I learnedin journalism school. Which was, when you're doing hard news reporting youare trying to get the facts and explain both sides is, there are differentviewpoints and tell people what happened on the ground.But as we all know, there has been a slow change over the years where moreand more news media people and reporters and journalists see themselves asthe ones who are supposed to tell you what the truth of the matter is evenwhen it's in dispute or in a matter of opinion or something that's not yetdecided.And that they are to convince you. And then we saw in 2016 with theentrance of Donald Trump on the political stage. That just threw everythingout the window and one fell swoop. The media admitted that's exactly whatthey're doing and were encouraged by their bosses when they did such thing.Blended news and opinion and even cheered on throwing out ethics andstandards so that they could cover differently what they called a uniquelydangerous president.SMITH:  Sharyl, and perhaps what is a window into what we are about to seewith the Biden presidency and the treatment of him by the media.Kayleigh McEnany pointed this out in a tweet today. This is reporting onJoe Biden. Today he wore dark blue socks adorn with lighter blue dogs. Sheretweeted a Bloomberg reporter's tweet pointing out George H.W. Bush wasknown for his socks and maybe Biden will too. Today he wore dark blue socksadorned with lighter blue dogs. Yes, there's plenty of more substantivethings to tweet about but when we can have some fun sometimes too.So, is this a suggestion perhaps at the soft or light treatment we may seeof a Biden presidency by the media?ATTKISSON; Well, I think there is little doubt. We in the media promisedafter we were so wrong in 2016 to self-reflect and self-correct, instead wedoubled down with a lot of information for years without evidence, withoutcounterpoints when we're talking about the Trump Russia collusion.And then after that proved to be wrong, we doubled down as we cover thecampaign for 2020. And kind of with no holds barred with our one-sidedreporting. Refusing to get counterpoints, calling everything Donald Trumpsaid a lie on its face while calling anybody who defended any attacks hehad, we called them truth tellers without knowing which side was tellingthe truth r when it was a matter of opinion. Taking sides. And I do thinkwe'll see more of that under a Biden presidency.SMITH:  This is about 10 seconds. This is Biden last week when asked aquestion by a reporter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNKNOWN:  Mr. Biden, the COVID task force said it's safe for students to bein class. Are you going to encourage unions to cooperate more to bring kidsback to classroom, sir?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Why are youthe only guy who always shout out questions?(END VIDEO CLIP)SMITH:  Legitimate question but he was asked why do you shout, why are youthe guy who shouts.Sharyl, great to have you here tonight. I really appreciate your time.Thanks so much for having me.SMITH:  All right. Good to have you here. And that's us for THE STORY onthis Tuesday, November 24th, 2020. Thanksgiving week. But as always, THESTORY continues and we will see you back here tomorrow night at seven. AndI'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning America's Newsroom from 9 tonoon. Thank you for joining us.
