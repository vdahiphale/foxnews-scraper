     Video  Gutfeld on the false narrative of Playboy reporter 
Where were the media watchdogs under Obama? 
The White House correspondent for Playboy threw a tantrum yesterday when deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed out that some of Trump's loudest critics are behind so much fake news. So, that's kind of neat: Playboy has a White House correspondent. It's like National Review having a stringer at Hooters.

BRIAN KAREM, PLAYBOY: You're inflaming everybody right here right now with those words. This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heaven, anyone of us, right, is replaceable. And if anyone of us if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us. You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There's no option other than that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We here to ask you questions. You are here to provide the answers. And what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, once again, the president's right and everybody else out here is fake media. And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.

Yes. Of course, when someone in the media does this, then the rest of the media falls in love. Drool away Chris Matthews:

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Brian, thank you. I was very impressed by that. What got to you? What made you do it today? Because nobody else has done it before. It should have been done, I think. You find it, because they turn that supposedly a service to the American people, with people paid by American taxpayers to give us answers to questions which you have right. That's what a briefing's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be a PR campaign of trashing everybody who disagrees with the president.

I admit it was entertaining especially when the reporter tries to ask a follow-up. The expression is better than its centerfold.

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I disagree completely. First of all, I think if anything has been inflamed, it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media. And I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to his question. Kevin?

The fact is, the media is the dog under new owners. They were so docile under the previous owner, President Obama. Every day, he fed them from the table scraps of eloquence that reminded them of their favorite professor, the one they had a crush on, and thought maybe they had a chance with after finals. He probably drove a convertible MG and quoted Kerouac.
But now it's different. It's so much harder. The folks they mocked for years, they're now in- charge. I'm not talking just about President Trump, but Republicans, conservatives and libertarians. All those people you rolled your eyes at whenever they knocked President Obama. They probably don't remember that, but I do. All those times they muttered or groaned when Benghazi came up or anything critical of Obama's White House. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, please table your outrage. Since Trump came into office, there has been a run on tiny violins, and now they are all out of stock.   </pre>
