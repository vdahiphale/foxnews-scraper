Let's all go "Off the Record." Does it seem to you that some people are just looking for a fight? New ideas pop up all the time. But some ideas just seem designed to spark a big fight and divide our nation. And we sure don't need that, do we? It's awful.
And guess what? Brace yourself, we are on the verge of one of those big fights now. It has to do with money ... well, currency and women. Some are clamoring, including some in the Obama administration, to bump Alexander Hamilton from the $10 bill or Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill, and put a woman on them. Now, I'm a feminist. I like to see women get treated fairly. But this - what about history or tradition? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, with history and tradition being very important to a nation, here's an idea: Keep Jackson and Hamilton right where they are and where they look quite happy and content and let's get a new $25 bill. We could use a $25 bill, and let's put a woman on that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, is everyone happy? Not so fast. I know, here we go: Now begins the huge fight over which woman. I can hear it now. How about you? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
