NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Dow 30000, we hit it and we stayed over it.And food for thought. No play on words there, after two, by the way, verythin anchors talking about food. That's a whole 'nother issue. But this isa record issue. We have never seen the Dow 30 so high, other marketaverages sprinting at or near records themselves, and all of it based ongrowing optimism that there are not only a number of promising vaccinecandidates out there, but that there is going to be an orderly transfer ofpower.And so it looks like everything is coming up roses, or at least somewinning stocks.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is your record world today,to read that number and leap. We have never been in this territory before.And a lot of people are saying, with every hint of a vaccine and every hintof something promising down the road and the prospect that, because ofthose vaccines, we might be able to get out of this whole virus funk, andreturn from a world free of restrictions and limitations and lockdowns andshutdowns.That's not happening right now, but, again, the market is a forward-lookingindicator, isn't it?To Susan Li at FOX Business on what it is looking forward to.Hey, Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.First time ever crossing 30000. The Dow Jones industrials took almost theentire year to get there, after reaching 29000 at the start of January. Thenext 1,000 points were pretty hard to come by. And we only got here after ablowout month so far, best since 1987, on pace for the best November sincethe 1920s.Here's President Trump on the historical breakthrough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The stock market's justbroken 30000. Never been broken, that number. That's a sacred number,30,000. Nobody thought they'd ever see it.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI:  Vaccines, more stimulus on a possible Janet Yellen nomination andsigns of a White House transition has Wall Street optimistic.And that's propelling stocks that benefit from a reopening and a return tonormal, including travel stocks, like airlines, cruise lines and hotels,gym operators, banks, which trade depending on where the U.S. economy goes.Oil stocks are up on a recovery and oil prices, and also underperformers,like IBM, McDonald's and Visa getting a lift today as well.And, meantime, as the Dow crosses 30000, Bitcoin crosses $19,000 for thefirst time in three years, pushing ever closer to brand-new records. Andthe reason for this year's Bitcoin bonanza, adoption, as more companieslike PayPal, Square, Fidelity, and Robinhood allows its users to buy andsell the cryptocurrency.And, finally, it's good to be Elon Musk. Tesla's founder is now the world'ssecond richest, worth $128 billion and counting, overtaking Bill Gates andright behind Jeff Bezos.Neil, they say that, after $100 million, it's kind of all the same, isn'tit?CAVUTO:  Yes. Someone told me that the interest on that alone and hiswealth would be a billion dollars a year, at a minimum, just trying to dealwith the interest.I'm sure it's a lot more than that.LI:  Yes.CAVUTO:  But that -- without ever touching your principal. That's likeSusan Li money.LI:  Yes, exactly.CAVUTO:  Or Stuart Varney or something. It's a cross between.LI:  Or Neil Cavuto.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Oh, wouldn't that be nice?Susan, thank you. Great job, as always, my friend, Susan Li, following allof those developments at the corner of Wall and Broad.Also some political developments that had a way of connecting with thecorner of Wall and Broad and the market itself. And that continues to bePresident Joe Biden's picks for his Cabinet. He's already about a third,close to halfway through the process right now.Hillary Vaughn following it all very closely, with some big announcementsjust today in Wilmington, Delaware.Hey, Hillary.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, today's rollout of all six Cabinet appointees was in many ways anhomage to Obama. All six appointees have at some point served in somecapacity under former President Obama and now are coming back to serve inrevamped roles.Several of the picks are making history, the first immigrant and Latino incharge of DHS, the first woman to serve as director of nationalintelligence, and even a brand-new Cabinet position for climate.But national security is evolving too under president-elect Biden. It'sgoing to cover a lot more than terrorism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER DESIGNATE:  You have alsotasked us with reimagining our national security for the unprecedentedcombination of crises we face at home and abroad, the pandemic, theeconomic crisis, the climate crisis, technological disruption.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN:  More Cabinet announcements are on the way, one of those pending,Treasury secretary.The Biden team has not announced it yet, but FOX News has learned it isformer Fed Chair Janet Yellen. It's very rare for Wall Street's interestsand progressives' hopes to align, but this seems to be the case with Yellenas Treasury secretary.Progressives are cheering the news, saying she is the next best thing toputting Senator Elizabeth Warren in charge. They see Yellen's pastenforcement action against Wells Fargo and bank stress tests while at theFed as a sign she will keep big banks in check.And markets are reacting positively too. Investors are hopeful that Yellenwill reverse Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's decision to let the Fed'semergency program expire at the end of the month. She's also expected to bea strong advocate for fiscal support and is someone who can work with theFed to address the $3 trillion looming national debt.And, Neil, even Senator Elizabeth Warren has praised Yellen as the pick.She was on the short list for the job, but clearly no sour grapes there --Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Hillary Vaughn.We will be asking Senator Rand Paul what he thinks of some of these picksin just a moment here.I want to get the market reaction with Charlie Gasparino, HeatherZumarraga.Heather, particularly on the Janet Yellen pick for Treasury, not formaltoday, but it was one of the reasons the Dow advanced, in that she would,at the very least, keep stimulus going. She's a big fan of that dating backto her days with Bill Clinton as an economic adviser and as a Fed chairmanherself.So I'm wondering if that played into part of the market's rally that youhave got, not -- I think everyone loves spending now these days.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  So, that that fuels this argument we're going to see a lot of it.What do you think?HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Absolutely. We're all addicted tothis monetary morphine, right?That was a big theme after the 2008 financial recession, as we were comingout of it. If you remember, Janet Yellen was actually confirmed with 14Republican votes as well.CAVUTO:  That's right.ZUMARRAGA:  So, not just Democrats. There's bipartisan support.So this is not a far left progressive, like Elizabeth Warren, whichRepublicans had feared. And, yes, she's going to keep rates lower forlonger. I think that bodes very well for the stock market, as evident over-- today, over 30000 on the Dow.But the difference is, as Fed chair, that is a nonpolitical job. Right now,you're Treasury secretary. That is a political position. But I do thinkit's the best hope that Republicans could have as Treasury secretarynominee.CAVUTO:  Charlie, when you look at this number, with a 30000-plus Dow, andyou think of where we were back in March, when we dipped under 19000, I canremember there were articles being written we're going to 10000, we'remelting, we're melting, we're melting.And look at where we are now. It is a remarkable comeback.CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  It is.We should point out that Fed chairman appointments are very political.Janet Yellen was a very political Fed chairman, not in demeanor, But whatshe did. She was -- you know, she had the money machine printing all thetime. She was constantly talking about the wealth gap, even though a lot ofher policies, keeping interest rates at zero, not pushing back againstObama's tax increases, increased the wealth gap at the time.In terms of the market right now, Neil, this is when I'm talking toinvestors. They're putting -- they're basically pointing to Donald Trumpand not Janet Yellen. Janet Yellen is icing on the cake right now, becauseit's essentially a relief -- part of the relief rally, so to speak, is thatwe didn't get Warren. We got someone that's reasonable, not some left-winglunatic.But the reality of the markets is this. The economy is a lot better becauseof the stimulus that Donald Trump pumped into it. The vaccine is comingaround the corner because of Operation Warp Speed, which you got to givehim credit for that. And Joe Biden is going to be walking into dividedgovernment, which is going to put a cap on the tax increases.Therefore, what do you got left? Well, you got Janet Yellen screaming atJerome Powell to keep interest rates low, which she will do. That's all netpositive for stocks.CAVUTO:  And that was evident today.Guys, thank you both very, very much on that.We have a lot more coming up, Rand Paul's read of these very quickdevelopments here, and optimism over vaccines. That, you have heard, thatthey're coming, they're coming.What if I told you one is already here, and out, and now?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, Joe Biden announcing a good many, a third, up to a halfof his Cabinet picks right now. We're told more are coming in the next fewdays. So, he's moving at a pretty quick rate here.Of course, it has to pass muster in a Republican Senate, for now, right?That run-off election could decide a lot of things in Georgia. Marco Rubiosays he has his doubts about a few of those. I wonder if his colleague RandPaul feels the same way.The Kentucky Republican with us right now.Senator, what do you think of some of these picks? Would they pass musterwith you?SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY):  You know, we have had a Democrat at the helm at theTreasury for four years anyway. So, I'm not sure that will make muchdifference.You know, if the standard is whether or not you spend money like a drunkensailor, we have been doing that anyway. So, I'm not sure that Yellen couldbe much worse.But I would say that, with regard to foreign policy...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  You're not a fan of Steve Mnuchin? You're not a fan of hisleadership of the Treasury?PAUL:  I see him as trying to shovel money out the door and just give awayfree money to people. And that's not a conservative notion. That's aDemocrat notion.And I think he is a Democrat.CAVUTO:  Apparently, he did it with the blessing of the president, right?He wouldn't do anything the president want, did he?PAUL:  That's directed specifically towards him and his negotiations withPelosi.But I would say that, on foreign policy, I am very worried about that therewill be a big shift, and it's back to those who believe that we shouldmilitarily intervene abroad in a big way.You have neoconservatives on the right who wants to intervene forgeopolitical reasons, but then you have liberals, like Blinken and SamanthaPower and others, who want to intervene for humanitarian reasons. But,nevertheless, they want to send our armies and our young men and womenaround the world.And I think Blinken is a bad choice. I'm going to ask him if he's going toapologize for his support of the Iraq War and what lessons he learned fromit, whether he still believes regime change in the Middle East is a goodidea, which it was not a good idea. It was not a good idea in Libya eitheror in Syria.And I don't think Biden or Blinken have really fully understood that. And Iactually do think President Trump really did get that, that regime changein the Middle East hasn't made us stronger.CAVUTO:  Senator, John Kerry is going to be like a climate change czar orenvoy. I don't know how you describe it, but it comes with Cabinet-levelstatus.And I'm just wondering, does it also come with it approval in the UnitedStates Senate?PAUL:  You know, I'm not really in favor of czars or aristocracy. So I hopewe don't call it czar. I think they were calling him envoy in the papertoday.I think it's worth having a discussion about climate change.CAVUTO:  But does that need Senate approval? Do you know if it needs Senateapproval, because -- I'm showing my ignorance here. I don't know if itdoes.PAUL:  I know the Constitution doesn't refer to czar, so I don't know.On some of the envoys, they do have to be approved, and some don't. So, Ithink a lot of the special envoys don't have to be approved. Like, when yousend them to certain nations, they're not approved. So, I'm not sure if itwill be or won't be.But the main thing is, we shouldn't have anybody directing policy, creatingpolicy or creating rules we have to live by who's not been elected orapproved by the Senate. So, really, most things that are -- involve thelegislation or legislative ideas that are being put forward, they reallyneed to be legislation, and not done by individuals.CAVUTO:  Senator, as you know, the GSA has given the go-ahead here to getthe transition process going. That probably could not have happened withoutDonald Trump's blessing, which seems to be greasing the skids for Joe Bidenand a Biden presidency beginning on January 20.You had said that the vast majority of voting, though, must still be donein person to mitigate the potential for fraud in the future.So, are you saying here that the issues the president raised werelegitimate and they did tip the election in Joe Biden's favor, and that thepresident was robbed of victory because of it?PAUL:  I think, if we put our heads in the sand and say, oh, no big deal,this was like any other election, we're not being honest and we're notbeing good at poring over the details to get to the truth.In every election we have ever held in this country, really, literallyevery election, 99 percent of the votes or more have been cast in person.They're pretty easy to verify that the person showing up is voting. Youhave a Republican and Democrat sitting at the desk. No one can sort ofstuff the ballot, or it's much more difficult to do.When they're written and sent in, there is much more potential for fraud.I'm concerned about what Professor Williams has looked -- Professor Millerfor Williams College has looked at, where they did a random sampling of2,600 Republicans. And what they found is that a significant percentage ofthem said they did not request a ballot, and yet somebody counted a votefor them.And another significant percentage said they did request a vote, they didvote, but their vote was counted for someone else. So, I think there is a -- something that has to be looked at, because, if you extrapolate hisnumbers, he says as much as 100,000 ballots could have been countedincorrectly either through fraud or error.And that ought to be looked at. We had millions of ballots. We have neverhad millions of absentee ballots. And it is a mistake just to slough overthis. I don't know what the conclusion would be. But I think people who saythere's no evidence there are being biased, in the sense that they don'twant to look to see if there is evidence there.CAVUTO:  So, some of your colleagues who were pressing, including ChrisChristie and others, who have been saying, it's time to move on, Mr.President, are you in their camp?Or do you think he should still fight this?PAUL:  I'm in the camp, if we push this under the rug, we will never knowabout this election, but we also will in the future have elections justlike this, where the lack of legitimacy will trouble half of the country ormore.I'm worried about the election January 5 in Georgia. I think that you haveto -- see, now they're saying we can't even check out absentee votesbecause they throw away all the envelopes. I think they're saying that inPennsylvania and Michigan.So, they have separated evidence of whether the vote is valid by throwingaway the contents. If it doesn't have a postmark on it, how did it getthere? That would make you question that it came from somebody's lockbox orsomebody's storage unit.But if there's no postmark or signature, the signature is apparently onanother document. So, if we can't check all of those things, how can wecheck for the validity of things?It's why we need to have in person voting. You can have early voting, butit needs to be in person. Look, when I voted here in Bowling Green, we hada big, huge gymnasium. I was in there for three minutes. Everybody in thecountry is going into someplace for three minutes or more.There is no risk to doing it in person. I fear that we're transforming theelection to something that will be very hard to police for fraud, both thistime and in the future.CAVUTO:  Real quickly, Senator, I had the pleasure to talk to you and yourwife last week. We were talking about the initial attack on you guysleaving the White House last week.And it was on the heels of an attack on a lot of Trump supporters over theweekend a couple of weekends ago. Now I come to learn that you're relayingthat a U.S. attorney is not going to investigate who might have fundedthese protesters who confronted you and your wife.How do you feel about that?PAUL:  I think that, if our cities are going to be livable, if you wantpeople to travel to our nation's capital, you have to make them safe.If the people throwing firecrackers in there, people coming into therestaurant and taking your food are not punished, then who will want totravel? Right now, they have said we can't eat inside because of the virusand we can't eat outside because of the rioters.But, yes, they have to have law and order. They have to arrest thesepeople. But I think they should check the finances. And what disturbed memost when I spoke to the assistant U.S. attorney in D.C. yesterday wasthat, basically, she said there was not going to be any investigation andpursuit of the people who attacked my wife and I.And I asked specifically, did you look at their finances to see who waspaying for their trip to Washington and who was paying for them to stay infancy hotels? And she wouldn't indicate whether there was an investigationor not.She just said nothing was being pursued at the moment. So, this doestrouble me. And I think it leads to more chaos. And many people online haveresponded, look, if you're not even going to investigate people attacking asenator, what about ordinary citizens? Do they care at all?Do they care that anybody goes to restaurants anymore? Our big cities haveto have law and order, or they're going to be ruined.CAVUTO:  All right, Senator, we will see what happens. Hope at leastsomething does to address this. But it looks like an uphill battle now.Rand Paul, thank you. Have a safe Thanksgiving, sir.In the meantime, here, we talk about all the promise of vaccines down thepike here. There is a treatment. I guess they're not outright callingRegeneron a vaccine, but a treatment that's out, and now immediatelygetting released.Jennifer Griffin has the details at the Pentagon -- Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Neilsome really positive news today about vaccines and therapeutics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals received U.S. government approval for emergencyuse of its monoclonal antibody treatment just three days ago. Here's HHSSecretary Alex Azar.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX AZAR, U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY:  Following FDA'sauthorization of Regeneron antibody cocktail this past weekend, we begandistribution of the first 35,000 doses of that product today.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN:  This is the same treatment that President Trump received lastmonth. On Saturday, the FDA agreed to allow emergency use of Regeneron forpeople with mild to moderate symptoms who are at high risk of developingserious illness due to age and underlying conditions.It's not authorized for use in hospitalized patients or those who needextra oxygen. CDC head Robert Redfield told Dana Perino vaccinations willbegin next month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR:  First, it's exceptional that we havethese vaccines, and it's very exciting. And, again, it just reinforces whyI want people to be vigilant, because we're turning the corner now.You don't want to be the last group to end up getting COVID, because thevaccine is going to begin to be rolled out probably by the end of thesecond week of December.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN:  Redfield says the CDC will have 40 million doses before the endof the year, enough for 20 million people.The general public will have access to the vaccine by March, he says. TheU.S. government already has purchase agreements for up to 300 million dosesof the AstraZeneca vaccine for Americans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AZAR:  We now have phase three data on three vaccines, three more vaccinesin active study. Five therapeutics now are authorized or approved by theFDA.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN:  The FDA will meet on December 10, to look at the results of theserecent trials. If all goes well, Operation Warp Speed can begin vaccinedistribution within 24 hours of authorization.Secretary Azar said CVS Health has said it expects to begin vaccinatingresidents of nursing homes within 48 hours after FDA authorization -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Very promising, indeed.Jennifer, thank you very much, my friend, Jennifer Griffin following all ofthat.Well, we told you about the Dow hitting 30000, a little bit better thanthat. Are we seeing a lot of green, though, because, well, we're looking atthe green, the environment, and trillions of dollars worth of spending?Could the environment over the environment be actually helping the stockenvironment?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, here's the good news on COVID if you're eating out.They will test you to make sure you're OK. Here's the bad news. It's goingto set you back 50 bucks. Still plan on eating?Food for thought -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  For the first time ever, there will be aprincipal on the National Security Council who can make sure climate changeis on the agenda in the Situation Room.For the first time ever, we will have a presidential envoy on climate.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, Joe Biden calling him a presidential envoy. Others aresaying he's going to be a climate change czar.But John Kerry is back in action, the former presidential candidate, thesecretary of state, the last one under Barack Obama, back in the fight toget the whole Green New Deal in, and the trillions of dollars' worth ofspending that comes with it.Steve Moore is very excited at the prospect and heartily endorses thismove.All right, maybe not.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Steve, what do you think here?One of the things we know is that we're going to be back in on this, butthat also means back in on paying the lion's share of this that thepresident quit back in 2018 because he said we were paying adisproportionate share, and the Chinese and the country of India wereescaping that.What do you think happens now?STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Well, that's right,Neil.Look, I think one of Donald Trump's wisest decisions, which really did putAmerica first, was pulling America out of the anti-America Paris climateaccord. And now that's obviously one of Biden's top priorities to put usback into that deal.And what's really changed over the last 10 years that nobody expected isthat we have seen this incredible boom in the shale oil and gas industrythat has lowered costs. It's become super abundant in the United States.And what frustrates me is, the other thing that Trump did that I think isone of the reasons he's going to go down history as a great president isfor the first time in your and my lifetime, we became energy-independent.We have been producing more oil and gas than we're consuming for the firsttime. So we're not captive to the Saudis or to the OPEC nations or toRussia, for that matter.And it just doesn't make any sense to me to move away from those greatenergy sources that are cheap and abundant and made in America. But itlooks like that's going to be one of Joe Biden's top priorities.CAVUTO:  I know, I'm not saying anything profound here, Steve, but you haveindulged that over the years we have chatted, that I know elections haveconsequences.The president's still fighting the outcome of this one. I get that and all.But he reversed or tried to, even with executive orders, if Congress wasn'tmoving fast enough, everything or as -- most -- as many things as he couldunder Barack Obama. It's very, very clear some of these early moves,including planned executive orders, under Joe Biden will do the same towhatever Donald Trump was doing.It's got to confuse the world, right? I mean, it's one thing -- thesearen't minor adjustments. These are 180s after 180s, you know?MOORE:  Well, I think that's right.I mean, Biden is going to reverse a lot of the most positive things we didon health care, on deregulation. You mentioned the Paris climate accord.The Iran deal, what's going to happen with that? So I'm not a big fan, bythe way, of legislating through executive action.We do have a legislative branch, Congress. And this governing by executiveorder is sort of putting these powers in the hands of the executive branchthat belong with the legislature.But Trump's record on the economy has been really nothing short ofspectacular. I was listening to your previous conversation about Dow 30000.I mean, really, that's a pretty amazing thing, given what we have beenthrough this past year, Neil, when you think about we have had a pandemicthat flattened the economy for the first half of the year.We had all these businesses struggling. Now we have this vaccine. We havegot -- I mean, I really think Trump is going to be going out on a verytriumphant note. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't...CAVUTO:  Do you think, though, in your heart of hearts, Steve -- I mean,you can wonder about the timing of these vaccine announcements that cameout a week after the election, Dow 30000.MOORE:  Yes.CAVUTO:  If we had seen that right before the election, do you think itwould have been a different outcome?MOORE:  Oh, I don't think there's any question. If the election were heldtoday, I don't think there's any question Donald Trump would be elected bya pretty wide margin, because we have had the two -- those twodevelopments, a vaccine, which is a miracle -- I mean, nine months todevelop a vaccine -- and the second thing is, we got the monster jobsreport.CAVUTO:  The irony was, many who turned away from the president turned awaybecause they didn't think he was doing as good a job on the virus.MOORE:  Exactly.CAVUTO:  Do you think, in the end, in retrospect, had he been moreaggressive about the mask thing, had he been more aggressive about everyonebeing on the same page with this, that he would have another four years inthe White House?MOORE:  I think that the news that we have seen in the last few weeks hasbeen extraordinary.I think people are upbeat, even, by the way, in the area that I work on,the economy. Even, I think, a majority of Biden voters said that Trumpwould be better on the economy.I think Trump, what tripped him up was some of his behavior and some of hisactions that just rub people the wrong way. But I'm very proud. I have tosay, I'm very proud of the job this president did on the economy, and I'mproud to have been a small part of it.And I think, as the months roll on, I think people are going to look backand say, Trump, it made a big difference having a businessman in office whoknew how to grow an economy and create jobs. And, boy, did he do it.He built -- rebuilt the economy twice, twice.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Yes, it is what it is, as you say.And you didn't have just a small role in that. People can say what theywant...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  ... and all.MOORE:  Tiny, very tiny role.He knew what he wanted -- he didn't even need economic advice. He knew whathe wanted to do. I mean, he had just great instincts on the economy.CAVUTO:  All right, well, I think you sell yourself -- I think you sellyourself short young man.MOORE:  Well, thank you, Neil.CAVUTO:  But, anyway, Steve Moore, very good seeing you again, my friend.Woulda, coulda, shoulda. We will never know, if we'd seen Dow 30000 theweek of the election, if we had seen some of this promising vaccine newsright before the election. Just one of those things. Would it have changed?Would it have changed the outcome?Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, we interrupt this talk of Dow 30000-plus for peacebreaking out in the Middle East.Just think of it, a Saudi prince meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, as onecountry after another makes peace with the Jewish kingdom, at a time when alot of folks were saying they were going to war almost instantly. That wasthe view then. So, what happens under a President Biden now?The read from Rebeccah Heinrichs of The Hudson Institute, senior fellowthere.It does get lost in all these issues we discuss, right, Rebeccah, aboutwhat's happening with the markets, and the vote stuff, and the virus stuff,and the vaccine promise and all. But, in the Middle East, it's like peaceis breaking out. What's happening here?REBECCAH HEINRICHS, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the Trump administrationreally has not gotten the credit it deserves for foreign policy generally,Neil.And I would say that what we're seeing now with this meeting, thisunprecedented meeting between Bibi Netanyahu of Israel and the prince, theyoung prince, MBS -- and this was orchestrated by the United StatesSecretary Pompeo -- is that it really kind of destroys this myth, a coupledifferent myths, one, that the United States has not been leading whenPresident Bush has been president -- or President Trump has been president.And then the second myth is that the United States is not working with ourallies. Both of those things are not true. There's really been two majorapproaches towards the Middle East that has made the conditions conduciveto these breakthroughs, these peace breakthroughs, between Arab states andIsrael.And those two things are defending Israel and our Arab partners andcountering the major threat, the preeminent threat in the region, which isIran. Those two things have brought some really great progress for relativepeace in the Middle East.CAVUTO:  Obviously, Israel will have a -- I wouldn't call it a more tense,but certainly not as friendly a relationship with a President Joe Bidenthan it's enjoyed, certainly Benjamin Netanyahu, leading a largelyconservative government, has enjoyed with this president.I'm just wondering, what will change, do you think, as far as our posturewith the country?HEINRICHS:  A few different things.I think that there's not -- there has not been a recognition of thesuccesses of the Trump approach. And that's to our, I think, shame. I thinkthat president -- president-elect Biden has in the past called Saudi Arabiaa pariah nation, has really gone after Saudi Arabia very publicly on itshuman rights, and not to say that Saudi Arabia doesn't have human rightsproblems.But if you're looking at this kind of thing, more realistically, in powerpolitics, what is more conducive to peace, which helps human rights anddecreases human suffering and warfare, some of those things kind of have tobe moved to the backstage.And so I think that that's going to change. And then also you have  who arethe people who are going to make up the Cabinet in a Biden administrationwho want to rejoin the Iran deal. And getting out of the Iran deal hashelped isolate and take away some of the resources for the Iranian regime,what they have used to disrupt the Middle East and to fund terrorism.So, unless something majorly changes in the outlook of Joe Biden, his --and his advisers, I'm afraid a lot of this great progress is going to beundone, Neil.CAVUTO:  You mentioned what's happening now and the tone that could change.I tend to look at things through the prism of money and all that stuff.It's just shameless, what I do for a living. But one of the things I waswatching was, with the administration, the incoming administration's dimview of fracking, and some of the energy independence we have gottenbecause of pushing fracking and all alternatives, we have become now thelargest oil producer on the planet.That could get compromised under -- under the new administration and maybemake us more reliant on the very same people we have -- we have becomeindependent from on this front. I'm wondering how that plays out.HEINRICHS:  One hundred percent, Neil.I thought during that second debate between Biden and Trump, when Bidenreally kind was defensive about his position for ending fracking, I thoughtthat was going to potentially undo him, especially in Pennsylvania. It'snot just Pennsylvania that's, of course, reliant on that industry, but manystates are.And it also is a cornerstone to a strong America, a sovereign America, thatallows the United States to have less dependence on these other nations introubled parts of the world. And it gives the United States more freedom todecide when and where we act in the world.And so I definitely think that that's an issue not just for foreign policygenerally, but, of course, for the -- for markets, for our economy. So thatis going to be, I think, something very troubling.And I hope, of course, that, as they get in there, they start gettingintelligence briefings and that kind of thing, that reality will mug them,as they say, and that some of these things will change. But I'm not veryoptimistic about the direction of this administration on fracking.CAVUTO:  I like that line. Reality will mug them.Rebeccah, I hope you have a safe Thanksgiving. Thank you very, very much.Good seeing you again.HEINRICHS:  Thanks so much, Neil. Happy Thanksgiving.CAVUTO:  To you as well, Rebeccah Heinrichs.In the meantime, we're told about how many people can be at our home forThanksgiving, but no one says anything about how we all leave the houseafterwards, go shopping, with thousands of people crowded around us.That's fine -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Ready for the crowds?Not at your home, at your nearby mall or store.Jackie DeAngelis on what could be a very busy shopping season after all --Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, there has been a holiday shopping surge ahead of schedule this yearfor several reasons. First, people are anticipating more lockdowns andrestrictions. We're seeing it here in the city. We're bracing for it. Sothe lines and the rules and regulations, they might actually make shoppinga little difficult.There are some who say shopping in these conditions for the holidays justisn't fun and some of joy has sort of been sucked out of the season. Butthere is a little bit of a silver lining. Americans that haven't lost jobshave saved money through the pandemic, just spending less on life in thelast nine months that they have been at home.And they also may be willing to splurge on others and themselves to bringsome household cheer. The U.S. personal savings rate jumped to a record32.2 percent in April. That's up from 12.7 in March, according to the U.S.Bureau of Labor Economic Analysis.And the retailers are catering to that by starting their discounts earlyonline to offer bargains and to make it easy for consumers. Now, theNational Retail Federation actually doesn't expect a downtick at all inholiday sales because of the pandemic.They're forecasting an increase of 3.6 to 5.2 percent from last year. Andlast year, we saw holiday sales up 4 percent to $729.1 billion. They alsoexpect those online sales, which are included in the total, to increase 20to 30 percent from a year ago.Now, with the vaccine on the way, there could be some tough months ahead,but there is that light at the end of the tunnel. And overall optimism,Neil, is what helped lift that Dow today over 30000.CAVUTO:  Not too shabby.All right, Jackie, thank you very, very much.Let me ask you something. Have you ever tipped a maitre d' to try to get agood table? Well, how about 50 bucks to get a COVID test, whether you wantone or not?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  If you're lucky enough to have indoor dining where you are, yourtable is ready, but first a $50 payment for a COVID test.Kristina Partsinevelos in New York City, what's going on here?KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, it's notjust $50 for the COVID test. You also get a glass of bubblies, too.And this is possibly a glimpse of what the future of indoor dining couldlook like. I'm at City Winery in Chelsea right now. And they are the firstrestaurant here to mandate patrons to take this $50 rapid COVID test.Neil, I will admit, I left the restaurant, came back. So, I actually had totake the test twice today. The way it works is, you have a nasal swab. Theyput it up your nose. You wait about 15 minutes. If you test negative,you're home-free and you can come in. If you test positive, unfortunately,they turn you away.And while you're waiting during that 15-minute period, you do get a niceglass of bubbly. But, luckily, I was part of the dry run.Overall, this is an example of how restaurants could be moving forward.They want to ensure safety. Over here, the owner told me that they are soldout today and tomorrow. And with 1,000 restaurants, Neil, that have shutdown since the pandemic since March, you can understand why a restaurantlike City Winery, it just wants to stay ahead of the curve, and hopefullykeep everyone safe.So, luckily, I didn't penetrate the bubble, and we are all good -- back toyou.CAVUTO:  That's an interesting idea.And speaking of which, we have Michael Dorf with us right now, the CityWinery founder and CEO.Thank you, Kristina.Michael, what reaction are you getting from customers?MICHAEL DORF, FOUNDER AND CEO, CITY WINERY:  It's been mostly positive.And, certainly, there are some people challenging the legitimacy of whatwe're doing, questioning the type of testing we're doing, and alsofrustrated that we're forcing a $50 charge before you come in.This is only -- let's be clear. We're doing this for two days a week topilot the concept. We only are doing this as a bridge to a time when thevaccine is in enough people's arms and we can have indoor dining againsafely. But we didn't see any alternative if we were going to survive overthe next four or five months in a cold New York season, where people arereluctant to be eating outdoors anymore, to go to this next level ofsafety.And, of course, if people don't want to do it...CAVUTO:  So, when you come in the restaurant, Michael, just to be clear,you would -- you would give me this rapid test, right?I find out the results in 15 minutes. You give me a glass of wine, I guess.Do I drink it outside? Am I allowed to drink it in your restaurant? What doI do?DORF:  You can't come into the restaurant until you're tested negative.CAVUTO:  Got it.DORF:  So, luckily, with our new facility here on 15th Street and the WestSide Highway, we have got a winery space that is serving as an intermediaryfrom the street into the restaurant.And so we're using that as our testing space.CAVUTO:  Huh.DORF:  Every 15 minutes, we're testing about 10 customers, and they'recoming in. The doctor and the nurse are doing the test. Then they wait.They get their bubbles.They are at six-foot-separated tables. When they get the results, thenthey're able to go in.So, no one inside...CAVUTO:  What's the reaction of people -- what's the reaction of people whotest positive?DORF:  Well, we haven't had anyone yet. We're doing -- tonight is our firstnight.CAVUTO:  Oh.(CROSSTALK)DORF:  We have not had anyone test positive.They're -- the antigen tests apparently have more false positives than theydo negatives. They're very good, 99.9 percent on the negative test side.But, on the positives, it's about 90 percent. So we are expecting a fewpositives this evening.Then the doctor will give them a PCR test, which will then -- it takes 24hours for results, and we won't let you in. But then if there -- if you arepositive, it's really good that you got the test, and especially if you'reasymptomatic. That's why testing is a really important thing to be doing,so we can beat down the virus.CAVUTO:  The ones who might test positive, well, let's say people coming intonight, will you give them the voucher to come back, once you're negative,drinks on us?DORF:  Yes. Yes, we -- lookit, we don't want to turn anyone down.We actually don't want to be charging people money for this. We wouldprefer to have it back to where -- the way it was. But that's not thereality. It's a harsh reality. We have about six months to wait until Mayor June, when the vaccines will be deployed. We have got to survive to thatpoint.And this seems like a safe way to go.CAVUTO:  It's not a bad idea. It might ruffle some feathers, but the more Ithink about it, keeps your staff safe, keeps you safe. Other customers arereassured they're safe. So, it might be a win-win.The $50 thing, maybe if you drink it enough wine, you don't -- you ignorethe $50. You forget that you just spent it.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  So, Michael, we will see what happens.Thank you very, very much, Michael Dorf, the City Winery founder and CEO.By the way, they're not the only ones dabbling with this. A lot of otherrestaurants are playing with ways to make customers feel that, wherethey're eating, they're safe, it's a safe zone, and the tests prove it.All right, that will do it here.Again, the Dow Jones industrials now over 30000. Indications right now themore promising talk on vaccines, which, by the way, could removerequirements for tests like that, the better things look.Here comes "THE FIVE."ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
