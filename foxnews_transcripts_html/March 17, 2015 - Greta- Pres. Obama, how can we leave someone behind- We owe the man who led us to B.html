Let's all go "Off the Record." A message to President Obama: Help! We have left a man behind on the proverbial battlefield.
That's not like us, and it shouldn't be. I'm talking about Pakistani Dr. Shakil Afridi. He is our hero. He helped the CIA run that fake vaccine campaign, which led us to Usama bin Laden. We never would have gotten bin Laden if it were not for Dr. Afridi. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Where is this hero? He is in danger. He is rotting in a Pakistani prison. He was arrested shortly after bin Laden was killed. Yeah, I know, the cover story is that he is not in prison for helping us get bin Laden. I don't believe that for one second, do you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Don't forget, the Pakistanis were furious that our Navy SEALs sneaked into Pakistan to get bin Laden. This, after Pakistan pretended for years they didn't know where bin Laden was, even though he was right under their nose. Yeah, right. They didn't know where he was. I think Dr. Afridi's imprisonment is Pakistani payback because we dared to have him help us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, we should get him out and bring him to the United States, where he is safe. And don't tell me it can't happen. Does the Sergeant Bergdahl-Taliban deal ring a bell? If our administration would go that extra mile for a potential deserter, why not a deal for a hero, for a guy who risked his life for us?
Getting Dr. Afridi out shouldn't be an option. We owe it to him. What are we waiting for? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
