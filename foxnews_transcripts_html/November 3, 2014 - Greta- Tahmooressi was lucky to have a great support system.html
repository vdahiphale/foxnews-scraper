     Video  Greta: Tahmooressi was lucky to have a great support system 
'Off the Record,' 11/3/14: If you see a veteran who may be in distress, make a call or take the time to say, 'Thank you.'

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I have seen your e-mails, tweets, Facebook posts, and GretaWire comments, and you are just as happy as I am that Sergeant Tahmooressi is home. It has been a long haul, something that shouldn't have taken 214 days, but should have taken two days.
What stands out tonight to me is that Sergeant Tahmooressi is so lucky to have a mother like Jill, a good friend like Montel Williams, and supportive viewers like you. I worry, though, about all our other vets, thousands who have served us so well, so honorably, and suffering tonight because we may have overlooked them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, let this be a reminder to all of us, meaning to me, too: If you know a vet who might be in trouble or hurting or being lonely, make a phone call. Sometimes even a two-minute phone call to say thank you can make a huge difference. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the coming days, you're going to hear from Sergeant Tahmooressi right here on "On the Record." And I'm pretty sure he's going to have a message for all of you, too. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
