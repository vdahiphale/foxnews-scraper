     Video  Cavuto: What a difference a week makes 
Remember when Hillary couldn't lose and Trump couldn't win? 
A week ago today, Hillary Clinton couldn't lose and Donald Trump couldn't win.

A week ago today she was campaigning with more surrogates in more places than we had ever seen. A week ago today, he was campaigning largely on his own with no surrogates in places he shouldn't have been.
A week ago today she was nailing down Democratic strongholds with folks like Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. A week ago today he was going to those same Democratic strongholds and they said he was wasting his time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today, she had Lady Gaga and experts said he'd be lucky to have any lady voters, at all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today they were debating the size of her win and whether he'd accept the loss. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today they were talking about angry Trump voters who'd riot than accept that fate. A week ago today they were already saying the Trump brand was bruised, and he'd never get it back.
A week ago today newspapers and magazines were fine-tuning their "Madame President" covers as they were planning their Donald Trump obituaries. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today the Grand Old Party was a grand old lost cause and the Democratic Party was in the midst of a generational lock.
A week ago today pundits were writing about the last angry musings of a populist candidate desperately trying to rally his base, unaware what he was rallying went way beyond his base. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today few pundits saw the shifting sands beneath them, until that shift hit the fan and there was barely a dropped jaw among them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today no sign they would be humbled, far more attention on this guy Trump and how he continued to bumble.
It's amazing how much things can change in a week. It's weak the excuses experts have come up with for missing that change since.
A week ago today no signs of the big pivot to come, but here we are now and the great pivot is on. Not from a media that should be focusing on how it screwed up, but on the man they dismissed and how he inevitably will screw up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So they're back to bashing him over staffing choices they never thought he'd be making and we're supposed to forget a week ago today, what these same experts were saying.
A week ago today they were busy fooling us with data they said was indisputable and now we're supposed to forget blatant biases that were and are reprehensible.
A week ago today they could almost get away with it because it looked like they were right, not so much now because they got it so wrong. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A week ago today they could fool us and make us think Jay Z and Beyonce and Lady Gaga would wow us, until the music stopped and their excuses started. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It would take one more day for it all to come crumbling down. But a week ago today, one last day before the whole gig was up.  </pre>
