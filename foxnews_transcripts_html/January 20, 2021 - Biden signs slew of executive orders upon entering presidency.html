BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Total unity. Jesse, thank you.Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Tonight, America has a new president and a -- and the free world has a newleader following a unique and understated inauguration ceremony heldagainst the backdrop of significant national division, lockdown security,and of course a deadly global pandemic.President Joe Biden immediately took the reins by signing a number ofexecutive orders in the Oval Office, essentially reversing several of hispredecessor's initiatives.About a thousand miles away, Donald Trump began his life as a formerpresident, after four tumultuous years in office leaving a letter writtento his successor in the Resolute desk. Like the letter, Trump received fromhis predecessor President Barack Obama.We have Fox team coverage tonight. We have reporters blanketing in theWashington area and really across the world. We begin with White HouseCorrespondent Peter Doocy and the highlights from today's historicinauguration. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. The first time we laid eyes on President Biden at the Resolute deskin the Oval Office, he was wearing a mask. He already had a whole bunch offamily photos on the table behind him and he was sitting next to a stack,about a foot and a half tall of orders to sign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I thought with the state ofnation today, there's no time to waste. Get to work immediately.DOOCY (voice over): Taking this oath on a Biden family Bible from the 19thcentury.BIDEN: So, help me God.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, Mr. President.DOOCY: Got the 46th President a limo with license plates that say 46. A newhouse and an authority that turns his signature into presidential action.Today's list of executive orders address immigration by immediatelystopping construction of the southern border wall and reversing the travelban on passengers coming from majority Muslim countries.BIDEN: We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.DOOCY: Another day one priority, climate change and some executive actionsborrowed from the Obama administration like killing the Keystone XLpipelines permit and rejoining the Paris climate accords.BIDEN: This is America's day.DOOCY: President Biden is also ordering a 100-day masking challengerequiring face covering on federal property and for interstate travelers.BIDEN: We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of thevirus.DOOCY: Biden was joined at the Capitol and at an Arlington NationalCemetery wreath-laying by predecessors Barack Obama, George W. Bush andBill Clinton.President Trump was absent and never came up in the inaugural address. ButBiden did call out political figures he believes sowed discord.BIDEN: Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson, there istruth and there are lies. Lies toll for power and for profit.And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americansand especially as leaders. Leaders who have pledged to honor ourConstitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat thelies.DOOCY: So, he says his rise to the presidency represents a return tonormalcy.BIDEN: We must end this uncivil war. The pits red against blue, ruralversus urban or rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): Biden has read the letter President Trump left for himin the drawer in the Resolute desk and he says he doesn't want to talkabout what it says until he talks to Trump because it is private. But hetwice described what the former president wrote as being generous, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thank you.Former President Trump is at his Florida resort home tonight havingdeclined to attend his successor's inauguration.In his final hours as president, he granted dozens of pardons andcommutations and left a tease about possibilities to come. CorrespondentDavid Spunt reports tonight from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The 45thpresident left the White House on a windy inauguration morning, bound notfor his successor swearing in, but Joint Base Andrews.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It has been a greathonor, the honor of a lifetime.SPUNT: The first couple left the South Lawn one last time in Marine Onebefore arriving at the base minutes later.TRUMP: I can tell you that from the bottom of my heart, this has been anincredible four years. We've accomplished so much together. I want to thankall of my family and my friends and my staff and so many other people forbeing here.SPUNT: President Trump wished his successor's well, without directlymentioning the names Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.TRUMP: I wish the new administration, great luck and great success. I thinkthey'll have great success. They have the foundation to do something reallyspectacular.SPUNT: In one of his last access, President Donald Trump issued 144 pardonsand commutations, including former aide Steve Bannon charged withdefrauding donors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars meant toconstruct part of the border wall. Bannon's alleged co-conspirators werenot pardoned. Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy also pardonedDespite rumblings in the mainstream media, the President did not pardonhimself, the members of his family or anybody involved in the siege of theCapitol earlier this month.TRUMP: This is a five-year lobbying ban.SPUNT: Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump signed an executive orderbanning administration staffers from lobbying the government or lobbying ona foreign government's behalf. Supporters touted the move as draining theswamp.But late last night on his final night in office, Trump rescinded theorder, leaving former staffers with plenty of future opportunities, thoughhis future opportunities remain a mystery.TRUMP: So, just a goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): We will be back in some form, Bret. What form is thequestion? The former president with his family in Palm Beach this evening,but I suspect in the coming weeks and months, we'll hear what's next for apresident that changed the office, Bret.BAIER: David, thank you. The overarching theme of the new president'sinaugural address today was unity. Let's take a closer look at that speech.Here's White House Correspondent Kristin Fisher.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: My whole soul is in this bringing America together, uniting ourpeople, uniting our nation. And I asked every American to join me in thiscause.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President JoeBiden making a direct appeal to the 74 million Americans who voted for hispredecessor.BIDEN: Hear me out as we move forward. Take your measure, me and my heart.If you still disagree so big, that's democracy.FISHER: The 46th president had promised to make unity, the central theme ofhis inaugural address and it was. But there were few specifics about how heintends to truly bring together a deeply divided nation.President Biden never mentioned his predecessor by name or a possibleimpeachment trial. He never as the Wall Street Journal editorial board hadsuggested spoke out against the burgeoning progressive desire to punish,blacklist and censor the political opposition.And just a few hours later, he issued 17 executive actions to reverse manyof his predecessor's signature policies.BIDEN: We have much to do in this winter of peril and significantpossibilities, much to repair, much to restore.FISHER: President Biden acknowledged he's assuming office at one of themost difficult times in American history. From a once in a century virus tothe economic crisis and the deep domestic divisions laid bare two weeks agowhen writers stormed the Capitol on the exact steps where the presidentdelivered his inaugural address.BIDEN: Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy hasprevailed.FISHER: With a peaceful transfer of power complete, attention turns to thenew president's agenda.In the address, he was light on details about what he hopes to accomplishduring his first 100 days in office. But he did reference two issues thathe believes the previous administration neglected, racial inequality andclimate change.BIDEN: The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): So, now comes the first real test of this newadministration. After today's address, what action does President Bidentake to prove that his calls for unity are more than just words, Bret?BAIER: Kristin Fisher at the White House. Kristin, thank you.Let's bring in our expanded inauguration panel, Fox News senior politicalanalyst Brit Hume. Laura Ingraham, host of "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE". DonnaBrazile, former interim Chair of Democratic National Committee and BillBennett, former education secretary and host of the Bill Bennett showpodcast.Bill, let me start with you. Your thoughts on the speech, the day, themoment, the new president?BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it was Flannery O'Connorwho said I hate to find tedious what's giving such general satisfaction,but I found that tedious. This was not a great speech.Let me get to the main point. Unity is not a fundamental American value. Weagree to disagree on things. We hold these truths to be self-evident.The man is created by God an equal rights, equal rights to pursue happinessand life and liberty. Unity is not in there. Equality and liberty are thefundamental rights, not unity.Madison says in the 10th Federalist Paper, faction is what motivatesAmericans. That's passions and opinions on different things. We give it asa -- as a given in American life that we will have different opinions.It's the sorting out of those opinions, how we resolve those differences,not unity, you're not going to get people on the far left of the Bidenspectrum, and Donald Trump's right side to agree on things, and how do wesort them out?And I think the president showed today in his list, that's not unity he'safter. His list suggests disunity, disagreement, fundamental divisiveness,that's a more honorable way to go actually.Barack Obama said, you know, we won, the election returns matter. Let's doit that way. Now, will civility prevail? Not unity, but civility.BAIER: Yes, Donna, I'm sure you saw it differently. You're up on theplatform with Congressman Steve Scalise. I should point out as I'm talkingto you here, the Senate is moving forward with the vote on Avril Haines,the Director of National Intelligence expected to be approved tonight.Donna, your thoughts on what Bill just said and you're look at today?DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I believe what President Bidenwas referring to and calling for unity is to summon us as American citizensto look at the major challenges that we're facing today, including thevirus, the coronavirus, the economic uncertainty because of the virus,climate change is a real crisis and of course, racial equity. And he saidthe only way we can achieve these results in any other results is to cometogether and I believe that is his fundamental belief. It was a heartfeltplea.And so, while it may not be a traditional American value, given the hourand of course the incidence of the recent weeks, and year, I would go asfar as to say the last year, it is time that we try to unify around certainprinciples so that in order for us to move ahead.BAIER: I want to -- a lot of talk about the speech, President Biden'sspeech, but I want to reflect back on one other moment, Brit today andthat's the poet laureate, 22-year-old Amanda Gorman, who really seemed tobe a bright star in this ceremony today. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AMANDA GORMAN, POET: We will not march back to what was but move to whatshall be, a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierceand free, we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidationbecause we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of thenext generation, our blunders become their burdens. But one thing iscertain: if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then lovebecomes our legacy and change our children's birthright.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A Hill To Climb is the name of the poem. She wrote it -- finished iton January 6th when Capitol Hill was under attack obviously. She has echoesof Mayo Angelou there Maya Angelou.Brit, your thoughts on the ceremony today?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I thought theceremony was moving as it always is, this peaceful transfer of power didcome about despite doubts that it ever would.In fact, it doesn't appear that there was any significant threats to(INAUDIBLE) in the United States Capitol, but in state capitals all aroundthe country. That's a good thing.I think the new president did what he could to set a tone. I think BillBennett has a -- has a good point and that -- and then it seems to me thatPresident Biden actually mentioned that he didn't expect everybody to agreeon everything, or even coming close to that.What he really was calling for as Bill suggested is civility. And we have aserious lack of that. Joe Biden is an amiable character, familiar to hiscolleagues, liked by many of them, that will make things a bit easier.Now, there may be areas of compromise that can be achieved outside thepoisonous atmosphere that has governed our politics for many years now. Hemay be able to take some serious steps in the direction away from that,that would be a good thing.I also think that, you know, he has incoming presidents tend to doexaggerate it, to some extent the severity of the crises around us.Actually, many things are -- many things in this country are doing well.But that's for another day, he will inherit those things and they willbenefit him.BAIER: Laura, a lot of talk about President Trump not attending theinauguration, not mentioning Biden by name as he was speaking about it. Hedid leave a letter on the Resolute desk as his predecessor did for him.And Joe Biden, the president talking about that, asked about in the OvalOffice just moments ago. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: President wrote a very generous letter. I have it. Because it wasprivate, I will not talk about it until I talk to him. But it was generous.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Talking about it being generous. Your thoughts on President Trump,his leaving, and where he stands tonight?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, just one more -- one morepoint on the unity and the civility point and I will get to that.Look, I think you unite around common principles and common values, sharedvalues, tradition is a big part of that in any country. Our belief inliberty. Ass Bill said, freedom. That's at the center of our Americanfounding.The problem with trying to unify at this moment is that those fundamentalideals are being called systematically racist, illegitimate, founded onlies, under attack in our schools.So, it's nice to say unity, and it sounds -- it's wonderful to be civil,but those calls often come, Bret, not when the left is rampaging throughthe streets -- American streets, but after Democrats win.And then, like, OK, let's all be civil now. Well, OK, last week they were -- no, last week, this week -- last week, they were saying Donald Trump wasa white supremacist. And so -- and so that is a little bit difficult for alot of people to swallow.But on issue of President Trump, I thought it was interesting today as hewas leaving, he said, I hope the next administration is successful. Hedidn't mention Biden's name, which says everyone on the left in a -- in atizzy.But he said, and I think they will be successful. They said we've left --basically, we've left behind a solid framework.I think he did that off the cuff, but in those moments where Biden saidTrump was generous, and Trump said, look, I think he can be successful,both of them in their way are very charming people.Trump can be very charming, I know people watching this, you don't like,are like, oh, he's never charming. But he can be. It was most -- his mostunderutilized asset.In Biden, anyone who knows, and I know Brit knows him well, and Brett, youdo too. He is -- he --- when the -- when the old Biden around town as asenator, no one's more charming than Joe Biden.So, there are moments at times of great political acrimony where you seethe -- you know, the real people who do want the best I think for thecountry, but with diametrically opposed views on key issues: power to thepeople or power to the government. Liberty versus control, dominationversus individual sovereignty and civil liberties. So, it's going to be a -- it's going to be an interesting for years.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: But --INGRAHAM: That's for sure.BAIER: It definitely will.Bill, just to your point, to get things done, they're going to have tonegotiate. There is going to have to be this -- and whether it's moderate,Democrats, and Republicans, they're going to have to get together to getlegislation across the finish line, or are you saying that the Republicansto stand up and block whatever they can't.BENNETT: No, no, they are going to have to get together. And the presentleads here, one would assume this president would lead. Is he get a leadand call off the impeachment dogs? Is he get a lead and say let's not getrid of the filibuster? Is he get a lead on, you know, a number of otherfronts? Obviously, McConnell and the -- and the Senate Republicans arewilling to go along with those things.The point about unity is not that it's a fundamental American values. Youcan come together on some things even where you disagree. But, if thepresident is calling today as he was for unity, he could sure show that alittle bit better in the upcoming weeks or days in a couple of the issues Ijust mentioned.BAIER: All right, Donna, 15 seconds left. Last word.BRAZILE: I think the president is earnest and he has a history of reachingout, and if -- and then if the Republicans would like to help this countrymove forward, they will also do the same. It takes two.BAIER: All right, panel, standby if you would. We'll have more to panel ina bit. And up next, the check of the day's other headlines. And then,Washington remains under heavy security tonight. We'll have a live report.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Inauguration obviously the big news, but here are some of the otherday's other headlines from today. 22-year-old Harrisburg, Pennsylvaniawoman is now officially accused of stealing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi'slaptop during the Capitol riot.

Somecongressional sources suggest a major Biden priority, a $1.9 trillion COVIDrelief package could now be delayed until March. One reason, severalfederal unemployment benefits are due to expire March 14th. And sourcesnote the Senate can be slow-moving, particularly when it's handlingconfirmations. Several leadership sources suggest a smaller COVID reliefpackage could be moved sooner, trying to get an early win. Bret?BAIER:  Mike, thank you.A short time ago at the White House, President Biden administered the oathof office to 1,000 political appointees via videoconference. You can seethis video coming in from the state dining room. He told the group theywill work long hours, have the opportunity and privilege to impact peoplearound the world. He also told them "I'm not joking when I saw this. If youever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect,talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot, no ifs, ands, or buts.Everybody's entitled to be treated with decency and dignity. That's beenmissing in a big way the last four years."

JAMES LANKFORD, (R-OK):  Is economic opportunity a valid reason forasylum?MAYORAS:  Just generally an opportunity to make a better living, if that iswhat you are referring to, that -- my understanding is that that does not alegitimate asylum claim make.EMANUEL:  But history shows what makes a legitimate claim is open to thosewho enforce it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are desperate, they are desperate.EMANUEL:  Shunned by the Trump administration, these asylum-seekers inTijuana want immediate entry.

Thank you, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Now, former president Donald Trump leaving Washington, heading toFlorida. We're back with our panel, Brit Hume, Laura Ingraham, DonnaBrazile, and Bill Bennett. Laura, let me start with you. You heard thatgoodbye. What do you think the future politically is for now formerPresident Trump?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  It remains to be seen, which seems like acop-out answer. But it's hard to imagine, Bret, that with such a powerfulfollowing, even with all the tumult, with every presidency, a missedopportunity here, a mistake there. Being judged on the totality of hisaccomplishments, on everything from trade to wages for middle classAmericans, criminal justice reform, traditionally not a conservative issue,peace deals -- I think in some period of time, after all of this pageantryand the symbolism of today wears away and we are just living in the brutal,stark reality of a new administration, I think people who might not to haveloved Trump might say, I didn't like his tone, maybe, but some of thosepolicies actually put money in my pocket.And it's hard, I think, for him perhaps to walk away from that. And whetherhe runs for president or not, it's a long time, four years is a long timefrom now. Things change, people change, everyone is getting older. Will hedo it? I have no idea. But that 74 million people who voted for him, mostof them are going to be around. And who's going to step forward to takethat America first mantle?BAIER:  Donna, after January 6th and the riot on Capitol Hill, a lot seemedto change politically. But is there a sense that there will be an outreachto the 74 million who voted for Trump? There have been so many liberalcolumnists and pundits who have said they need to be reprogrammed or theyneed to be squashed or some different phrasing like that. What about thatoutreach?DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  First of all, they are ourneighbors, our coworkers. We might be even in church with some of them. I'msure we go to grocery stores together, bowling alleys together, movietheaters, the things we used to do before we had to wear a mask and besocially distant. So yes, there is no question that we should constantlyreach out to the other side. Whether we are successful or not successful,the end goal should be to build the country back stronger.President Trump came into office with America first, now President Biden iscoming to office with building back stronger. I think there's lots to do.And we are going to -- when I say we, the Democrats will need Republicansbecause we have a slim majority. And as you well know, in the House and theSenate, if you get a few members to sit down, work together, we might beable to come up with some commonsense solutions.BAIER:  Brit, elections have consequences. As you see this scrolling video,these are the executive orders that are essentially undoing many ofPresident Trump's initiatives. That is one element, but obviously the bigsweeping things have to happen legislatively.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, and as we talked aboutit, Bret, it won't be easy to do that. I guess they could try to blow upthe filibuster, though some Democrats have indicated they are notcomfortable with that. Joe Manchin, the Democrat from a very red state,West Virginia, has said he would not vote for that. So they are operatingwithin narrow confines here. It'll be interesting to see how it goes.As for Trump, what Laura was talking about is right. He composed ofremarkable record of achievement. The problem he had, and the reason, Ithink, he lost the election was he had a reelection record on the issues.But his personality so offended so many people that they turned out instaggering numbers and overcame the 74 million who voted for him. And thosenumbers, those 74 million, were composed of two elements. One was thehardcore Trumpers who were the kind of the people that would turn out forthat rally at the Capitol two weeks ago, and the rest were ordinaryRepublicans who were content to live with him because they liked what he'daccomplished.But I never saw a political figure, certainly not a president do himselfmore damage in a shorter period of time than Donald Trump did in his lasttwo month in office. His behavior was what drove people to believe in thefalsehood that it was a stolen election that he had won in a landslide andall the rest of it. So he has a lot to overcome with everyday Republicans,and it will remain to be seen if he can find a platform from which to doit.BAIER:  Bill?BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Well, on the Biden side, want tobe neighbors -- neighbors don't impeach neighbors. He might apologize forthe first impeachment and stop the second one.As for Donald Trump, whatever he does, he goes off the scene. The politicalphilosophy of Donald Trump, the policies of Donald Trump remain very strongand very appealing. And I believe they will become more appealing as theBiden years go on. This country is extremely strong in many ways that itwasn't before. It's now a party of the working class. We have shown that weare energy independent. This crazy pipeline deal today is not a unifyingmessage.So that philosophy remains offstage, I don't think far off stage. I thinkwe will see it again, maybe in someone else's hands other than DonaldTrump.BAIER:  The Canadian prime minister weighing in on the Keystone XLpipeline, saying he is saddened by the move, but we'll see where this allgoes.We know the big headline, but when we come back, a sneak peek at tomorrow'sheadlines.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, we can imagine the big headline, but a look attomorrow's headline. Back at the panel. Laura, what do you see?INGRAHAM:  President Biden says dark winter requires united front. Theprediction that it's going to be pretty dismal in America for the next, Iguess couple of months at least. I protect that the 100-day mask mandatewill turn into an indefinite mask mandate, and I wouldn't be surprised ifwe were wearing masks four years from now in the next presidential race.BAIER:  All right, Donna, what is your headline?BRAZILE:  The peaceful transition of power is now complete. The NationalGuard will be able to go home. And I want to say thank you to all of themand all of the other jurisdictions that sent personnel to help us out. Theother, below the fold, is that the first shelter dog ever to go to theWhite House, Major, there will be a first sighting tomorrow.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  Dana Perino will be happy about that. All right, Bill, yourheadline?BENNETT:  Biden preaches unity, acts otherwise, more divisive actions byBiden to come. Second headline, Trump exits stage left or stage right, buthis philosophy, the Trump doctrine, remains strong, and it is looming andhas a future.BAIER:  What paper do you read, Bill?(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  All right, Brit, what's your headline tomorrow?HUME:  Media swoon as Biden takes office. Fact-checking units are disbandedand universities offer new major in the wonders of the Biden program.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  There you go. Always a good panel. Well, thank you so much,appreciate it.
