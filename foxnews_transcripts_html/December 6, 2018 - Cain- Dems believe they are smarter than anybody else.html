LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I am Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. With disgraced FBI director Jim Comey set to testify on the Hill tomorrow, there are specific questions that need to be asked and answered, namely why did Hillary aides Cheryl Mills and who Huma Abedin likely get away with lying to the FBI while Trump associates are prosecuted. Byron York has some answers.
And while the resistance cheers, the Mueller probe may have inadvertently ensnared former Clinton and Obama aides. Professor Jonathan Turley will tell us why this is another sign that Mueller has overstepped his bounds. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus, we were led to believe that everything the government tells us about climate science is true, but what if those reports are being funded by billionaire activists? The man who investigated the latest climate report is here to tell us what's going on. Herman Cain and Raymond Arroyo are here as well. But first, the attack of the liberal killjoy's. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });

        }
      
Liberals are trying to tell us how to feel, how to celebrate, and if you can believe it, even how to pray during the holidays. A few decades back, they fought really hard against a campaign by Tipper Gore. Remember when she was lobbying for warning labels on music that had explicit content in the lyrics? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's face it. Whenever parents for instance raise concerns about the music industry's gross, explicit lyrics or over-sexualized scenes on T.V., well, liberals responded with, oh, just change the channel. But today, they have a current case of amnesia because they are now the new censors, and the offending content, Christmas songs.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you see in the video how she tries to leave and he grabs her arm and then she looks at her arm. And then he closes the thing and says you can't leave. I mean, that part is somewhat coercive. I mean, I have to say it's making me re-think --

INGRAHAM: Now I am rethinking a lot of things too after watching (inaudible) comment there. All right. Maybe it's really cold outside. Well, notice how the left, they don't want to place any limits on what is truly objectionable content, you know, hip-hop, rap, some of the worst of stuff which routinely objectifies women, demonizes law enforcement and celebrate things called murder. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
But instead they seek to spit (ph) the darkest spin on part of our American musical traditions. The left has no problem with performances like these, but ‘Baby, It's Cold Outside’ is a national disgrace. Thankfully not everyone is thrilled though about where the politically correct crowd is taking us.

INGRAHAM: Bingo, Gayle King. Even Christmas specials, we used to look forward to them every year. They only played once a year that made them more special. Even though specials aren't safe from the liberal black list. Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer has been singled out by The Huffington Post as seriously problematic.
Have they watched T.V. recently? People are being sexually assaulted and brutalized 24/7, Huff Po. But a 54-year-old clay animation reindeer sends them all to the crying room? Well, actually scenes like this are quite harrowing.

Now, this is a beloved Christmas special and the longest continuously running one as well. But do you see what liberals seek to do? They are trying to disrupt and destroy traditions and replace them with their own version of some transitory nonsense. By seeing dark forces and even an innocent Christmas special, they divide us with the goal of ripping away yet another little innocuous thing that families have enjoyed for more than half a century.
But nothing fun and traditional is off-limits or I would say for any of these censorious liberals. Years ago they started complaining that Charlie Brown, that Christmas special, was offensive too, you know, because it was too Christian.

Now, the left are the worst types more or less because they claim not to be. They talk about tolerance and diversity and being your authentic self. I'm going to speak my truth. But what they really want is for you to bow down and worship at their altar of self-righteous political correctness. They want to control what you watch, what you eat, what you hear and yes, how you speak, and even as we saw during the Bush 41 funeral yesterday, how you pray.

INGRAHAM: First of all, Trump is considered a very religious person? I don't know what she's reading. Sally Quinn, who is a journalist, who in her memoir described hexing three people, two of whom died, and she's going to demand that Trump recite a religious creed at a public ceremony or judge him? Let there no judgment.
But again, this is the problem with the left, depending on the politics of the moment they go from being libertines to puritans. The once aggressive seculars suddenly become religious enforcers. And these are the same people who by the way applauded when prayer was driven out of public schools and who cheered when manger scenes were pulled from the public square.
For ever crowing about how we need separation of church and state, a phrase found nowhere in any of our founding documents. My friend, today's left is blissfully unaware of how much they become caricatures of what they accuse conservatives of being. They claim to be tolerant.

They are among the most rigid, intolerant people on the planet. They claim to be pro-choice. That only applies to abortion, maybe or gender. They claim to be for creative expression, but they are control freaks and monoliths. They really want to do is stifle and marginalize conservative voices whether they are on college campuses, in the workplace, in the U.S. military or yes, right here on cable T.V.
And while they point the finger at Trump for being divisive, they are the ones working overtime to divide the country along lines of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, just to name a few. But above all, liberals have become aggressively boring and no fun at all. And that's “The Angle.”
Joining me now for reaction is attorney and RNC committeewoman from California, Harmeet Dhillon, Fox news contributor Raymond Arroyo, and CRO of DSPolitical Jennifer Holdsworth. First of all, I want everyone to know that this is a safe space here. You can -- we won't censor you like some of the liberals.

RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: The jokes are out the door. You can't kid and look, how do we get over difficult situations? How do we overcome and find connections with people we disagree with? We joke. We make fun of each other and ourselves.
That is being pushed further and further out of society. You see it in some of the clips you played. You can't do a little racy or suggestive song. This was a way in the 1950s that people interacted. It was a way to suggest something without gratuitously hitting you over the head with it.

Now, we are in a gratuitous age where you can't make the quiet sideswipe, the fun jokes on the side. Everything has got to be to be very plain, very black and white and frankly it's a lot uglier out there today.
INGRAHAM: It's more divisive and not fun. Jennifer, this is what Jerry Seinfeld said a few years ago. He was on with Seth Meyers talking about what it's like to be on the comedy circuit. He's also said he will not perform on college campuses because talk about an un-fun place these days. Let's watch.

JENNIFER HOLDSWORTH, CRO, DSPOLITICAL: I don't think it's so much about political correctness as it is to just being sensitive of what might really hurt someone. And, you know, look, when we talk about, you know, Christmas songs, I wouldn't necessarily put ‘Baby, It's Cold Outside’ in the realm of Christmas songs. You know, when you talk about liberals --
INGRAHAM: Oh, even if it's not.
HOLDSWORTH: -- criticizing, you know, the way --
INGRAHAM: Does it play it in June? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HOLDSWORTH: -- the way President Trump, you know, praise. You know, this is a president who was sitting less than a foot away from another president who, you know, a lot of conservatives talked about being a Muslim for the last decade, as if there was something wrong with that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, I think when we talk about turning the tide of the national conversation into something that's a little less offensive. It doesn't have to do with political correctness. I would like to see what conservatives would have said had it been President Obama who did not recite the Apostles Creed when the entire rest of the church did.
INGRAHAM: One thing that's different here is that conservatives actually try to say we want to conserve the culture. We want to conserve that what makes us different is OK. It's okay to be different. It's OK to have different points of view.
But what I'm trying to get to, Jennifer, and you didn't quite seem to understand what I'm saying, is that in this world of -- if you are offended, I can't say it. I can't even feel it for fear of losing my job, not getting a promotion, and not getting a benefit in the workplace. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

People are afraid to speak their minds. That is not liberal. That's scary. And that is censorious. That's what the left always considered conservative. Harmeet Dhillon.
HARMEET DHILLON, Calif. RNC COMMITTEEWOMAN: Absolutely, Laura. I mean, you know, conservatives are not in the business of critiquing how people pray. I just think that's crass and, you know, he prayed the way he felt comfortable doing. And it's not our business to critique that.
But what I see on college campuses and workplaces where I do a lot of litigation is that people are constantly censoring themselves, walking around on eggshells. You know, young people are actually doing consent videos before they move to second base with a girl so that they don't get sued. And it's really sucking all the joy out of life --
INGRAHAM: And romance.

DHILLON: And romance. And if I were a young person these days, I mean, I would be very stressed out and having to take all the drugs they take now because they're always worried about what the new rules are.
HOLDSWORTH: I mean, are you saying that consent is sucking the joy out of romance?
DHILLON: No, what I said was making a video to document the consent is sucking the joy out of interactions between the sexes.
ARROYO: Fear of being dragged before a board or the fear of litigation keeps boys from asking girl out and vice versa in some cases because they don't know where the line is going to be.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: When you pray, what do you pray for?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to talk to you about that. I mean, I pray. It's very personal to me. I'm a person of belief. I certainly, you know, I pray for my family. I pray for our country. But I don't want to talk to you about that. I think that's very personal.

INGRAHAM: I do. Go to my twitter feed. You are a liberal. You can do whatever you want.
ARROYO: With apologies to the jewelry choices ladies. The moment criticizing the man for not praying the Creed though or reciting it, first of all, you are dealing with the man who I think is new to faith. He's working his way through it and he's not ostentatious.

But I would, Jennifer, but I would prefer someone -- I would rather a faithful pagan who follows -- protects religious freedom and advances basic morality in our government over a pious fraud who assaults both.

DHILLON: But it's the secular humanist. They don't believe it themselves.

HOLDSWORTH: Liberals have been called godless for years when they have worshiped a variety of gods.
INGRAHAM: What?
HOLDSWORTH: And I think if you're --
INGRAHAM: That's a non sequitur. You are not arguing the point. The point is that liberals claim that they are pro-choice, be who you want to be, be your authentic self, my truth. Trump is praying the way he darn wants and he gets trashed by Don Lemon. Don Lemon used to be someone I actually respect.
Don Lemon has gone so far over the line. God bless him. I don't know what's going on with him, but you are so obsessed with trashing Trump that you've got to trash him, you know, at the moment when everyone is honoring George Bush. I don't understand that.
I think it speaks so poorly of where this culture is and I think it goes back to, Jennifer. People are truly just afraid. They are afraid. They are afraid to speak, afraid to feel. Now, if you hum along to ‘Baby, It's Cold Outside,’ you might as well have raped somebody. I mean, honestly, it's gone way over board and it's, well, this is just not fun. There's no fun.
Can you really have fun? I guess you can smoke pot, do edibles and then talk about how you might want to change your gender and that's kind of interesting, I guess, but you can't do much else. I guess play sports. Honestly, and the public life, it's very hard. Jerry Seinfeld is right. Humor is dead and that's why they go into political humor and they trash Trump.

INGRAHAM: All right guys. All right, thank you so much. And our next guest by the way joins us to expand on what we brought you in last night's “Angle.” Well, the Democrats claim to be, you know, they are the smart party. They are the science party, the intellectuals, all the troglodytes who voted for Trump, clinging for your guns and religion and all the deplorables.
You just need to sit down, shut up and let the smart people run the country because things are very complicated. Last night we pointed that out to you and sadly the left and many of the GOP establishment smarts have been wrong on issue after issue for years. And today, well, they were just wrong on geography.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-Calif.: We can move forward with this. We have a responsibility, all of us to secure our borders. North, south, and coming in by plane on our coasts, three coasts, north, south, and west. And that's it. It's a responsibility we honor, but we do so by honoring our values as well.

HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am on the east part of the nation. Allow me, Laura, for one moment. I want to respond to Jennifer, your previous guest --
INGRAHAM: She's right here.
CAIN: before we get into our topic, OK. The constitution says freedom of religion which means also freedom to read and freedom to not read if you don't want to. I have been in a --
HOLDSWORTH: It also means freedom from religion, sir.
CAIN: Allow me to speak, please. You had your chance to say what you wanted to say. I have been in a different religious setting than my normal setting and I didn't pretend to do everything that they did because I wasn't comfortable doing it. So I remained silent and I did read.
Now, the liberals want to make a big deal out of that that the man didn't read. Freedom of religion means, excuse me for getting a little passionate about this, also means freedom to not read if you don't want to.
Now, Laura, the compilation that you put together last night was so impressive to me and my folk that I wanted to reproduce that clip on my website, hermancain.com. It demonstrates without a question of a doubt how hypocritical that the Democrats are, and it demonstrates clearly, better than anything that I have ever seen, that they do believe that they are smarter than everybody else.

This is why they are trying to destroy and change our culture from top to bottom. That's what they are trying to do. And you made that point very clearly by showing what they have said historically and what Senator Hirono had said.
INGRAHAM: A lot of the Republicans have got -- yes, a lot of Republicans have screwed up along the way as well.
CAIN: Exactly. And that's exactly --
INGRAHAM: I mean, of opening the -- China into the WTO, not worrying about the housing bubble, the housing credit.

CAIN: Laura, that is not a sign of tolerance. That is a sign of disdain and trying to enforce the liberal doctrine of you conform the way we want you to conform or we are going to try and intimidate and ostracize you. That's what Don Lemon is talking about. They were at a funeral.
INGRAHAM: All right, I got to get to my Apostle's Creed here. I've got to get to my Apostle's Creed and I think I got to go to confession after this segment.

REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: Do you see how someone could view the context of what she did, set up a private system, she alone controlled it. She kept everything on it. We now know from Ms. Abedin's deposition that they did it for that very reason. And when they got caught, they deleted what they had and they scrubbed their devices. Is that part of the context in evaluating this decision?
JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Sure, sure. And understand what inferences can be drawn from that collection of facts, of course.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: What inferences could be drawn? BleachBit. Former FBI director Jim Comey will be back on the Hill tomorrow and there are some double standards at play, namely when it was revealed in e-mail the Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills had likely lied to the FBI about their knowledge of her private server. Why the heck weren't they punished?
This question has new resonance in the wake of General Flynn's life being turned upside down on account of similar transgressions, lying, a 1001 violation. So might Comey face questions about that double standard? Here with us is Byron York, "Washington Examiner" correspondent and Fox News contributor. Byron, you just wrote a great piece about a set of questions that Comey should grapple with, be asked and have to answer, number of which is?
BYRON YORK, CONTRIBUTOR: Michael Flynn. What did FBI agents think when they interviewed Michael Flynn on January 24, 2017, just four days into the administration. You remember, they interviewed him about that wiretapped phone call he had had during the transition with the Russian ambassador.
And why did they go to the -- why did the FBI go to the White House? And did really, as we have heard that Comey has said, that the FBI agents believed that Flynn was not lying.
INGRAHAM: Including Peter Strzok who was there.
YORK: Including Peter Strzok. So, what did the FBI agents really say about this? Has Comey actually read the transcript of these conversations?
INGRAHAM: Or (inaudible).
YORK: Absolutely. And did Comey believe that Michael Flynn was going to face a false statement charge because members of Congress say that Comey told them back then that he did not expect Michael Flynn to be indicted.
INGRAHAM: So, the big sentencing memos are going to come out looks like on Friday, both Manafort and Cohen. Looks like both are coming down. It's going to be a big, big news night tomorrow. What do you expect if anything Comey behind closed doors -- we'll get the transcript on Saturday with what he says -- what light will he shed on this question that we posed at the top? How did Hillary's aides seem to always get away in the end? They get away with this stuff in the end.
YORK: Well, he's been questioned about stuff like this before because as you remember, it was over the July 4th holiday in 2016 that they questioned her. And then almost instantly they exonerated her of making any false statements.
INGRAHAM: And he wasn't there during the questioning.
YORK: No, but it's as if the FBI didn't even check her testimony. And we later learned that they had been writing this exoneration memo for months before they questioned her and before they questioned a lot of other key figures. And of course they handed out immunity like candy.
On the other hand, Comey has been asked these questions before and there were some Republicans who were not happy with Comey being called to be questioned tomorrow.
INGRAHAM: But Strzok was the agent that interviewed Mills and Abedin, correct?
YORK: Correct.
INGRAHAM: He also interviewed Michael Flynn.
YORK: Yes.
INGRAHAM: And he's testified on Capitol Hill. So what if they gotten on that from him?
YORK: Well, they didn't -- he didn't talk about the Flynn case to them because the FBI and everybody associated with has said, well, it's an ongoing criminal investigation. I'm sorry we can't talk about it. Well, Flynn has already pleaded guilty.
And Charles Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee has been trying to get information on that ground, on that basis, saying well, look, he's already pleaded guilty. Well, now, by the 18th of December, just a few days from now, he's going to get sentenced and it's really all going to be --
INGRAHAM: But Byron, wasn't Michael Flynn out of the country when he was wiretapped or he was surveilled -- they listened --
YORK: Right. It was the Russian ambassador.
INGRAHAM: Right. So it's not wiretapped. They are allowed to do that under U.S. surveillance policies. No problem. But then his name was unmasked. You wrote about this as well.
YORK: This was something that Devin Nunes got a lot of criticism for bringing up, but the point is we do wiretap. We never say this. But we wiretapped top Russian officials. We knew what was being said. But then you think who's on the other end of that conversation? And that's what was so- called unmasked and --
INGRAHAM: Why does Susan Rice's name come up frequently?
YORK: Because she was involved in a lot of the unmaskings and the questions Republicans asked --
INGRAHAM: At the National Security Council.
YORK: -- and never got an answer to, as why was it so necessary to learn these people's names?
INGRAHAM: Byron York, we appreciate it. We can't wait -- I mean, Christmas is early. We're getting all these things. Big night tomorrow night. And while the resistance has --

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: This is not strictly speaking a Bob Mueller investigation. This is an example of where he discovers something. His FBI agents learn something about Podesta's brother in the course of interrogating witnesses. They are looking at whether or not the Podesta firm in conjunction with the Manafort firm did lobbying for political groups in the Ukraine and did not tell the federal government. This is the first time that the Democrats or any Democrat is arguably within the ambit of something that Bob Mueller does.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, while the resistance has been cheering its every move, a referral from the Mueller probe involving former Obama and Clinton aides is now heating up with an increased focus on Clinton-linked Washington insider Tony Podesta and former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig. Here to help us make sense of all of these players, constitutional law professor, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. Professor, assuming this is true, why shouldn't we be just as critical of this in terms of an overreach by Mueller as we were when the other parties were involved?
JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR: That's a valid point. These violations in terms of registering as foreign agents use to occur rather regularly. It's a rather regular practice in Washington. People would mix these things, they'd get caught on them. They would often retroactively apply for these. They generally were not viewed as strong criminal cases.
But they went after people like Mueller and others for the failure to register for these types of issues. And now it looks like they are proceeding against people like Podesta. What's interesting about Podesta is --
INGRAHAM: He was offered immunity, wasn't he?
TURLEY: That's right. He wasn't given transactional, but he was offered immunity.
INGRAHAM: More limited.
TURLEY: That's right. And since then, of course, Manafort did speak with them a great deal. And so there is a possibility that Manafort did drop a dime on people like Podesta.
INGRAHAM: And I think for Mueller's case, if he's laying out some case against some member of the Trump circle, if he seems to be a little bit more evenhanded and how he kind of throws out the judgment or the facts, it will be better for the overall credibility of the report, perhaps?
TURLEY: I think it will be. But the problem is, if this is how it ends, it's going to be rather underwhelming. This is like going around and shooting the wounded. These are not significant crimes. They may be perfectly appropriate to proceed for, and certainly to refer, but this is not what we've all been waiting for. Now, maybe he'll prove to be that Agatha Christie prosecutor and in the final scene we find out all the characters, the things they didn't tell us before. But if not, there's going to be a lot of disappointed folks in this town.
INGRAHAM: If it comes down to Farah, the foreign agent.
TURLEY: That's right, or Corsi and Stone, that's going to be rather --
INGRAHAM: Again, where's the collusion? Where's the work between the Trump circle and Russia to throw the election, or to get Hillary and release the emails? This is a long process. Is an ending, do you think?
TURLEY: I think it is ending. But we have all of these speaking indictments that have been filed. None of them suggest that there's any connection, any knowing involvement with Russians by top Trump officials thus far that would sustain this type of collusion conspiracy that people are talking about. Maybe he's holding it for the end, but we haven't seen it so far.
INGRAHAM: Bill Barr's name was out there today as perhaps Trump's pick to be attorney general, a couple other names are out there, Chris Christie and a few others. What about Bill Barr, former attorney general himself for a short period of time?
TURLEY: Bill would be just an absolutely brilliant choice. He is a go by the book guy. He is as steady as a rock. I represented him during the Clinton impeachment with a bunch of other former attorney generals. In fact one time I got a call from him at 40,000 feet in his plane heading to Europe to tell me he spotted a typo in one of our briefs.
INGRAHAM: Oh, no.
TURLEY: Yes, I spent years in therapy over that. That's the worst moment.
INGRAHAM: So he's a stickler for details.
TURLEY: Exactly. He's actually one of the best lawyers I've ever encountered, which really puts the pressure on when you represent him. But he would be ideal. And he would get through the Senate very, very easily. He would bring instant credibility. You could not pick a better guide this moment for that job.
INGRAHAM: And he already was once confirmed. They are citing things he said about Comey. We'll play just a quick snippet. This is from May of 2017. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He crossed a basic line back in July, fundamental line in the department, which is that investigations are supervised and directed by the lawyers, the prosecutors at the department, not the agents. And what is of concern and certainly what appears to have concerned the administration was not so much that transgression but his steadfast refusal to acknowledge that he had transgressed those limits on his power.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Not shy about talking about --
TURLEY: It's hard to imagine anyone would object with anything he just said. The Democrats have been saying that. The Republicans have been saying that. It's the one point upon which there is universal agreement is that Comey overstepped his bounds. That was in the Rosenstein memo. Rosenstein quoted Democratic and Republican appointees saying that what he did bordered on the horrific. So the point that you should really get out of that is really the essence of Barr. He was loved by agents at the Justice Department.
INGRAHAM: Boy, do they need that now.
TURLEY: Yes. And he's just this rock-solid guy who views these things with clarity. He speaks very directly to them. There's no effort on his part to spin ever. He just talks directly to the issue. Comey was outside the navigational beacons, and he said that.
INGRAHAM: And he and Comey couldn't be different. Bill is someone who doesn't want the credit. He doesn't need to get the credit. But steadfast and clear, and I would not want to debate him on any legal issue.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: I'm glad you were representing him and not I. Jonathan Turley, thanks so much.
And when you hear the term deep state, you might think it refers to topics like the ones we just discussed. But what it extends to government climate reports, too? An analyst digs in. next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: When the government puts out reports, it does give it an aura of credibility, right? That's exactly how the latest National Climate Assessment was treated, when newsrooms flew into a frenzy about the looming apocalypse. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is criminal really when you get down to it. It is tragic that we have a president who at this critical moment chooses not to be a firefighter but to be an arson.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got kids. We don't want to be slowly burned to death on our own planet here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Climate change could kill thousands of Americans and cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars. We are just suggesting, Mr. President, if you don't want to believe science, maybe just start with climatekids.nasa.gov. It's a pretty easy read. It's fun. There are pictures.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's right, Anderson. You are smarter than everyone else. Anyone scared yet? What if we were to tell you that same government policy paper was funded with the help of progressive climate alarmists like billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg? Here now, the man who uncovered the funding, Chuck DeVore of the Texas Public Policy Center. Chuck, tell us a bit about how you were able to find out who funded this and what their climate agenda may be.
CHUCK DEVORE, VICE PRESIDENT, TEXAS PUBLIC POLICY FOUNDATION: That's a great question. First of all, I owe a lot to Nick Loris over at the Heritage Foundation because he did a quick critique on exactly the point that you showed, the huge hit to the economy and thousands of people dying. That's what the media focused on. That was taken from one study, funded unfortunately by federal government tax dollars, but also Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. And so he mentioned that.
And then I dug into it some more. And I found out, Laura, was one of the main authors of the report, Professor Rising (ph) from Berkeley, this guy is a veritable basket case. On his blog, he talks about quote, eliminating the president. On his blog, he talked about how he's concerned about the rise of religious extremism in the United States and in the Middle East, I guess equating guys like me with Al Qaeda and ISIS, which is, I don't know, a little kooky if you asked me. He's one of the main authors of the report. And the reason why they are doing this, of course, is that they need to whip people up into fear so that we can hand over our sovereignty, hand over our autonomy, to these people who are better than us and smarter than us.
INGRAHAM: Smarter. Go back to my “Angle.” I did an “Angle” last night about how the left loves to portray itself as the smart set. They know better than the little people. You may like to fill your truck up with diesel, but guess what, it's all going to be better under the new way of doing commerce and fueling vehicles, and you've just got to listen to us. We'll give the tax incentives to the, electric cars and so forth. And you see what's happening in France. People are just rejecting it. There's a lot going on in France beyond that, but that's part of this. It costs real money, and people don't want to open up their wallets.
DEVORE: It does. And it hits the middle class the most. The thing that's amazing about France's is gas there is about $7.06 a gallon, and almost half of that as taxes, so a lot more than here in America. But what they were rioting over, Laura, was just a 25-cent a gallon increase in gas tax and about a 10 cent a gallon in diesel. The U.N. climate expert who wants to of course transfer a lot of our wealth to corrupt third world countries, he estimates that in 12 years we are going to need a carbon tax that's the equivalent of about $49 a gallon for fuel. You think there's riots in France now over 25 cents, imagine what happens with $49 a gallon.
INGRAHAM: By the way, there is another brainiac whose words we must share with our viewers, Chuck, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: I wish that I could be the Terminator in real life to be able to travel back in time and to stop all fossil fuels when they were discovered.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: First of all, send me a memo when he's going to drop the "Terminator" references. It's more like "Kindergarten Cop," it's a climate cop. He should do a whole new sequel to that, Chuck.
DEVORE: Just think about what he said. If he could travel back in time and stop all fossil fuels, it's like, are you kidding me? So stop the industrial revolution in its tracks around 1700? We would be living in abject poverty and misery right now if that were to happen, which I guess it's kind of like "The Terminator" movies, right? Wasn't that some sort of post-apocalyptic dystopia?
INGRAHAM: Yes, yes. And Chuck, how would he get on the G-4 to the next film festival? That's what I want to say.
DEVORE: Exactly.
INGRAHAM: Chuck, thanks so much.
This leads us to our next question. Some of the most influential leaders in the Democratic Party have lied to you about science for decades. So why are we still listening to them? Here to debate this is radio host, former Chuck Schumer aide Chris Hahn. All right, Chris, I know you just got off your global express jet. But The Federalist's David Harsanyi wrote a great piece today documenting the less than stellar track record of some of the climate alarmists. I want to start with this one. Back In 1970, Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that, quote, "civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken." So what happened? He was the soothsayer of the time.
CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Yes, you know, look, major events don't happen on a schedule, right? Climate change is real. It is happening. We have seen evidence of it.
INGRAHAM: It's always happened.
HAHN: Just this year between the major storms, the California wildfires, it is a problem that we should be addressing. And 97 percent of scientists who study this agree that this is a problem that is manmade, caused by our using of fossil fuels, especially coal, and it is time for us to wake up and all speak with one voice. This should not be a political debate whether or not it's real or not. It should be a debate about how we solve the problem. Instead, we still have a president of the United States who said this isn't even a real problem. This is a real problem. It needs a real solution.
INGRAHAM: Do you have a problem, though, Chris? Chris, do you have a problem, though, I think we have a lot of problems that are resulting in cataclysmic issues happening to our environment. I am a conservationist, so I want to conserve the beauty that we have. And we have to have business. That's where I come down. I'm not a scientist. I don't pretend to be one on TV.
But it is interesting, going back to judging. In retrospect, we can see who is a pretty good prognosticator and who wasn't such a good prognosticator. So let's try this one. This is back in 1977. The was Barack Obama's future science czar John Holdren predicting that global warming could lead to the deaths of about 1 billion starving people by 2020. We have about 13 months left, so what happened?
There is another recent prediction, by the way, that I have to get to. Al Gore, he proclaimed in 2006 in that "Inconvenient Truth" film that sea level would rise 20 feet, quote, in the near future. Was that just when he stepped into the Atlantic? Sorry. But according to scientists, sea level rose about three inches between 93 and 2017.
Up next, we lost Chris on the satellite. This is live TV, it's what happens. Chris, we didn't do it on purpose. It was the climate. Lawsuit madness. A new federal complaint accusing the state of Rhode Island for failing to provide students with the skills they need. I'm going to talk to the lead lawyer in the case next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: The NYPD is investigating a bomb threat near CNN's New York City bureau in Columbus Circle. Due to the threat, the office has been evacuated. Right now, CNN is airing taped programming due to the disruption. And, my friends, we are going to keep following this in this segment, and Raymond Arroyo will join us. Again, the temperature is got to be brought down in these conversations. And politics should be debated and aggressively so, but not violence. And our thoughts are with our friends over at CNN. We are competitors in cable, but we are thinking of you and hoping everyone is OK. We will continue to monitor this and bring you the updates throughout this hour.
Now, another topic, have lawsuits gone too far in the United States? It's a question was asked before, and it's when we keep debating this. We need lawsuit reform. We have too many people suing too many people. It's killing business, killing initiative, loser should pay. But maybe we need a fresh look at all this. Check this out. Public school students and parents are suing Rhode Island's governor and other educational officials in federal court, saying that the state failed to prepare young people to fully participate in civic life. That's interesting.
Here now, lead counsel in the case, Michael Rebell of Columbia's Teachers College in New York. Michael, thanks much for being here tonight. You recently remarked that, quote, we are living in troubled times. Our democratic institutions are being challenged like never before. It's a provocative statement, but what makes these times more troubled than five years ago, we had all these riots in St. Louis and we had Baltimore. We had the Freddie Gray, we had Michael Brown, we had Trayvon Martin. So is it all Trump?
MICHAEL REBELL, COOK VERSUS RAIMONDO LEAD COUNSEL: I'd like to look back to the era of George H. W. Bush that we were thinking about yesterday. It seemed like a century ago when people could engage in civic conversation, people from different political perspectives, and try to work things out. Now our whole situation is totally polarized. People scream at each other. They don't think. They don't talk. I think it is a very troubled time, and it is different from I think virtually any other era in American history.
But another problem we have got here, Laura, our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Sam Adams, you go back to any of them, they said that this experiment in mass democracy that they were implementing, first time in human history, could only survive if we had an educated citizenry. And that's been a theme throughout American history.
INGRAHAM: So, OK, the soliloquy is fascinating.
REBELL: OK.
INGRAHAM: It's fascinating. Dan Henninger wrote a great piece, by the way, in The Wall Street Journal today, don't blame Trump for a corrosive culture. Nice try. But the culture has been corroding for decades. And every time conservatives say we've got to look at this cultural equation, both in politics and entertainment industry, everything is coarsened, they are always laughed at and they're called a bunch of rubes. And you want to circumscribe creative expression. So the idea that Trump brought in the era of coarseness which is what many on the left are trying to bamboozle us with is patently ridiculous.
REBELL: Listen, we are not saying that Trump brought this in. I trace in my book that I wrote on the subject the decline in the schools taking responsibility for seriously preparing kids for citizenship. It goes back 50 or 60 years. I think it's gotten worse now.
INGRAHAM: But isn't that a little difficult for public school teachers especially today, professor, they are competing with a lot. They are competing with broken families. I have two educators in my family, one at a public school, one at a private school, different political backgrounds, both of them. But what I hear and have heard over the years is this is really tough. We have in some cases 17 languages spoken in public schools over northern Virginia. Teachers are trying to do their best, but teachers aren't parents. We have a fundamental problem with a breakdown across societal lines. And it's not racial and it's not ethnic. It's in the home.
REBELL: Look, that's a whole other area. Laura, we could get into that, I'm sure, for another half-hour. But the point is, only one-third of the American population even knows what the separation of powers is. Only 23 percent of our students on the latest national tests were proficient in civics. I mean, our democracy cannot survive if two-thirds of the people can't name the three branches of government. The schools do have a responsibility for this.
INGRAHAM: We have heard this for some time, which is why you should be for public school choice and choice in education, which is what conservatives have been lobbying for years. Take the monopoly from a public school's away from the poor kids and opened it up to competition.
Professor, we've got breaking news in New York tonight with a new threat against CNN. Sorry, we have to cut that short. We will be right back. The very latest on this apparent bomb threat outside of CNN. Again, our thoughts are with our friends over the other network. We'll bring you the latest. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: CNN has gone to taped programming after a phoned in bomb threat of some sort of evacuated the building. Raymond, we were talking about how things are too hot, and there's nothing for people to hold onto.
RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: When the world starts to shift, crazy people react in crazy ways. We set that on October 24th when those pipe bombs were disseminated at CNN and other media outlets. We pray this is nothing like that.
INGRAHAM: Cesar Sayoc, nut bag who was with his weird van. People have got to understand, when individuals who are already on the edge feel like - - got to take the temperature down. And that's a good lesson from George H.W. Bush. Bring it all down a little bit. We still have an aggressive debate.
That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" team, take it from here. All the latest developments. Shannon?
