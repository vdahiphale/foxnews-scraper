Missouri Congressman Ike Skelton is the second at-risk Democrat in as many days looking to brandish some moderate credentials. In a new campaign ad called "Keep and Bear," Skelton does not shoot any firearms the way West Virginia's Joe Manchin does, but Skelton touts his NRA endorsement and talks about the Second Amendment's importance to rural Missouri. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Skelton accuses Republican Vicki Hartzler of letting "the government decide, not gun owners, on the issue of carrying concealed weapons." Hartzler insists she opposed the referendum on the subject because she felt it should be up to individuals. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {

Billionaire financier George Soros says he is sitting out this election cycle preferring to funnel his considerable funds to progressive groups rather than electoral politics. The New York Times asked Soros if it worries him that Republicans could take over one or both Houses of Congress. Soros answered, "It does, because I think they are pushing the wrong policies. But I'm not in a position to stop it. I don't believe in standing in the way of an avalanche."

Former funnyman and current Minnesota Senator Al Franken still has it. The New York Post reports Franken was at Reagan National Airport with fellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar talking about which security line he was going to take. Franken said he enjoys the line where they pat you down "the way my marriage is going these days."
His office insists it was just a joke.  </pre>
