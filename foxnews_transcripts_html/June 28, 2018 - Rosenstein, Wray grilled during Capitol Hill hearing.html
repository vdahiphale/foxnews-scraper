SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you for being with us. We'll always be fair and balanced and we're not to destroy Tump media. Let not your heart be troubled, Laura has a big show coming up. Laura, take it away, have a good show. 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks so much Sean. Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is 'The Ingraham Angle.' Law enforcement officials, as Sean said, are set to provide updates on the very latest about that deadly shooting, horrific shooting at the 'Capital Gazette' Newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. They were not planning on giving any further updates tonight so we expect to hear some real news. So let' go straight to Fox News correspondent, Kristin Fisher live at the scene, Kristin.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, we've just been told that at this press conference that's going to be taking place in about 15 minutes, police are expected to identify the victims. We don't know if they are going to identify the gunmen. But already tonight, the parent company of the gazette, the newspaper where this horrific shooting took place, the parent company, 'The Baltimore Sun,' has identified the shooter and they say that his name is 38 year old Jared Ramos. And they say that he had a long running feud with the 'Capital Gazette.' In 2012, he filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper and a columnist over a story that it covered, a criminal harassment case against him. He then lost that lawsuit three years later which brings us to today. And at a press conference earlier tonight, police said that there had been threats made against the newspaper over social media. Listen here

WILLIAM KRAMPE, DEPUTY CHIEF POLICE OFFICER: We know that there were threats that sent to the gazette through social media. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By this person, the threats were sent by this person?

        }
      
KRAMPE: No the threats were sent over social media, we're trying to identify what account that was and we're trying to confirm who actually sent them. To my knowledge, those threats were as early as today.

FISHER: So that's all the police said about the gunman at the previous press conference. They may say more in about 15 minutes but they will certainly be talking a bit more about the victims. In terms of what the paper has said, they have already named one of the victims and the Baltimore Sun is reporting that one of the people killed here today was the 'Capital Gazette's' own editor and I'm afraid I may butcher his name but his name is Rob Hiaasen. He is one of the five victims here. Two people were injured, they were transported to the hospital with what we believe to be superficial injuries, either from blasts or from the gunshots.

        }
      
Just a horrific day here Laura, started around 2.30, police responded to the scene about 60 seconds after this gunman walked through the door with a shot gun and smoke grenades. He then walked through the first floor of this newsroom which had a very open floor plan so there was no place for the employees inside to hide. They had to get underneath their desks, he then opened fire, police showed up on the scene. The shooter did not fire at police, they were able to miraculously take him into custody without any shots being fired. They are now interviewing him, trying to get to the bottom of this, he has not been cooperative. At least now Laura, it seems like we know a little bit more in terms of motive. 
INGRAHAM: Kristin thanks so much. The editor was the brother of novelist Carl Hiaasen, you know global bestseller, that came out tonight as well. Thanks so much for that report. And of course, this has been a harrowing day. Our prayers are with those who are grieving tonight and to those who are still suffering in hospitals. We are so grateful for the bravery of the first responders, amazing in a first response today. And there a lot of outstanding questions that are going to be answered. We will get to them in that press conference that's coming up in just a matter of moments.
 And we have a lot of news to get to tonight but we start with something that's been raging across the country, we call it Protest Palooza, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. 
Now lately it seems like protest mania is the new normal in America. With few exceptions, if you really think about it, conservatives really aren't into protesting. Now the joke is it's because they're too busy doing that thing called work but for the most rabbit on the left, protesting has become a way of life. Marches are grievance festivals, they're rollicking affairs complete with live musical acts, food trucks and balloon tosses. And since the election of Donald Trump, the left has been ramping it up into overdrive. This was LA just a few days after Trump's surprise victory where protesters, remember, shut down one of the city's busiest freeways, the 101 between downtown and Hollywood.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then back on the east coast, protesters of Trump Tower, remember this scene? They shut down traffic in mid-town Manhattan. And who can forget the women's march the day after the inauguration?

INGRAHAM: Well she was ahead of the time on the Nazi reference. Well participants are passionate, you got to hand it to them and some are old, some are young and they're pretty organized. And sometimes celebrities attend or donate millions to their pet causes that spill out onto all the streets. Because when they write a check, it means that they care and let's face it, it ain't bad PR either. And then violence at some anti-Trump rallies has happened too. Remember at Berkeley, ANTIFA showed up and showed us just what they're capable of. No debate, no debate allowed, no diversity of opinion tolerated ever. 
These protesters want to make it impossible for the president to travel, certainly to places like California, and they tried to do that during the campaign and sometimes his supporters were harassed and others were actually assaulted. And now the occupy ICE protesters want to, again, make it impossible for our immigration investigators to do their jobs. Well they managed to shut down one office of ICE in Portland, Oregon for more than a week, this is a Democratic Socialist of America group and they blocked entry into the federal facility.

INGRAHAM: Doesn't that look like a Saturday night skit at some point, it look ridiculous. Dozens of people today, here in Washington DC shut down a government meeting and in Grandrapids, Michigan they did the same thing, protested a contract ICE had to house detainees in a local jail. A mall in Washington DC that also saw these protests where thousands of women urged for the abolishment of ICE, Immigration Customs Enforcement. Now they occupied the Senate Hart office building and they joined themselves together with all these liberal politicians and again, everybody looks like Jiffy Pops they have the tin foil robes and the chants that don't really rhyme. But the Capital Police arrested nearly 600 of the chanting throng. And the DC ICE protests were led by Pro-Palestinian activist, you've seen it before, Linda Sarsour.

LINDA SARSOUR, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MPOWER CHANGE: Marching is important, rallying is important. But it is not enough under a fascist administration. Are you ready to sacrifice just a little bit? People want to tell us when to protest, how to protest, how to be civil. How uncivil it is to have billions of dollars to build prison camps on military bases but not have money to give clean water to the people of the city. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: As Islamic countries continue to subjugate women and girls, as honour killings go on unprosecuted across the globe, it's curious that Sarsour would lecture us on human rights abuses against women in the United States. Now by the way, this is the same women, who in addition to her hate the Jewish state in Israel, once tweeted out the following. She tried to delete a lot of these but they were captured. "Underwear bomber was #CIA all long. Why did I already know that? Shame on us scaring the American people" oh and this gem, I love this one,

        }
      
"How many times do have to tell White women that we do not need to be saved by them? Is there code language I need to use to get thru?"  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Well here's a question for Linda, is she really worried about kids at the border? Or is her primary concern burnishing her own brand as this global human rights super heroine? Or maybe it's just kind of part of a larger political agenda? Probably all of the above. Sarsour is arrested regularly, it's kind of like a hobby. She was arrested outside speaker Ryan's office back in March, outside Trump Tower last year and she wears it all as a badge of hour, they release them quickly anyway. And of course she relishes all the media coverage. 
Now, you got to understand this, she wants your daughters, your wives, your sisters and our students to join her in what is ultimately a deeply anti-free market, anti-rule of law, anti-American founding mind-set. She and thousands like her, they're really really good at projecting anger and outrage. You know I was thinking about this today, to what end? What's the game plan here for making America better? For making it stronger, more economically prosperous? I guess freebies for everybody from the government, guaranteed wages, guaranteed college education guaranteed universal preschool, guaranteed I don't know, everything. Open borders, more abortions, where does it all go?

        }
      
Well I have a question, is this message really getting through to younger generations of women? Republicans better hope not. But in the meantime they better have a plan of their own to reach young people looking to engage politically, they're looking for meaning. And I don't mean just people sitting around, a bunch of conservatives sitting around reading position papers of think tank fellows or quoting the federalist papers, as much as we all love the federalist papers. I'm thinking of these kids who join these social media flash protests and then they check their feeds on their cell phone for news updates throughout the day. Those are the people we have to reach. Of course our country has had a long and proud history of civil disobedience and marches that have galvanized positive change from civil rights march, of course, of 1964 to the March for Life, we have that every year in January. 
And our First Amendment right to seek government redress always has to be protected and defended. And even if that message offends and shocks our conscience, we must protect the right to speak out. But at the same time what we should never encourage are threats implicit or explicit, against our public officials as we saw from Maxine Waters last weekend. So maybe we should reconsider, just kind of elevate it a little bit what we're writing on those signs that we hold up to the cameras. What we're screaming in people's faces, how we speak to each other, it's all gotten too nasty. And everyone seems really really angry all the time.

KRAMPE: We know from the investigations that there are no further threats. No further threats to the Capitol Gazette Newspaper or to the area around 888 Bestgate Road. What I also would like to tell you is that the Anne Arundel County Police Department, with our partners throughout Anemone County Government, Annapolis City, the state, we work very well together. We have the best interests and wellbeing of our victims in mind. We have a warm line for Anne Arundel County, that number is 410 768 5522 and I would urge any persons who witnessed anything that occurred this evening while walking by the address of 888, was near the address who just needs someone to speak to, I would urge them to call that line. Jen Corbin will have additional staff ready for this evening for any influx of phone calls and I'm going to allow her to explain the warm line and issues behind that in a second. 
I want to end on this, we have a responsibility and an obligation to these victims. Everyone in the Anne Arundel County Police Department and all of our allied agencies, all of our government officials, we are deeply sadden by what happened today. We are deeply saddened that we had to make those notifications. And we're deeply saddened that a person had to take this into his own hands and this is the result. So I'm going to bring Jen Corbin up and we're going to talk about the warm line real quick.

We have been involved in the reunification of the witnesses to their families along with notifying the families of the people who lost their lives. For the warm line, basically what we're asking is anyone who spoke with us today or anybody who did not make contact with us through investigations, that they can reach out through that number. We have licensed clinicians on 24 hours a day, we will come out and help you in any way possible.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What I'm going to ask is that we are not using that number to call for information on the investigation. That is not what this number is for. This number is for people who have witnessed and might need assistance getting through the trauma piece of this. We are not asking you to call and ask questions about which family members are where, or for us to give comments on the investigation. We are here to help. So that number is for family and witnesses to call in, we will be available all night long, we can come out if people need it or discuss how people are doing back home, thank you. 
KRAMPE: Okay, so that's the information that we have to hold true to what we said in the beginning of this. As soon as we have information we will get it out so that was the purpose of calling this press conference. Again, that warm line number is 410 768 5522. So that's the number to call for anyone that needs assistance and needs to talk to somebody for support. Thank you. So the first is Wendi Winters, that's spelled W-e-n-d-i, last name is W-i-n-t-e-r-s.

Yup, so again, as information becomes available we'll make sure we get it out to you but again, we don't anticipate having more information until the morning. We just thought that it was very important to get the information out about the victims to you guys so the families can begin that healing process. So out thoughts and prayers go out to the their families, the victims, their friends and we'll have an update for you in the morning. Thank you very much.

INGRAHAM: Again, our hearts and our prayers are with those victims, just identified. We're going to continue to monitor this for more developments, other networks are publishing photos. We have not confirmed those yet, we're not going to do that here on Fox News but let's get back to the focus of the Angle. Now Robert who is a civil rights attorney as well as number one bestselling author and hit documentary film maker whose new film, `The Death of a Nation', is out August 3rd, we're going to see a new sneak peak of it later on in this segment, Dinesh D'Souza is also with us and his book comes out, same title, on July 31st. Gentlemen, first very briefly, comments about this horrific shooting tonight. Dinesh, we've now learned of the victims. Looks like the killer had some grievance about the defamation action against the newspaper, wildly reported tonight. There's Twitter feed that looks like it could be the individual, but again, we're not confirming that, your thoughts tonight.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER: Well I think we're seeing a tragic sort of vendetta played out before the whole country to see. In an age of media it is not entirely surprising, although very disturbing, to see people who have grievances look for this kind of media stage in which to enact this ritual of death. I don't know if it's driven partly by a desire to get attention but it's a dementia in our society and I'm glad that we are roundly condemning it. I'm also glad that we distancing it from false political attributions which does not seem to be relevant in this particular case. 
INGRAHAM: Right and Robert, again horrific tragedy for a country, for the community, for the media. We're learn more about this individual, I don't want to use his name, but we'll learn more about it as the days go on. But, again, it's just you want to just sit down and cry at some point.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROBERT PATILLO, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well you know, I don't think it's a situation where we have to sit down and cry, it's a situation where we have re-evaluate what we are and who we are as Americans. Fundamentally speaking this is just another example of why we need to encourage support the Second Amendment and allow more people to defend themselves in this situation. Even with police responding in 60 seconds, five people lost their lives. If the individuals had the ability to protect themselves, then maybe this tragedy and many others would not have happened. I'm a member of the National African American Gun Owners Association and I think one of the cornerstones of our democracy is the ability for individuals to protect themselves from mad people like this. You can't change individuals' actions, all you can change is your ability to defend yourself. 
INGRAHAM: All right, let's go back to the focus of the Angle which we didn't get to finish but suffice as to say the nation has been locked down, at least immigration enforcement. And some parts of the country have been locked down by these protests that are run at least on the west coast, some on the east coast by the Democratic Socialists of America, this after a candidate for Congress unseated the number four in Democratic leadership in Queens two nights ago. Dinesh your reaction to now embrace of open borders, of lawlessness and the abolishment of ICE  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
D'SOUZA: I find it incredible that a major party in the United States is essentially embracing lawlessness, in this case lawlessness on the border, almost as a matter of strategy. Now, I'm a legal immigrant, I'm a non-white immigrant. I come from a country with a billion people, if we had open borders, probably half of them would like to come to the United States, but they can't. Why? Because they don't have a contiguous border, they can't just jump over a fence, it's a long way and second is there are rules, there's a line. I stood in line and I went through the line so really what the illegals are demanding is preferential treatment over the millions of other people who have to play by the rules to get here. And the fact that the Democratic Party is unwilling to draw a line between the legal and the illegal, in fact routinely in the media the term illegal and the term immigrant are conflated as if an illegal is an immigrant. But an illegals are not immigrants, illegals are law breakers.

INGRAHAM: Robert the language today at this protest in Washington where they took over the Senate Hart office building but they met outside of the Senate Hart office building first and Linda Sarsour, the Palestinian activist, a lot of people think she's anti-Semitic, anti-Israel. She got up and she talked, and others talked about, white privilege and so forth, we'll play a little snippet of this.

        }
      
LISA FITHIAN, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: There's different kinds of fear, there's real fear but a lot of folks, particularly folks with white skin privilege, have a lot of irrational fears. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: White skinned people have a lot of irrational fears. It's all virtue signaling from college campus lingo, Dinesh and I saw a lot of that back in the '80s at Dartmouth, but it's been ramped up quite a bit. But Robert your take on where this is all going. You heard the training manual being referenced in the speech there. We have the direct action training, they train people on how to get arrested, that's nothing new I guess the civil rights movement did that as well in the `60s, but it seems a lot angrier and a lot more ravid. 
PATILLO: Well I don't think it's so much angrier and more ravid but we have media now to concentrate on it. Then we have three news outlets are reporting on things that we have a 24 hour a day news cycle that reports on things instantly and not including the internet. But what I think we have to do is not discount these protests, not discount their needs and their grievances. One of the mistakes the Democratic Party made was in 2008 and 2009 while the Tea Party was rising, you saw Liberal commentators on the other networks making the same assumptions about them, calling those people crazy, insane, everything along the lines. And then 10 years later after losing a thousand plus elections, Republicans on the right control all facets of the United States government and most state governments. So we can't simply ignore the individuals who are out there protesting. What we need to do is engage across party lines, have the President, have the Republican Party lay out what their immigration strategy is. What their policy procedures are. What exactly are they planning on doing?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
INGRAHAM: What's their strategy? I didn't get to this in the Angle, what is the strategy of Linda Sarsour who has tweeted the most hateful, horrific things in her career, okay? She doesn't have problems with tweeting that, she deletes some of them and everybody forgets about it. And Dinesh you have this film coming out on August third that deals with a lot of the hate of the past. And it's like a historical foundation, in many ways, of what's happening today. You're reaction and then we're going to play a clip from your preview of your film that no one else has seen. But your reaction to her in particular in her vitriol.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
D'SOUZA: Well look, the reason they keep using terms like racism and fascism and white privilege and so on, is they can't fault Trump for being anti-black, he's not. And so they're trying to get him on this immigration issue as well as on the security issue as being some kind of a racist. Now, the important thing to realize Laura, is that the vast vast majority of legal immigrants who come to this country are non-white. Most of us today come from Asia, from Africa, from South America and so the line that Trump is drawing is not a racial line at all, it's a line between the legal and the illegal. The comparison to fascism is absurd because Hitler was not concerned with illegal immigrants, the Jews were citizens of Germany, they'd been in Germany for a long time. Hitler was drawing an internal line between, if you will, what he considered to be first class citizens, the Nordic Germans and he wanted to make Jews into second class citizens or worse, this is a deep distortion. 
INGRAHAM: The comparison is embarrassing, the comparison is insulting, it's so ridiculous on so many levels, it's infuriating. But I want to play a clip, this is from the preview from your film, 'The Death of a Nation,' coming out August third, nobody's seen this yet, let's watch.

All right and Robert, as we close the segment out, do you feel like the protesters throw around Nazi, racist, concentration camp, internment camp, fascist too glibly, too regularly, too frequently and so all of the criticism and maybe some of its merited of Conservatives just kind of melts away? It becomes white noise at some point and I don't mean that racially, talking about white noise. 
PATILLO: Well I think a big chunk of it is be the hyperbolic nature of American political discourse has grown to a point where it's exed itself out. Remember during the Obamacare to date, we talked about death panel fascism and a new form of slavery because Obama wanted to give people healthcare. So let's stop and take down the rhetoric on both sides and get back to policy discussions because if you get to the root of things, about 90 percent of people agree on most issues. It's the five percent on each end of the political spectrum that are driving the debate. We got to get to appoint where we can all talk and find real solutions.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: Did you see the fireworks during the question of the deputy A.G. in that House hearing today? Rod Rosenstein has been overseeing the Russia investigation forever since Jeff Sessions notorious recusal, and GOP lawmakers didn't hesitate to vent their frustrations with his handling of the probe. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You wrote the memo saying that Comey should be fired, and you signed the FISA extension for Carter Page. So my question is to you, it seems like you should be rescued from this more so than Jeff Sessions just because you were involved in making decisions affecting both prongs of this investigation. Why haven't you done that? 
ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: Congressman, I can assure you that were it appropriate for me to recuse, I would be more than happy. 
REP. TREY GOWDY, R—S.C.: If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury. If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people. Whatever you got, finish the hell up, because this country is being torn apart.

ROSENSTEIN: I think the best thing we can do is finish it appropriately and reach a conclusion. And I certainly agree with you, sir. People should not jump to conclusions without seeing the evidence. 
REP. JIM JORDAN, R—OHIO: Did you read the FISA application before you signed? 
ROSENSTEIN: I'm not going to comment about any FISA application. 
JORDAN: Why are you keeping information from Congress? 
ROSENSTEIN: Congressman, I am not keeping any information from Congress that is appropriate. 
Your statement that I'm personally keeping information from you, trying to conceal information -- 
JORDAN: You are the boss, Mr. Rosenstein.

ROSENSTEIN: That's correct. And my job is to make sure that we respond to your concerns. We have, sir, so I appreciate your concerns. 
JORDAN: Again, I think the House of Representatives is going to say otherwise. 
ROSENSTEIN: But you are using this to attack me personally. 
JORDAN: You've got seven days to get our act together. I want to know why you won't give us what we've asked for. 
ROSENSTEIN: Sir, I certainly hope that your colleagues are not under that impression. That is not accurate, sir.

INGRAHAM: Anyone else get nervous during that exchange? I was very uncomfortable. Joining me now for analysis, great panel, of course, FOX News contributor, former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, just wrote a great piece, by the way, former Whitewater deputy independent counsel Sol Wisenberg, and former FBI national spokesperson John Iannarelli. Great to see all of you. 
Sol, let's start with you. You are annoyed by Jim Jordan's questioning which you found to be badgering. I have to say I was watching at my radio studio, and I kind of winced, because when you have to interrupt the witness it makes your case not look that strong. Let him answer the question and then have a quick follow up. But I think he was worried about not having enough time. They have such a limited amount of time that he probably got frustrated, but was that a fatal mistake on the part of Jordan? 
SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: I don't think it's a fatal mistake. I just think he went to school, the Teddy Kennedy school of congressional cross-examination. You ask a hostile question and then you immediately interrupt the person that you are questioning. So my objection is not to the substance of what he asked. He is allowed to ask anything he wants. It is to the badgering. 
But the larger question here about this whole exercise of bashing Rosenstein is something that Andy has spoken to several times in his columns, Andy McCarthy, and spoke to it a couple of days ago. President Trump has the absolute authority to order Rod Rosenstein to turn over anything and everything to the Congress. And if he did it and Rosenstein didn't want to do it, he could resign, or if he refused to do it, the president could fire him. Why hasn't he done that? 
INGRAHAM: Let's ask Andy that. Andy, what is the delay? Why hasn't President Trump just said turn the documents over? That's not prejudicing the case, or he doesn't look like he is defensive. It's transparency. Why won't the president say to Rosenstein enough with these continuing resolutions that they keep passing that are meaningless in Congress. They passed a resolution. We are compelling you to release the documents. They are not going to release the documents. That was clear today to me. So why won't the president demand that they be finally released and get this show on the road? 
ANDY MCCARTHY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: That's a great question, Laura. And I appreciate Sol bringing it up. The great irony I thought of the hearing was my friend Jim Jordan really laying into Rod Rosenstein saying you're the boss. These people work for you. And the elephant in the room is that Rosenstein works for Trump. And precisely the point you make is true. Trump can order this. 
So what we understand is that he has gotten advice, I don't think it's particularly good advice, that because has been under investigation for obstruction and because the critics of Trump have conflated in the public mind the Republican Congress's pursuit of what went on with the agents who conducting these investigations and Mueller's investigation, that if Trump act to force disclosure and help Congress here, he is effectively obstructing justice. Now, I think that's nuts. I don't see a legal obstruction case.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: I get it. 
MCCARTHY: But I think that's where they're at. 
INGRAHAM: That's what they are worried about. John, there are so many things in this hearing that were wild. One of them was when he was asked, Rosenstein was asked, what about this FISA warrant? And he wouldn't answer the question about whether he read it. And then he said Strzok didn't brief me and it went through the others, Moyer didn't brief me. But he wouldn't answer the question about did you actually read this FISA warrant? And he kept saying you basically don't understand. He also said I don't supervise -- I have 100,000 employees. So he wasn't looking over the shoulder of Peter Strzok at every moment, but he said he wants to root out any corruption that's there. 
JOHN IANNARELLI, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: If he had read the warrant, he would have said I read the warrant. He obviously didn't read the warrant or maybe glanced over it so long ago he can't remember the specifics which is why he's not commenting. I'll tell you, this whole process is moving so incredibly slow, at this point DOJ has to stop with the glacier performance and recognize the American people want to know what's going on. Speed it up already. Let's get the answers out there. 
INGRAHAM: And Trey Gowdy went just crazy on that. He decided, Sol, not to ask a question, but to take his time to make sure he got quoted and the soundbite was used on most evening newscasts, and cable and all over social media today, get this thing wrapped up. What is taking so long? Give us the documents. And then there was a moment when Jordan was pressing another matter about Peter Strzok. I want to play it and have Sol's reaction. Let's watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
JORDAN: Why did you tell Peter Strzok not to answer our questions yesterday? When I asked Peter Strzok if he had ever communicated with Glenn Simpson, he gave us the answer he gave us dozens of times, on the advice of FBI counsel I can't answer that question. Why couldn't he answer that question?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROSENSTEIN: I appreciate your sincere concerns, but I didn't give Peter Strzok any instructions. How do I know, sir? You interviewed Mr. Strzok. I didn't. So I can't -- 
JORDAN: That works for you. It doesn't work for us. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Sol, I don't think Rosenstein came off well today at all. I thought he came off as very defensive, very flip, but he played the victim card. You are personally attacking me, you are mean to me in the media. Welcome to the big leagues, buddy. You're the deputy A.G., pretty hot right now. But he kept saying, there are all these people who work in the Department of Justice. This is the biggest case, the Russia case and the Hillary email case, these two things dovetailed together because of this one agent. He had a duty to find out what happened. 
WISENBERG: Keep in mind here -- I think he did better than you think he did. But keep in mind two really important things, I'm glad you focused on this, because Rosenstein made two points. Number one, I am not the one and nobody at DOJ as opposed to the FBI, which is in the DOJ, but nobody in Rosenstein's shop told Peter Strzok what to say or not to say. And also he made it very clear he had nothing to do with the redactions including this latest outrageous redaction that they didn't find out about until the inspector general's report came out about they will stop him, he didn't have anything to do with that. When he found out and when he was told there were redactions he brought in this U.S. attorney from Chicago. 
But it brings up and interesting point. There appears for many years on and off, there has been a rogue element in the FBI leadership that obstructs these kinds of investigations. And obviously it's outrage that that text message was not sent to the Congress. And the question is what is going to be done about it, because I think the DOJ should do something about that. 
INGRAHAM: Andy, are there any repercussions for what was done? Redacting, don't worry, basically, I will take care of it, meaning it's not going to be a problem, Trump is not going to be a problem. And that doesn't go to the Congress?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCCARTHY: Of course. And this is the problem I think that Rosenstein has. I think, for example, I wondered if he had ever prepared a witness before because a lot of times it seemed to me his answers were sensible but the smirk on his face was really off putting. But on this particular, he says that he strongly supports the discipling of agents who committed misconduct. He endorsed I.G. Horowitz's report. But you have got to put your money where your mouth is. And it's impossible to be credible and say at the same time, we are giving you all this cooperation, and when we find somebody who withholds stuff, we don't do anything to discipline them. 
INGRAHAM: John, what I am looking for some of these officials, why isn't he angry about this? He seems it's all about him. Again, you were mean to me in the press, and they're personal attacks. If this happened at the FBI, which it did, you had these people burrowed into the system who hated Trump. They wanted to make sure that Hillary Clinton didn't ultimately get prosecuted, and they were going to make sure by hell or high water that Trump was going to have problems. Why isn't this guy, Rosenstein, angry? 
IANNARELLI: I don't know, because I will tell you, in the FBI I held a lot of leadership positions. No matter what somebody did underneath me, I'm the boss, I'm responsible for it. And you better believe I would have been angry after the fact when I confronted whoever did what. 
INGRAHAM: The buck stops here? No, I guess not. 
WISENBERG: They let him out. The let Strzok out, don't forget, a couple weeks ago. He was let out. 
INGRAHAM: It's about time! 
MCCARTHY: He still works there, though.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes. 
MCCARTHY: It's not like he is gone. He is sort of over there. 
INGRAHAM: But he was moved to like human resources after the lovebirds -- 
MCCARTHY: Laura, we need human resources. 
INGRAHAM: OK, guys, human resources, yay. All right, guys, thanks so much. 
And another Roger Stone associate a target in the Mueller probe, and Stone is here to respond next.

INGRAHAM: Is Bob Mueller chasing facts or is he just looking for some inconvenient timeline for the president? I ask that because Bloomberg is reporting tonight that the special counsel will decide whether to issue indictments for collusion with Russia by this fall. That's right, right before the midterm elections. 
As you heard moments ago, Trey Gowdy wants this, quote, wrapped the hell up, and it seems the America public agrees. A Harvard-Harris poll recently found that 58 percent of Americans want this probe wrapped up in six months with a whopping 30 percent who want it to stopped immediately. Let's discuss with former adviser to Donald Trump, author of the book "Stone's Rules" Roger Stone, and Fox News contributor Byron York, chief political correspondent for the "Washington Examiner." 
Roger, we're going to get to the issue of your associate being subpoenaed in a moment, but first this "Bloomberg" story about the timing of when this will be wrapped up. Very curious. 
ROGER STONE, FORMER ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP: Well, two days ago there was a story that said that the special counsel was now going to focus on Russian collusion. Really? What has he been doing for two years? We are almost at the half-point in Donald Trump's first term and he is still under investigation with no charges of Russian collusion by him or his family or his campaign brought because there is no evidence of such. This is an effort to undo what they couldn't do at the ballot box in 2016. It is a naked partisan effort to remove the president. 
INGRAHAM: Byron, what do you make of the public souring on this investigation at this point? 
BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": I think part of it is just the fact that hasn't come out, and there has been no evidence to come out about collusion. And part of it is the president's campaign against him. The Rudy Giuliani campaign has been actually quite effective. 
Now, on the November thing, there is a very specific Justice Department policy about issuing prosecutions that might affect an election. 
INGRAHAM: Last time, remember, that's what Comey talked about. 
YORK: Right, that's not done. And there is no date specific set, but it is late June now. And the idea that he would issue some sort of indictment in the fall before this election, no, I don't think that's -- 
INGRAHAM: And now they're talking about you can't name a Supreme Court until the investigation is wrapped up. 
YORK: It has to be an odd numbered year. It can't be an election year. 
INGRAHAM: Roger, the news came out today that your associate, one of your associates, has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller, an aide who worked apparently briefly for you during the 2016 election. Thoughts? 
STONE: First of all, the witch hunt continues. Andrew Miller, who hasn't worked for me since 2013, three years ago, did come and help me at the Republican National Convention for a week. By the way, he is not a Trump supporter. He is a registered libertarian and active supporter of Governor Gary Johnson in 2016, supported the Johnson-Well ticket. This is a fishing expedition. But if he didn't work for me other than at the convention, it reinforces my view that this is some kind of effort to frame me for some extraneous offense to silence me, or to get me to testify against the president. 
INGRAHAM: Roger, what did he do for you? Why did you have a Gary Johnson guy work for you for a week? I am not following that. 
STONE: When he worked for me, and it was three years ago, he did scheduling. He traveled with me as a wing man. He did some I.T. work. But, again, he remains a good friend of mine. But I thought this was about Russian collusion and the 2016 election. The story here is not so much the subpoena but the fact that he is going to seek through his lawyers to quash it on broad constitutional grounds as I understand it. It's a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. This is an effort to take my associates and browbeat them to get one of them to say something negative about me. 
INGRAHAM: This is the most heavy-handed, classic prosecutorial tactic. Take people who are low on the totem pole, turn the screws on them, and turn them so hard they will do anything to make it stop, because they are afraid. Roger spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to defend himself against Lord knows what, and someone on MSNBC tonight apparently, Byron, said that Roger is the last person to be interviewed by Mueller. 
YORK: And look for crimes that have nothing to do with what you are actually investigating. I will say, though, this challenge that Miller is going to make to Mueller's appointment is another one. Paul Manafort has tried to challenge it. They are doing it and two slightly different grounds, but basically saying that Mueller's office is unconstitutional, and they're not going to win with that. Manafort has already lost in the courts, and this one will probably not work either. 
INGRAHAM: Roger, tonight Michael Cohen put out a tweet and he said "My family and I are owed an apology. After two years, 15 hours of testimony before House and Senate under oath, producing more than 1,000 documents, dossier misreports 15 allegations about me. My enter statement must be quoted -- I had nothing to do with Russian collusion or meddling." Any thoughts about that. 
STONE: Michael Cohen deserves his day in court as well. I've read a dozen stories, he's going to plead to this, he's going to flip over that. We haven't seen anything yet. So this story remains unwritten. I feel badly for Michael Cohen because he has had millions of dollars' worth of legal fees, and they seek to destroy him as well. Yet he hasn't been charged with any crime. 
INGRAHAM: And the public is turning on this. The public is turning against Mueller and it's turning against this investigation. We've got to go, guys, unfortunately. But forget that blue wave. We're going to tell you why President Trump is suddenly talking up a red wave in midterm elections. Top pollsters will be with us in a moment. You won't believe what they found out about immigration, coming up. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: The tide might have turned against the Democrats as we approach the midterm elections. We'll see. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly. The red wave is happening. Just look what happened last night. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: President Trump of course referring to the stunning primary wins by the far left Democrats which could split the party. And this while GOP voters may be motivated to turn out on Election Day to assure that the president's Supreme Court nominee is confirmed. 
Let's analyze all of this suddenly shifting picture with Republican pollster Frank Luntz and Democratic pollster Mark Penn. It's so great to have both of you on. We could do a whole hour on where we are right now. Mark, you have done very interesting polling on immigration that I just read about tonight. I saw you on "The Hill" talk about it. But a question about separating families, and what did you find out? 
MARK PENN, CHAIRMAN, HARRIS POLL: Look, 88 percent did not want families separated. But the underlying attitude, 70 percent said they want tougher enforcement of our immigration laws. So this was a wrong policy, but the underlying notion of the nation is that we have got to have borders here while we are also good to DACA recipients and treat families appropriately. And that explains why Trump's ratings did not go down in my poll. He actually went up to 47 despite this controversy. 
But I'll tell you, there may not be a blue wave, but there is definitely a blue edge, because while people may fear that the Democrats are moving too far to the left, the Republicans have no leadership and no message and still have a pretty good edge here for the Democrats going into the midterms. 
INGRAHAM: Why do they have no leadership? Donald Trump is a leader. Last night he was like, we are going to have a red wave. Frank, you've been doing some interesting poling on trade. He's in Wisconsin, the big Foxconn deal today, thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. They're worried about Harley- Davidson, but we've got Foxconn. 
FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: You look at the unemployment levels at record lows for Latinos and African-Americans. You look at more money in their paychecks. People vote their pockets, and they vote their wallets, and they vote their bank accounts. And all of them are in favor of the GOP. But what I am looking at in terms of immigration, it's not just about border security. In the end do we feel safer as a country. And it's safety, security, and a sense of will being. 
INGRAHAM: And your poll question which I found most interesting is that 84 percent of respondents said that you should notify authorities when crimes are committed, illegal immigrants, people in custody, keep them in custody. And I think most people want people unified, united, in their home countries. Keep family together in their home country. 
PENN: Absolutely. They said two things. One, if people are arrested, given a choice between the authorities notifying ICE or being prohibited, 84 percent they should be notified. And second, they said by two to one what should happen to families here illegally? They should be sent home. And that's the general attitude Americans have about immigration, tougher borders with compassion and done the right way. 
INGRAHAM: Frank, we've talked about this before. But the Democrats, they are looking for something in the trick bag to use against Trump, and they tried everything. He is a demagogue, he's authoritarian, he's Hitler, he's Nazi, he's fascist, everything. And his numbers were 47 percent in Harvard-Harris yesterday. 
LUNTZ: His numbers are higher than Barack Obama at this moment. But I've got one for you also, and I'm waiting to see who jumps on it, which is energy security and the economics. If we actually turn our oil, our gasoline, and using natural gas, if we do that kind of energy change, which is easy to do, gas prices go down and the economy gets even stronger. 
INGRAHAM: It's money in the pocket. People want money in the pocket, and conservatives were motivated in 2016 on the Supreme Court. Federal appellate court judgeships and the Supreme Court, people think it's not interested. My radio callers today were on fire about this retirement of Kennedy. And Schumer, et cetera, they are going to go to the mat. Let's watch Schumer today. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Our Republican colleagues in the Senate should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a Supreme Court justice in an election year. 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
LUNTZ: He is making such a huge mistake. If they don't vote for it now, every Republican across the country will vote to keep Republicans in control of the Senate. 
INGRAHAM: They are motivated on this issue. Guys, I want you both on radio. Tomorrow, next day. We'll be right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: Thanks as always for being with us tonight. We continue to send our prayers, our thoughts, and our love to all those affected by another senseless and depraved shooting that we saw today down of course at the "Capital Gazette" in Annapolis. Tell us how we're going on Twitter. 
That's all the time we have tonight. We have a lot of news to cover tomorrow so you're going to want to tune it right back in here tomorrow night to Fox News all through the day and night. 
Let's hand it off now to Shannon Bream and the "Fox News @ Night" team. Shannon?
