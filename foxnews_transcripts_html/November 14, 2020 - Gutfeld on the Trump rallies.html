GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Before I got someone's watching it but me.
Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Bret Baier, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a
cherry tomato is her yoga ball, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Last night's Trump
rally ended at 1:00 a.m., nine hours past Dana's bedtime.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Wow, what a crowd, what a
crowd. Nobody gets crowd like this. You know what gets crowds like this?
Making America great again, that's what gets crowds like this, the only
thing that will get a crowd like this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD:  Yup, the crowd is huge. The Trump train is longer than that wall
in China. But where is Joe?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  The next president of the
United States of America, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD:  The media as usual is spooked by Trump's crowds, a concern that
missing when cities were burned by leftists attacking cops. To them,
American flags are scary unless they are on fire. Meanwhile, who is having
fun -- all these white people. They are not white, there goes that
narrative.

The contrast between that excitement and what was heard from the media is
stark, something's up. The Dems are already questioning the election, a
stunt they pioneered in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I suspect we will find out in 48 hours how successful
these suppressing tactics have been. That is the one concern that I have.
The only way, in my opinion, for Joe Biden not to be successful is for
voter suppression to be successful.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GUTFELD:  Oh, boy. So even though 100 million already voted, he screamed
suppression, which assures more violence if Trump wins which they will
blame Trump for. But it was the media that started the, what if he stays in
the White House BS which Trump into a joke, chanting 12 more years. And all
this crap is coming from the same dopes who started it all with the Russian
collusion hoax.

First they called Trump's win a foreign concoction. Schiff had proof they
claimed. They also claimed Trump wasn't there president so they held
massive protests. Maxine demanded that you get into people's faces,
ignoring Trump's work for minorities from prison reform to black colleges
to jobs, they embraced mind-reading.

His deeds may not be evil, but we know his thoughts are. And what did that
bring? Well, they chased Trump staffers at restaurants. They showed up at
homes. They docked supporters, celebs called for assassination and bombing
the White House. And the capper, hey, let's defund the cops. Then when the
violence worsens, we can blame it on Trump again.

Leftist leaders blamed their cities mayhem on Trump and not their own
cowardice. Then came the arson, the looting. Media on Twitter shouting burn
it all down until it reached their homes. Democrat mayors hid behind the
cops they wanted to defund. And soon, media hacks defined looting as
acceptable.

The pathetic phrase mostly peaceful became the mockable defense. Joe Biden
called Antifa an idea. As Plato understood, when you live in a cave,
everything is just an idea. So now, we have these huge rallies and caravans
of thousands. And the press, they ask in fear who are all these people?
Well, to quote your idol, sorry, you built that.

So Dana, last night at the club, you said this to me. You said you know
Greg, elections are like taking drugs. You wanted to peek exactly at the
right time which Trump is a master at.

DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  I mean, I have a lot of experience with drugs.
And that's why you listen to me when it comes to that, because honestly, if
you are going to ask somebody just when you want that high to hit. I'm the
perfect person to come to. And you know, President Trump is closing, like,
maybe he's at the right place at the right time.

I was been thinking about how another narrative that you heard over the
year was that President Trump doesn't really want to win. This is all for
publicity and for a possible thing that he wants to do in the future, and
to build hotels around the world. And there he is at 1:00 a.m., the fifth
of five rallies with a crowd like that.

So I think obviously he wants to win. Stirewalt reminded me of something
earlier today, and that is in the last two re-elections both for Bush and
Obama, remember as I said. Incumbents are hard to beat. They'll usually win
again. It's only happened twice since World War II that a president didn't
win a second term.

And for Bush and Obama, they got a push of about 2.1 percent at this late
stage, and it made the difference. So it possibly could be happening.

GUTFELD:  All right. You know, Jesse, Trump is pulling out all the stops
while hitting all the stops.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD:  Again, isn't it that kind of reciprocity that makes voters think?
He's really working for my vote so maybe I should get up and do it?

JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  And he believes the base is strong and
really fired up to vote, and the models are indicating that they are going
to show up. And the votes that the Democrats have put in the bank so far
with early voting and mail-in voting are just not enough they believe to
withstand a strong Trump turn out.

And everything we've seen about the Trump base, it's never wavered in four
years, it's never cracked. Enthusiasm is at record high. And you could
argue that it's even growing. When you think about all the rallies he's
done, all the new registrations that they've added, if he can maintain
strong numbers with white working class, cracked 30 percent with Hispanics.

Maybe 10 percent with blacks, you punch your ticket back to the White
House. And other indicators are really strong for the president, too. Just
look at his approval on the economy, the number one issue in this election.
Very strong, Rasmussen has him at 52 percent approval. Also very strong
there, I was looking at the polls today, Juan. I know you like looking at
the polls, Real Clear Politics average.

(CROSSTALK)

WATTERS:  I like looking at certain poles, Dana. Real Clear Politics
average two weeks, Biden was up five in the battleground. His lead is now
is 2.7 in Pennsylvania. He had a seven-point lead two weeks ago in
Pennsylvania. The the lead is now 2.9. That's kind of scary. So if you just
look at how the campaigns are finishing, Trump looks optimistic.

Well energized, focused, hitting a lot of those populists, very, very sharp
contrast with Joe Biden. Joe Biden looks like he's making a lot of
mistakes, not a lot of enthusiasm on that side. I think the Trump campaign
feels good.

GUTFELD:  All right, Juan. You can respond.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  I'm allowed to respond? This is news. But I
will say -- I just think Jesse, you know what? I have a lot of trust in Fox
News polling. I know the president said somebody here doesn't like him. Tim
Murtaugh was on Fox and said the Fox polling was terrible. I think our
polling is pretty good.

And I think our Fox polling has a great record, in fact, of accuracy. And
what the Fox polls says is that Biden is up eight nationally, right? And I
think if you look at the fact that their data has been so consistent, I
think there's a reason to think, oh, yeah, people might show up at 1:00 to
have some fun and be entertained.

But it doesn't necessarily transition then in your mind into, oh, that
equals votes. The big question for me is who would you rather be looking at
those polls on election eve tonight? Which side is better positioned to win
the Electoral College? That's what it all comes down to. And I don't think
there's any doubt.

I don't think if you are in the club or you are in the rafters doing the
Macarena, you'd say, oh, I'd rather be Trump -- no. You'd rather be Joe
Biden tonight. And you know when you see that incredible turnout, and by
the way, Greg, people who turned out and stood in line, they did in
defiance of voter suppression.

They are in fact overcoming something. And there's a tremendous history in
our country, especially with black Americans, of having to fight for their
right to vote. So I think it's triggered something. In any case, when you
see those lines with an incumbent running, an incumbent, it means people
want change. That's not good news for the incumbent.

BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  So heading into Election Day, Juan's right.
Biden has an advantage heading in. But we don't know what the electorate
looks like on Election Day. And we've already seen 95 to 97 million people
vote, it's truly amazing. It's a staggering number. To Dana's point, Donald
Trump outperformed battleground states from 1-7 points.

So you look at just some of those states and how much that can's shift, we
have a long night ahead tomorrow.

GUTFELD:  You guys do. I don't know what I'll be doing.

BAIER:  Are you going to bed?

(CROSSTALK)

WILLIAMS:  I know. He'll be on the club.

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO:  I have the right formula for the whole night.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD:  I love that we ended up with drug humor.

(CROSSTALK)

GUTFELD:  All right. Coming up, we're less than 24 hours away until
Election Day. But the fight over who wins could be far from over. Both
sides are ready for a legal battle.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BAIER:  It's amazing what happens in the commercial here. Welcome back, a
live look as President Trump and Joe Biden gear up for doing campaign
rallies this hour. The election is tomorrow, but finding out who wins could
take a lot longer, both sides preparing for the legal battles after the
campaign officially ends.

And President Trump doubling down on his call to have all the votes counted
by tomorrow night.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP:  You know what would have been really nice, though? If our Supreme
Court could have ruled that everything has to be counted by the evening of
our election, our great Election Day. Wouldn't that be nice? Instead of
waiting around six days, eight days, nine days giving them more time. If
they want more time, let them put their ballots in early.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BAIER:  Over the battleground, Pennsylvania the mayor of Philadelphia
warning that counting mail-in ballots will quote, "easily take several
days." This honestly, Dana, could last, if we think that Pennsylvania is
going to be as tight as it may be, you remember or Tallahassee in 2,000, it
could be Harrisburg in 2020.

PERINO:  You remember Tallahassee better than all of us here, because you
were there for 36 days? The interesting thing about the 2,000 recount which
people think about as obviously a big moment in history is that you could
have a few different Tallahassee's. Because if they are going to challenge
ballots in Pennsylvania, you also have the situation in North Carolina.

The other thing is, though, some of these mail-in ballots, people get
Florida in that count. Mail-in ballots have been coming in strong from
Republicans. So I know that the president would like to have this done by
tomorrow night. But in some of these places where it's going to be close,
those mail-in ballots or absentee ballots could actually benefit the
president as well.

BAIER:  In other words, after tomorrow night, Jesse.

WATTERS:  I think both campaigns will know tomorrow night who's going to
win, whether a network declares victory or not. They will know if their
voters showed up, which ballots are outstanding and from where. So if the
president believes he is winning or will win, he will declare victory
tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. You can be sure of that.

BAIER:  And do you think that's OK before the thing's wrapped up?

WATTERS:  Listen, I guess he will say we know how many votes are cast this
many states, and we know the mail in ballots are at a small margin where
even if they all go Democrat they won't be enough to overcome his lead
somewhere in the state. So yes, I do believe he will declare himself
victory.

But do we really want that? Do we want a contested election? Does this
country, after all we've gone through, deserve a contested election?

(CROSSTALK)

WATTERS:  It's like you can almost see it coming. And I don't want it to be
decided by the courts. And you don't want conspiracy theories flying,
because right now you can see the Democrats have already put out talking
points that this will be a red mirage tomorrow night when Donald Trump is
going to be ahead in some of these swing states.

And they will be suing in some of these battlegrounds to change the rules
and the deadlines. Because right now, the deadlines and the rules have been
set, they've been set through courts and legislatures. So if you fly in
lawyers and then change the rules and delay and say ballots that have been
sent out that haven't even been returned need to be counted, because every
vote needs to be counted. You are playing games.

BAIER:  And what makes it even more complicated, Juan, is every state
handles it differently. Some states have a Democratic secretary of state,
and Republican legislature which is a battle yet to come.

WILLIAMS:  Well, each state has the right to decide how they do the vote
counting. And I think that's something that somehow people don't appreciate
that it's nothing of a conspiracy. It's not left or right. It's just
history. That's the way it's done. It's like a Tenth Amendment argument
about states' rights.

And states are in charge of the election in their jurisdiction. You know,
even today, you saw in Texas, you saw a Republican judge say to the
challenge coming from the Trump campaign about people who had cast votes at
a drive-through situation, more than 100,000, no. Those people had the
right to vote and that was set up long ago.

You could have challenged earlier. You didn't. And so leave them alone.
Many of these challenges are coming from the Trump campaign, so it's ironic
to see the president out there saying don't you wish the Supreme Court
would rule that we could -- no, listen. People historically in Florida and
Pennsylvania and here in New York, these votes have taken days.

It's just that they haven't made any huge difference, except of course in
Florida in 2,000. But the point is that this is the way America runs. It's
not any conspiracy. It's just the way things are done. But right now, in
this heightened polarized political atmosphere, you see people pointing it
out and say, oh, there goes the other side. Well, that's just not
realistic.

BAIER:  And it's possible either way that you don't get to that point where
the legal challenges don't have to be used but somebody is declared the
winner.

GUTFELD:  I hope so, because I don't want to get involved in this. The
problem here is time. It's like the more time in which we don't know the
more unrest can occur. And we know that could happen and what we knew --
smart people do as they plan ahead, and we were talking about this in the
break.

Every place in Georgetown and every place in New York is being boarded up,
why, because they are preparing for the worst. But somehow, the politicians
couldn't get together to prepare for the worst if something is close. I
mean, if you see something coming, can't you do anything about it? And I
mean, let's face it.

Trump was ridiculed for talking about, like, the problems with the mail-
ins. And now, you have the Democrats talking about it. It's like, you know
what? Maybe we should have listened to the guy. He hasn't been wrong yet,
ever, ever, ever.

(CROSSTALK)

BAIER:  What about Clyburn saying about suppression yesterday, talking
about suppressing the vote?

PERINO:  Well, I think to Juan's point, for black voters, it has been very
true for them in some places, right? And we know that from history. But I
also think a lot of states have taken great measures to make sure that
doesn't happen. And also, I would say this in terms of suppression. Like,
the Democrats have turned out so many voters already.

That to me, it seems like we need to wait until this turkey is cooked to
see if that is actually true, because the Democrats are turning out.

WILLIAMS:  Well, I think we had a situation just over the weekend in North
Carolina, a small town, where the police are using pepper spray on people
who are marching and being taken to the polls. You think what is going on?
Or you think about what's going with the Postal Service, obviously more
than just Democrats are upset about what's been taking place there and the
delays that are already in place to transport people who voted -- to the
ballot box.

GUTFELD:  Now, it's OK to criticize the Postal Service?

WILLIAMS:  No, it's not a criticism, it's the fact that what you have is a
--

(CROSSTALK)

WILLIAMS:  We are going to cut back in terms of overtime and the steps
necessary to make sure those ballots are in place.

(CROSSTALK)

WATTERS:  That's on you.

WILLIAMS:  All right.

BAIER:  Ahead, Bernie Sanders with a message to the so-called Squad about
what they will need to do if Joe Biden becomes president.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WATTERS:  More evidence of far left is ready to hijack a Joe Biden
presidency if he wins. Bernie Sanders with this message to the Squad.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We understand that electing Biden is not the end. It's
the beginning. Biden's proposals in this campaign are much stronger than
they were in the primary. Do they go as far as we would want to? No, they
don't. We are not giving up on our agenda. We are going to introduce
Medicare for all.

Green New Deal, we aren't giving up on that. We organized our people to
make sure that Biden becomes the most progressive since FDR.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


WATTERS:  Not so fast, Bernie. Joe Biden is reportedly mulling a plan to
keep all current senators out of his cabinet, meaning Liz Warren and
Sanders will be out of luck. Dana, this is kind of a crafty move by a
presumptive president-elect.

PERINO:  Yeah, when I first thought that's really smart, because it does a
couple of things. One, it gives them a clear line. Like, here's a clear
line. We're not having any senators, so stop calling. Don't have your
people call. Stop putting it in The Hill newspaper. Stop putting it on
Twitter. Stop having your friends call us because we are not going to have
any senators.

Just a moratorium on that, another thing for Elizabeth Warren is she would
be up for re-election in 2022. There is a Republican governor in
Massachusetts. If the Senate is going to be held by Republicans, barely
even, but if the Republicans are going to hold on, then why would they risk
having the governor of Massachusetts replace Elizabeth Warren with a
Republican so that she could be the secretary of the treasury when that
will give them no end of headaches? I thought it was super smart.

WATTERS:  Greg, you know what would be really smart is if the Trump
campaign just cuts an ad of that far left that Zoom call and says this is
coming.

GUTFELD:  I was looking at Bernie with the (Inaudible) it was like a
communist version of Charlie's Angels. Sanders is Charlie and those are the
Angels. And every hour, there's like a little plot where they try to
undermine America with socialist principles. Let's tax, let's steal. By the
way, just a --

(CROSSTALKING)

GUTFELD:  And ban fracking. Just to clarify, Joe did say there was no way
he was going to put Bernie and Liz in the cabinet, but he was thinking
about an actual one. You have to be clear. But Bernie looks at Joe the way
Dr. Frankenstein looked at his monster. He sees it as his creation, just
cobbling together of all these left-wing body parts.

And maybe it will kind of a move down into the city and change things
before it collapses and Kamala Harris takes over.

WATTERS:  The Biden campaign, Bret, can't be happy when they see a Zoom
call like that. These people plotting for how they are going to influence
the new administration?

BAIER:  No. As you are making you close that you will be the president of
all America, and the progressives are fighting over what policies they are
going to effect. I think the secretary of treasury Elizabeth Warren pitch
really was not the best close with the Biden campaign, especially for
independents.

I do think that Attorney General Amy Klobuchar could be upset with this
decision if, in fact, Joe Biden becomes president. I'm saying Senator
Klobuchar being considered. But I think that this is a reminder for people
in the middle or center left or disaffected Republicans that that is a
possibility. And the Biden campaign had to stop it and they had to do
something quickly, and they did.

WATTERS: Juan, was there anything the Biden campaign could have done to
kind of stop these people from jockeying for position so openly on the eve
of this election? I mean, they could have waited a week or two, right?

WILLIAMS: No. I don't get it. Why would you want to stop them?

WATTERS: It just doesn't look very good when you have all these socialists
plotting to take-over your administration.

WILLIAMS: Well, look, what did I -- I must say -- I must say, I noticed,
you know, the stock market today. I know you're very concerned about your
riches, Jesse. And I noticed the stock market --

WATTERS: I'm not as rich as you, Juan.

WILLIAMS: -- the stock market went way up. And I thought to myself, I think
they factored in the chance that Joe Biden might win this election and
they're not upset about it. And they're not upset about the idea --

PERINO: Maybe it went up because they've said Elizabeth Warren want to be
Treasury Secretary.

WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. Go right ahead.

WATTERS: No, go ahead, Juan. I don't know why that's the stock market the
reason that went up.

WILLIAMS: No, because you guys were saying, oh, imagine Elizabeth Warren
and the -- let's say he said, Elizabeth Warren for Treasury Secretary. You
know, would that somehow cause capitalism to fail? Would it upset America?
Answer, no. Answer, no.

Answer, in fact, you know, right now we have a big Wall Street guy as
treasury secretary. Maybe people would be working -- and America is a
little upset, hey, they're always looking out for the rich guy, not for me.
Maybe Elizabeth Warren would be atonic.

I think that what you got to understand is, Donald Trump is not running
against Bernie Sanders. He's not running against the squad. Bernie Sanders
and the squad, in fact, are identified by Joe Biden as the guy I beat for
the nomination among Democratic voters. Maybe that tells you something
about who Joe Biden is.

And I just would say to you, look, in fact, at Joe Biden. He's not for
Medicare for all, right? Joe Biden is the guy who would put more people in
jail in the 80s and 90s. It doesn't sound to me like he's some liberal
puppet.

BAIER: OK, but do you think it is helpful, Juan?

GUTFELD: That's a good thing.

WILLIAMS: Right. Now, it's a good thing. Go vote Joe.

GUTFELD: That's what I'm saying.

BAIER: Do you think it's helpful on the close?

WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- I think they have a right to voice just like the
freedom caucus, just like the Tea Party. You're going to get people who are
saying things. Is that helpful in terms of the political messaging at this
point, probably not great, but not bad, because you want to make sure that
people on the left are willing to stand in line tomorrow and vote for Joe
Biden.

WATTERS: It may not even be an issue, Juan, because Joe might not even win.

WILLIAMS: It could be.

WATTERS: And you don't have to worry about it. Coming up, Joe Biden says
Trump is the virus America needs to defeat. Now, the President is hitting
back against that attack.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Joe Biden and President Trump trading blows over
the pandemic for most of this campaign. The former vice president saving
one of his sharpest attacks for last night. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The truth is (INAUDIBLE) to beat the
virus, we first got to beat Donald Trump. He's the virus.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: And President Trump, he's hitting back with these insults.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This election is also a
choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to have you locked down.
Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison
state.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: Bret, last night the President was at a rally and as they began
chanting fire Fauci, fire Fauci, he suggested he might do that after the
election. Is that a good strategy?

BAIER: As good as talking about Secretary of Treasury Elizabeth Warren.

WILLIAMS: OK.

BAIER: Yes, I think it's about equal to that. Yes, Fauci, if you look at
all the polls has a pretty good polling average as far as people and their
thoughts about him. That's probably not the close. Listen, President Trump
is though moving people, I think, on the lockdown, no lockdown. And I do
think that especially some of these battleground states, that is moving
some people.

And. you know, we may just be seeing the beginning of this. Again, it's all
about the electorate tomorrow.

WILLIAMS: All right. So, Jesse, take a look here at Mayor Pete talking
about that very issue that Bret Baier just raised.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAKE TAPPER, ANCHOR, CNN: If Joe Biden wins, should another lockdown be on
the table?

PETE BUTTIGIEG, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, hopefully it doesn't
come to that because we will see swift action coordinating with and
supporting public health authorities telling us what we can do as citizens
without requiring any kind of mandates. But everything has to be on the
table in order to keep Americans safe. Look, we should never have got to
this point. It should never have been allowed to get this bad nothing.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAMS: So Jesse, I think the corollary to that is OK, so if we're
talking about a possible lockdown once again, although, you know, Mayor
Pete said that might not be the case, what's the President's plan after all
this time? What's his plan to get the virus under control?

WATTERS: People say Pete is so brilliant on television. He needed a little
discipline there. Why would you answer a hypothetical like that? Joe Biden
already got hammered for letting the door open to future lockdowns and got
crushed the whole fall over it. And now he has surrogates out there opening
the door for more lockdowns.

You may look back if Biden loses and see Biden's association with the pro-
lockdown wing of this country as being probably one of the dumbest things
he did. You can still slam Donald Trump for his handling of the Coronavirus
and not be for lockdowns and be for masks and do all that.

But he hasn't been able to pull that off and it's really hurting him in
specially in states with Democratic governors, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota states that are -- still
have very strict regulations about restaurants and schools and sports. It's
a really bad message.

WILLIAMS: Well, you are disciplined because you didn't answer my question.

WATTERS: You see how I did there?

WILLIAMS: Yes, I really. That was excellent, excellent.

(CROSSTALK)

WILLIAMS: All right. So Dana, in fact, the seven-day average for new cases
in the United States hit a record high on Sunday. And one of the things we
see politically is that seniors who were strong for Trump in 2016 are not
this year, and a lot of them disapprove of his handling of the virus.

PERINO: Yes. So, like, when we finally get to pick through all the election
results, the Coronavirus is going to weigh very heavily one way or the
other. But, you know, I mentioned in the A-block about the Bush reelection
and Obama reelection getting that push of about two percent at the end.

One of the things that Bret just mentioned is like, in the suburbs, for
parents of children who are still not in schools -- and this issue of
parents versus the teachers' unions, they might not they might not like
President Trump at all. But the thought of locking down again for another
year when they watch their children spiral downward, both from mental
health, their physical health, their inability to compete on a global level
because they're not in school when the private schools are open, that --
you know, that could be one of the factors.

WILLIAMS: All right, so Greg, I was -- remember, when I was listening to
the monologue watching you talk about the rallies, I know that lots of
Trump critics call those rallies super spreader events where the virus.
Biden obviously likes to have a distance with the cars and the honking.
Which image do you think has worked best in this campaign?

GUTFELD: Well, the media loves the phrase super spreader. But I just want
to point out, when we do a show, we get these files, and we get these
things, and they have all of our -- all the stuff that we're supposed to
read. Every day that we do this about COVID, there's a very important
detail in there nobody brings up, the infection fatality rate keeps
dropping.

PERINO: Yes.

GUTFELD: That's the most important thing. Now, the media won't tell you
that because that doesn't help Biden. And if you report that, then you help
Trump, that the infection fatality rate is going down and will continue to
go down. A lot of that is because as this -- OK, so you go well, there are
all these new cases. Well, there's new cases because we're testing. Testing
is finding the new cases. The infection fatality rate drops.

That has to be told again, and again. It drives me crazy that we really
don't. But I want to give THE FIVE a slap on the back because we talked
about -- that's good, right, a slap on the back?

PERINO: A pat on the back.

GUTFELD: A pat on the back. That comes later. We predicted that -- we
predicted this debate would come down to the lockdown versus no lockdown
probably five months ago when the lockdown started. We said sooner or
later, we're going to have to calculate how many lives are saved by a
lockdown versus lost. And it was such a cold calculation that nobody likes
to do it.

But we actually argued about it. We said like, OK, here's an adult
argument, drug overdoses, right, suicides, depression, what does
unemployment lead to? What about rising crime which we saw? Oddly enough,
ironically, car accidents have gone up in some cities, because people are
speeding more. Pedestrian deaths are at a high in New York City because
pedestrians are getting hit by the speeding cars.

So, we have actually had this discussion many times. And Trump has always
been kind of one step ahead because as an optimist, he thinks that we're
going to get back to work, we're going to get back to work, because we
will. It is time for us to have this discussion. But Joe can't have it
because he's stuck on one variable. He's the generic candidate that can't
come up with a plan.

And we need to have somebody who says we're Americans, we're going to get
back to work. There are costs and there are benefits. We have to embrace
that. That's the -- that's what adults do.

WILLIAMS: Right. But is there a Trump plan?

GUTFELD: I think we've seen it. It was -- the Trump plan was, I've said it
before, it was like a -- it's like a transmission in a car. You get moving
forward, and then you change the gears when you run into stop. You might
even have to go in reverse, or maybe you take a left, but you move forward.

WILLIAMS: All right, Bret is got to run. He's going to get ready for that
terrific show "SPECIAL REPORT" at 6:00. Bret Baier, thank you so much for
joining us here on THE FIVE. We hope that you had a good time.

BAIER: I did. I survived.

WILLIAMS: You survived. Some people look at it that way. Coming up, there
are other big issues on the ballot tomorrow. More states could be
legalizing marijuana. Next on THE FIVE.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Welcome back. Tomorrow's election isn't just about President Trump
and Joe Biden. Yes, there are plenty of other hot button issues that voters
are going to decide on. New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota --
South Dakota will vote on whether to legalize recreational marijuana.

And Oregon could become the first state to decriminalize hard drugs instead
of jail time. Possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, and LSD would
result in fines or attending addiction recovery centers. Voters could also
legalize so-called magic mushrooms in that state, which I've just learned
the technical term for that.

Now, I thought a 60 minutes piece about magic mushrooms and there's --
their help for people that have PTSD. Is that correct, Greg?

GUTFELD: What's the technical name, Dana?

PERINO: Psilocybin?

GUTFELD: Psilocybin?

PERINO: I don't know. It starts with a P-S-I-L-O --

GUTFELD: Yes, it's a lot of words -- a lot of letters. I'm sorry. What were
you saying?

PERINO: I don't know. I mean --

GUTFELD: I'm so high right now.

PERINO: Is the magic mushroom -- is that the one that help PTSD.

GUTFELD: Yes, no, it's got -- OK, here's the thing, and I'll walk -- I'll
give you my argument using psilocybin as an example. Psilocybin is an
incredibly powerful hallucinogenic. And if you take it with your friends
and have a good day, it could be the worst possible night of your life. But
if you take it under supervision, and it's a controlled substance, it could
be the most amazing time of your life.

And that's why decriminalization I think is important because once you take
substances and regulate them by -- not by law, but by packaging and dosing
so that there's an enterprise that is actually doing the right measures and
making sure it's pure and clean, you have a substance that is effectively
safe, almost, I would have -- I haven't done the research in like two
years, but almost all of the opiate overdoses were due to fentanyl-laced
drugs purchased on the streets from China. It wasn't prescription Percocet
or Oxycontin that were killing people.

So, just one analogy, imagine if -- imagine if nicotine was illegal and you
couldn't buy 20 cigarettes, but you could go on the street and buy one
cigarette that had the strength of a carton. That's how we buy drugs on the
street. And we, I mean, Dana and her husband Pete.

PERINO: So, I was -- I have long been conflicted about legalization of any
drug. I've never done drugs. And I wonder, Juan, like, I guess, how do you
feel about it that you have grandchildren? Have your views evolved on this
issue at all?

WILLIAMS: So, as you know, I voted early. And in the District of Columbia,
I voted against proposal, a referendum that would say, you know what, we're
going to not police this, not deal with it, because I just I worry about
that very issue, Dana, about kids.

I must say that I'm a little bit of a hypocrite on this because as a kid, I
was involved with some of this. So, I will say this, though. What strikes
me is Michael Moore's thesis, which is that none of those states that you
listed in the open are swing states, none of them. And what you see is
whenever you put legalizing marijuana, not so much the psychedelics, but
marijuana on the ballot, wow, you get a boom of young people turning out to
vote.

So, it could have made a difference. I mean, certain people in certain
races in the past have put it there for just that reason. They want the
younger people to vote. And the younger people are behind this 100 percent.
Greg is on target.

PERINO: I know that -- I know that for some people who say that it's been a
great thing, but you know, I have really good friends that live in Colorado
they think it's been really not good for that state and that it wasn't well
thought out.

WATTERS: I just love how this is such a typical cable news eve of the
election crazy ballot initiative story. It's like you know, like your shark
attack in the summer story --

PERINO: I love ballot initiative stories.

WATTERS: Or like, the Monday after the Super Bowl be a holiday type of
story. Sexy Halloween costume, this is like right in the wheelhouse.

GUTFELD: It's like pork barrel -- pork barrel topic.

WATTERS: Yes, like you know, $500.00 for shrimp running on a treadmill.

PERINO: I do love this topic but what I love more is corny jokes, "ONE MORE
THING," which we have. That's coming up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GUTFELD: "ONE MORE THING." Dana.

PERINO: Well, that's not on the ballot. All right, It's time for this. OK,
so this is an Election Day version of corny jokes. And some of these corny
jokes were written by our producers, and they're very good. OK, are you
ready?

GUTFELD: All right, I'll be the judge.

PERINO: All right, why did the founding fathers have good breath?

GUTFELD: Good breath?

PERINO: Founding fathers have good breath, why?

WATTERS: Mints?

PERINO: They all had amendments?

WATTERS: Yes. Oh, I almost had it.

PERINO: Very good. Very close. Why wasn't Mitch McConnell invited to the
kegger?

GUTFELD: Because Brett Kavanaugh didn't know him?

WATTERS: Because he's doing cocaine instead.

PERINO: OK, those are all -- those are all very good responses. The answer
was a house party.

WATTERS: Oh, it was thoughtful.

PERINO: Why did the senator keep his bike -- how did the senator keep his
bike from getting stolen? The senator kept his bike from getting stolen,
how?

GUTFELD: He --

PERINO: He used gridlock. He use gridlock. That's OK. Why does the Midwest
have the best playgrounds? There are so many swing dates.

GUTFELD: Swing states.

PERINO: OK. And the last one, how come the president never picks up the
tab?

GUTFELD: Because he just writes the bill.

PERINO: Because Congress can't pass a bill. There we go. Those were pretty
good.

WATTERS: Those were pretty good. Those were pretty good.

PERINO: Everybody up on the 21st floor, congratulations.

GUTFELD: Jesse.

WATTERS: All right, Happy Halloween, everybody. As you know, Halloween was
Saturday night and we have some pictures of the twins. Here are the twins
in their costumes. You have -- Ellie was a football player. I don't know
why she wasn't an Eagles player. I guess she went with the Bucks instead.
And then Sophia was Snoopy. And she -- who was Snoopy his little friend,
like that little bird?

PERINO: The Woodstock?

WATTERS: Yes. Woodstock is not in the shot, but there they are. And they
got a lot of candy. And they're all hyper on sugar right now.

PERINO: Super cute.

GUTFELD: All right, let's do this quickly, my friends. Greg's Election
Tips. All right, you know what? I am trying to take my own advice like this
fellow right here. I really just need to chill out. I need to chill out. I
don't know if this is going to help me. I got to -- I got to turn out all
the lights in my apartment so people don't throw rocks through it. That's
what I'm going to be doing tomorrow.

GUTFELD: Yes.

PERINO: And get -- and turn that fan on.

GUTFELD: And turn that fan on. I often -- I often have the fan on, but not
for my face, Dana. I exercise a lot and I smell. Juan?

WILLIAMS: All right, so talk about bird brained ideas. Take a look at what
an expert in artificial intelligence did with the neighborhood birds. Yes,
those are magpies picking up bottle caps and then dropping them in a hole
to trigger the release of food.

It took a week but according to the scientists Hans Forsberg, the birds got
the idea and began cleaning up the neighborhood streets by grabbing every
bottle cap they saw. But as you watch this, keep in mind that not every
bird can do this.

Magpies are the most intelligent. Their brain to body mass ratio is bigger
than any creature except a human. In fact, magpies are one of only five
species that can recognize their own reflection, so you can't call them
bird brains.

GUTFELD: No. Magapies. That's what I call them.

WATTERS: Nice.

WILLIAMS: Oh, there you go.

GUTFELD: I think I've used that before. All right, that's it for us.
There's a show up next called "SPECIAL REPORT" starring Bret Baier.

Hi, Baier.
