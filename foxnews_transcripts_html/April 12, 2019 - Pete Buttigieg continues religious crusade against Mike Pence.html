LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Hey, everybody. I'm Laura Ingraham this is “The Ingraham Angle” tonight from Washington.
Now last night, we explained why Obama Intel czar Jim Clapper was so testy, gosh he was angry about Attorney General Bill Barr confirming that the Trump campaign had indeed been spied upon. Now he wasn't the only one. And tonight, is Jim Comey's turn in the barrel. Plus, the Democrats congressional hearings this week or a farce from beginning to end. All the embarrassing moments you know you miss them and the hilarious clap backs. All coming up. And Raymond Arroyo is here. So, what's behind Mayor Pete's religious war against Vice President Pence. Don't get it. And screwing Louis Farrakhan forgot what funeral he was attending. All that more in a special holy edition of Friday Follies.

But first in our “Ingraham Angle,” we can review some stories you may have missed. Now, first we hit immigration. Now the left has a very interesting way of approaching this issue. It's not an emergency, is it? When 100,000 people are pouring across our southern border. But when it's reported that President Trump is considering busing illegal immigrant detainees to sanctuary cities. Well, the Democrats totally freak out. The President up the ante today.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We can give him a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply and let's see if they're so happy. They say we have open arms. They're always say they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.

INGRAHAM: Well, now the President may have legal standing to make good on this threat and look at how the Democrats are squirming now. Nancy Pelosi said, the extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. But wait a second, shouldn't she and her other California politicians, the ones are all for open borders. Shouldn't they be thrilled. They are the ones after all who have said this about sanctuary cities.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: In our sanctuary cities, our people are not disobeying the law.

They keep people healthier and they keep people educated.

INGRAHAM: Gosh, I mean that's just a commercial for sanctuary cities. Take them in, bring them in, welcome them in. But it's not so simple, is it? Consider this horrific crime in the sanctuary city of Jersey City. An illegal alien is charged in the March 24th rape and murder of jogger Carolina Cano. Jorge Rios had been deported two times from the United States before returning illegally a third time. Now Cano worked as a nanny and friends say, she was an incredible woman of strong faith and a beautiful giving heart.
But the left doesn't even acknowledge these American tragedies. They're too busy trying to demonize Trump on this and score political points, which brings us to our next story. This week, Democrats continued flailing in the wake of Bob Mueller's no collusion finding. Now I think they're beyond desperate at this point to regain political footing after two years of leveling defamatory and false accusations against the President. Remember he was basically spooning with Vladimir Putin before the election. But they've quickly found a new target, Attorney General Bill Barr.

At the moment that sent shivers down the spines of the former Obama deep stators was this one.

INGRAHAM: So, let me get this straight. Clapper and Comey otherwise known as Jim Squared. That's what we call here, were the guys determined to get something on President Trump both through surveillance and leaking to the media. But now they're spending their time quibbling with the term spying. Now this concern which is all phony over semantics. Of course, it's reeks of desperation. I think the real fear is that Attorney General Barr is extremely serious. He's very judicious, extremely professional and he's on the case. And they also know that the Inspector General Mike Horowitz will not only clean up this mess but hold those who perpetrated this fraud accountable.
Here now, Sara Carter and Former Deputy Independent Counsel Sol Wisenberg, both are Fox News contributors. Sol, why do you think now they're worried about surveillance versus spying. When Bill Barr himself said numerous times, I'm not saying it was necessarily impermissible. I'm just saying that's what I'm saying.

SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: He's saying it's a big deal if the government is spying on a major political party candidate was it well predicated. We don't know. I'd be silly not to look at it. Really, I think that's the really dangerous thing that they see in Barr. He's making a very simple observation that nobody in the media and almost nobody in the Democratic Party has made for the last two years. That's a big deal. And you better have a really good reason before you spy on any major candidate of any party.

Can you imagine what the ACLU and all these organizations would have - they would have been screaming holy hell about it.

CARTER: And the New York Times and The Washington Post would have won Pulitzers because they would have put all their money into investigating why the Bush campaign was spying. But all we need to do is look at right now Laura. There is good reason for William Barr, for the Attorney General to say these things. He obviously has more information than we do. We've been reporting on this John Solomon and I starting back over two and a half years ago with the expansion of authorities under the Obama administration that allowed people within the intelligence community to spy at an enormous rate. Now some of that was legalized because they expanded it. But he's going to take a hard look at a political campaign that was given no defensive briefing that was approached by a ...

He also is doing the exact opposite of what Jeff Sessions did. Jeff Sessions was recused. Attorney General Barr is completely embedded. So, he should recuse Sara quickly.
CARTER: Oh! Absolutely not. I mean look Eric Swalwell is just grasping at straws trying to find something to say, it's complete hyperbole. It's ridiculous. And I don't think Barr is at all threatened by ...

He was a partner in my old law firm Skadden Arps for hiding information related to foreign lobbying work for Ukraine. Ukraine has been in the news a lot. They stem from what they found out various issues Sol in the Mueller investigation. But the MSNBC Justice and Security Analyst Matt Miller has some questions.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MATT MILLER, MSNBC JUSTICE AND SECURITY ANALYST: I don't know whether the charges against Greg Craig are justified or not. There's something fishy about the way the Justice Department brought this case that they still have yet to explain why they brought this case after one office declined to bring it. They haven't yet to give it. And I think without that it does raise questions over whether the prosecution is political or not.

So, I would want to look. They certainly weren't sending a signal that they thought this was something they were enforcing. I wouldn't want to look ...

CARLTON REEVES, DISTRICT COURT JUDGE: When politicians attack the courts is dangerous, political and guilty of egregious overreach. You can hear the claims lawyers assailing officers of the court across the south when the executive branch calls out courts and they'll work stupid, horrible, ridiculous, incompetent, a laughingstock and a complete and total disgrace.

INGRAHAM: Sara, Obama appointee Code of Conduct for U.S. judges not supposed to be involved in politics. There is a slight exception for it. If the judiciary is being persecuted, I guess that's what he would be hanging on.
CARTER: Yes, correct. But I mean think about this. Think about how these enormous attacks on President Trump and then coming from a judge, right. We're just crossing every line. I mean I don't know how you feel about this. But to me it just crosses the line. It shows what's been happening in the United States. And I personally think that there is something that needs to be done about ...
INGRAHAM: Can't get into politics as a judge, can't do it.
WISENBERG: Well, I haven't seen the whole context of it, and I don't - of the President's criticisms of the judiciary, so I'd like to hear the whole thing.
INGRAHAM: So, the executive branch when it's stymied time after again by one or two federal district court judges can't have a comment on it. Federal policy, you can comment on it.

CARTER: But a lot of judges now have been creating policy, not just judging.
INGRAHAM: It's not an imperial judiciary either. I don't like these judges getting into politics, but you know we'll be respectful of the courts I think that's a fair point. All right. My next guest says the Democrats obsession and thank you two. I don't even say, thank you. How rude on a Friday night. Session over investigating Trump and his administration will actually hurt them. He says it reminds me of 2002 and 2010 elections that saw Democrats obsessing over what, Enron. Remember the financial crisis media guru pollster Frank Luntz is next.

INGRAHAM: Now media guru pollster Frank Luntz joins us now. Frank both of your examples where midterms you know this voter weariness over these investigations during a Presidential election. Could the same dynamic be at play?
FRANK LUNTZ, AMERICAN CONSULTANT: I think it may be. Look voters want people in Washington to be their voice and they want the people in Washington to hold businesses accountable if they do something illegal, they do something wrong. And they appreciated early in those election cycles the Democrats for holding Enron accountable and for holding the banks and the real estate companies and all those involved in the meltdown of 2008, 2009.
But what happens is if you go too far. If you look like you're trying to score political points if you're trying to get yourself elected off the backs of the pain that the American people feel not only don't, they like that but they end up punishing the party who seems to be doing it. In 2002, the Democrats had a six-point generic ballot lead with eight weeks to go and they lost it. In 2010, they had a seven-point lead with 90 days to go and they lost that one as well. In the end voters will punish politicians who seem to be scoring political points when people are suffering.
INGRAHAM: Well and I think now people are doing better. You know that's pretty by all accounts it's a pretty good time if you're if you want to work you probably be able to get a job, probably have a little bit more money in your pocket. People are pretty optimistic about the economy. And it's interesting Frank because The Washington Post ABC did a poll. Here's the poll question, do you think Democrats will go too far investigating Trump or not far enough go too far, 46, percent not go far enough, 17 percent.
LUNTZ: It's happening then that's should be the wakeup call. They left town to do their retreat. And it's interesting because today is the 100th day of the Democratic Congress. Can you name one accomplishment in the first 100 days. Go back to 1994, the Republicans passed 10 solid pieces of legislation. They never went home. They did their job. Democrats are now on a two-week recess, a two-week vacation.
They go to a resort area and they talk about all the things that they haven't done. And that polling data is obvious but there is also a warning for the Republicans which is not to become complacent and to remember that in the end they were elected to be the voice of the people. And they have that responsibility in what they do.

INGRAHAM: Yes, Frank I thought the image yesterday we pointed out in “The Angle” of Trump with the hardhats in Texas. The oil workers and the ranchers and then the Democrats with John Legend and Chrissy Teigen who are trashing in the most disgusting way the President. And it was like hanging out with the elites, doing yoga sessions in the afternoon and then Trump with the blue-collar workers. I thought it was a great - I thought that study in contrast I think was pretty powerful.
LUNTZ: Well, you raise an important point which is that the visual is as important as what is said. And if the Democrats think that hanging out at expensive resorts and laughing about what's going on in Washington is going to get them elected, they're wrong. The American people still expect Washington to do its job. Expect them to work hard. To get results that that they can measure. Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: All right, Frank. Frank, thanks so much. Frank Luntz here on “The Ingraham Angle.” And up next. Democrats were Mad Maxine Waters and Jerry Nadler spent the better part of the week embarrassing themselves during committee hearings. I know you didn't see them. Don't worry. We watched for you. The segment called Hearing Slade. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right with committee hearings all week, it was like from beginning to end. Yes. We took the time to highlight some of the Democrats, sorry most pathetic attempts at trapping conservatives and we have a new segment, we're calling it, Hearing Slade. Get it. And here with me to help break it all down Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union. He says it's a bad pun. And Virginia State Rep. Mark Levine. It's great to have you on, both of you. Now let's start with Mad Maxine. OK. This is just two of the most embarrassing exchanges she had. And I'm just talking in the last week.

MNUCHIN: Can you clarify that for me.
WATERS: If you wish to leave, you may. What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan debt? Who would like to answer first?

MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: Bahrain.
INGRAHAM: Bahrain was waiting and waiting. OK.
SCHLAPP: I have never seen a Secretary of the Treasury be put in time out before. He has to raise his hand if he wants to go the bathroom. It was completely absurd.

LEVINE: Right.

INGRAHAM: No props. If she can't remember the statute.
LEVINE: No, I know the statutes.
INGRAHAM: OK. Well, guess what, if you think Americans are going to vote on Donald Trump's tax reform, I want you to go to his ...
LEVINE: But I think we're going to vote on law whether they obey the law or not. And Republicans wants to agree with law abiding.
INGRAHAM: Maxine Waters embarrassing in that clip about the student lending. I mean if you're a junior associate at your law firm did that, you'd be like wait a second. Where did you go to law school?
LEVINE: But if you're a junior associate at a law firm said, we don't have to follow the tax code.
SCHLAPP: I'm with Bill Barr on this one.
LEVINE: Mnuchin could go to jail for six years. That's actually much more closer.
INGRAHAM: All right. Well, I have a feeling Mnuchin is not going to go to jail for six years, but Mad Maxine wasn't the only one with no idea about what falls under the purview of the particular person they were questioning.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We tried to base our answer on the law. If you think it's such an outrageous position you have nothing to worry about. Let the courts do their job.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm dismayed to hear that you're willing to drive our health care system off the cliff with no plan for replacing it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that your premise that the Justice Department makes health care policy is simply wrong. We take legal positions and cases.

INGRAHAM: Now Mark you have to admit, this is strange. He didn't have Alex Azar, HHS Secretary up there. He didn't have the White House Chief of Staff up there. Maybe in the lobby. He had the Attorney General of the United States. Well, you're going to push grandma off the cliff. He's like what. I took a position that the administration agrees on that they want to take.
LEVINE: The question is whether they're going to enforce the law.
INGRAHAM: He's not the HSS Secretary.
LEVINE: No, but he's the Attorney General.
INGRAHAM: But it's a composition that the administration itself jointly comes to.
LEVINE: Right. But the Supreme Court was very clear. You may not like it. The Affordable Care Act is constitutional. And he's got to obey it. All of this is about lawless.
SCHLAPP: No, it's not.
LEVINE: This is about whether Republicans under Trump.
SCHLAPP: Jump real fast what this is about is the idea that Obamacare does not stand because the Congress legally pulled out the individual mandate. That's what the question.
INGRAHAM: No one can follow this conversation. It's too confusing. But he doesn't run health care policy. That's the point that I want to - and I think he said that.
SCHLAPP: That's right.
INGRAHAM: Not to say they can't ask questions. All right. This was Congressman Mazie Hirono's other half in Hawaii. What's his name Brian Schatz. I always forget his name because Senator Schatz. All right. This is a Q&A that we also watched. Check it out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the word spying could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out and I think it's necessary for you to be precise with your language here you normally are. And I want to give you a chance to be especially precise here.
BRIAN SCHATZ, SENATOR: I'm not sure of all the connotations of that word that you're referring to, but unauthorized surveillance. I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Thank you.
SCHATZ: Is that more appropriate in your mind?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Is it OK to say unauthorized surveillance.
LEVINE: It was authorized surveillance.
INGRAHAM: Is it OK to say unauthorized surveillance.
SCHLAPP: And spying is OK too.
INGRAHAM: All right. All right, panel, thank you so much. A holy or unholy Friday Follies next with Raymond Arroyo.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for a holy, or is it an unholy edition of Friday Follies? Mayor Pete takes a swipe at Vice President Pence Mike Pence, the Pope bows, and Louis Farrakhan ruins a rapper's funeral?
Joining us now with all the details is Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor, "New York Times" bestselling author of the brand new book, "Will Wilder, The Amulet of Power." All right, Raymond, Pete Buttigieg making a lot of headlines, raising a lot of money. I think he's basically number two now in Iowa. He's a force to be reckoned with. He's really, like, poking at the vice president. What's going on with that?
RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, this is part of a deliberate strategy, Laura, and probably an unwise one. For the last few weeks the Democratic golden boy has been engaged in a faith feud with V.P. Mike Pence. Buttigieg has repeatedly questioned the vice president's faith. Yesterday in an interview with CNN Pence responded.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: I hope that will Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the president.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He argues that your quarrel is with him as a gay man and that he says I was born this way.
PENCE: I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment. All of us in this country have the right to our religious beliefs.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Basically the vice president is saying people have a diversity of beliefs, and stop questioning my faith since I've not questioned yours. But Buttigieg won't let go, Laura. He hit the Vice President Pence again on "Ellen" today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not critical of his faith. I'm critical of bad policies. I don't have a problem with religion. I'm religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people, and especially in the LGBTQ community.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: That is not entirely true. When Mayor Pete started this religious crusade against Pence, it was not focused on LGBT issue, but it was a kind of ideologically infused puritanism. He challenged Mike Pence's character. Remember this?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: His interpretation of scripture is pretty different from mine to begin with. It is about protecting the stranger and the prisoner and the poor person.
How could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Then later he would go on to call the Mike Pences of the world to account for their unwillingness to accept him. But this is not about rights, Laura. This is about a small town mayor trying to break from the pack, distinguish himself from the crowd, and I think a vain attempt to reclaim religion for a party that has let it languish and disparage it for too many years.
INGRAHAM: I would say, as a political analyst, if I were consulting with Buttigieg, I would say definitely make yourself stand out. It's a big crowd. I'm not sure the social issues is going to work for the Democrats. When the social issues come to the fore, when they're brought to the fore, they usually end up helping Republicans, I think. I think it's a little, Mike Pence is about the most innocuous, nicest person.
ARROYO: Likeable guy.
INGRAHAM: Is he out there talking about LGBT issues?
ARROYO: It puts Buttigieg in the position of being a judgmental, rather puritan, virtue signaling guy who is judging someone else for his faith --
INGRAHAM: Tell me what you think about this.
ARROYO: -- unless you do what I do. And you just mentioned the social issues, Laura. In South Bend, he has got a problem. There was with a crisis pregnancy center that wanted to open up near an abortion clinic, he shut it down, Buttigieg did.
INGRAHAM: What about those religious guides. I guess that is OK in the Episcopalian faith, I guess.
ARROYO: This is the tension. This is the tension between religious liberty and other rights that are making a claim here.
INGRAHAM: The question is should people be able to have their religious beliefs? Is he going to go through the list of Muslims, of orthodox Jews, of others who have a certain set of beliefs that might not be copasetic with what Ellen and he believes?
ARROYO: When he announces on Palm Sunday.
OK, we've got to talk about Pope Francis for a moment. Yesterday at the Vatican the 82-year-old Pope hosted a group of South Sudanese leaders who have been locked in a civil war since 2011. To drive home his plea for peace in a surprise move, the Pope got down on his hands and knees, Laura, to kiss the feet of four South Sudanese leaders. You can hear him heaving really heavily here.
Remember, the Pope only has one functioning lung. Some have praised the humility of this gesture, it's power. Others have questioned it. They say it's an act of submission to political leaders and it could be interpreted by some, particularly Muslims on the ground in Sudan as an act of submission. I'm not sure I'm buying that interpretation. It is a rather dramatic gesture.
INGRAHAM: Well, it's supposed to be he's showing that he's, Christ came to be a servant.
ARROYO: And humble.
INGRAHAM: Humility, he's in servitude to man.
ARROYO: Right.
INGRAHAM: I have got to say, does it become showy? He seemed to not like anyone kissing his ring, remember that?
ARROYO: Right.
INGRAHAM: He did the ring kissing deal.
ARROYO: Now he's kissing feet. But Laura, 400,000 dead in South Sudan, so it's a big challenge.
INGRAHAM: So maybe that will inspire people to get along, maybe.
Yesterday in L.A. thousands lined the streets to say goodbye to rapper Nipsey Hussle. This dear artist recently released a song called "FDT," F Donald Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- Donald Trump, yes -- Donald Trump. Yes, yes -- Donald Trump. -- Donald Trump. -- Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's a very creative refrain.
ARROYO: Very catchy. Irving Berlin, look out.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: It all began and ended with Irving Berlin for you, didn't it?
ARROYO: Yes.
INGRAHAM: So the refrain, the chorus that goes on and on, is that related to the lowest unemployment ever, basically, for African-Americans?
ARROYO: But at Hussle's funeral, Laura, the less than holy religious figure Louis Farrakhan rose to offer a reflection.
INGRAHAM: This is nice.
ARROYO: It's always a good idea before you give a eulogy to know the name of the deceased. That helps. Which in this case was Nipsey Hussle.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The spiritual life of Nipsey Russell.
I thank Nipsey Russell. I said it right.
(LAUGHTER)
FARRAKHAN: Russell.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: For those who might not remember, there was a '70s comedian, Nipsey Russell.
INGRAHAM: I love him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young people are very different today. And there's one sure way to know. Kids used to ask where they came from. Now they'll tell you where you can go.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh my God, was that "Match Game"?
ARROYO: It was "Match Game."
INGRAHAM: My grandmother loved that.
ARROYO: Brett Somers come on down.
INGRAHAM: Wasn't he on "Hollywood Squares," and on "The Love Boat"?
ARROYO: I have to say, after that, I love Nipsey Russell. Nipsey Hussle, may he rest in peace.
INGRAHAM: God bless.
Up next, after passing a bill that essentially legalizes infanticide, what would you think the New York Assembly, you couldn't sink any lower if you were they. Now they're giving benefits to illegals that veterans' families are denied. I cannot believe this, you won't either, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Just how destructive can one state assembly be? In New York just over two months after celebrating their abortion expansion law, otherwise known as yay infanticide, New York Democrats just voted to block a provision that would extend additional college financial aid for Gold Star families. And if it wasn't disgusting enough, this vote came right after the same body approved millions in tuition assistance for, you got it, illegal aliens.
Joining me is New York Republican State Senator Robert Ortt. Senator, what's your message to the country after what your colleagues on the left did? It's an insult to American veterans and American military families nationwide.
ROBERT ORTT, R-N.Y., STATE SENATOR: I think the message is New York should act as a warning to the rest of the country of what will happen if the Democrats take over all levels of power of the federal government in 2020, because they own everything here in New York, the Senate, the Assembly, and of course the governor's office. And this is what you get. You get priorities, I would say show me your budget, I'll show you your priorities -- $27 million, as you mentioned, for so the-called Dream Act to provide tuition assistance to illegal aliens, people who are here who have broken our immigration laws. And at the same time, they killed this bill which would have expanded access to the families, to the children of fallen servicemembers.
If that isn't an inversion of what is right and good, I don't know what is. So it really is a message to I think the people who are watching out there that this is what the Democrats, the regressives will do if they get control of the U.S. government.
INGRAHAM: Both coasts were represented in this just obscene, radical thinking. California, if it moves tax it. Pushing the pot deal, the pot legal, all of the stuff in New York is basically becoming a mirror image. And this is what -- this is where we're going. It's open borders, rewarding lawlessness, and penalizing the hardworking people, families who don't make a lot of money, whose father or mother paid the ultimate price for our freedom. They don't care.
I got to show something. This is from a New York congresswoman trying to defend all this, Deborah Glick. She's the chair of the committee that blocked the bill. She calls criticism of her basically a cheap shot. "The bill -- though laudable -- had a budgetary impact which the committee routinely doesn't consider post budget. We did promise to see funding in the future that considers potential additional eligible individuals. Cheap shot." Is it a cheap shot, they're going to take this under advisement later on? So why are you making a big deal?
ORTT: This isn't a cheap shot at all. I think it's really rich that Congresswoman Glick and other Democrats, suddenly they're fiscal conservatives, suddenly they're concerned about the taxpayer and additional dollars spent. They just increased taxes by over $1 billion in the budget that was adopted April 1st. We were one of the highest tax states in the country. And they gave away $27 million tax dollars to folks who have broken our immigration laws and who are here in this state illegally. And yet when it comes to people who have given the ultimate sacrifices --
INGRAHAM: I don't know. It's too much money, costs too much.
ORTT: -- and their families who bear the price, this is too much money. We need to hold the line and be fiscally conservative. That's really rich.
INGRAHAM: The costs of freedom. Freedom costs something, doesn't it?
This is what NBC 2 Buffalo pointed out, "providing free tuition for Gold Star children would not cost nearly as much as providing the same for tens of thousands of eligible Dreamers who will now be provided financial assistance to attend college by the state."
ORTT: That's right.
INGRAHAM: So, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the cost would be for college assistance? Again, what's up is down, what's right is left. Everything has gone completely off the rails crazy if this is what New York stands for. I remember, I love New York, I used to wear one of those t- shirts. Not so much after infanticide and this. Close it out, senator.
ORTT: No, you're 100 percent right, Laura. This really is a complete inversion, it's like Bizarro World, what is right is left, what is up is down. And basically you said it. If you are a hardworking, taxpaying New Yorker, if you served in the military, if you're in law enforcement, you are not a priority. If you're a criminal --
INGRAHAM: Why are you voting for this? New York, why are you voting for this? Why is this helping your state or doing anything to advance common sense principles of fiscal responsibility and fairness? Senator, thank you so much.
ORTT: Thank you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: And by the way, speaking of radicalism, a pro-choice college student, I like to say proabortion rights activist, says babies who survive abortion shouldn't get healthcare. But who does she actually say does deserve it? We'll tell you, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Well, you have been watching this show, you know that college campuses are worse than ever when it comes to free expression and real tolerance, especially the tolerance for views that are right to life. Well, take this exchange between a student at Boston College and Kristan Hawkins, president of students for life.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KRISTAN HAWKINS, STUDENTS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA: Do you think that the children that are apprehended at the border that are in U.S. government care, do you think, like, babies who are going to die should be resuscitated and be given care?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
HAWKINS: Do you believe that, like, a baby who's born alive during abortion at a Planned Parenthood should get care?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Kristan Hawkins. Kristan, you travel the country visiting college campuses, talking to students. You really kind of pointed out the -- illogical thinking is one thing. It's sad, it's funny in a way, but it's very sad. What happened next after that exchange?
KRISTAN HAWKINS, STUDENTS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA: I actually asked her why she didn't believe that babies who are born alive during a failed abortion should be allowed to live. She said, well, we've already determined it's not a baby. And then she went on to say, I know you said science, but. And so what she pointed out was the cognitive dissonance we see all the time on college campuses across the country. And I don't know whether or not I changed her mind, but I know she certainly changed the minds of a lot of pro-choice students who actually came to the event to protest me. I got to see their eyes light up when she pointed out the leftist hypocrisy on this issue.
INGRAHAM: So again, for people who missed it, you asked about children at the border, should they be helped, should they be cared for, infants, yes. A baby who is born despite an attempt to abort the baby, no. But it's reflexive, is it not? It's not like there's some deep moment of reflection. It's reflexive.
HAWKINS: That's right. This is exactly, they're just repeating the talking points that they hear. And when it comes out of their mouth and you force the other side to actually say what it is they're advocating for, it changes the minds of everyone who is listening because they realize, this doesn't make sense. This is illogical. Your humanity shouldn't be determined by the location of your delivery room.
INGRAHAM: Isn't this what happened, you were at UCLA's campus about a year ago. Tell us about that.
HAWKINS: Yes, I've been to UCLA, Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, all of these schools, Dartmouth.
INGRAHAM: Good for you.
HAWKINS: And we have this conversation. My tour is called "The Lies that Feminists Tell." I just tell women, you are being lied to by the abortion lobby that tells you, you have to pay somebody else to commit an act of violence against somebody weaker than you in order for you to live your life as you see fit. And that's wrong. That's actually anti-feminist.
INGRAHAM: And what is the reaction from, is there -- you're brave to be doing this. You're a brave person. I just want to salute you for doing this, because I think a lot of young women, I say this on the radio show, when you're in your 20s, especially when I was in my 20s, it wasn't an issue. But now, with the help of science, digital science techniques, you can see inside the womb, now it's a person. We were all -- speaking as a former embryo, we all were.
HAWKINS: That's right. And millennials, the good news is, Laura, the majority of our generation are actually pro-life. We're the largest voting bloc now in America, and we reject those lies that the abortion industry tells us.
INGRAHAM: Are you seeing "Unplanned"? Did you see "Unplanned"?
HAWKINS: Absolutely, we sent thousands of students to see "Unplanned." We actually had a baby saved today in Indiana after students when and saw "Unplanned," went and prayed in front of Planned Parenthood and saved the life of a child.
INGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh. This is great. Every life is precious.
HAWKINS: That's right.
INGRAHAM: Thank you so much for joining us.
HAWKINS: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: And my final thoughts on a wild week, oh, my gosh, it's going get wilder next week, but wild week in Washington. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Attorney General Bill Barr, he started this week with a bang, and I'll bet he does the same thing next week. We expect the redacted Mueller report to be dropped either Monday or Tuesday. You know where to come for the best legal analysis. For every detail that matters, right here on “The Ingraham Angle,” we have the best legal experts, Constitutional lawyers, people who have done this before, written these types of reports, so you want to keep it locked right here.
And do not forget, get caught up on all my podcasts, you'll love it. Some people are coming up to me on the street, love the podcasts. Very easy. Go to PodcastOne or iTunes. You're going to have a blast. You'll laugh, learn all at the same time. America now and forever. And up next, Shannon Bream and the "Fox News @ Night" team, take it all from here.
