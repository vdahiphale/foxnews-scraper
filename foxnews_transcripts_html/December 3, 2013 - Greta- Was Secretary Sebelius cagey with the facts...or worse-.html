'Off the Record', 12/3/13: If Kathleen Sebelius was warned about the challenges of meeting the Oct. 1 HealthCare.gov launch deadline - and still misled a House Committee - she needs to be fired

Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. If this is true, what the House Committee says and if Secretary Sebelius has no good explanation, she needs to go.
Now, here's what I'm talking about. Yesterday, the House Subcommittee on Health announced Secretary Sebelius would testify on December 11th. In that committee press release announcing her testimony, it is reported that the committee just got documents that demonstrates that on April 4th, Secretary Sebelius was warned of the challenges made in the October 1st launch date. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Despite that warning, 14 days later, Secretary Sebelius testified before Congress that implementation of the website was, "on track." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On track, really? She got a warning 14 days earlier. Now, I confess I have seen some politically-motivated, cherry-picked press releases. If that press release is complete and accurate - and if Secretary Sebelius has no good explanation or even if it is half true - and she was simply being cagey and slippery with the facts in her testimony, she must go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Health care is not a hide-and-seek political game where we are simply their pawns. Health care is about life and death. If I were on that House committee, she would be on notice tonight that I would be grilling her on this, and I would give her a fair chance to explain it.
But if after Secretary Sebelius answered my questions and I thought she was being deceitful or just a bit cagey, I would tell her that's it, go. Spare us. Leave us alone while we try to sort out the serious issue of access to medical care. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
