HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  This is MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz. We'llget to Maria Bartiromo's exclusive interview with President Trump in just amoment. It took three long weeks when the president broke his post-electionsilence by returning to a favorite past time, mixing it up with reporters.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  If the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on November 14th,will you concede?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I -- it's  going to be avery hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud.UNKNOWN:  So if the Electoral College does elect President-Elect Joe Biden,are you not going to leave this building?TRUMP:  Certainly, I will. Certainly, I will, and you know that.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  When Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason kept pressing himabout the Electoral College, the president punched back.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)TRUMP:  Look, between you people -- don't talk to me that way. You're justa lightweight. Don't talk to me that -- I'm the president of the UnitedStates. Don't ever talk to the president that way.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  The media are largely celebrating Trump's decision tocooperate with a Joe Biden transition  without an actual concession. Butreaction on the right has been decidedly mixed.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  The 2020 presidential election was not fair. No honest personwould claim that it was fair. They rigged the election in front of all ofus. And nobody did anything about it.UNKNOWN:  Unless the legal situation changes in a dramatic and frankly anunlikely manner, Joe Biden will be inaugurated on January 20th. To say thisconstitutes living in reality. And if I offered you a false reality, if Itold you that there was an excellent phenomenal chance that the SupremeCourt was going to step in and deliver a victory to President Trump, Iwould be lying to you.UNKNOWN:  I don't get what my brothers and sisters in the media keepplaying to this. Who cares if Trump concedes? It's not in the law. It's atradition.UNKNOWN:  Imagine the democratic legitimacy crisis we would have been in ifTrump had flipped 60,000 votes in the right states and was about to beinaugurated, the president having lost by four points and over of sixmillion votes.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us to analyze the coverage, Ben Domenech,founder and publisher of the Federalist, in New York, Kennedy, whose FoxBusiness show is now back in business at 8:00 p.m. eastern, and ClarencePage, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune. Ben, Maria gave the presidentplenty of time, and the interview ended just a couple of minutes ago. Letme play a brief bit of it, and we'll ask you a question on the other side.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)TRUMP:  This election was over, and then they did dumps. They call themdumps, big massive dump. All of a sudden, I went from winning by a lot tolosing by a little.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  The president's talking about massive dumps. Those arethe mail-in ballots. He's talking about problems with voting machines. He'stalking about dead people voting. The challenge for the media is that inmore than 30 of case,  president's legal team has been unable to convincevarious federal judges and state judges that there was evidence ofsignificant fraud. What's your take on how this is playing out in thepress?BEN DOMENECH, THE FEDERALIST:  Well, i think that this is the presidentshifting from a largely legal strategy to a media strategy. You know, thefact that this morning he went on with Maria and made as strong of a casethat he could for his perspective on this, one that I think is to his pointearlier, to the clip you played, not going to change --(CROSSTALK)DOMENECH:  -- anything like that. I think that you're just going to be in asituation where, again and again, you are going to have these conflictsbetween the press and the president until he actually leaves office,because they've set up this whole scenario of him getting, like, bunkeredin or something like that in the White House in ways that I think werenever going to happen, but in ways that they, you know, have really playedup over the past several months, as the president acknowledged.He's going to leave if the Electoral College goes, as we all expect it to.And I anticipate that that's going to hatch, but it's not going to stop hiscriticism of the way this election played out.KURTZ:  And speaking of that, I'll play another clip for you Kennedy,president talking specifically about the press and the way that journalistshave covered his post-election battle. Roll it.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)TRUMP:  The media doesn't even want to cover it. I mean, you're doingsomething -- you're actually very brave because you're doing something --the media doesn't want to talk about it.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  So does Donald Trump have a point that the media don'twant to cover his allegations of massive fraud? Because it seems to me thatreporters have gone to the courthouses, they've covered these cases, andthen overall, it's gotten a lot of coverage. Your thoughts?LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Yes, and they havecovered the bigger aspects of some of the legal cases and the filings onbehalf of the president and his team. But what hasn't gotten enoughcoverage is the more than anecdotal cases of weirdness in certain states.And there are people who of feel, you know, perhaps disenfranchised becausethey hear stories.And I'm not talking about the Big Dominion, Hugo Chavez conspiracytheories. I'm talking about the lesser stories, perhaps in the affidavits.And maybe that doesn't add up to massive voter fraud, but it does requiresome investigation in particular states, and I hope investigativejournalists in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan really figure thisout.So there is confidence in their election system going forward for themidterms and four years from now.KURTZ:  It would be good to have such confidence. Clarence, Maria Bartiromosaid the allegations of fraud as laid out by the president are disgraceful.But as you know, and just to update our audience, last night, aPennsylvania Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the president's legalteam, saying no evidence of fraud.And before that, three judge appeals court panel in Philadelphia ruled noevidence of fraud. Three Republican judges, and the opinion was written bya Trump appointee. So what is the gist of the president's complaint aboutthe press right now?CLARENCE PAGE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Well, Howard, you'reright. As President Trump would say and everybody knows it, that there havebeen some 30 cases thrown out already. The only case that had any stickingpower was one in regard to how far back the judges were from the ballots,in terms of how many feet. That's not massive voting fraud.And that's what the president is alleging constantly, that there's thismassive fraud. What he is showing is that he definitely has a sense ofentitlement to an election victory, even if the votes don't back him up.And his supporters appreciate hearing that. It bolsters the idea that theirguy couldn't lose unless it was stolen from him. How that translates intohis political future, we will see.KURTZ:  OK. Ben, we showed some of the Thanksgiving news conference withreporters. It seemed like the press corps couldn't wait to get at PresidentTrump and vice versa, given the three weeks of no engagement. What's yourtake on how each side did at that press conference?DOMENECH:  Well, I think the journalists in that situation, you know, arevery cognizant of how much President Trump has boosted their personalcareers. Their interactions with him have become, you know, the stuff of,you know, viral memes and the like, and also have led to, you know,significant book and speaking contracts.They have a limited amount of time to really scrap it up with the presidentin this kind of context, and I think that they were trying to takeadvantage of that.KURTZ:  You're saying they're going to miss the guy --(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Kennedy, we saw the president snapping -- it was Jeff -- excuse me,Jeff Mason, Reuters correspondent for pressing him about the ElectoralCollege. He is a pretty mild-mannered guy. He doesn't ask prosecutorialquestions. Did you think that he deserved that tongue lashing?MONTGOMERY:  They both know what they're doing. And Ben is absolutelyright. This has become a cottage industry for reporters who covered thispresident. And, you know,  it's the Jim Acosta model. You don't have to belong on talent to really turn this into a lucrative career. But the windowfor both of them is closing.The president isn't going to be president for very long, and so he has toengage as much as he can and say, wait, I'm the president. And the press,they're not going to have access to Joe Biden the way they have with thispresident, so there's never going to be exchanges like that. It's going tobe very, very different and probably quite boring covering Joe Biden forthis press pool.So you've got to milk it while you can. It's like being an Instagram modelor a TikTok star. You may have a hundred million followers now, but nextweek you're going to be a hobo.KURTZ:  We'll come back to that in a second. But Clarence, one of thedilemmas for the media right now is it's a mixed message. On the one hand,it was just a few days ago the president unauthorized the GSA to go forwardwith the Biden transition. And at the same time on Twitter, in an interviewlike we just saw and at the news conference.He's insisting massive fraud, stolen election and all of that. We knowwhich one the press is giving greater weight to.PAGE:  It's not a dilemma for the media, Howard. The reporters cover thestory. They cover news. That's their job. It's what they've been doing.It's President Trump who has given so much color to the news conferencesetting that people tune in more, if you will. I think there's a ratingsrace. I mean, what were the questions they asked?If the Electoral College so rules, will you concede? If that happens, willyou announce your candidacy for 2024? What confidence will the voters have?These are ordinary questions. It's President Trump who gives the colorfulanswers, and that's what really counts here. That's the way journalismworks, and whether the media will remember President Trump or miss him.As I said on your show before, President Trumps is a medium. And he willcreate growth in the media on his own.KURTZ:  Ben, I take your point about there's something in it for both sidesduring this four -- actually six year battle between Donald Trump and thepress. From what we've seen in the post election period, do you have anyindication that the press is going to be even reasonably tough on JoeBiden, who does have a less confrontational style, shall we say.DOMENECH:  The biggest thing I learned about the incoming Bidenadministration this week is that they plan to have a pet in the WhiteHouse. I think that says a lot about the expectation that are built in herefor how the media will treat the --(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  -- let's stop right there. That's actually a good point. The NewYork Times and other outlets have stories today about a CBS Sunday morningexclusive that the Biden's will be getting a cat to join their dogs in theWhite House. What does that suggest to you?DOMENECH:  Well, it just suggests to me that this is going to be the tone.We're going to learn about Tony Blinken's ability with the guitar (ph).We're going to learn about how nice these folks are. We're not actuallygoing to learn about the policy questions that we never really got answersto during the course of this past elections because of all of therestrictions and because of the distance Joe Biden was allowed to have as acandidate.I think that unfortunately that's going to lead to even higher levels ofdistrust in the press as we move forward, if you can even imagine it,Howie. Because people really do want answers to basic things like what isthe Biden policy going to be when it comes to reopening schools, how is hegoing to go about in achieving that, is that even going to be a priorityfor them? Still, you know, major things that we don't know the answers to.KURTZ:  And on that point, Kennedy, we're a little short on time. I mean,Biden right now is not president, so the questions are necessarily aboutwhat will you do or what will you say. But after January 20th, don't youthink there going to be some toughening up on the part of the press corpsjust for their own self-preservation.MONTGOMERY:  I think there will be frustration. And you know, again, theNew York Times digital subscriptions are up 300 percent since 2016, so theyare going to miss miss him. But you have potentially a ton of warmongerswho are going to be a part of this administration, and the press reallyshould be asking questions about what this administration intends to dowith regimes like Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, and Libya, and Syria.And other parts of the world that Anthony Blinken has screwed up so far.And I don't care about how well he fingers the frets.KURTZ:  Fair enough. You know, just to give you an idea of the tone, CNN'sDana Bash this morning conducting an interview with a Republicans senator,said the president is undermining the democratic process, and one time thatmight have been a question, but now it's a statement. All right, let me geta break here. When we come back, the media uproar over the president'spardon of Michael Flynn, and later, we'll check in with Frank Luntz. Staywith us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Many pundits are apoplectic over President Trump's pardon ofMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser who had pleaded guiltyto lying to the FBI, and whose case Bill Barr's Justice Department tried todismiss. But others say Flynn has been railroaded.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  Roger Stone got his sentence commuted. Michael Flynn today got acomplete pardon, why? He fought it. He shut his mouth. He never saidanything about Trump.UNKNOWN:  At every step along the way, Donald Trump and his cronies misusedtheir power to help Michael Flynn escape justice time and time and timeagain.UNKNOWN:  This is great news. I know you feel the same way, because we knowhe was entrapped by a group of people out for a Trump scalp.UNKNOWN:  Flynn was treated differently. They wanted to catch him. Theywanted him to make a mistake. We are not a country with two justicesystems.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Ben Domenech, whether or not you think the FBI had astrong case against Mike Flynn, and he did plead guilty twice, the press isclearly characterizing this as a miscarriage of justice.DOMENECH:  Well, I do think that in this instance there's so much of astrong defense to make for Michael Flynn and the way that he was treated. Imean, if you actually just look at the facts of the case and theexperience, it was very clear that the FBI really didn't have any kind ofsurety that they had even caught him in a lie or that he even believed thathe was lying to them.This was a technicality that was used as the basis for an investigationthat obviously changed the course of Donald Trump's presidency. And I thinkthis is kind of a book end to that. But I want to give you just aperspective on the double standard that's involved. John Brennan, who is apaid media figure now, the former head of the CIA, is someone who we knowfor a fact spied on Congress, spied on elected representatives of theAmerican people over the torture report.And yet, he is allowed to just come and go, free of any kind oframifications for that. Mike Flynn gets put in the position that he's in,and there's just a completely different standard in terms of his treatment.I think that this is going to be a case people will look back to in thefuture and analyze in a lot of different ways as one that altered the caseof this presidency.And I think that's going to be something historic in terms of ourperspective on the double standard in which people are treated when caughtin technicalities.KURTZ:  All right. Well, Brennan is a cable news contributor. He would --and his allies would argue that he was conducting legitimate investigationsand not spying. But Clarence, there's no question that President Trump hasthe constitutional right to use his pardon power. But some of the punditswere saying, well, he's trying to protect himself against what Mike Flynnmight say.Sorry, the guys was national security adviser for 22 days. I mean, he wentthrough a long Russia investigation, because this all has to do with hisconversations with the former Russian ambassador. So does that have anyvalidity?PAGE:  Well, I'm one of those who says that the Russia investigation waslegitimate. It made sense. And Michael Flynn's behavior was highlyquestionable, and that -- as we can see, even he lied to try to cover itup, and that's what he was convicted for. I'm not losing any sleep overMichael Flynn. I think most people really care about what this has to sayabout who else President Trump may pardon.And these slow news days around Thanksgiving, yes, we are in a holidayweekend, aren't we. You asked a lot of questions about what's going tohappen in the future. And I think this says a lot about who Trump pardonsand why.KURTZ:  Well, let me get to Ben on that, because there's been a whole lotof media speculation when you include the president's commutation of RogerStone's sentence. Then next up, he's going to pardon Rick Gates, GeorgePapadopoulos, Paul Manafort, maybe Steve Bannon. Is there anything to basethat on? And if he did that, would that mar his image?DOMENECH:  The president has the capability to pardon, you know, anyonethat he wants. I actually don't think that we'll see as much of a wave ofpardons as some of the media has anticipated. But I remember being on thisnetwork four years ago right after President Obama, you know, pardoned theunrepentant terrorist, Oscar Lopez Rivera, someone who has never apologizedfor his crimes and for the murders that he helped inspire.And so, you know, from my perspective, these pardons always -- almostalways end up looking like black marks on people's records. You recall thatBill Clinton pardons as well. Though I do think that in this case, justgiven the momentous ramifications of this Flynn investigation on thepresidency, that it's going to have a little bit of a different context.KURTZ:  Well, Clarence, Ben has -- took it right off my question here,which is, you know, Bill Clinton on his last day in office pardoning thefugitive financier Mark Rich. George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger,and former national security adviser Robert McFarland, gotten caught up inthe Iran contra affair. It's not like modern presidents haven't done this.Donald Trump didn't exactly invent this practice.PAGE:  Well, I mean, the president's right to pardon is beyond question. Wecan talk about why the framers give him that right, but that right isbeyond question. What does it say about the legacy of the president? That'swhat we're really asking at a time like this when those pardons come down.And the big question with President Trump what nobody's mentioned is thatwill he pardon himself?KURTZ:  That's a legal can of worms. All right, unfortunately, we lost ourvideo connection to Kennedy. I want to thank her for being on the program.Thank you, guys, as well, Clarence, Ben. Up next, how the press is coveringthe COVID surge and the sharply different Trump and Biden approaches to thepandemic.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  The Coronavirus is continuing a rather chilling surge, with 2million new cases over a two-week period, and death rates starting toapproach the level of last spring, as high as 2,300 a day. But conservativecommentators say the country wouldn't be on the verge of approving at leasttwo new vaccines if not for President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  If Donald Trump had not put this in motion back in January, youcan only imagine where we would be at as we turn the corner into December.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Joe Biden made a soft spoken speech about his extendedfamily canceling their Thanksgiving plans, not the kind of presidentialaddress that journalists are accustomed to.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Those who have lost aloved one, I know that this time of year can be especially difficult.Believe me, I know. The federal government can't do this alone. Each of ushas a responsibility in our own lives to do what we can do.(END VIDEO TAPE)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us you now is Fox News correspondent, GriffJenkins. And Griff, that is a different kind of speech. Joe Biden didn'tattack anybody. He didn't have any sizzling soundbites. But some in thepress are questioning whether that kind of approach, that kind of plea tothe public, can really make much progress against this pandemic.GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we'll see. And you're right,Howie. It's not what you expect from an incoming president who might wantto project strength, but he's appealing to the emotions of fatiguedAmericans. And actually, if you covered Joe Biden in town halls during theprimaries, he did try to emotionally connect with crowds.He seems to be trying it in a national address. But if you follow thefacts, the country did see these massive spikes after the summer holidays,Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day. And so now, he's trying to, I guess,be honest that the worst is coming. We're in for rough days ahead. Andwhile people are tired of, quote, "hanging on."He's trying to get people to make sacrifices, and he's also got to dealwith some hypocrisy in the part of his own party, like, California'sGovernor Gavin Newsom, and Denver's Mayor, Michael Hancock, getting caughtin hypocritical failings to lead by example.KURTZ:  Right. They tell everybody to stay home, and then they get onairplanes and so forth. Look, I'll give President Trump a lot of credit forthe breakthrough of these Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Operation Warpspeed,because he would've gotten the blame if the whole thing got bogged down.But when the president in a Thanksgiving message said I encourage allAmericans to gather in homes and places of worship.Offer a prayer of thanks to God, that's against the CDC advice. And when Iask that question -- look, I understand why people want to see their familyor go to church or synagogue at this time of year.JENKINS:  Yeah. His progress on the vaccines, which we may see within amatter of weeks, runs contrary to his failed messaging on this. He'sconstantly undermined his own government's warnings and data. You saw thismorning, Howie, on the Sunday morning shows, on Fox News Sunday, SurgeonGeneral Jerome Adams saying it's going to get worse.And he's worried about how he handled it, Fauci, Birx, also out on othershows, trying to say that you've got to listen now to the medical expertsand the CDC that are recommending against traveling and gatherings in largenumbers.KURTZ:  Let me jump in. National Review editor, Rich Lowry, says there's acoming backlash once Biden takes office against all of the restrictions andcurfews and mask mandates and all that. That may be right. But if that'strue, wouldn't some of it be directed at some of the Republican governorsin states like Utah and North Dakota and Ohio, who are also cracking downtrying to beat COVID-19?JENKINS:  That's right. And look, if Thanksgiving was any indication of howthe messaging went south, just wait until you start telling people tocancel Christmas and that Santa's staying home this year. You're going tohave those Republican governors and Republican leaders in cities trying toget an honest, serious health -- you know, you're trying to protectpeople's health here, and they're going to have a tough job in doing that.KURTZ:  Yeah. The governors are on the frontlines, as we have learned.Griff Jenkins, great to see you. Have a happy holiday. Coming up, DonaldTrump says there's no way Joe Biden could have gotten 80 million votes.Frank Luntz on the post-election battle between the president and thepress.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ (on camera):  When President Trump was sparring with reporters andinsisting he actually won the election, he singled out one number astotally implausible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is not a candidate thatcould get 80 million votes. This is just not the candidate. This is not acandidate that beat Barack Hussein Obama with the black voter.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us now here in Washington, Frank Luntz, theveteran Republican pollster and, Frank, a White House official the otherday sent me a note saying POTUS one should read this article. It is a piecein The Federalist by J.B. Shurk saying journalists should be skeptical ifBiden got eight million votes, how did he perform so well in the suburbs.But is that so bizarre when President Trump got 74 million votes comparedto 62 million last time? FRANK LUNTZ, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER:  It's a responsibility of journalists tobe skeptical and to challenge the facts, to provide honest and accurateinformation. I think that once again, the media got it wrong.I want to read you a quote, because you may recognize it. They said thatdemocrats were a solid bet to hang on to the Senate. They said many of theraces were tight as a tick. So what did journalists have to say forthemselves now? Why are they so slavishly vetted to conventional wisdom?You know who wrote that, Howie. This is your quote from 2002. Not meant toshow you up. It's meant to show up your profession. I want you to know Ikeep your newspaper from 18 years ago. That's how much I respect you. Theygot it wrong. They got the polling wrong. They got it wrong.KURTZ:  Hardly the first time. Well, on that point, the Trump centric mediadon't seem to have focused very much this time around on the fact thatRepublicans did far better, particularly in the House, than anybody,pundits or just about anybody else had predicted. LUNTZ:  Well, this is my point. That they were predicting for KevinMcCarthy that he was going to lose 10 10 or 15 seats. In the end, he'sgoing to win 50, 60, maybe 70. He's going to be at least 212, maybe 213seats. That's a hair's breath away from control.If you look at the numbers over the last 40 years or so, in the firstelection of an off-year, Kevin McCarthy is actually more likely to becomespeaker if these Republicans learn how to work together, learn how tocooperate.But the key here, Howie, is that the press doesn't see it, they don't hearit, they did not see Trump's election in 2016, they did not see what washappening in the Senate in 2020, and they did not see what was happening inthe House.And my issue is that as a pollster, our job is to give accurate informationto the media so that they can then tell the story in a precise and pristineway. That's not happening.KURTZ:  OK.LUNTZ:  And it didn't happen again and it hasn't happened for decades.KURTZ:  Well, pollsters have had their own problems as we discussed. Andalso, the press didn't see Joe Biden winning the democratic nomination. Thepresident in his interview with Maria Bartiromo hit that, how Bidencouldn't have gotten 80 million votes, pretty hard.But let me ask you, many liberals have accused the president of underminingdemocracy. The Washington Post has a long piece today saying he's dupinghis supporters. Is that overheated on the part of the press or is it simplycovering the president's repeated and charges of a stolen election, a casethat he hasn't been able to successfully make yet in court? LUNTZ:  And that's the point right there, that he's not been able to makeit successfully in court. He has every right to make any claim he wants to.The media has every right to analyze that claim and report as what he issaying. And at a certain point, you accept the results. At a certain point,you have to move on.And I'm looking at the bigger picture. I'm looking at the percentage ofAmericans, which is right now over 50 percent. In Georgia, which is the keystate looking ahead, 54 percent of Trump voters think the election wasstolen.You go back to 2000, the last time something like this happened, there'sonly a third of Gore voters who thought the election was stolen. I'mconcerned that it is going to be impossible to promote, to unify, to findsome way to defend this democracy when you have this constant challenge ofit. It has every right to be made but if it fails --KURTZ:  So with all the president's tweets about a rigged election and allthe charges he has made and he did so with Maria, he's also going after NFLplayers who kneel, he's going after AOC and he's going after Fox News, butdo you think, therefore, if you're worried about the impact on futureconfidence in elections that the president ought to ease up on this or totake a different tone, leaving aside whether he concedes at all?LUNTZ:  It is not for me. I'm just a citizen. It's not for me to say --KURTZ:  You're expressing concern. You're expressing concern about voterconfidence in the fundamentals of American democracy. LUNTZ:  In a public way. I know what station I'm on. I know what viewersare watching. It's reasonably likely that Donald Trump is still watchingthis. I'm not asking him to stop. I am telling him to consider theramifications. I am telling him to consider the consequences, for in theend, far more important than the election of a single individual is thehealth and trust of the democratic processes.And I remind you, Howie, when people take an oath, they don't take an oathto the president, they take an oath to the Constitution, they take an oathto the system of government. It is not just about presidential elections.It's also about our faith and trust in freedom.And, yes, I am afraid that that is being worn away by what has happenedover the last few weeks, and quite frankly what happened in the weeksbefore the election.KURTZ:  Frank, one last question. We're a little short on time. There havebeen a number of media reports about the president telling his confidantsthat yes, he knows he will probably have to leave on January 20th, but thata lot of this messaging about stolen elections is really about the nextfour years, whether he runs again in 2024.In other words, trying to maintain a strong, enthusiastic support among thepeople who -- which is nearly half the country who support him. What do youthink about that? LUNTZ:  I think that that would be so cynical and so horrible. And if thatis the case, then it is his responsibility. I would assume that that is notthe case. I would assume -- I take the president at his word.But if that is the case, deliberately upsetting and angering a significantsegment of the population for your own benefit, then that needs to beexposed and people need to be held accountable.KURTZ:  Well, we don't know exactly what's going to happen. I think it'sfair to say that whether he's in or out of office, President Trump will bea major media figure for some time to come. He knows how to command themedia's attention.It is always good to see you, Frank Luntz. Thanks very much for joining us.LUNTZ:  Thank you.KURTZ:  After the break, the media heaping praise on Joe Biden's earlycabinet picks and his first post-election interview you with Lester Holt.Is he getting kid gloves treatment?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ (on camera):  The media verdict on Joe Biden's initial cabinet picksis that they're somewhat boring and predictable collection of Washingtoninsiders, but they're drawing lots of praise for their knowledge andexperience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST:  It does mean the return of competence, itdoes mean the return of decency, and it does mean the return of humanity tothe White House. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST:  He's found very, very bright people who are alsovery experienced and who are also very creative and flexible about the waythey think. JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  If Trump appoints somebody that he knowsreally well, the media calls him a Trump loyalist. But if Biden appointssomeone he knows really well, oh, it's a long-time advisor, a very closeconfidant. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  If you look at the backgrounds where almosteveryone Biden says he plans to hire, these people are lobbyists. They'reconsultant. They are shills for this big multinational, that bigmultinational.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Gayle Trotter,who hosts the Right in DC podcast, and Mara Liasson, NPR's nationalpolitical reporter and a Fox News contributor.Gayle, in terms of this early praise and regardless of what you think ofthe policies of these people, the real media message seems to be or do youagree with this, they're experienced, they're seasoned, and they'rebringing normalcy back after years of Trump being in chaos. GAYLE TROTTER, COMMENTATOR, HOST OF "RIGHT IN DC" PODCAST:  The mediacoverage, as you said, seems to be flattering and positive. They seem tolike Biden's picks. They keep emphasizing the fact that they have longrecords of public service and expertise.But I think the media like Biden's picks but they're not in love withBiden's picks. They reflect the far-left sentiment that they would like tosee Biden picking more people from the left for his cabinet.And I think you can see the contrast in the coverage of Biden's supposedcabinet picks compared to Donald Trump's cabinet picks or the mediacoverage then was skeptical and negative. So we've got flattering andpositive of Biden's picks, when Donald Trump did not get the sametreatment, his picks were --KURTZ:  Right.TROTTER:  -- they were skeptical of them and negative.KURTZ:  I think you make a fair point that the left isn't in love withthese initial nominees. Mara, whether it's Tony Blinken for secretary ofstate or Jake Sullivan or Janet Yellen or John Kerry, you're talking to(INAUDIBLE) these people don't have plenty of experience.What about the clip we heard from Jesse Watters saying, you know, Trump'speople were loyalists when he knew them through his previous life --MARA LIASSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR NPR: Yeah.KURTZ:  -- and Biden's are just confidants. LIASSON:  Yeah. Well, first of all, when you talk about how the mediatreated them, certainly Fox treated Trump's picks more kindly than MSNBCdid and now vice versa.However, when you think back to the people that Trump picked in 2016, 2017,yes, some of them were people he knew for a long time, but other people,Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson, interesting outside pick, lots of experience, heknew Vladimir Putin, Jeff Sessions, certainly qualified, regardless of whatyou think about his politics to run the Department of Justice. Andremember, the adults in the room, John Kelly.So I think that the reaction to the cabinet of Trump and Biden has beenmixed from the media. It hasn't been all one thing. But there's no doubtthat the transition itself is being covered differently because thetransitions are so different. One was chaotic, one threw out all the workthat Chris Christie did, and the other one is plotting and what we wouldcall more normal.KURTZ (on camera):  Interesting that Tony Blinken was CNN's global affairsanalyst, a number of people at MSNBC now leaving that network contributorsto join the Biden transition. Biden did his first post-election interviewwith NBC nightly news anchor Lester Hold. Let's take a look at some ofthat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESTER HOLT, NBC ANCHOR:  This lineup, those you selected so far, a lot offamiliar faces among them. What do you say to those who are wondering ifyou're trying to create a third Obama term? JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is not a third Obamaterm because we face a totally different world than we faced in theObama/Biden administration.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Gayle, Joe Biden gets a lot of softballs from reportersbut did Lester Holt at least press him on a couple of things?TROTTER:  This interview is a perfect example of my earlier point. LesterHolt was asking him things like are you going to appoint far leftists likeElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Biden demurred.Lester Holt asked Joe Biden if he was going to pursue investigations at thefederal level against Donald Trump, and Biden deflected that and he said heswipe to try Trump and then he said that the state investigations willcontinue.And I think this interview by Lester Holt shows that the mainstream mediadoes not love Biden's picks and they're egging him on to the left. Andyou're going to see that continue because this is just the first group ofpotential cabinet members.KURTZ:  Right.TROTTER:  So we're going to see more pressure from the mainstream media forthis.KURTZ (on camera):  Yeah, egging him on could also be looking for conflict,which is what we in the press do. You mentioned the question about whatwould happen to Donald Trump after the election. Let's play this othersound bite from the Holt interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOLT:  Some Democrats want investigations to go forward against PresidentTrump after he leaves office. Do you support that? BIDEN:  I will not do what this president does and use the JusticeDepartment as my vehicle to insist that something happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Mara, that was a terrific question because there aresome liberal commentators and democrats who, like, Donald Trump must bebrought to justice and Biden had to figure out how to handle that. LIASSON:  Yeah. I mean, the message from Biden on this question is theDepartment of Justice is going to be independent and not going tointerfere. On the other hand, the rest of the answer that you just playedat the top of was how the state prosecutions or something that he hasabsolutely no control over.It doesn't sound like Joe Biden has a big appetite for having the federalgovernment prosecute Donald Trump.KURTZ:  Gayle, I've got 20 seconds for you to chime in on this. TROTTER:  Well, after railroading General Flynn, who was granted a fullpardon this week, thankfully, I can see that Biden would like to stay outof railroading people and using the FBI and the Justice Department totarget enemies. So I think that's a good choice.KURTZ:  All right. Gayle Trotter and Mara Liasson, great to see you. HappyThanksgiving. Appreciate you being here.TROTTER:  Happy Thanksgiving.KURTZ:  Still to come, Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo -- thank you --actually agreed on something. Cuomo and Trump, and it involves the press.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ (on camera):  Fox News has settled a lawsuit by the parents of SethRich, a young DNC staffer who was tragically killed in Washington fouryears ago in what police believe was a failed robbery.Joel and Mary rich say they are pleased with the undisclosed terms -- quote-- "The settlement with Fox News closes another chapter in our efforts tomourn the murder of our beloved Seth, whom we miss every single day."Fox said in a statement, we are pleased with the resolution of the claimsand hope this enables Mr. and Mrs. Rich to find a small degree of peace andsolace moving forward.Fox said in an online article, which was later retracted for not gettingproper editorial scrutiny and not meeting the network's standards, theinvestigators believe Rich was killed because he was somehow involved inthe Wikileaks hacking of Democratic e-mails.The family had also asked Sean Hannity to stop raising questions abouttheir son's death and he said he would stop talking about it afterreceiving their heartfelt note. There was no evidence for this conspiracytheory and hopefully this closes a very sad episode.The New York Times ran a piece on Jared and Ivanka being unlikely to returnto Manhattan. Instead, instead expanding a home they have on thepresident's Bedminster gold course.The headline -- the end of President Trump's time in office leaves hisdaughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well-to-dorefugees but they appear to have plans in New Jersey.The Times then deleted the phrase well-to-do refugees after online criticssaid that should refer only to refugees fleeing their countries andsometimes not welcome by the administration.But why are so many snarky stories being done and written about Jared andIvanka? It was a dumb headline and they are fair game for criticism as topWhite House officials, but too many pundits are revelling in their D.C.departure. Times columnist Frank Bruni said maybe they should go live inNorth Korea or Saudi Arabia. Come on.YouTube has suspended the One America News Network for a week for breachingits policy against posting misinformation about the pandemic. The Google-owned video service penalized OAN for describing a COVID treatment as acure for the disease and barred the network from making money on itsexisting videos, though OAN can reapply for that program.Now get this. Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump would seem to have very littlein common other than growing up in Queens. But it turns out that New York'sDemocratic governor also has a rather dim view of the media, saying they'retaking on a nastier and disrespectful tone with some journalists asking --quote -- "really biased questions." This after Cuomo chastised reporters ata recent briefing.Here's what he told radio station WAMC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY) (voice-over):  The way they question PresidentTrump at some of these press conferences is just -- I've never heard thattone. There's supposed to be decorum to the institution. If anyone used thetone that they use with me in some of these press conferences -- if you didwith my old man, you'd be lucky if he didn't walk around and deck you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ (on camera):  Well, I knew Mario Cuomo. I don't think he actuallypunched any press people. But it sounds like Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trumpmight enjoy commiserating about their media antagonists. Neither one rightis now happy with their press corp.That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz. I hope you'rehaving a great Thanksgiving weekend.
