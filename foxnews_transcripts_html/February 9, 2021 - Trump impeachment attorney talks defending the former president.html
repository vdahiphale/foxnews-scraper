SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  To catch a star, that's all there is to it.CARLSON:  That's good.HANNITY:  A hundred percent.All right. Tucker, thank you.Welcome to HANNITY.Here we go again for the second time in as many years, actually, twoFebruarys in a row, Democrats are conducting a show trial in the U.S.Senate to impeach and convict Donald J. Trump who is president in exileaccording to Jim Acosta.And while the first unsuccessful charade was pretty terrible, the sequel iseven worse.Now, coming up tonight, we have a lot of analysis. We'll get reaction.Donald Trump Jr. is here. Senator Ted Cruz is here. The president'sattorney, David Schoen -- had a great day today in my opinion -- he willjoin us for an exclusive interview.First, I would like to start and lay out the arguments that I think I wouldmake if I was there.Now, today, the U.S. Senate kicked off what could be a lengthy, dramaticSenate trial against the former president. It all means absolutely nothing.We can start there as the outcome is already predetermined because we knowPresident Trump will be acquitted. You need two-thirds of the U.S. Senateto convict, 44 senators now have already voted twice to stop the proceedingbecause it is unconstitutional for the Senate to convict a private citizen.And, by the way, they don't even have jurisdiction on a private citizen.You cannot remove somebody from an office they no longer hold.Now, what we are witnessing on Capitol Hill is a complete and total wasteof taxpayer time, your time, your money, your resources. This will solvenothing. It will improve nothing. It will not make your life better it anyway.It will not unite the country like Joe says he wants to do. It will notease tensions in the country. It will not create a single job. It will notprovide necessary COVID relief and a more organized distribution of theDonald Trump vaccine, other words, Operation Warp Speed. Democraticgovernors are messing it up in state after state.Now, this charade only serves the Democratic Party, their own obsessive,compulsive need to impeach Donald Trump and avenged the results of 2016.They never got over it. They never will get over it.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That could be seen as an impeachable defense.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Impeach.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Impeach 45!CROWD:  Impeach 45!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's an impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Grounds for impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Impeachable.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Grounds for impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An impeachable offense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachable.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If that's not impeachable, I don't know what is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is it impeachable?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Grounds for impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Talk of impeachment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  None of us came to Congress to impeach a president andnow, we have to do our duty.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, make no mistake. By the way, that's the short version.What's happening in the Senate is, well, we'll call it, sewer, swamptheater. Now, it's complete with hysteria, hyperbole, and, of course, well,rank hypocrisy.Now, of course, the Democrats conducted the snap impeachment in the Housewithout taking the time to gather evidence, build a case, allow for dueprocess, or a defense or even a rudimentary investigation. They are nowshort on something called facts.This is why you don't rush to judgment. That's why we have due process.That's why a snap impeachment is so dangerous to this country.They claim the president incited an insurrection, their new favorite word,because of his insightful remarks on January 6. But now, according to everymajor media outlet and the FBI and court documents and even AOC, yeah, thecapital breach was, we now know, predetermined, preplanned. It wasplotting, planning, scheming by violent agitators while way before thepresident ever spoke at the rally, days and weeks before.How do I know? The mob and the media even have to admit it. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The investigation into the deadly insurrection at theU.S. Capitol a week ago, new evidence that it was planned.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Also shocking, new reporting that the FBI received avery specific reporting before the riot.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That FBI notice warned of war at the capitol, but forsome reason, security wasn't stepped out there to meet the challenge thatthat attack would oppose.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The FBI admitting it had intelligence before theinsurrection that people were planning to travel to D.C. with the intent tocause violence.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One week before, the week prior to the insurrection,I started to get text messages that I needed to be careful and that inparticular, I needed to be careful about the sixth.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, according to Forbes, quote, the Capitol attack was plannedopenly online for weeks and police, law enforcement, they still weren'tready."The Washington Post," the FBI report warned of, quote, war at the capitol,contradicting claims that there was no indication of any looming violence.And even "The New York Times," FBI warned of violence before the siege.This is why the capitol police chief actually requested the National Guardbefore, during, and after. As a matter of fact, he made six separateappeals for help, but his pleas for help were rejected every single time.In fact, according to Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, he was on withour own Maria Bartiromo over the weekend, the president was very vocalabout offering security assistance prior to the 6th and even ordered 10,000National Guard troops to stand ready. But they were never called on, evenwhen the chief of police in the capitol was calling them, until, of course,it was too late.The federal government has a duty to figure out exactly what went wronghere, why those capital police were left out to dry, why didn't Pelosi havethe sergeant of arms prepared, what are we going to discuss her derelictionof duty and failure to protect the capitol?By the way, that's your capitol, we the people. That's our capitol. Thoseare our elected officials.This transcends any politics in my mind. It doesn't matter, whoever iselected needs to be protected, period, end of sentence.That's why I've been saying we need a 9/11 style commission to investigateand give us a full report and put in changes so this never happens again.Well, not the snap impeachment of a former president. That directly impactsthe argument, by the way, that President Trump's rallies speech wasresponsible for inciting the insurrection.If it was planned in advanced, no argument can be made that the presidentin any way through his words was responsible for what they had preplannedunless he was part of the planning and, of course, nobody is making thatallegation because that never happened.So, now, the entire impeachment Schiff show charade and charges is dead inthe water. Democrats now are left arguing that President Trump told hissupporters he's going to fight like.But don't forget, President Trump also told his supporters that many of youwill now peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol so your voicescan be heard. But I guess that doesn't matter to Democrats because theyconveniently left all of that out in their presentation today by againselectively cutting, slicing, dicing, cherry-picking only the parts of hisspeech that they want the public to hear. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  I know that everyone here will soon bemarching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically makeyour voices heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Oh, whether the Democrats going to show that part of the speechor rally?Democrats don't want you to hear that part because according to them,context doesn't matter. Yeah, the president absolutely said "fight likehell" and we're to believe that that phrase, those words, fight is somehowa call for insurrection? If so, well, Democrats, the media mob, well, theyuse the exact same language. That would mean if we use their standard,they're guilty of insurrection themselves.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What does Congress do about this?REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  We fight. We keep fighting.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We're going to keep fighting, and fighting andfighting for this.SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  We should dream big, fight hard, and takeback our country.PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  This is a fight of our lives.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Stand up and fight forthe best of who we are, and I'm prepared to fight and I know how to fight.ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL:  But I'm ready for that fight.Increasing numbers of people are ready for that fight.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Stand up and fight for democracy.WATERS:  I will fight every day until he is impeached.SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ):  This is time for every single one of us to get upand fight for our country.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDNET:  We can't just imagine a better future. Wegot to fight for it.REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  We continue to fight for aprogressive agenda in our future.REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): That's what we are fighting against when wefight Republicans in Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Well, by their own standard, is that not incitement towardsinsurrection?What about this violent rhetoric from Joe Biden himself? Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They asked me, would I like todebate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, if I were in high school, Itake him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  I wonder what would happen to any conservative that said theywanted to take any Democratic president in the back of the gym and beat thehell out of him.So, do we impeach Joe Biden? He said it about a sitting president.What about this incitement insurrection language from Senator Cory Booker?You decide.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOOKER:  Before I end, that's my call to action here. Please don't justcome here today and then go home, go to the Hill today. Get up and pleaseget up in the face of some congresspeople.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Get in the face of your congresspeople.When are we going to impeach insurrectionist Cory Booker? Or is it okay fora Democratic senator to call for getting in the face, violence againstmembers of Congress? And what about Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer onthe steps of the United States Supreme Court?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCHUMER:  I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, youhave released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.(CHEERS)You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  You've released the whirlwind. You will pay the price.Oh, when do we impeach Chuck Schumer or is it just okay for the Democraticleader in the Senate to threaten members of the U.S. Supreme Court outsidetheir own building?And, of course, what about Maxine Waters? She vowed to take Trump outtonight and called on supporters to also attack cabinet officials. Followthem to store -- they are not wanted anywhere anymore, get a crowd andeverything, take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATERS:  If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in adepartment store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create acrowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome.And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  When does Congresswoman Waters get impeached for that violent,inciting rhetoric, a call to insurrection if they love that turn so much?What about Vice President Kamala Harris during the height of this summer'sriots? Remember, right after the police precinct in Minneapolis was burnedto the ground, oh, this is what then Senator Harris had to say. Take alook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HARRIS:  This is a movement, I'm telling you. They're not going to stop andeveryone beware because they're not going to stop and they're not going tostop before election day in November and they're not going to stop afterelection day. And that should be -- everyone should take note of that onboth levels that this -- they're not going to let up and they should not.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  They're not going to stop. They shouldn't stop. We shouldn'tstop.Before, during, after those remarks, American cities -- they were facing awave of violent riots, so does it not count as an incitement, again, theircharge, to insurrection when far left rioters attack a federal courthousein Portland for weeks on end or occupy an entire city blocks in the middleof Seattle or burn a police station to the ground in Minneapolis, let'ssee, just take over police stations, lay siege on the White House? When thepresident and his family were inside?Riots all summer and the left either praised them, ignored them, ordownplayed them. After all, the riots this past year and this is the onlyone they get outraged about. Well, over the summer, nearly 30 people died,over 2,000 police officers -- they were hit with rocks and bottles andbricks and Molotov cocktails and frozen water bottles and worse.And what about the unionists? Remember, the people that stormed theWisconsin state capitol? Oh, Nancy Pelosi praised them, said it was animpressive show of democracy in action and went on to say she stands insolidarity with those that invaded and occupied, yeah, the state capitolbuilding. Wow, how times have changed.So will Pelosi and her fellow Democrats hold themselves accountable or isthis impeachment charade Schiff show a total sham?The answer is obvious, not only is the impeachment premiseunconstitutional, hypocritical, totally insane, but is now officiallyconstitutes a kangaroo court.Look at this -- the judge presiding over the trial, it's not Chief JusticeRoberts as the Constitution calls for. Why? Because he wanted nothing to dowith this Schiff show charade and a show trial.Instead the presiding judge is Democratic Senator Pat Leahy, that guy rightthere. He's also -- well, he is a member of the jury and to make mattersworse, he already voiced -- he's presiding over the whole thing and he'salready voiced his support for Donald Trump's conviction, writing, quote:For the good of the country, he must leave his party and voting to convictPresident Trump and prevent him from holding future office.Now, if you ever go to court, do you want to get a judge that has alreadydecided you're guilty before the whole thing started?And meanwhile, the Democratic impeachment managers are also deeply flawed.You have Eric Swalwell and his long-time BFF, you know, the person namedFang Fang, the Chinese spy. You got Jamie Raskin, that guy actuallychallenged the 2016 election results which he seems to now think is animpeachable offense.And ultimately, the show trial would drag on, I don't know, days, they callwitnesses weeks, and in a way I kind of hope they do call witnesses. I'vegot a great list for the Republican senators.Well, we are going to see hysteria. You're going to witness feigned,selective moral outrage. We will all witness rank hypocrisy and what isnothing but a detestable double standard.But the outcome, it's pretty certain and predetermined. President Trumpwill be acquitted and this will all be for nothing. Watch your greatelected officials in action.Here with reaction, Donald Trump Jr.All right. A lot to digest.Four major arguments in my mind, one, it's unconstitutional. Two, the snapimpeachment was made before we found out that the whole thing had beenpreplanned in advance. Three, the insurrectionist language of the leftwhich I kind of think is a big deal and we can get to more. Your thoughts?DONALD TRUMP, JR., AUTHOR OF "LIBERAL PRIVILEGE":  Well, Sean, if it wasn'tfor double standards, the Democrats would have no standards at all. I mean,I think, in your monologue, you sort of highlighted all of the hypocrisythat we saw during ten months of rioting, looting, arson, in-your-face typeof politics.Candidly, whatever my father said on January 6th was mild in comparison.But if you were to take his speech and compare it to literally any stumpspeech ever given in the history of politics, you would see absolutely nodeviation, but again, because the Democrats have the media in their pocket,carrying whatever message, they can go on with impeachment part two, whatthey started back in 2016 before the original inauguration. They're justgoing to continue it.They are all excited to be able to grandstand, to be able to selectivelyedit, to do their faux outrage on a global scale with TV and free air time.That's what this is all about.And I think that's the way we have to counter that. We have to do the samethings. We have to fight back the way the Democrats fight.And I don't mean physically because in today's world, if you say the word"fight", all of a sudden, magically, that means an insurrection. Give me abreak, Sean. This stuff is asinine.Forty-four Republicans have already voted to say that the sham impeachmentpart two was unconstitutional.Aren't we in the middle of a pandemic, Sean? I thought that these senatorswould maybe have something better to do. Maybe they would actually fightfor the American people for a change. Maybe they would actually get to thebusiness of helping us through this pandemic.I don't see that happening and I certainly don't see it happening from theBiden administration who's killing American jobs, defending China,eliminating the ban of the Confucius Institute, which is China taking overour universities and ultimately bribing our professors to get, you know,all the data that you have out of the research projects at Americanuniversities. I mean, you're opening the border, you have to test peoplecoming in legally to the country for COVID-19, but illegal immigrantsstreaming across the border, there's no test. They just get released to thesociety.The double standards are insane and may be the United States Senate shouldbe focused on that rather than their nonsense.HANNITY:  You know, I know that there are eight -- there are going to betwo eight-hour days available for both the case they want to put on -- Idon't know what they could possibly say except slice, dice, selectivelyedit. Oh, look at this, but let's take out what Donald Trump said to marchpeacefully and patriotically, we'll take that part out.To me -- TRUMP JR.:  Yeah. Minor detail, Sean.HANNITY:  Minor detail. Yeah, it's called a fact. Yeah, it's actuallycalled real words that they didn't want. That's inconvenient for theirargument.But it's not inconvenient, their insurrectionist language, Don Jr., is it?It's not -- if we apply the standards to them, then all of the ones I'veplayed and many more I could go on all night -- they would be guilty basedon their own standard, and yet the media is only on one side. That's sad.TRUMP JR.:  Correct. And more importantly, the Republicans are also -- andrightfully so. I don't think we should be impeaching every one of theDemocratic caucus who said ridiculous things that are frankly much moreinflammatory than anything Donald Trump said.HANNITY:  I agree.TRUMP JR.:  I'm not about that, although if they are going to pursue thesethings, Republicans have to stop trying to play the game differently. We'vegot to play hardball if they're playing hardball. We've been playing T-ballfor generations while the Democrats have played hardball.We've turned the other cheek as they slapped us in the face and laugh asthey've won every major fight along the way, while we claim some sort ofmoral high ground and losing everything.That's what Donald Trump showed the Republican Party. That you can pushback, that you don't have to go with their norms, that you don't have tolisten to the media when they're just flagrantly putting out nonsense. Youcan actually push back, and I hope that the Republican Party does that.If they go back to the old ways of just rolling over and dying each andevery time someone in the media wants to write a mean piece about thembecause they can't stand them or their constituents or Donald Trump's 75million people that voted for him in this country, the highest of anyconservative in the history of America, there's no future for the party.So, they'd better learn from that.And as much as I despise the notion of it, we have to be playing the samegame. So we got to come out aggressively. We got to pursue those kind ofideas if they're going to do it.It's the same with cancel culture. Notice, that only goes one way. I'm notfor cancel culture but if they're going to go against us, against half ofthe country on a daily basis and use it to get rid of people, to suppressthem, to bully them -- and it's bullying in so many cases.You know, if they come after me, it's one thing. I got a platform, I'm abig boy. When they go after some of these people that don't have anyplatform, they tried to attack them, as CNN has done with random people whoposted something on Facebook, that kind of bullying has to stop and we haveto push back accordingly.HANNITY:  Hey, Don, look what's -- it's cancel culture. Oh, have you -- areyou and have you ever been a supporter of Donald Trump? Reeducation camps.They won't hire people that serve country in the White House.Oh, Don Jr. might buy a house in the neighborhood, oh, I get the vapors,oh, the feigned outrage. It is literally -- it is the sickest it's everbeen, ever.TRUMP JR.:  It is really. I mean, it's McCarthyism on steroids. I mean,think about this way, Sean -- I mean, they're doing it across the board buteven within the military, if you have conservative leanings, we're going topurge.Well, I don't know, I called a couple of friends of mine, you know, in theSEAL teams. You know, how many guys do you think would left in the teams?And they go about, maybe 1 percent and they'd be really, really moderate onjust everything.So, this notion of purging conservatives from the military for -- I mean,what are they protecting? I mean, these people have to represent Americans.This is half of the country that they're talking about -- HANNITY:  Yeah.TRUMP JR.:  -- trying to cancel, trying to suppress and guess what, this isthe kind of treatment and behavior that created the rise of Donald Trumpand I think we are going to see that goes back in midterms, because asalways, the Democrats are overplaying their hand.They don't get it because they live in their little echo chambers, and Iunderstand the irony of a son of a billionaire from Manhattan having abetter pulse of the American people than the people chosen by those peopleto represent them in Congress. But Congress is clueless. The Democrats inCongress have no idea what's going on because they have their lackeys inthe media telling them they are right about all of their nonsensicalattacks.HANNITY:  All right. Why don't you go to Congress and argue with DavidSchoen? You'd be the perfect guy.All right. Don, Jr., thank you.All right. Up next, will AOC apologize to Ted Cruz for saying he almost hadher murdered? Apparently, she was in the other building. Not that we'redownplaying the threat.We'll tell you the answer and get Senator Cruz's reaction, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Now, at the exact same time Democrats are lying about PresidentTrump's remarks on the 6th and then slicing, dicing, cutting and editing,far left radicals, they still refuse to take any responsibility for theirreckless, violent rhetoric.Joining us now to discuss this and more, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.Senator, good to see you.How would you argue this -- I thought David Schoen, who was going to joinus next, was particularly effective. I thought it was a little bit of aweak start, I'm not being critical, just a little lackluster, meandering tome, needs a little more focus, and I thought David brought that.Your thoughts?SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  Well, there's no doubt that lawyers could tighten itup some but at the end of the day, I think today typified what we're goingto see this week, which it reminds me of Shakespeare. It's full of soundand fury signifying nothing.We're going to see this week a whole lot of Democrats pounding the table.We're going to see a lot of moralizing and a lot of really venting theirhatred for Donald Trump. In case you haven't been paying attention the lastfour years, the Democrats really, really hate Donald Trump and they'regoing to attack President Trump over and over again, every way they can.They're going to bring in -- you know, the idea that they've got -- youknow, Swalwell coming in. I do hope he gives -- gives some remarks onimproving our relations with China. He has a novel approach to that.But this is going to be just venting the id of the Democrats -- HANNITY:  Senator -- CRUZ:  -- and it's going to end with failure. It is going to end with thepresident being acquitted.In order for the president to be convicted, it takes 67 votes in the U.S.Senate. That's not going to happen. It's not going to get 67 votes, it'snot going to get close to 67 votes. Every one of the 100 senators knowsthat. Every one of the House managers knows that.But this is political theater because rather than address the realproblems, the real challenges we have in this country, rather than focusedon getting kids back in school and getting tens of millions of Americansback to work, the Democrats want a week of just political theater raging atDonald Trump.HANNITY:  If the issues that you mentioned and others, COVID relief,vaccine distribution, helping people that are still in need of help becauseof draconian shutdowns, et cetera, et cetera, if that wasn't so importantright now, I would almost want to argue, I'd like to bring in witnessesbecause I'd like America to see the double standard of how we defineinsightful language and insurrection.But now that we know it's preplanned and they knew it ahead of time anddidn't do anything, that now transcends all issues because we can't allowthat to be happening in a post-9/11 America, Senator Cruz.CRUZ:  Well, Sean, you're exactly right, and let me commend your monologuetonight. I always enjoy the monologues. But I think you did a really nicejob of clipping together some of the more egregious examples.You know, the Democrats right now, what they're trying to say is thatPresident Trump's rhetoric what caused the terrorist attack on the capitol.And listen, the president's language at times I think is overheated. But ifyou look at the language he used, saying things like "fight", saying thingslike "go retake our country", if that is now incitement, then we betterprepare a long line to indict every candidate for office who's ever run in,anyone who was ever given a stump speech and said, let's go fight, let's gowin, let's go retake our country.And when it comes to encouraging violence, you noted quite rightly that thepresident was careful to say that the protesters should be peaceful. Wehave had Democrats for a year cheering on, we've seen violence all over thecountry, we've seen riots all over the country, we've seen stores beinglooted, stores being firebombed, police cars being firebombed, policeofficers being assaulted, police officers being murdered, individualcitizens being assaulted, and what did the Democrats do? They cheered iton. They celebrated.In fact, Kamala Harris, our new vice president, Kamala Harris not onlyencouraged they keep at it and keep doing more, she raised money to pay forthe bail to bail out the violent criminals.Now, let me be clear, anyone who attacked the capital, anyone who attackeda police officer, they need to be prosecuted and they need to be put injail a long, long time.HANNITY:  Let me -- CRUZ:  Nobody has a right to engage in violence.The difference is, you and I have been consistent in that. We said ifyou're engaged in violence, whether you're left-wing or right wing, that'sunacceptable. The Democrats have been complete hypocrites on this, cheeringon BLM and Antifa and apologizing for their violence, and the hypocrisy isreally thick right now.HANNITY:  Senator, you're a constitutional scholar. You're a championdebater from Harvard. Tell me what my arguments are missing or maybe whatyou would like to see and hear from the defense in this case?CRUZ:  I think the arguments that the defense needs to focus on areprecisely what you say, which is that the impeachment article fails on themerits. They have charged the president with incitement of violence andinsurrection, nothing in he said -- nothing he said meets the legalstandard for incitement.Incitement is very clear. Incitement is very deliberately saying go attackand, by the way, if you are actually measuring the standard for incitement,those Democrats you played, Maxine Waters, what she said, Chuck Schumer,what he said, they would come much closer to meeting the standard forincitement then did President Trump.But the honest answer is, none of them meet incitement. You know, we havethe First Amendment, we have robust political speech. People are entitledto be idiots. And, you know what? In the United States Congress, we get alot of people doing that.We shouldn't be prosecuting people for speaking and we shouldn't beimpeaching them. This is political theater.And the reason they are doing this, we need to understand this, it's notjust that they hate Donald Trump, they hate the 75 million Americans whovoted for him and they're trying to silence you, they're trying to cancelyou, they're trying to erase you and it's not going to work.And already, just a couple of weeks into the Biden administration, they areoverreaching, they're going too far left.And politics is like a pendulum and we're going to come back towardssanity. And mark my words, 2022 is going to be a fantastic election and2024 is going to be a fantastic election.HANNITY:  All right. Senator Ted Cruz, thank you.After the break, the president's attorney David Schoen, he joins us for anexclusive interview following day one of the impeachment Schiff showcharade sham. Say that five times fast -- straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right. Joining us now is the attorney for President Trump,David Schoen, for this impeachment -- I call it the Schiff show charade.David -- we've been friends a long time, David. I loved your arguments. Iloved your passion.I thought it started a little meandering, sort of like -- a lot of freeassociating in the beginning and I'm not -- I'm not attacking your partner.I don't -- I don't know him at all, but I liked -- I liked focusedarguments and I particularly liked -- you actually ran tape of theDemocrats pointing out the obvious that, oh, the news has changed quite abit since this snap impeachment.DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP ATTORNEY:  Yeah.  It's -- I think this is a very, very,very painful and wrong process for the country. It's said -- as you saidearlier in your show, it's very easy to stand up and show spliced andmanufactured films. Literally, you know, the Democrats, the House managersapparently hired a large movie company and a large law firm to put togetherthis thing.It's just -- it's a matter of tricking the American people to play as ifthe writing was going on in real time with the speech, what's the purposeof that? Why do we want to trick the American people?And, listen, they have great entertainment value. People are glued to, youknow, a movie that's made professionally like that. But that's not going toadvance the cause -- any cause of good in the country.HANNITY:  The constitutional issue of jurisdiction, let's go over that, andwhy this is not constitutional.SCHOEN:  Yeah.So many reasons why it's not constitutional. It's funny, though, that Dem -- the House managers got up and said, it's such a clear question, eventheir people say it's a close call at best. But it's -- it's common sense,nobody thinks of using the impeachment process for anything other thanremoving a civil official from office.We have courts. If you want to have an investigation, if you want toprosecute someone, or something like that, we have the courts for that.That's not what impeachment is for.But, you know, we talked about the language in the Constitution today, thatsort of thing. It's just -- to me, it's absolutely nonsense. The presidentis no longer the president right now and he's a person who can't be removedfrom office. He's a private citizen.This is what our Founding Fathers are very much against, having alegislative body try a private citizen. Think about it, he doesn't get anyof the benefits or safeguards that our Constitution provides for someonewho has an actual trial. They put that -- that videotape would never gointo evidence anywhere in the world today. It's a spliced tape showing whatthey want to show.HANNITY:  It's pretty profound to me that the media is now acknowledging,we have a law enforcement, the FBI acknowledging, we have court documentsacknowledging, we have Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman, acknowledging --all these people now discussing how in fact this is all preplanned.Well, how do you make the argument that at a rally, the words of thepresident to peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol so yourvoices are heard -- how do you make the argument that that incited aninsurrection when in fact it was all planned out apparently ahead of time,according to all of these varying sources now?SCHOEN:  Yeah, even taking the position that that speech incited aninsurrection is as dangerous as I can imagine in the free speech area. Itshould (ph) -- it would absolutely chill passionate political speech.I think one of the your earlier guests, Mr. Trump Jr., said it best, that,you know, compared to other rhetoric you hear, this is mild. If you reallyread the speech and watch it, he calls for -- when he uses the word"fight", it's in the context of a legislator fighting or something likethat. It's -- it's really setting a horrible message to people.I understand they don't like Donald Trump on that side of the aisle. Well,he has -- you know, half the country loves him. I would say to you probablythat if he had 74 million, 75 million voters, they voted for him becausethey love Donald Trump.I don't know that many other candidates can say that. People may have votedbecause they didn't want Donald Trump, the other candidate, but he has areal following.He's a passionate person. And it's setting a very dangerous and a wrongmessage, and it's a -- it's a hoax, I'm sorry to say.HANNITY:  If we apply the Democratic standards for how they defineincitement and insurrection, well, what if we applied it as we started ourmonologue tonight to the words of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer,Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and a whole host of others. If that samestandard is applied, do they not all deserve impeachment to it?By the way, I don't agree with them, but if you use their standard, itseems if you're somewhat intellectually honest, you'd have to say theydeserve impeachment.SCHOEN:  Yeah, I would say -- you know, listen, if they tried to impeachthem, I would say was an abuse -- was an abuse of the impeachment process.But your point is, they're using rhetoric that's just as inflammatory ormore so. The problem is, they don't really have followers, you know, thededicated followers. And so -- you know, when they give their speeches.But this speech, I think right now, you really are finding out about thepreplanning and I'm afraid they're going to back off that investigationbecause maybe, you know, so many people want to tie it to Donald Trump.There's nothing they showed today that in any way ties it to Donald Trump.It's just a silly argument. It's not tied to Donald Trump or his speechwhatsoever.So what they're doing now a bit (ph) is, going -- well, you see, it's notjust that speech, he's been, you know, inciting people and inflamingpeople. You know, he's been arousing the American public to drain theswamp, whatever they call it on his side, to make a difference in thiscountry. That's what political speech is about.HANNITY:  There's a lot of criticism of the opening, not your part inparticular. But it seemed to be free associating, extemporaneous, somewhatmeandering.Will the rest of this process -- because you're going to be out, as Iunderstand it, Friday and Saturday -- will this be more focused and will itbe more prepared? And are there other people that are planning to makethose arguments? Because some conservatives called me and said, well, weneed somebody harder hitting here.SCHOEN:  Well, the fellow who you said did the opening today has his lawfirm there. They're very capable people. I'm sure -- today, he hadn'tplanned on going. And so I'm sure they will be very well-prepared in thefuture and do a great job in the case.HANNITY:  All right.SCHOEN:  There's a lot to say and I know you feel very strongly aboutfighting against what they're seeing.HANNITY:  All right. David, good job today. Thank you so much for sharingit with us. We appreciate it.You won't believe -- all right, creepy Joe is back. Yeah, creepy,uncomfortable comment Joe directed at a nurse yesterday. We've got the tapeand we've got some highlights, and we'll get reaction from Pete Hegseth andTammy Bruce coming up, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right. So, now, the week, the frail, the cognitivelystruggling Joe had another baffling and frankly what we were calling beforethe election, creepy moments in -- this happened Monday in a virtualdiscussion with a nurse running a vaccine center in Arizona.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NURSE:  They know that I'm trying to do everything to make this safe andefficient. So, support. Yeah.BIDEN:  Well, are you a freshman at the university?NURSE:  No, no.BIDEN:  I'm teasing.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN:  You look like a freshman.(LAUGHTER)NURSE:  Why, thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Okay. Now, it wouldn't be that bad, but, of course, Biden has along history of this sort of unprofessional, these uncomfortable moments.Here with reaction, "FOX & Friends" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth, alongwith FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce.I mean, when you run the video and we actually edit out and pixel thephases of a lot of young kids in this with Joe, you know, a lot of hairsniffing, a lot of kind of kissing of the neck, just kind of creeped meout. I'm being nice or else I'd show a lot of stuff that I think someparents may not like -- Pete.PETE HEGSETH, FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND CO-HOST:  Sean, she was not just not afreshman at Arizona, she was the lead nurse on a COVID-19 vaccination sitemeant to demonstrate the efficacy of their efforts which, of course, theBiden administration should be thanking the miracle of these vaccines tothe Trump administration.I mean, there's a reason Dr. Biden did all the talking in the Super Bowlvideo because we know who Joe is. This is very, very typical, notsurprising at all. And, you know, instead of focusing on COVID the way heshould, Sean, we are spending all this time talking about an impeachmenthearing that we know the outcome is going to be when the Senate, the House,and the White House can be totally focused on actual vaccine sites likethis.Instead, we get a virtual hair sniffing which is what we can expect fromUncle Joe.HANNITY:  You know, Tammy, I don't know. Maybe I just have a differentphilosophy, I'm not a big touchy-feely type and you've seen the video whichI'm discussing here. This was not the worst comment in the world, let's be-- let's be honest here. Trying to -- I assume just trying to be nice.TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  There was more.HANNITY:  There is a lot more.BRUCE:  Yeah. And look, and this is where we have to remember what has ledup to this, the impeachment hearing is a distraction from the disaster thatis in the White House. Joe Biden had to issue, remember, during thecampaign, a video statement after scores of women came forward,professional women, women who are Democrats saying that their space hadbeen not just intruded upon but his inappropriate behavior made themextremely uncomfortable, credibly accused by at least, I think, 18 women, adozen to 18 women if not more and a credible accusation of sexual assault.You notice that that is gone. This is what we can expect. This isn't justfrom today where he was tired or he was, you know, trying to be funny. Thisis what he does and what it shows you, Sean, is how deep-seated thisattitude is.His comment to her and I think being a freshman is great, being in acollege is great, but it was a diminishment of that woman before hiscomment.She had described her role, what her position is after that comment, shedescribed it again. That woman worked hard to be in that position and heturned her into a thing.This is what Joe Biden does. It's what he's been doing, and the Democrats,Hollywood, you notice their silence. It highlights their hypocrisy and this-- he has been in office, what, Sean, a couple of weeks and it's alreadybeginning -- Kamala Harris said she believes his accusers. If you noticeher face when this begins, it -- there's a sweeping kind of panic. And sheerases it right away.But she is there all the time now almost like a minder which is shameful.This is an issue of character across the board for everyone in the WhiteHouse.HANNITY:  Yeah, he may be weak and frail but I guess old habits are hard tobreak.Twenty seconds, Pete Hegseth.HEGSETH:  That's exactly right and you want the most thoughtful, seriousperson possible in that position to get us out of this nightmare we're ininstead. I mean, again, what Tammy said is right, we knew who this nursewas. Afterward, she had to have the knowledge it, yet you make a crack thatshe's a freshman at Arizona? Like it was the juvenile, the base thing youcan think of in the most important moment you can possibly imagine.It's who Joe Biden is. It's the empty vessel we have in the White House.It's really sad.HANNITY:  All right. Pete, thank you. Tammy, thank you.We'll have more HANNITY right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left thisevening. We hope you'll see your DVR so you never miss an episode ofHannity. This show is always independent. We always do our own research.We'll never be the media mob. We'll give you news, information and opinion.We're like the whole newspaper in the press. They say that they're news.They're not. They're abusively biased.But let not your hearts be troubled. Why? Because Laura Ingraham takes youthe rest of the way.Laura, how are you?ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
