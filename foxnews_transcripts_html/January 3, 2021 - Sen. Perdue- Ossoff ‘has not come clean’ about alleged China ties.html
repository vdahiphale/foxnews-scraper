MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good Sunday morning. Welcome to "SundayMorning Futures."Happy new year, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo.Today, the kickoff to the most consequential week in Washington for yearsto come for America. The 117th Congress will be sworn in hours from now, asa resistance is growing within the GOP House and Senate.This morning, breaking news on the upcoming joint session of Congress,where several GOP senators and congressmen will object to certifying the2020 election for Joe Biden.Texas Senator Ted Cruz is leading the way. He joins me momentarily on whyhe's leading the group of senators who will reject the results unless anemergency 10-day commission is named to investigate election fraud.Then, leading the charge in the House of Representatives this morning, OhioCongressman Jim Jordan and Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks with what they sayis evidence and the burden of proof, why they will object to up to sixstates when Vice President Mike Pence begins the historic roll call onWednesday.Then, the Georgia Senate race is just two days away, with up to threemillion Georgians registered to vote early. One of two sitting senatorsdefending the GOP majority this morning, Senator David Perdue, on the stateof play, along with Georgia state Representative Vernon Jones this morning.Plus, incoming freshman Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on whyshe says she's ready for a civil war in rejecting Joe Biden this week.All that right here, right now, as we look ahead on "Sunday MorningFutures."And Republican resistance is growing this morning ahead of the finaljudgment day, this Wednesday, on the presidential election of 2020, and thejoint session of Congress.Breaking news this morning, Senator Ted Cruz is leading a group of 11senators who will object unless a commission is named to investigateallegations of fraud.Senator Ted Cruz joins me right now.Senator, great to have you this morning. Happy new year to you.Why are you doing this, and how will this play out?SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  Well, good morning, Maria. Happy new year as well.Thanks for having me.Look, we're at an extraordinary time in our country's history. We went intothis election with the country deeply divided, deeply polarized. And wehave seen in the last two months unprecedented allegations of voter fraud.And that's produced a deep, deep distrust of our democratic process acrossthe country. I think we in Congress have an obligation to do somethingabout that. We have an obligation to protect the integrity of thedemocratic system.And so, this past week, I spent writing out a position and assembling agroup that -- ultimately of 11 senators that we put out yesterday, that wewill, together, object to certification in order to force the appointmentof an emergency electoral commission to perform an emergency audit of theelection results to assess these claims of fraud.I think we can do that. We can do it promptly. We can do it in 10 days,before the inauguration. But I think we have an obligation to the votersand we have an obligation to the Constitution to ensure that this electionwas lawful.BARTIROMO:  You mentioned the allegations of fraud.And in the press release announcing this commission that you would like tosee, you report on a Reuters/Ipsos poll that says 39 percent of Americansbelieve the election was rigged, that belief held by Republicans 67percent, Democrats 17 percent, and independents 31 percent.But, Senator, we know that we heard from Bill Barr. And he said he didn'tsee fraud. We know that we heard from the states. And we also know that weheard from the Supreme Court, who did not hear the attacks and the casesthat said there was fraud.How do you respond to that?CRUZ:  Well, each of those different players has a different role in ourconstitutional system.Bill Barr was speaking as to the evidence the Department of Justice saw.The Department of Justice wasn't administering any elections, did not haveaccess to particularly widespread evidence on either side of the issue.As for the states, there are a lot of people in the states and statelegislatures who have expressed deep, deep concerns about the unlawfulpractices that we saw on Election Day, that we saw particularly citiescontrolled by Democratic politicians shutting down the vote, throwing outobserver, disregarding the law.And, finally, you mentioned the Supreme Court. Listen, I wish the SupremeCourt had taken this case. There were two opportunities to take this case,one out of Pennsylvania, one out of Texas. In both instances, the lawyersasked me to argue those cases.And so, with regard to the Texas case, President Trump called me and said:"Ted, would you do the oral argument in this case if the court takes it?"I told the president, absolutely, I'd be happy to do it.I wish the court had taken one or both of those cases. I think the SupremeCourt would be a better forum for resolving those issues. That obviouslywas the forum we resolved issues similarly in 2000 in Bush vs. Gore.Unfortunately, the court declined to take those two cases, so we don't havethe court stepping into resolve it.And that's why I think Congress has a responsibility. We have anindependent obligation to the Constitution. We have an independentobligation to the rule of law.And the question -- look, we have got a vote on January 6 on certification.And every member of Congress faces a dilemma, frankly, two pretty lousychoices. One, we can vote to certify, not consider any objections. If we dothat, that will be heard by a lot of Americans as saying we don't thinkvoter fraud is a real concern, we don't think these claims should beinvestigated thoroughly.I know that's not what most of us believe.But, secondly -- and I think all of us rightly don't want to be in aposition where we're suggesting setting aside the results of an electionjust because the candidate that we supported didn't happen to prevail.That's not a principled constitutional position.That's why, in assembling this group of 11 senators, I was looking for athird option, an option that was really moored the law.And so I will tell you what I did, Maria. I went back and looked at thehistorical precedents. I think the strongest precedent is the presidentialelection of 1876, Hayes vs. Tilden. In that election, there were seriousallegations of fraud in three different states, in Florida, in Louisiana,and in South Carolina.And what did Congress do in 1876? Now, they didn't throw up their hands andsay, well, gosh, we have got allegations of fraud, but we can't do anythingabout it. We have just got to certify. No, they didn't do that.BARTIROMO:  Yes.CRUZ:  What they did instead is, they appointed a commission. It was calledan electoral commission, consisted of five House members, five senators,five Supreme Court justices. They considered evidence. They examined theballots.And they made a determination based upon what -- the disputed ballots --and what the outcomes should be.BARTIROMO:  Right.CRUZ:  What I'm arguing for is, Congress ought to do the same thing. Weought to have a fair inquiry, a fair audit into these results, and we oughtto resolve these claims, not just dismiss them out of hand.BARTIROMO:  What kind of pressure are you facing right now?We know that Mitch McConnell does not want any objection. We also know thatLiz Cheney is telling her colleagues:  Why are we doing this? This is awaste of time. Don't do it. We shouldn't be putting ourselves out there.We also heard from Senator Klobuchar. She said, get a grip. Lisa Murkowskisaid, we should not be doing this.And you know that you will require both the House and the Senate to rejectthe electors from a number of states in order to be successful. That'slikely not happening, that you're going to win in both the House and theSenate. And what if a commission does find fraud? What happens then?CRUZ:  Well, listen, I think everyone needs to calm down. I think we needto tone down the rhetoric. This is already a volatile situation. It's likea tinderbox, and throwing lit matches into it.And so I think the kind of hyperbole we're seeing, the kind of angrylanguage -- yesterday, when I released my statement with 10 other senators,I had multiple, multiple Democrats urging that I should be arrested andtried for the crimes of sedition and treason.Now, look, that's not helpful. At a time when this country, when we'repitted against each other, just relax and let's do our jobs. We have aresponsibility to follow the law.And let me say, by the way, to those members who may not have a concernabout this election, whether you're a Democrat or even some Republicans,the poll numbers you covered at the top of the show, I think, ought to bedeeply troubling to everyone. Thirty-nine percent of Americans think --quote -- "The election was rigged."And that includes 17 percent of Democrats, 31 percent of independents.That's bad for our democracy. That's bad for the legitimacy of anysubsequent presidential elections.And so dismissing these claims, I think, does real violence to ourdemocratic system. We ought to have a serious, fair process and tribunal toconsider these claims, consider them quickly, consider them expeditiously.We can do it in 10 days before the inauguration.I think that would take major steps towards reestablishing trust in ourdemocratic process. And I believe that should be a bipartisan objective. Wemay be too divided today for that to happen, but Democrats should beinterested in Americans having confidence in our electoral system, just asmuch as Republicans should be.BARTIROMO:  Yes.Senator, look, you are an expert on the Constitution. You're aconstitutionalist. You wrote an entire book about it.What does the Constitution tell us about who decides who the presidentshould be? What if the commission that you are explaining does form, comesback with actual evidence of fraud? Then what happens?CRUZ:  Well, then the results have to be set aside.If there's evidence of fraud, and it's substantial and significant enoughto affect the results in a particular state, then those election resultswould have to be set aside, and the states would then have to determine,all right, we have a valid claim here, the evidence supports it, we need toconduct elections consistent with the law.You know, the Constitution gives the responsibility of counting the ballotsto the vice president of the United States, Vice President Mike Pence, andto both houses of Congress. And the framers of the Constitution, when theyassigned a task to the Congress, they knew what they were doing.There are some folks who are saying, this is purely a ministerial act, theyjust have to count them and walk out, and you have no judgment whatsoever.Well, that, frankly, doesn't make any sense. Why would the framers give toCongress something that could be given to a clerk?The reason they gave it to Congress is, they understood there are difficultdeterminations about what counts as a valid vote. You know, following the1876 election, 10 years later, in 1887, Congress passed a statute, thestatute that we're operating under. It's called the Electoral Count Act.And what it provides is the mechanism for raising an objection. And it saysyou can raise an objection if the votes were not regularly made by lawfullycertified electors.And so, in this instance, if you have states that are violating the law,that are committing fraud, those votes are not being regularly made, andthose are not lawfully certified electors. And so that -- Congress'responsibility is to address these claims.I understand that, for some of my colleagues, that's a hard choice. It'snot a responsibility they welcome. Whether we welcome it or not, theConstitution gives us that responsibility.BARTIROMO:  Yes.CRUZ:  And we need to step forward and defend the rule of law and protectthe integrity of our elections.BARTIROMO:  Real quick, as we wrap up, Senator, we are two days away fromthe Georgia Senate races.Do you believe that, if the Democrats win those two Senate races, and theDemocrats take the majority in the Senate, that you will have an evenlarger group of senators come Wednesday, the next day, to object theresults of the 2020 election?A word on Tuesday's Georgia Senate races.CRUZ:  Yes, so, I was in Georgia yesterday campaigning with Kelly Loeffler.I'm actually, as soon as we finish, jumping on a plane, flying back toGeorgia to campaign today again.I think these two Georgia Senate races on January 5 are, withoutexaggeration, the most important Senate races of our entire lifetime. If wesee a Democratic majority, a Chuck Schumer majority, I think they will dogenerational damage.It will empower the extreme angry leftist voices in the Democratic Party.And so I would say to folks at home, if you are in Georgia, please, please,please come out and bring your friends and your family and your neighbors,because we're seeing massive Democratic turnout.BARTIROMO:  Yes.CRUZ:  And the consequences -- I think the people of Georgia want to see areasonable check and balance.BARTIROMO:  Yes.CRUZ:  They don't want to see the extreme, the Bernie Sanders and ElizabethWarrens and AOCs...BARTIROMO:  Sure.CRUZ:  ... having no restraints on them whatsoever.Georgia will decide that. And I will tell you -- and I will tell you what.I think we're going to win both races in Georgia, but it's going to dependon turnout on Election Day.BARTIROMO:  All right, Senator, we will be watching, and, of course, thevery next day, the joint session of Congress as important.We will be there.Thank you so much, Senator. We will watch the developments. Thanks forbeing here, Senator Ted Cruz in Texas.Coming up, lawyers by trade and now sitting congressmen leading the debatein the House of Representatives, Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mo Brooks withevidence and the burden of proof, why they say the Constitution wasviolated in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin on Election Day 2020 --right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.History being made this week in Washington, when Republican lawmakers fromboth chambers of Congress plan to reject the certification of Joe Biden'svictory.While House Democrats may have already tried this in 2005 and 2017, nosenator has backed their objection since the election of 1876. Today, youhave got 12 senators backing them.Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mo Brooks are here. They are spearheading thechallenge in the House, accompanied by the senators this time. They join usright now.Congressmen, it's great to see you both. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Good to be with you.BARTIROMO:  Jim Jordan, I'd like to kick it off with you.JORDAN:  Yes. Sure.BARTIROMO:  Will you walk us through what will take place on Wednesdaymorning?JORDAN:  Well, there will be...BARTIROMO:  Vice President Mike Pence will do a roll call.JORDAN:  Yes.BARTIROMO:  Can you briefly tell us how this will play out Wednesday?And then I would like to hear your arguments of the constitutionalprinciple.JORDAN:  Well, sure. Sure.Vice President Pence will oversee the proceedings. There will be anobjection raised by a House member. We have, I think, probably over 100House members who want to object to the various states, the six states inquestion. And then we have 11 senators.So, if you have one from each, there will be the objection raised as hecalls each state in alphabetical order. If, let's say, we get to Georgia,and there's an objection from a House member and a Senator, then eachchamber will -- each body will retire to their respective chamber.They will have a two-hour debate. There will be a vote and they will comeback. If those -- if there's a vote to object and not accept those electorsfrom that respective state, then they won't be accepted. And then you moveto the next state.And if neither candidate -- if you go through that process and neithercandidate has 270 electoral votes, then the Constitution is clear. There'sa vote in the House of Representatives done by delegation. So, it's -- thatprocess is very straightforward.But there's a two-hour debate on each state if there's an objection raisedby both a House member and a senator.BARTIROMO:  Tell me what you're planning to do, Congressman.JORDAN:  Well, as Senator Cruz said, it's about the Constitution.Article 1, Section 4 says is very clear. It says the time, manner and placefor holding elections is determined in each state by the legislaturethereof.Take Pennsylvania, for example. Pennsylvania state law says Election Dayends at 8:00 on Election Day. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says, nope,we're going to extend it three days until 5:00 on Friday. State law inPennsylvania says, for every absentee mail-in ballot, there has to be asignature verification.The secretary of state says, nope, we're not going to do that. We're notgoing to have a signature. We're going to -- she just unilaterally wentaround the law for 2.6 million mail-in ballots. The state law ofPennsylvania is clear. It says that mail-in ballots cannot be processeduntil Election Day.But some counties in Pennsylvania allowed ballots to be fixed, cured beforeElection Day.Now, Maria, take a guess which counties allowed that. Democrat counties,with Democrat county commissioners and clerks allowed that to happened.Republican counties didn't. The Republican counties in Pennsylvaniafollowed the law.So, when the time, place and manner is not adhered to and not -- that thelegislature set, that is a direct violation of the Constitution. And thatdisenfranchises the votes in the district I get the privilege ofrepresenting in the Fourth District of Ohio. That disenfranchises the votesthat Mo gets -- the people that Mo represents in Alabama, and countlessnumber of people around the country.And understand this, finally. It wasn't us who said it. Ruth BaderGinsburg, the late justice, said this:  The ultimate date of significanceis January 6. This is how the process works. The ultimate arbiter here, theultimate check and balance is the United States Congress.And when something is done in an unconstitutional fashion, which happenedin several of these states, we have a duty to step forward and have thisdebate and have this vote on the 6th of January.BARTIROMO:  And, Congressman Mo Brooks, you are a litigator by practice.You know about the burden of proof. You say you have seen evidence thatthere was fraud.REP. MO BROOKS (R-AL):  Oh, no question. The evidence is overwhelming andcompelling.In my judgment, if you were to get a non-biased jury that listened to theevidence, they would find 99 percent of the time that there was massivevoter fraud and election theft in the November 3 election.Now, having said that, let me emphasize that there are a lot of differentthings to cover. And, of course, we have limited amount of time in which todo so on this show. I'm not sure how much detail you want me to get into,but I'm more than happy to address it within the time allotted.BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want you to address the fraud that you see.But before we take a break, and then we will go into that deeper, how manystates are you going to object to?BROOKS:  Well I intend to object to six, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.BARTIROMO:  And why is that? Why those six?BROOKS:  Well, there are different reasons for each of them.But, for example, as Congressman Jim Jordan just pointed out, some of themquite clearly violated Article 1, Section 4 of the United StatesConstitution, the election clause. That empowers the United States Congressparamount authority and then legislatures secondary authority to set thetimes, places and manner of elections.Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin all clearly violated Article 1,Section 4. So, we can either ratify that with our votes, that illegalconduct, or we can oppose it.I stand for opposing the violation of the United States Constitution,federal statutes and state statutes.BARTIROMO:  OK. OK.Let's take a short break, and then get deeper into this evidence that youwill present and talk about on Wednesday, and what this looks like for thejoint session of Congress.We're talking with Mo Brooks and Jim Jordan.And we will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.We are back with Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mo Brooks, who are leading theRepublican election challenge on the House on Wednesday.Congressman Brooks, before we went to the break, you said that you wantedto layout the evidence. I want to do that right now. I know you both arefacing real challenge and pressure from establishment players, from theleadership in the Senate.You say you have seen evidence of fraud. Lay it out for us, Congressman.BROOKS:  Well, it's difficult to do in such a short period of time, but Iwill give it a shot.Let's talk about Nevada, just for example. Joe Biden purportedly prevailedby 33,000, plus or minus, votes. Yet there have been over 130,000, 130,000votes identified that were illegal. Non-citizens were voting, roughly4,000. Individuals, roughly 40,000, voted twice, not once, but twice, inthis election. Of course, that's illegal.You have got people who purported to live at an address that doesn't exist,people who purported to live at an address that is a business address,where, of course, nobody lives. You have got dead people voting; 130,000,add it all up in the state of Nevada, and I'm quite confident that,overwhelmingly, they voted for Joe Biden. You remove those from theequation, and Donald Trump carried Nevada.You can go to Georgia, where you have videotape of poll workers ordering,ordering the media and poll watchers to leave. And they use that as anexcuse some kind of pipe leak, OK? And they announce that they're not goingto vote anymore -- they're not going to count any more votes, quite clearlya lie.There was no pipe leak of the kind expressed. There was a leak in a toilet12 hours earlier. That was fixed 12 hours earlier, so that couldn't havebeen the justification. Yet that was the excuse used.So, why are these people lying? Well, right after they lie and tell peoplethey are going to stop counting votes, right after the poll watchers andthe media leave, they pull out four suitcases full of ballots and startdoing what they said they weren't going to do, and that's continued tocount votes.We don't know where those ballots came from, but that sure is bad-lookingon the security cameras that they probably didn't know about when they pullout suitcases...BARTIROMO:  Yes.BROOKS:  ... that are hidden under a table and start counting them.Then you have got the massive violation of Article 1, Section 4, wheremail-in balloting is not allowed. Congress, pursuant to its powers inArticle 1, Section 4, established a day for the election. That's a 24-hourwindow.BARTIROMO:  Yes.BROOKS:  We set exceptions for certain absentee ballot purposes. People areoverseas, people are disabled, what have you.But this mail-out ballot scheme, that is in direct violation of Article 1,Section 4.BARTIROMO:  Yes.BROOKS:  That is in direct violation of the statutes of the United StatesCongress. Those are illegal votes.And by way of example, in Georgia, if you exclude illegal votes, only countlawful votes cast by eligible American citizens...BARTIROMO:  Yes.BROOKS:  ... David Perdue won on November 3. He should not be in a run-off.And the Senate ought to act accordingly, under Article 1, Section 5 of theConstitution.BARTIROMO:  Well, Congressman Jordan, this is just what you said in termsof the mail-in ballots and the Constitution violated.Why wasn't any of this investigated, Congressman?(LAUGHTER)JORDAN:  Well...BARTIROMO:  I mean, look, you should have had the FBI and the DOJ talkingabout what Mo Brooks just talked about.JORDAN:  Look, Maria, we put out a report back in September. And we calledthis.The Oversight Committee and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee put outthis report. And we said Democrats were going to do this. In fact, wecalled this last summer. We said, on election night, President Trump isgoing to be winning, but Democrats want the chaos and confusion createdaround mail-in voting.We had a staff member, Maria, who got four ballots sent to her residencehere in D.C., her ballot and four others of people who no longer livethere. So, they wanted this chaos and confusion because they were going towin the election after the election..And that's what they did with this crazy mail-in ballot scheme that theyundertook. And in several states, as we pointed out, as Senator Cruz haspointed out, as Representative Brooks has pointed out, several of thesestates did it in an unconstitutional fashion.That is the heart of our argument. So, let's have the debate on Wednesday.Let's show the American people what took place. They haven't had that.There have been no hearings.We have called for hearings and investigations in Congress. Jerry Nadlerand Chairwoman Maloney won't hold them here in the United States House ofRepresentatives. So, we have to have this debate on the 6th of January onthis Wednesday, so the American people can see what was done in anunconstitutional fashion.BARTIROMO:  Can they come back to you and say, look, COVID justified mail-in ballots; that's why counties upon counties were littered with ballots?JORDAN:  Maria, as this -- as the attorney general said, the Constitutionis not suspended during a crisis. You can still do it in a constitutionalfashion.In fact, millions of Americans did. They voted in a constitutional way.Millions of states didn't go around their election law, go around threatelections. The state legislature sets the time, place, and manner forelections in the respective states, not the Supreme Court, not thesecretary of state, not the governor, not some county clerk, not Facebook,not Twitter, but the state legislature.And when they violate that rule, that disenfranchises millions of votersacross this country. That is the heart of this issue. And three of thesestates in particular, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, definitely had thatproblem. And the others did to some degree as well, on top of the fraudthat Mr. Brooks has pointed out.BARTIROMO:  Mo Brooks, your final word here.I mean, what is this going to look like? If you're going to object to sixstates, and then you have got a two-hour debate, we're not going to learnthe results here until -- well, we're not going to learn on January 6.That's for sure. This goes into January 7.Tell me how this plays out, because you have got to get the majority of theHouse and Senate to go along where you are.BROOKS:  Well, how it plays out, quite frankly, is dependent upon theAmerican people.This is an organic movement that has risen up from angry American voters,70-plus million, who have been disenfranchised by voter fraud and electiontheft.To the extent they contact their senators and their congressmen and demandhonest and accurate elections, then we're going to win this fight onJanuary 6. But if the American people do not rise up, if they don't contacttheir senators, if they don't contact their congressmen, demanding thattheir congressmen and senators do the right thing for our republic, well,then we're not going to win on January 6.So, I urge all Americans to participate in this fight on behalf of theircountry, on behalf of their republic, and, of course, the election systemthat is the underpinning of any republic.BARTIROMO:  I know, so far, this has been a lonely place for you both.Thanks very much for your courage. Thanks for joining us this morning,Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mo Brooks.BROOKS:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  We, of course, will be watching and covering it.Coming up, the other only race that matters right now, and the GOPincumbent at the center of Georgia's high-stakes run-off elections thisTuesday.Georgia Senator David Perdue is here on the state of the race.Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  If we pick up these two Republican seats inGeorgia, we have the ability to stop the most radical agenda in the historyof the United States.Kevin McCarthy can slow it down. Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and otherscan stop it, only if we win Georgia. We have to win these two seats inGeorgia. I'm confident that we will.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  That was Senator Lindsey Graham on this program a few weeks agolaying out the high stakes of this upcoming Tuesday's Senate run-off racesin Georgia, with incumbent Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loefflercampaigning as the last line of defense against the progressive liberalsocialist agenda.President Trump and Joe Biden will both be in the Peach State tomorrow inan effort to tip the scales of these razor-tight contests.Joining me right now is Georgia Senator David Perdue.Good morning, Senator. Thanks for being here.First off, how are you feeling in terms of COVID? Have you had anysymptoms? Are you now negative?SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA):  My wife and I are great. Thanks for asking.We have tested negative again. That's three negative tests in the last fewdays. So, we continue to follow the protocol and doctor's advice and beingvery careful here.BARTIROMO:  Senator, we have been talking this morning about what will takeplace on Wednesday in the joint session of Congress, where a number of yourcolleagues will object to the results of the presidential election.Will you object?PERDUE:  You know, when I first saw the magnitude of the irregularitiesback in December, early December, about our November race, I called for theresignation of our secretary of state.I repeatedly called for a special session of the General Assembly toinvestigate. None of that happened. And so I started calling out for -- theonly thing left for the president is for us to object. And I agreed that Iwould do that.The technical problem is that I won't be certified until this election iscertified some week to 10 days after the election, when we win on Tuesday.But I'm encouraging my colleagues to object.This is something that the American people demand right now. You heard inthe last section that there are huge irregularities in Georgia. They needto be investigated. And they need to be corrected, in my opinion.BARTIROMO:  All right, so you are committing to object, despite the factthat, technically, you will not be a sitting senator until we have aclarification on the results of Tuesday.I want to ask you about the potential for voter fraud in Georgia. IsGeorgia prepared? What have you done? What has the -- have the Republicansdone to ensure that you have a safe and secure election on Tuesday?We know that Stacey Abrams has been bragging on Twitter that she hasregistered three million Georgians to vote early.PERDUE:  Well, there are three million people who have voted already.That's short of where we were in November. But what we have done is, wecalled the General Assembly to try to get this resolved. That hasn'thappened yet. So, we have done is, we have gone to court. We had a couplecases thrown out because they said, you got to go back to the legislature.But, in addition to that, we have hired -- we have doubled the number ofpoll workers. We have got cameras and people watching all the drop boxes.We're doing everything we can on the absentee ballots and on Election Daycounting to make sure what happened in November didn't happen.But, Maria, the big issue here is, there are still Republicans that areupset and mad about what happened in November, as I am. Look, I don't thinkI should be in this run-off, if everything had happened the way it shouldhave in November.But the only recourse we have is to get out and fight and rise up and voteon January 5, next -- or this coming Tuesday. So, that's the only recoursewe have now.BARTIROMO:  Your opponent, Jon Ossoff, has been out tweeting aboutfollowing the results.And he put out this tweet. And I want to get your comment about it. JonOssoff tweeted out that for people to follow Xinhua News. This is theChinese state media. "Especially during the 18th Party Congress, followXinhua Chinese state media."What is he saying here?PERDUE:  Well, this evolving scandal with Jon Ossoff is becoming more andmore clear, that the Chinese Communist Party, as you called out, hasidentified young ambitious young people in America to try to influence.You see the Eric Swalwell crisis right now. You see the Hunter Bidenscandal. And now we see the evolving Jon Ossoff problem that he has withChina. He was paid by them for two years. He's been encouraging people tofollow the Chinese propaganda. That's what Xinhua does, and that's whatPCCW does.And he participated in that for two years. He hid it from the people ofGeorgia during his primary, got caught, lied about it, finally disclosedit, and then lied about it again.So, this is a young man that has not come clean about China. He was askedthis week on FOX News what he thought about it, and he accused the reporterof being a serious journalist and shouldn't ask the question.He's never answered the question about his relationship with the CCP,Maria.BARTIROMO:  Do you believe we will see a winner on Tuesday night? What ifit is contested once again? Here we are on January 3 still talking aboutNovember 3. What do you expect Tuesday?PERDUE:  I expect a big win.We're going to get our vote out on Tuesday. We know this is the last lineof defense. We know that Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will be nothing buta rubber stamp for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and this radicalsocialist agenda.They have said as much. They have not addressed the issues. And the onlything they really care about is giving Chuck Schumer two more votes in theUnited States Senate. That'll give them total control, and it'll change theface of America. That's the issue here.We will fix the election problems, but we have got to hold the line in thiselection Tuesday. And it's in our hands. It's in Republican conservativehands, Maria. If we get out and vote and fight for America, we can winGeorgia and save America. That's what's at stake Tuesday.BARTIROMO:  All right, Senator, we will be watching, of course.Thanks very much for being here, Senator David Perdue. We will see yousoon.Coming up, freshman Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is here, andDemocratic state Representative Vernon Jones on why they're calling onmembers of their respective parties to take a stand against election fraudwhen Congress meets to count the electoral votes on Wednesday.We continue the conversation when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Well, welcome back.It may come as a surprise that one of the most-talked about figures in theGeorgia Senate run-offs is not even on the ballot.Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams took credit for deliveringGeorgia for Joe Biden. Now she's boasting that she has registered nearlythree million early voters for Tuesday's races, this as her sister, anObama-appointed judge, has refused to recuse herself this week in a Georgiavoter eligibility challenge just days before the big election.Joining us right now are Vernon Jones -- he's a Democrat Georgia staterepresentative -- and freshman Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.Great to have you both. Thank you so much for joining us.And I want to kick it off with Georgia.Vernon, can you walk us through what is taking place with Stacey Abrams andher sister? This certainly looks like a conflict.STATE REP. VERNON JONES (D-GA):  Well, you know Stacey Abrams was involvedwith the previous administration, Obama and Biden, on getting her sisterthat judgeship.Now here it comes full circle, where there's a case that was pending beforeher sister where Stacey had a vested interest in her organization, and hersister ruled in their favor.Now, there's something called discretion. That judge, her sister, isprobably a good judge, but she made a poor decision. She was a badpolitician. On the other hand, Stacey Abrams may be a good politician, butshe's a bad lawyer. She knows that that gives the impression of improprietyfor her sister to be making that type of ruling in her favor.And Georgians see that, and they don't appreciate that. Her sister, thejudge, could have used any of the other judges in that district to makethat decision, but she took it upon herself. These are two siblings, onewho has a case before the other, and have a vested interest. And they helpeach other.When she helped get the judgeship, now she's returning the favor. At leastthat's what the many see as happening.BARTIROMO:  Well, this is just one of the issues, Congresswoman Greene,that voters are saying looks bad, and raises an eyebrow, and one of thereasons that you say you will contest the results of the 2020 presidentialelection during the joint session of Congress on Wednesday.Tell us what you're planning.MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R), GEORGIA CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT:  Absolutely.I have said from the beginning I join Mo Brooks in our objection to thestolen election. I believe it's our duty as members of Congress to upholdthe Constitution and defend the integrity of our elections.And I intend to do that. The people of this country, Americans, by themillions, 75 million people reelected Donald J. Trump on November 3, andthey are screaming from the rooftops that they know this election wasstolen. We have got so many people that have signed affidavits, at risk ofperjury, telling about election fraud.We have all the situations in Georgia, such as Vernon just spoke about. AndI thank him for speaking up and telling the truth and serving Georgians,like he always does. But we have a true crisis.And this isn't about political parties. This isn't about Republican andDemocrat. This is not about President Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is aboutthe truth and defending the people's vote.And it's appalling to me that our state leaders in Georgia are notlistening to the people and doing what they're asking, is a complete auditof every single machine and all of the ballots. They need to be listeningto the people, because it's the taxpayers that pay for the ballots, pay forthe machines, and pay for the elections.And that goes for every single state across the country. We know that thishas really been a stolen election. I have seen the evidence, and that's whyI intend to object on January 6.BARTIROMO:  So, how does that play out? You will object. And then there isa two-hour debate period, where you each will get, what, five minutes tomake the case?Will you present new evidence? President Trump said there will be newevidence to present. And the campaign says it will present that onWednesday. Is that part of the five-minute speeches?TAYLOR GREENE:  Well, I don't want to reveal our full plan, because younever want the enemy to know what you're up to. And we clearly have enemiesin this country that want to stop President Trump from being president forfour more years and serving the American people like he has.You know, what we're going to do on January 6 is, we have over 100 membersof Congress. And that is growing. I hear from new members every single day,as I have been on the phone working hard trying to get people to join in.Our senators, we have a dozen, but guess what? There's going to be moresenators leading in this objection. We will be raising our objections. Andwe will have sponsors and co-sponsors for each state.Once we do that, the chambers will separate. The House will go its way. TheSenate will go its way. And then that's where we begin our debates, whereeach member has five minutes on the floor. And I think it should be a full-on debate, because we have to fight this out for the American people. Andthat's what we have to be doing.We have to make sure we get this right.BARTIROMO:  Vernon Jones, I want to get your take on this.Let's slip in a short break and then come back to discuss the ongoinginvestigation into Stacey Abrams' voter group, accusations theyaggressively registered ineligible out-of-state and deceased voters for theJanuary 5 run-offs.All that coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.We are back with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Georgia stateRepresentative Vernon Jones.Representative Jones, I want to get back to you.You consider yourself a conservative Democrat. You did endorse Perdue andLoeffler. And the president has warned that Democrats are going to try tocheat in Georgia. There are lingering questions about how the electionobviously was conducted.How secure do you believe this Georgia run-off race will be on Tuesday?JONES:  Well, let me be clear about something, Maria.I put my country before my party. I'm trying to save our democraticrepublic, not our Democratic Party.And so many people feel in this state and across this country that therewas not a free, fair and transparent election. And this is a -- and itshould be a very bipartisan issue to make sure that every legal vote iscounted and counted properly. And so...BARTIROMO:  That's right.JONES:  ... election integrity is important.It is very important that we give trust or we provide trust to the Americanpeople that they feel like, when they go and vote, that they're voting, andit's going to be free, and it's going to be fair, it's going to betransparent, and it's going to be accurate, and their expression was made.BARTIROMO:  Yes.JONES:  But what you see has happened is, the Democratic Party, I'm justappalled at the fact that they are not as upset about what has happened.BARTIROMO:  Right.JONES:  And let me tell you, it's voter suppression for African-Americans,who feel like their vote was not counted.So, that's not a Democratic thing.BARTIROMO:  So...JONES:  Republicans -- there are blacks who voted for this president whofeel like their votes have not been counted.BARTIROMO:  Right.JONES:  And so it's no -- it's partisan -- it's nonpartisan. We have tofight for free and fair and...(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO:  Which is why, Congresswoman, you are going to object.You're talking about 24 hours of debate over 12 hours, because you have gottwo hours per state per chamber.Congresswoman, do you believe you can be successful in terms of overturningthe election results?TAYLOR GREENE:  You know, Maria, I believe anything is possible.And I believe we have to fight. The American people, people that vote forRepublicans are fed up with the Republican Party when they lay down andjust hand something over. And, right now, it is a critical time for everysingle Republican in the House and in the Senate to stand up and fightright now for this president and for the American people's vote.It's not a political party issue. It's an issue of our integrity of ourelections.(CROSSTALK)   BARTIROMO:  OK. It is a monumental week.We so appreciate you joining us, Congresswoman-elect Marjorie TaylorGreene, Georgia state Representative Vernon Jones.Have a great day.
