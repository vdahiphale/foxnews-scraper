'Off the Record,' 10/30/14: Should we lighten up on kids who do the stupid things that kids do?

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Should we lighten up on kids? Of course, vandalism is wrong, it's against the law. Cheating in school, that's wrong, too. I wonder if the punishment these days for children acting stupid like children do can be too harsh?
I read about kids getting caught cheating and getting thrown out of school. That's an academic death penalty. If the kid gets picked up for minor vandalism -- more like a prank -- he gets tossed into juvenile court system. Juvenile court will certainly change your life and not in a good way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, when I was a little kid and got caught cheating -- and don't tell me if you never did -- or if did you the unthinkable, minor vandalism, and I mean minor, like a prank, you get a different punishment. You got dragged home to your parents and they took care of it and that could be hellish. You didn't get tossed into the juvenile cellblock. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, on the 50th anniversary of my getting picked up by the police in Appleton, Wisconsin for soaping windows -- yes, I was a little kid and very stupid kid at that -- it was enough to catch hell from my parents. And I think I turned out OK. Certainly, not perfectly, but OK. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, I was not the only culprit that night. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
