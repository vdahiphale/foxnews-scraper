NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  The first shots in a matter of days.The word out of the United Kingdom now that it is officially sanctioned andsaid it can go ahead and see Pfizer and BioNTech come up and out with avaccine, oddly before U.S. authorities here do the same.But it doesn't matter. People are going to be getting it. And more arecoming on the way.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.And we are looking at a stunning development, when people thought it wasunthinkable, impossible that, in the middle of a pandemic that was grippingthe world, that a vaccine, two, maybe three, could be available by yearend. One is out there now. A couple are waiting at planes at La Guardia.So it does seem that they're coming soon and they're coming fast. Andthey're going to be in millions of doses by the end of the year, possiblymore than a billion doses in the new year.What to make of this with Laura Ingle and the fallout in this country, andthen, of course, Greg Palkot with the fallout from London that, well, got ajump on this country.We begin with Laura in Malverne, New York -- Laura.LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, the CDC's advisory committee made that vote last night that basicallygreen-lights a plan of action of getting a couple of groups ready to go,front of the line when this vaccine, maybe one or the two that are on thetable right now, in front of the FDA get approved.Those are the front-line health care workers and those living in long-termcare facilities. Now, the panel of outside scientific experts who make upthe CDC's advisory committee voted 13-1 last night to recommend those twocritical groups.The news comes just as Britain, as you mentioned, gave emergencyauthorization today to Pfizer, something Health and Human ServicesSecretary Alex Azar says should be reassuring for Americans, as the FDAworks through its own process to ensure the vaccine is safe and effectivefor use here.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ALEX AZAR, U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY:  They have a verydetailed approach. They look under the hood. They're going to look at allthe data to make sure that it proves to be as good as it appears.And we will have that meeting of our advisory committee on December 10.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGLE:  And, Neil, just hours ago, the CDC also released revised guidanceon quarantine time for those who may have been exposed to the coronavirusand have tested negative.They're moving the goalposts from 14 days to seven days, and then 10 daysfor those who have not been tested at all. And the director of the CDCsays, while all of this is very encouraging news, we still have the nextseveral months, which they predict to be some of the toughest months of thepandemic, ahead of us.And they're also asking people today not to travel for the holidays. We sawhow that went for Thanksgiving, but that's the recommendation from the CDCtoday -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much for that, Laura Ingle.Now let's skip across the pond here, the Atlantic Ocean, more to the point,Greg Palkot in London with the fallout there, that it got regulatory firstapproval in London than in the United States. It's not meant to disparageanything here in this country, just different time standards, differentallowances for different things.Greg, what are you hearing?GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, it's big stuff here andpossibly big relief, as the U.K. becoming the very first country to giveapproval to a rigorously tested COVID-19 vaccine, getting that emergencyauthorization, a vaccine from the German firm BioNTech and, yes, theAmerican pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.In studies, it was proven to be 95 percent effective in dealing with thecoronavirus. Some 800,000 doses will be distributed here starting nextweek. It takes two doses within a month for treatment, millions moreexpected.First to get, very similar to the United States, nursing home residents andstaff, front-line doctors, medical, social workers, then the elderly, thevulnerable, and working your way down.Here is how U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described it:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT HANCOCK, BRITISH HEALTH SECRETARY:  In our battle against the virus,help is on its way. Today is a triumph for all those who believe inscience, a triumph for ingenuity, a triumph for humanity.(END VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT:  There are hitches, though, Neil.Maybe the biggest, these vaccines have to be stored and transported atsuper cold temperatures, about 100 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. But thecompany say they have special dry ice shipping containers which have GPSmonitors in them, and they should be able to handle it, just in time, Neil.The U.K. authorities have announced just in the past 24 hours here in theU.K. there were 650 more deaths due to COVID-19. Of course, the U.S. willbe watching very closely as the U.K. starts this, rolls it out, to see howit will go -- back to you.CAVUTO:  All right, and that could all be within 48 hours.Greg Palkot, thank you very, very much.So, the implications of all of this not only for this Pfizer offering, butthe others that are out there.Dr. Mike Varshavski joins us right now, the board-certified family medicinephysician,Doctor, very good to have you.How will this process go then, Doctor? What do you think?rMD-UL_DR. MIKE VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN:  Hey, Neil. Thankyou so much for having me.It's an exciting day for us in the health care community. We have beenbattling this virus on the front lines for going on nine, 10 months now,these trials have been going on for that same period of time. And so far,the results have been so reassuring.We have tens of thousands of candidates in randomized controlled studiesproving the effectiveness and safety of this vaccine. To us, effectivenessis equally, if not more important, than safety. So, to have both of thoseboxes checked at this time is amazing.And, Neil, we did this in a span of 10 months in a process that usuallyshould take 10 years.CAVUTO:  Incredible.VARSHAVSKI:  And it's really been an incredible undertaking, comingtogether, technology working with us.But, Neil, I do have a concern. Because, right now, the CDC has beenworking with their advisory committee, the ACIP, the Advisory Committee forImmunization Practices, and they have recommended that health careprofessionals on the front lines and long-term care residents get thisvaccine first, that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen, because this isultimately still going to be under state control in how they want toadminister vaccines.I hope that it happens in this manner, because these are the highest-riskgroups, especially the long-term care residents, Neil. Forty percent of alldeaths related to COVID-19 came in this vulnerable, frail population, andwe need to get them vaccinated.CAVUTO:  So how does this work, then, Doctor?I understand, I think I heard it correctly, 20 million doses would beavailable this year. But, really, it would be for 10 million individuals,because they get two doses, right, over time. How does it work?VARSHAVSKI:  Well, Neil, the way that it works is, it's going to be unclearfrom the outset of how many people are going to get it how quickly.We're just making a lot of predictions right now based on how many peopleare going to get it, how many are going to be shipped appropriately. And wedo have Operation Warp Speed in effect, but our dates are not yet perfectlyset. And I know, like, the whole purpose of us discussing this right now isthe differences between the U.S. and Europe and who is going to get thevaccine first.Ultimately, it's not even clear right now, Neil. In Germany, for example,they're hoping to get the vaccine ready to go in mid-December, yet the E.U.is aiming for regulatory approval in late December. So, right now, thedates are not clear, the numbers are unclear. That should not be what we'refocusing on right now.What we should be focusing on is that there is, in fact, a vaccine that'sefficacious, that is safe. We have multiple options. Each come with theirown challenges, because, as your colleague said, they need to be storeddifferently, they need to be administered differently.But if we take this seriously, and we continue doing all the safetyguidelines laid out by the CDC, we can have a positive return back tonormal in 2021.CAVUTO:  Doctor, how do you advise your patients, knowing that, besidesthis Pfizer/BioNTech drug and Moderna one to come -- and I know AstraZenecais getting a lot of attention, maybe the next to launch, Johnson & Johnson,a host of other players.I assume they will do different things. So you have to sort of play it byear then, right, yourself, don't you?VARSHAVSKI:  Well, Neil, that's not unusual for us.For example, when I want to give a patient the influenza vaccine, which wedo year in, year out, there are always multiple options, different brands,different formulations. For example, if you're over the age of 65, and youneed a flu vaccination, we give you one that is of higher potency, because,generally, your immune system needs that higher potency in order to kickin.So we are used to having multiple vaccine options available for patients.This is going to be nothing new for us. We just need to make sure that wedo this carefully, safely, and do not rush this process.CAVUTO:  Yes, you said that from the very beginning, Doctor. Wise words,then, wiser words now.Thank you. Very good seeing you. Continued good health yourself.VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  All right, Dr. Mike.Let's go to Ned Lamont. You know him, of course, the governor, beautifulstate of Connecticut, what he makes of all of this.You know, Governor, I understand that governors themselves, yourselfobviously included, will decide what works best in their respective states.Any early thoughts, sir, then, how you handle it in Connecticut, once youget enough available doses available?GOV. NED LAMONT (D-CT):  Yes, we get our first doses from Pfizer -- Neil,nice to see on -- the 14th.We're ready to roll that out of through our hospitals. Our hospitalsalready have the refrigeration units, so -- and those are the front-linefolks we need to take care of.But more complicated, we had to put together a vaccine advisory board madeup of ministers, made up the labor leaders, politicians, do everything wecould to give the community confidence that, when the vaccine is available,take it. It only works if you get the shot.CAVUTO:  Is it good enough for you, Governor, if the FDA says, ready to go,this is good stuff? Technically, it has not done so yet. Britain has donethat.And I'm told that there's no significance to that, just that the FDA isdotting the I's, crossing the T's, making sure it's effective and all that.But, until you get that, do you hold off, or what do you do?LAMONT:  People ask me that, and I say, look, I'm going to take the vaccineas soon as I can. I would like Dr. Fauci to take it first, if you want toknow what my seal of approval would be.(LAUGHTER)LAMONT:  But I have talked to Pfizer. I have talked to the pharmacompanies.I think maybe it got off to sort of a rushed or political start. But Ithink, here we are in December. I think they're ready to go, ready to do itsafely.CAVUTO:  You know, a lot of people have said, if not for Operation WarpSpeed, this effort to get this done, organized, searched out, remove thehurdles as quickly as possible, we might not be here today.Do you agree with that?LAMONT:  I'd say it's coming in the nick of time.I didn't want to wait another year. I can tell you that people areexhausted here in the state and throughout the region. We're -- still havea low rate at 5 percent. But, man, it's a lot more than it was a month ago.And people are tired. And they don't necessarily have the same disciplinethey did in the spring.So, thankfully, we can say there's an end zone in sight. And that's calledthe vaccine. So, be careful for a little bit longer.CAVUTO:  What are you advising for your residents, Governor, as far asgatherings?I know you put a limit on crowds at Thanksgiving. Dr. Fauci, you mentionedearlier, had been saying, we need one more holiday to get this right, limityour Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year's gatherings as much as possible, onelast attempt to get this from getting out of control.So, what are you planning for the holidays?LAMONT:  Well, Thanksgiving was a little small. And the kids are tired ofmy same old stories. I can tell you that.But I think the most important thing we can do is those informal socialgatherings. You can look at hockey rinks, you can look at restaurants, youcan even look at bars, because those are informal social gatherings.And that's where we got to be careful. So, you're right. We have said nomore than 10 people. Stick to your family as much as you can. That's howwe're going to power through this. That's the most important discipline youcan exact.CAVUTO:  So, I just want to be clear. You're telling me I should not see myin-laws? Just want to bounce this off my wife. Is that right?(LAUGHTER)LAMONT:  Well, if they're the 11th and 12th people, say, you would love tohave them, but the governor says no more than 10.CAVUTO:  Gotcha. All right, I will just say, the governor just said that.Governor Lamont, very good seeing you. Continued good health, sir. Weappreciate you taking the time.LAMONT:  Be good, Neil.Thanks, everybody.CAVUTO:  You know, we're focused on -- thank you, Governor.We're focused on Georgia right now, not only the continued count on theelection that was more than a month ago, but the upcoming Senate run-offelections right now, and the secretary of state looking into allegationsthat a number of progressive groups are trying to entice folks to move toGeorgia to vote in Georgia, and then they can go leave Georgia.There's only one teeny problem with that, if true. It's illegal -- afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA VOTING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER:  We doeverything we can within the bounds of law to assure that Georgians andonly Georgians are the ones who vote here who are legally registered andavailable to vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, the problem is, they can't be too sure of that.The Georgia secretary of state is now looking into allegations that anumber of progressive groups are trying to entice those who live outsidethe state to temporarily move in, vote in Georgia, presumably for theDemocratic senatorial candidates.And then they can do what they want. There's just one little problem withthat. It is illegal. You can't do that.But Jonathan Serrie following some of these fast-moving developments andwhat the charges actually are -- Jonathan.JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Neil.Well, George's Republican secretary of state is really fighting forces onthe left and the right. He's trying to ward off legal challenges byRepublican electors who want to gain access to the state's voting machines,conducting forensic investigations, which state officials say wouldactually cause potential security breaches.At the same time, the secretary of state has launched an investigation intoliberal groups allegedly trying to register out-of-state or deceasedresidents to vote in the January 5 Senate run-offs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STERLING:  We have New Georgia Project that you might know associated withStacey Abrams and Raphael Warnock that sent voter registration forms to NewYork City.So, we're continuing to dig in this investigation. We're finding more andmore information every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE:  Meanwhile, a progressive political action committee has purchasedad space on nine billboards across Georgia, not to rally Democrats so much,but to exploit divisions among Republican voters who are torn betweenloyalty to their party and President Trump.While this unusual tactic, it's not illegal, it is raising some eyebrows.Now, Neil, tonight at midnight is the deadline for all 159 Georgia countiesto finish their machine recounts of ballots in the presidential racerequested by the Trump campaign. Already, 132 counties have wrapped uptheir tallies, and state elections officials expect that the remaining 27will finish well in advance of the midnight deadline -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very, very much, Jonathan Serrie.Again, that count that Jonathan was referring to, the hand count of theelection, does seem to closely mirror what these Dominion systems' voteswere, almost to an individual vote.The read on all of this and what's going on now in the Senate run-offelection with the lieutenant governor of Georgia, Geoff Duncan.Governor, thank you for joining us again. Very good to see you, sir.LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA):  Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Neil.CAVUTO:  Let me ask you first about the hand count right now. This is thethird vote going through all of the votes right now.And up to now, it seems that the counts have pretty closely matched thesemachine-processed Dominion system votes, uncannily so. So, what can weconclude from that?DUNCAN:  Yes, not a lot has changed the last few weeks, Neil.We continue to watch now our final count, recount, which was asked for bythe president. And I think all signs point to the results continuing tomatch the other counts that we have had, so not a lot of news with --pertains to the outcome.But I will tell you, the mountains of misinformation continue to flow in atan alarming pace. And it is very -- it's very alarming to me.CAVUTO:  All right, that misinformation is -- are you saying thatmisinformation is coming from the president?I know he's disparaged some things you have said, what the governor hassaid, what the secretary of state has said. You want to clarify?DUNCAN:  Yes, that information -- misinformation is coming from everysingle angle, Neil.And I got to tell you, it's disheartening. It's definitely not our finestmoment. We continue to get hundreds, if not thousands of pieces ofmisinformation flowing in almost by the hour from folks seeing something onFacebook or Twitter. And it takes 10 seconds to debunk.And, really, I think the troubling part to me, Neil, is that so much ofthis is flying in just under the premise of not rooting out fraud, but tosimply try to flip an election. And, certainly, my job is too important totake that bait.I'm going to continue to work with the secretary of state and attorneygeneral to make sure we have a fair, legal election.CAVUTO:  All right, I assume what you're referring to is the president'scharge that thousands of votes that went to him are not coming up in thesecounts and recounts.Can you unequivocally state that is not the case?DUNCAN:  Yes, so we're four weeks into this, Neil, four weeks into this.And we have not seen -- the attorney general, the secretary of state, theinvestigators have not seen any signs of systemic or organized fraud.And, Neil, I got to be honest with you. As a Georgian, as the lieutenantgovernor of this state, I'm proud of that. Even though the guy I voted forisn't going to win Georgia, I'm still proud that we were able to put on afair, legal election.CAVUTO:  Now, he is going to be in your state on this weekend, in whichhe's going to try to help out those Republican senatorial candidates.Do you think his actions have hurt them?DUNCAN:  Well, look, my encouragement -- and I have said this a couple oftimes to our senators that we're fighting hard for, to the president and toRepublicans as a whole -- we need to redirect our post-election focus here.Short term, we need to make sure that we send two Republican senators backto the Senate, not just for us here in Georgia, but for Republicans allover the state -- all over the country.But also, long term, we got to protect this Republican brand. We are biggerthan one person. We need to -- we need to continue to champion and see thewins that President Trump had for us. I mean, his policy positions werephenomenal. The grounds gained by an outsider were awesome and should bechampioned.But there's more work to be done. I think this Republican Party can getbetter. I think we can take on some big issues, like immigration reform,like health care. These are big issues that we can gain ground on in thecoming years.CAVUTO:  Will you support him, the president, if he runs again in 2024?He's hinting at that.DUNCAN:  Well, look, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to project out fouryears from now. I think we have got a lot of time to keep working hard.And I think, look, this is an important reminder, Neil. On January 20, whenVice President Biden is sworn in as president, this will still be America,and we will still have the Constitution to protect our conservative pointof view.And I'm going to fight hard to protect small business owners that can'tafford tax increases. I'm going to support folks like myself that want theSecond Amendment to be strong. Those are things that the Constitutionaffords us the rights to have. And I'm going to fight hard for.CAVUTO:  Are you going to meet the president when he comes to your statethis weekend?DUNCAN:  I got good news. I'm actually hanging out with my three kids allweekend, and so excited about it. My wife and I have got plans with thekids, but certainly wish him the best of luck.I hope Senator Loeffler and Senator Perdue are able to rally up a lot ofsupport and get folks to show up for them on January 5, because I'mcounting on it. I know Republicans all across this country are counting onthem winning. And we need them.CAVUTO:  All right.So, to be clear, you will be with your kids. Great. You're a great dad.There's no denying that. But you will not be meeting with the president?DUNCAN:  No, sir. I'm going to be hanging out with my three boys.CAVUTO:  OK.Governor, thank you very much, Geoff Duncan, the Georgia lieutenantgovernor.We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, you are looking at the 737 MAX, American Airlinesshowing off the brand-new Boeing plane and inviting media and a lot of thecorporate types to go for a spin from Tulsa to Dallas.Everything went OK.Back after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, another big company from Silicon Valley is sayinggoodbye to Silicon Valley, not entirely, but Hewlett-Packard Enterprisesindicating it's going to move a lot of its operations to Houston, Texas.Sam Liccardo joins us right now, the mayor of San Jose. He has been doinghis best to stop this sort of thing, but it has happened yet again.Mayor, very good to have you. What do you make of this?Now, it looks like, reading from Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' comments onthis, that it's not abandoning your area, but it certainly is cutting downits presence in your area. Does it alarm you?SAM LICCARDO, MAYOR OF SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA:  Well, certainly, it's awakeup call for all of us, Neil.And the good news is, here in the city of San Jose, they're actually addinghundreds of employees, because they're consolidating their operations herein Silicon Valley, in my city.But we are seeing the headquarters move. And we know that this is a storywe have seen before, that, certainly, for the kind of talent that youreally need to find in Silicon Valley, that highly specialized, if it'saround artificial intelligence, or engineering, or software, you will findit in Silicon Valley, and folks will want to locate here.But if you're looking to expand operations for accountants, or lawyers, oradministrative assistants, you can do that in a lot of other places for alot less. And we have got to do more to make this region and the state moreaffordable.CAVUTO:  You have been trying to address that.You were reelected in 2018 with more than 75 percent of the vote at thetime, and largely by taking on unions and entrenched pension-fundedorganizations, where you just wanted to ease back on those obligations,because they're a good reason why San Jose and other areas across thecountry that have similar issues are so pricey, and, well, actually beingpriced out, and having companies move.But that apparently wasn't, isn't enough. So what does the state have todo, do you think?LICCARDO:  Well, the biggest challenge I think we all have is with housingcosts. It makes it so expensive to live here. Obviously, companies need topay a lot just to keep people here.And there's a lot more we need to do to ramp up production. We cancertainly get some of the red tape out of the way. And I appreciate somerecent efforts of the governor, for example, to be able to, for example,waive CEQA on the construction of affordable housing we need for homelessresidents, for example.And that enabled us to build three separate developments in four months,rather than four years. Those are the kinds of things we need to do. Itmostly is just getting out of the way.But, also, we need to be more innovative in how we're building housing.We're using a lot of different technologies, for example, prefab andmodular housing. And that takes local bureaucracies to be able to benimble, to enable the permit those kinds of things, make sure they're safe,but obviously still allow the innovation.So, housing is really a core of it. But we know there's a lot else goingon. It's taxes. It's regulation. It's a lot of issues where I think we justneed to be very cognizant in California. We have been taking it for grantedfor too long that tech employers want to be here.That won't happen forever.CAVUTO:  Did you offer an alternative deal to Hewlett-Packard Enterprisesfrom making this move? Or did they say, our mind is made up, we're buildingthis big facility in Houston, we're going there?LICCARDO:  No, I have been very clear that we don't want to offer companiesdeals of any kind. When Amazon was announcing its beauty contest for themove of its headquarters, I wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journalsaying, thanks, but we're not giving you any money.I don't believe in giving taxpayer money to companies. And H.P. never askedfor it. To their credit, they have been completely aboveboard with us. Iunderstood clearly why they'd be going to Houston. They have a lot ofoperations already there and a lot of employees.But for those headquarters operations, you don't necessarily need the toptechnical talent. They can keep all of that here in Silicon Valley. Andthey can hire elsewhere.CAVUTO:  You know, do you think it's about more than taxes, though, and thecost of living, Mayor?I know you have apologized for this incident where you joined your familyfor Thanksgiving. It was quite a large gathering, larger maybe than evenyou suspected. But it came at a time when number of other top politicians,mostly Democrats, I hate to say that to you, did one thing and practicedanother.Do you think that people look at that, Mayor, and say, the guy's ahypocrite?LICCARDO:  Sure. I recognize folks will come to those kinds of conclusions.And I made a mistake, and I own it. And I certainly should have been moreastute about the specifics of the regulations.I knew that there were advisories, and I simply should have been moreastute to it. And I -- as I learned, when the media reported that I was athome, we immediately disclosed, no, actually, I was at my parents' house.And that's how all this came out.So, I have (AUDIO GAP) going forward and, certainly, I'm going to dobetter.CAVUTO:  When you entered your relatives' house, did you notice, oh, wow,there's a big crowd here, and I'm the mayor of San Jose, and I have justbeen telling my constituents, keep it small, keep it limited?LICCARDO:  No. No, I can't claim to have been...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Did you think, I'm looking a little hypocritical?LICCARDO:  The reality is, I have got a big family. I'm one of five kids.And so, typically, Thanksgiving for us is 25 people. We actually had eightadults dining at the same time. And the problem was, under the state rules,you can only have three households. And so we had too many householdsthere, even though all of us -- many of us had been dining together everyweek.Simply, the rules have changed, obviously, as we have gone into -- deeperinto the -- this challenging period of high infection spread. And I shouldhave known better. I should have done better.CAVUTO:  Well, unlike a lot of other politicians who did the exact samething, you got ahead of it. You apologized for it. You did so again. Ifmore did, maybe we would just -- it would be easier to move on.Mayor, thank you very, very much. Good having you. Be well. Let's see howthe whole Hewlett-Packard thing goes.LICCARDO:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  All right, the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, on that.In the meantime, this growing concern of keeping a prosecutor going toexplore Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election that has itsorigins in something that Joe Biden once thought was a very good idea, thisvery thing -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, here in a nutshell was Democrats' prominent reaction toBill Barr appointing John Durham as a special prosecutor to look into thewhole Russia and the investigation mess that followed on all of that.But they might want to be a little careful criticizing it, because no lessthan Joe Biden had been warning back in 1987 that such prosecutors aren't abad idea, quoting here: "History proves that those who would strike downthe independent counsel statute as unconstitutional base their claim on aflawed factual premise. History teaches that prosecutions have not alwaysbeen controlled by the attorney general, and that they have not always beenpublic. In my view, the independent counsel statute can and shouldwithstand constitutional scrutiny."To John Yoo, the former deputy assistant attorney general on, all of that.What do you make of that, John? Because here we go with yet another one onthis, where I guess Joe Biden could contend, well, this is a good idea. Idon't think he's saying that. But what do you think?JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Well, Neil, I thinkthat Joe Biden wished that there were no Internet where you could easilyfind articles and speeches that he gave when the independent counsel lawwent to the Supreme Court for the first time back in 1987.And, in fact, Joe Biden loved special counsels so much then that he wantedthem to have even more independence and more protection than Durham has. Hewanted to make it almost impossible for presidents to order independentcounsels around or fire them.The one that we have now, the independent counsel is really under thecontrol of the attorney general, still can be fired by the president. But,more importantly, look at what he said in the quote that you just read.Biden should welcome John Durham's appointment, because he said, eventhough the president should generally control prosecution, when we have toinvestigate the highest-ranking members of the government or the JusticeDepartment themselves, then we got to have independence.And independence means a special prosecutor like Durham.CAVUTO:  So, what happens to Durham? What can he do? Obviously, Illinoisinvestigation will continue. He will have to bring him or whatever he'scoming to find to whoever Joe Biden's attorney general is going to be.Explain that process.YOO:  He can basically do everything that Robert Mueller did. He's going tobe able to hire up a full staff. He's going to have a pretty large budget.And, most importantly, he's going to be able to follow the evidencewherever it leads him. And that's what I think ought to worry Biden, justlike independent counsels tormented Clinton, tormented Trump, tormentedReagan, because it may start off on one subject. He's going to follow theevidence. Other things may come to light.You never know. And so that's why presidents end up burning up a lot oftime and energy and find these kinds of investigations quite crippling.Durham is going to start by looking at, what were the origins of this probeinto Russia collusion? Some of these meetings are ones where Biden himselfwas president -- was present as vice president. Who knows what else mightbe there once Durham starts digging?CAVUTO:  But he's not exactly Johnny rocket ,though, right, John Durham, Imean, in getting stuff out. Do you suspect that this could go on for years?YOO:  You know, if you are Biden, you wish he would hurry up now, wouldn'tyou?CAVUTO:  Right.YOO:  Because the last thing you want is this to be the sword of Damocleshanging over the Biden administration's head for two or three years.But you're quite right, Neil. Durham doesn't feel like he has to hurry upfor anybody. I mean, I'm sure President Trump and Attorney General Barrwould have loved for him to wrap up his probe over the summer, but COVIDgot in the way. I think maybe some witnesses gave him a hard time.And so he's had to delay past the election. I could see him easily taking awhole 'nother year to complete his probe, especially if he starts findingevidence of new kinds of wrongdoing that we don't even know about yet.CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch it closely. John Yoo, thank you verymuch, John Yoo following all these developments here.In the meantime, following what is again another hopeful sign out ofwatching them that we could see a lame-duck stimulus package, to the tuneof about $908 billion. It has bipartisan support. It has Nancy Pelosi andChuck Schumer saying it's a very, very good beginning, but it has just oneproblem, the White House not keen on it -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  It had bipartisan support, still does, a number of senators fromthe left and the right, and from all sizes of states, supporting a $908bipartisan plan to help those who are dealing right now with the falloutfrom COVID-19.There's just one problem. They're not exactly on the same page, and theWhite House so far not a fan of what they have produced.Let's get the latest from Susan Crabtree, RealClearPolitics.Is this too soon to call dead on arrival, Susan, or how would you describeit?SUSAN CRABTREE, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  Well, in Washington, Christmas andDecember is not a very cheery month, because it involves deadlines.And this is when Congress -- push comes to shove, and Congress finally getsto work on things. I thought that this coronavirus stimulus bill was prettymuch on life support last week, but it's revived by the centrist group.People like Susan Collins and Mark Warner are getting together, Joe Manchinand Lisa Murkowski.Usually, these moderates don't have a lot of heft, and they have beencriticized for not being able to produce results. But they seem to have atleast revived the talks right now. You have both sides exchanging paperworkthis week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talking to HouseDemocratic leaders.Steve Mnuchin seems to want a deal. The White House has said they wouldaccept the $500 billion that Mitch McConnell produced for his stimulusbill, just today and yesterday announced those -- that $500 billion, butthat's pretty far away from this centrist $908 billion bill.So we're still a ways to go. And we have a very limited amount of timeleft. December 11 is the deadline for these talks to end and Congressmembers to go home.CAVUTO:  You know, when you talk about the White House, I don't mean thatthat includes -- I'm not trying to be flippant here -- the president,because he was a fan of going big, and the bigger the better during thecampaign, and urging that, if it meant signing on to something -- I don'tremember the exact figures -- of $2 trillion or more, where Nancy Pelosiwas, and a little bit north of that, that was fine.So, now is the issue that $908 billion is too pricey? So, where does thatleave it?CRABTREE:  It seems like there's some concern on behalf of Republicans,mainly Senate Republicans, most -- probably, most likely, that's where theconcern is, because they're looking at this Georgia race, and they knowthat they have been leading a lot of huge deficit spending during the lastfour years during the Trump administration.They don't want voters to take that out on them. But, meanwhile, you areseeing the coronavirus numbers skyrocket, and businesses really beensuffering. In California, there's going to be new lockdowns in place.Americans are really hurting.So, I think that that's what's driving this. There's some concern, if theydo nothing, they're going to face criticism. Yet they still are worriedsome people, certainly the Democrats, Senate Democrats and House Democrats,think their hands will be strengthened next year, if they have Biden in theWhite House, which looks almost like it's obviously going to happen.CAVUTO:  Yes.CRABTREE:  So, that's what...CAVUTO:  So there's no reason for them to accept something they don't like,yes.CRABTREE:  Well, they're too far apart right now on the numbers.We will see in the next few days.CAVUTO:  Got it.CRABTREE:  It's going to be really telling. It's going to be really tellingin the next few days if they can make some move -- there will be movementthere.But, right now, McConnell said that Democrats needed to accept half-a-loaf.And I don't think they're going to be accepting half-a-loaf right now, notwith Biden coming into the White House.CAVUTO:  I suspect you're right.Susan Crabtree, thank you very much, RealClearPolitics.Do you remember the requirements here on quarantines? It used to be 14 daysif you tested positive for the virus or you were around anyone else whohad. Now talk that they could limit that or the CDC is open to limiting itto as few as seven days. What happened?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, have you had it with these states that say you shouldquarantine for 14 days, even at the slight chance that you have beenexposed to COVID-19?Now the CDC is saying, you know, seven days could work just fine or down tothat.Tom Frieden is the former CDC director, Resolve to Save Lives president andCEO.Director, good to have you back.What do you think of those guidelines? And what might have changed themfrom two weeks to as little as one week?DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, FORMER DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ANDPREVENTION:  Well, we're learning more about COVID every day. And it'sclear that people who get infected usually get sick within about a week.So, if you can test at the end of a week, or quarantine for at least aweek, especially if there are no other cases that are spread from theperson you were exposed to, then it may be safer.So, it's an evolution of the CDC guidance. But, really, the big picturehere is that, while we are all rooting for a vaccine and hoping for avaccine to come, for the time being, we're going to have to double down onthose protection protocols, because the pandemic is still very much with usand, unfortunately, over the next few weeks is likely to get worse.CAVUTO:  So, if the pandemic is, to your point, Tom, still with us, whathas changed in dialing back the number of days you have to quarantineyourself once exposed to it? It's the same COVID-19, right? It's the samethreat.So what brought the cut in days?FRIEDEN:  I think what we're seeing is that people weren't really complyingwith 14 days of quarantine.So, let's get real, and let's do what we can to reduce spread. And thatmeans the three W's, wear a mask, watch your distance, wash your hands. Italso means, for people who are sick, immediately isolate and get tested,because what we're finding is, people are waiting a day or two after theyfeel bad.In that day or two, they're spreading it to a lot of other people. Andthen, if you have been exposed, quarantine, new guidance says, at leastseven days, so that you won't spread it to others.Now, in the second seven days, it is still possible that you could becomeinfectious. But the risk of that goes way down, especially if you have hada test at the end of that first seven days.And I think the basic idea is, better people really quarantine for one weekthan pretend to quarantine for two.CAVUTO:  Oh, that's -- you know, that's a very good way to describe it.Director, what do you make of what a lot of people are saying, all right,the United Kingdom wrote off on this Pfizer vaccine, but not our own FDA?And a lot of people say, I don't touch it until the FDA rules on it.What do you say?FRIEDEN:  Yes, I learned something here.I thought, well, what's taking the FDA so long? All they have to do isreview the documents. Actually, that's not what they do. If you remember,thalidomide, a medication that caused terrible birth defects, was used inEurope for a long time before it was brought here.So, we do have more rigorous safety protocols here than many of theEuropean agencies. And the FDA actually doesn't just look at and reviewwhat the companies have done. They actually redo the work. They reanalyzeall the data. They look at the production facilities.These are new vaccines. And one of the biggest fears we have is that wewill have a great vaccine, and people will too suspicious of it to take it.So, I think it's better to be safe than sorry. We want the vaccines as soonand as safely as possible. There's a lot of data that we still haven'tseen, the rate of different adverse events.We're looking at company press releases now, not scientific articles. Whenthe U.S. FDA, if they give it an approval, they're going to have a lot ofdata that has not been in the public domain before. And I think it's goingto give us -- I hope it will give us a lot more confidence in the safety ofthe vaccine.The key is not necessarily to be first, but to get this out widely as soonas possible. And the recent recommendation to give it to nursing homeresidents and staff and health care workers first is a greatprioritization.The key is going to be to roll this out. A vaccination program isenormously complicated. And it will only succeed if people trust it. And itcan only be trusted if there are no corners cut on safety.CAVUTO:  Got it. Yes, better to be late and exactly right than early andpossibly wrong.Tom Frieden, very good seeing you, the former CDC director and much, muchmore.FRIEDEN:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  To Tom's point here, people are doing better dealing with thisvirus.Keep in mind, 87-year-young Chuck Grassley, the senator, will be talking tous, the first time since getting diagnosed. He's doing just fine. He's heretomorrow to tell us how fine on FOX Business. We will see you then.Here comes "THE FIVE."Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
