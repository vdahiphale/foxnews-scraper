The new far left extreme socialist Democratic Party, they are hitting new levels of radicalism.

Now, the Trump agenda succeeding, that is driving them off the rails. It was on full display last night. Fake news CNN put the 2020 Democrats on stage one after another, hour after hour of hard-core socialism, where they completely tried to out-socialist the other socialist on stage, from impeachment of Trump, open borders, guns, oppressive taxes, and, of course, yes, redistribution and the Green Deal, where crazy Bernie Sanders was confronted about the real failures of socialism throughout history. Why would we not learn from history?

What democratic socialism means to me as we expand Medicare, we provide educational opportunity to all Americans, we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. In other words, government serves the needs of all people, rather than just wealthy campaign contributors.

Remember, keep your doctor, keep your plan, save money? Everyone, millions lost doctors, plans, have only one choice, so everyone paid more.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is a broad U.S. consensus that we need to find a way to protect Dreamers. But as your question brings out, there are over 10 million people who are undocumented immigrants in this country who don't fall into that category. On the reality is, we can't have comprehensive immigration reform that works unless it addresses the status for those 11-some million undocumented immigrants. So, what we need to do is make sure there is a pathway to citizenship for them too.

By the way, now, what we are seeing is a party that has gone so far left it even looks like crazy, creepy uncle Joe Biden is having cold feet. According to a new report tonight, he again pushed back his launch, which was now set for Thursday, won't do an official campaign kick off until Monday, and a new piece out in the "Daily Mail" lays out the chaos surrounding Biden's 2020, quote, "rollout," raising more questions about whether creepy, crazy Uncle Joe even has a place in this new Democratic Party. Wait until they hear some of the things we are about to advise them on.
Now, that's pushing to get rid of -- this is your new Democratic Party. Remember, Medicare-for-All would take up most of the budget for ten straight years. That is one item. Gas and oil, remember, we are going to get rid of what is the lifeblood of our economy, the Green New Deal is $94- plus trillion in 10 years. Letting felons vote, open borders, abolishing ICE, oh, abolishing the Electoral College, so New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and California pick off all future presidents, stacking the Supreme Court with liberal activist judges, reparations, crippling the Second Amendment, they want a 70 percent top rate on individuals, marginal rate, 90 percent on corporations.

Now, maybe you want to dismiss all this, maybe you want to laugh at all of this as just crazy, unhinged madness, but these are really ideas within the new radical socialist Democratic Party. They have, what, over 100 congressmen and senators supporting Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal. All these presidential candidates support it.
These are ideas that have been tried and have been a massive failure everywhere they have been tried. If you have any doubts, look at the promises of Obamacare. Keep your doctor and pay less, how did that work out for you? Causing tremendous human suffering.
Let's go to San Francisco. Oh, we sent our own Lawrence Jones back yesterday. We have exclusive footage just ahead, but have to give a viewer warning, it is pretty disturbing what is going on in Nancy Pelosi's backyard.

That is why so many people are fleeing places like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, where all of these progressive fairy tales turn out to be nightmares come to life and why do Democrats make such a far left turn? Why are they so out of touch with law-abiding, common sense Americans that make this country great? Why exploit people's innate, natural fear that they are going to take away every fear that they have and take care of everything, promises of everything for free? It is impossible. They will never be able to deliver it.
It is because the Democrats, well, they are being led by a new crop of radical leftists. This is their power base. They make you dependent, you reelect them, then you are voting back in the very benefits they are promising to give you. Establishment Democrats, even as bad as they are, they are even terrified now of losing to the far left base that they want to win reelection. They're going to be literally running on those programs.

It is why extremist like Speaker of the House Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I didn't misspeak, are leading the party. Pelosi is really speaker in name only. It's why every day, she somehow finds a way to top her previous bad idea with one that is even worse. The latest, dismissing efforts by the president to reform the V.A. system to help our vets, saying everything is fine.
Well, thankfully, the president has been fixing it. Take a look.

REP.

The idea that this thing that isn't broken, this thing that provides the highest quality care to our veterans somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with it until we don't even recognize it anymore.

By the way, what Bernie said last night about Israel, a downright disgrace for every Democrat. Downplaying, in this case, Congressman Omar, 9/11 terrorist attacks, now it has been revealed at the Minnesota congresswoman attacked the soldiers, the ones that died fighting in the 1993 Blackhawk Down Operation, posting in a Twitter thread, oh, about 19 U.S. soldiers dying in the battle of Mogadishu, quote: In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by American forces that day. #nottodaysatan .

Where is that accountability? Where is the outrage? Where the Democratic leaders? This is their party. And where is the media in this country?
Now, if this was a Republican, they would have gone insane right now, but we are here to do the work the media doesn't do, and that is to expose how radicals and how radical this party has become.
And they don't even understand simple, basic, fundamental things like the law, the Constitution, separation of powers, coequal branches of government, or any of the real consequences of their actions like the Green New Deal, which comrade Bill de Blasio, he's ramping up right here in New York City, can't wait for this to happen, wanting to take the city back to the Stone Age, that is Fred Flintstone for those of you that are young at home, with Bill de Blasio's face on it, with a ban, quote, inefficient steel and glass skyscrapers, because they're bad for the environment.
So what exactly does Bill de Blasio want to build with? I guess we can't use trees because that would pillage the forest. Do Democrats not understand that these materials they want to ban, along with oil and gas, fossil fuels, it is the lifeblood of our economy and every economy around the globe? It drives wages. It drives opportunity for people in this country. It's why we are putting this big New Green Deal disaster on trial, because Democrats want to roll back all of the success of the Trump agenda.

Are you better off than you were to two and a half years ago? I think the answer is obviously yes. Like for example, we are now energy independent in America for the first time in 75 years.

They will retreat to their rich, expensive enclaves surrounded by walls and gates. The success of the forgotten men and women, the men and women of this country that go to work, pay their taxes, obey the laws, raise their kids, really? They are getting guaranteed from them? I don't think so.
It is going to be coming from your able-bodied, hardworking Americans, who they are chasing out of big cities. And if you leave New York, New Jersey, California, great, don't bring those stupid policies with you when you go to Texas or the Carolinas, or Nashville, or Tennessee, or Florida.

I want to add one word to all of those radical ideas that you delineated, and you are absolutely right, you can add one more word. They are radical and impractical. Not one of them is practical relative to cost or relative to the Constitution.
So, you can add that the next time you do a monologue, where he identify all of these crazy, radical ideas.

HANNITY: It was so important.
CAIN: Yes.
HANNITY: Is that part of the reason? I know you have given five reasons, but I want to give you a chance to respond.
CAIN: Those accusations had nothing to do with my decision. My decision was driven by, one, during the phase one of this process, collecting all the information, and also finding out from administration staffers the things that I could and I could not do. And when I started to look at the list of things that I could not do, that's like taking a stallion, keeping him in the stable, and not let him run.

I couldn't do the things that I enjoy. I enjoy The New Voice, I enjoy my show, I enjoy speaking, I enjoy my website. I enjoy working with people.
And most importantly, Sean, just like you --
HANNITY: You're a business guy.
CAIN: -- I enjoy educating people about the power of capitalism and how socialism has never worked since the history of man. If I have become the Federal Reserve governor, I would have been limited in terms of what I could talk about and tell people the truth. Whereas in this environment, I am unlimited in being able to say what I want, when I want, to whomever I want when it comes to the truth.
That's why I made the decision not to do it.
HANNITY: OK. By the way, I have known you for many years. It's true. It is -- how many people, by the way, and this is just breaking, I just got this, Trump says that he opposed to White House aides testifying to Congress.
OK, this president now has given more documents, never once like Obama and past presidents, not one time, did he invoke executive privilege. He never fired Mueller, never fired Rosenstein. All of these things.

        }
      
Now they want to just go on a fishing expedition. You know what? Enough. I don't think the president should lift a finger to help those people that won't lift a finger to help the country or serve their constituents.
They've done the investigating. They lost. They're a bunch of crybabies. It's like election 2016 all over again.
CAIN: If I'm the CEO of a company, which I have been many times, and I'm a CEO of my company now. People that are part of my organization --
HANNITY: Godfather Pizza, Coke, pretty big companies.
CAIN: They're pretty big company.
HANNITY: You are rich.
CAIN: People that work for me, they are not allowed to go out and represent their company. And so, the president represents the country, he represents the administration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And for them to say they want to be able to interrogate aides is absolutely ridiculous. But this fits in with all of the other radical, impractical ideas. In this particular case, I would suggest that the president just simply say no. There isn't anything they can do about it.
HANNITY: Not a darn thing. And you know what? I think the president --
CAIN: No.
HANNITY: -- is right. He's drawn a line in the sand.
CAIN: No.
HANNITY: Oh, well, collusion and Russia, oh, that didn't work. Taxes, let's go -- let's empower the IRS for our political enemies. Oh, OK.
CAIN: Right. That's what they're doing.

Sorry, it's called attorney-client privilege. Grow up, learn something.
CAIN: Right.
HANNITY: Thank you. Herman Cain, good to see you, my friend.

All right. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, FOX News contributor, former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino.
Guys, welcome.
Geraldo, you know, I don't mind prison reform. When I saw Alice Marie Johnson (ph) come out of prison, her family, that made me happy, and she said, thank you, America, for a second chance. She was a one-time offender, drugs, and she said, I won't let you down. I want to find all of the Alice Marie Johnsons in prison and let them out.
But the marathon bomber, terrorists, murderers, pedophiles, no way.

GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: You know, the president, President Trump passed the First Step Act, really meaningful criminal justice reform that reduced the use of mandatory minimum sentences, provided jobs training, education, alcohol and drug rehab, that's real criminal justice reform.
To propose that convicts be granted their right to vote before he or she has served their time behind bars, paid their blood debt to society, is an obscenity. It is grotesque, and it is deeply disappointing.
I'm starting to look at Bernie Sanders and saying, you know, that feisty old guy, he's got charisma, he's got what it takes come he's the best one of the Democratic field. Now I look at him and I'm reminded of all of that crazy Bernie talk from a couple of years ago.
HANNITY: Geraldo, that's the difference between me and you.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: It is an insult.
HANNITY: It is. It is an insult.
Listen, you give up your rights. If you inflict harm on a child, if you are pedophile, murderer, terrorist, and I'm like, where is this party, Dan Bongino? And the comments of Congresswoman Omar, really come about Blackhawk Down and what happened to Americans, you know, her Satan comment? No criticism from the Democratic Party or leadership. They're incapable of it.
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, can you believe what happened in these conversations? I mean, we are on your cable television show in front of white, 3 million plus people, actually having a conversation about the Boston bomber, a savage man beast who built this six-liter pressure cooker bomb build with ball bearings and nails, placed eight feet away from an 8- year-old kid and many others, by the way, watched it detonate, and then fled, led the police on a chase and shot up basically an entire city.
We're actually having a conversation on your show about the leading Democrat, many states, Bernie Sanders advocating for this piece of human waste to vote. Can you imagine politicians pandering to this savage for a vote in Bernie's America, that's the kind of place you'll be looking at? His words by the way, he supports this not us. This is unbelievable.
HANNITY: Geraldo, I assume you probably at some point in your 50-year illustrious career and some of the greatest investigative work ever done Willowbrook, I looked at those old tapes recently. It's amazing the work you did and how many - how you changed.
RIVERA: Thanks.
HANNITY: The mental health system in this country. OK. What's happening? This is twice in two weeks, one on immigration and then one's here. Have you been talking to her? This is got be a Geraldo influence in here somewhere because you are friends with everyone.
RIVERA: No, but you know there is a pragmatic idealism to you Sean that people don't get. Your ideas work. For Bernie Sanders it seems to me a panicky move to make sure that none of the other candidates and there are now almost two dozen of them outflanks him to the left. So, Bernie is going to make sure that he's the furthest left, a candidate could possibly be. What's the craziest idea that you can come up with?
I've got the idea; the Boston bomber has the right to vote on who is going to be representing him in the commonwealth of Massachusetts or wherever he's in deep isolation solitary right now. It is a bizarre idea that has nothing to do with ordinary, normal, prudent, voting Americans. That's what I can't figure out. When does this craziness get you the kind of following that you need to beat the President who has really done a great job with the economy? And as I mentioned criminal justice has passed meaningful reform, the first meaningful reform in a decade. HANNITY: Listen, all of that and breaking an economic record after the economic record Dan Bongino and add to that you know what America is fear to get on the world stage. I know that is liberals want to go on apology tours and drop $150 billion in cash and other currency, on the tarmac for the mullahs of Iran. I prefer America that is feared and peace through strength. That's what I prefer.
BONGINO: Yes. And so, would most sane rational voters out there. But Sean, Geraldo is right on this one. I know we debate a lot, but he nailed it. You know the effort here on the left is to separate yourself and distinct - to make yourself distinct from Donald Trump and in order to do that, it's a series of insane ideas, it's a liberal forest fire right now, it's going to consume the Democrat Party. One guy wants a 70 percent tax rate. The other one wants a 90 percent tax rate.
HANNITY: By the way, Dan.
BONGINO: I'm pretty sure there'll be arguing for no money at all. Let's confiscate everything. I mean I've never seen anything like this. HANNITY: By the way when - Geraldo is right, it's became the influence of a younger adopted brother. When he's wrong. He's on his own.
RIVERA: That's you.
HANNITY: Good to see you both. When we come back. All right. Two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett case; they're now suing Smollett's attorneys for defamation. Trace Gallagher, full report. You won't believe Hillary Clinton what she's actually saying about President Trump. It's so ridiculous, it's actually funny. And Rush Limbaugh's statements, she should be indicted and in jail. His evidence has been overwhelming incontrovertible. Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: New developments tonight in the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax as the Empire actor faces a fresh new lawsuit in this ongoing saga. Here with the very latest from our West Coast Newsroom again tonight, Fox News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher. Trace, this never ends.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Sean. Yes, it never ends. The Osundairo brothers are suing Jussie Smollett 's attorneys Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian because they continue to lie saying the brother is quoting here, "let a criminally homophobic racist and violent attack against Mr. Smollett". Here's the brother's lawyer. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Chicagoan brothers told the truth. They could have remained silent, but instead they told the truth to the police and with their right hand in the air, they told the truth to the grand jury.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: The Osundairo say their reputations and livelihoods have taken a hit and they can barely make ends meet. The brothers say Smollett hired them to stage a hate crime hoax and gave them money to purchase certain items and there is surveillance video of them buying rope, gasoline, ski masks and caps that resemble President Trump's Make America Great Again hats. Jussie Smollett maintains the brothers attacked him without cause and his attorneys called the lawsuit against them comical quoting while we know this ridiculous lawsuit will soon be dismissed because it lacks any legal footing. We look forward to exposing the fraud, the Osundairo brothers and their attorneys have committed on the public. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Jussie Smollett, but also said that does not mean he didn't do it. Sean. HANNITY: All right, Trace Gallagher in our West Coast Newsroom. Yet another big story, we are following tonight. Hillary Clinton today actually suggesting President Trump is getting a free pass on obstruction of justice. She ever heard of the phrase people glass houses shouldn't throw stones. You can't make this up. But here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY: Any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted. But because of the rule in the Justice Department that you can't indict a sitting President. As I read it basically what I thought it was saying is, look, we think he obstructed justice. Here are 11 examples of why we think he obstructed justice. But we're under the Control of the Justice Department and their rule is you can indict.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The Attorney General, Madam Secretary actually said the decision was in no way based on any consideration of whether you can or cannot indict a sitting President. No, that was the office legal counsel, Rod Rosenstein, the guy that signed the fourth FISA, the third renewal and the same one that also appointed Mueller took them seconds.
They didn't have the evidence at all. But we have evidence on you. Joining us now the author of the Russian Hoax, the illicit scheme to clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump. Boy, he's been right. Fox News Contributor and Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett, also investigative reporter Sara Carter is with us. You know, Rush Limbaugh said, we're going to play this in a minute Gregg.
By every standard, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. She even sent out Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and note to State Department employees don't use your private devices for State Department materials. She signs it. Private server classified top secret. Information marked as such on her - on that secret server in a bathroom closet, we believe hacked by at least six foreign intelligence agencies.
Now, that's the underlying crime. Why did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails, bleach bit and beat up the devices and pull out some cards that would be an intent of obstruction? Meeting all the criteria and standard Donald Trump wishing that he wants to fire Mueller, Rosenstein and it doesn't rise to the level.
GREGG JARRETT, AUTHOR, RUSSIAN HOAX: We always knew that Hillary Clinton was a lousy candidate. Now we know she's a lousy lawyer. There was no legal basis for obstruction of justice. Her hypocrisy as you point out is really breathtaking here. She's the queen of obstruction of justice destroying 33,000 emails and devices under subpoena. You know honestly if she were smart and she is not to be sure she'd put a sock in it, because criticizing the attorney general who holds potential your fate in his hands is really unwise, it's just plain stupid.
I mean William Barr might decide you know what I'm not just going to investigate the FBI, now I'm going to investigate Hillary Clinton for obstruction of justice reopen the email scandal, 110 different felonies and I'm going to look into her role in selling uranium assets to Russia at the same time $45 million is flowing into her foundation. So, you know she ought to keep her mouth shut or she'll get herself in deeper trouble than she already should be in. HANNITY: And by the way they're calling for unredacted materials. Apparently, there is a reference in there to Bill and Monica and tapes in Russia. I don't know.
JARRETT: There is.
HANNITY: But it's neither here nor there. Sara, the important thing is that on the law that if we're going to have a constitutional republic, equal justice, equal application of our laws, yes, all of those people that rigged her investigation should be in trouble. And we know it's rigged. People involved in it. Page, Strzok, everyone else saying yes, Loretta Lynch did it. What did she know, and she know it? What did Obama know? But more importantly then we've got to find out who tried to rig the presidential election with the phony Russian dossier that the New York Times is now saying might have been a disinformation campaign to influence the election and then we've got to find out who used the dirty dossier that she paid for to bludgeon the president with lies and conspiracy theories to remove him,
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. That's exactly what I was going to say Sean. This is what's so important. She obviously believes in something which is a two-tiered justice system one in which Hillary Clinton feels she can get away with everything with obstruction just as you said. I mean under the law, obstruction is tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence. I mean this is everything that she did under the law and then she turns, and she throws it at President Trump saying well, he could have been indicted if he wasn't a sitting President. Here is someone who feels that they are above the law. And this is someone that is going to be investigated and all the people that supported her are going to be investigated as well. If Attorney General William Barr does his job and Michael Horowitz does his job, people will be indicted, and it won't be President Trump.
HANNITY: You all know what's coming. It is going to be an avalanche, but when. Stay tuned. Just relax. Expect in May a lot of things to happen. By the way, we're going to play Rush Limbaugh saying, yes, Hillary should be indicted and convicted and put in jail. The evidence is incontrovertible overwhelming, but we believe in due process presumption of innocence. All right. Before we get to Rush, the drug human feces crisis out of control within walking distance of Nancy Pelosi's home and office. We sent Lawrence Jones back to the liberal city to see how bad things really are. His report, Rush's comments, all coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Based on that media report and the Washington Examiner report about maybe a redacted portion of the Mueller Report had the insinuation that there are tapes of Bill Clinton, with Monica Lewinsky on the telephone. Let's leave it at that, wouldn't that mean that the Clintons were compromised. Then we have the whole Uranium One thing, then we have the Russian dossier and we have Bill Clinton being paid twice as normal speaking fees. And don't forget she signed off on the uranium deal. OK, we have a big story.
We only have 25 percent of the story, but we have been telling you about the human feces' crisis, needle crises plaguing San Francisco. There is even an online map that shows where feces is reported to have been found since 2011. We sent Lawrence Jones back to the city by the bay to see what's going on. Here's what he found.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAWRENCE JONES, CORRESPONDENT: There is feces everywhere, homeless people, needles, is that the norm around here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unfortunately, it is. It's devolved. The city has become so much worse in the last 10 years. That's a disgrace.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I see a lot of people in the area and they're all like you know had needles pumping up in their arms just outside.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody is shooting up right up the street. They don't care. Selling dope, crack, whatever.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a bad situation. I don't really know what the solution is going to be.
JONES: So, what do you see on a typical day with the people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drug use. People shoot up right in the middle of the street. It's crazy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: While the kids are crossing.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kids.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Families are going through.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything. All over the floor, all over the ground. JONES: Is it really safe for kids to play in the playground, when you see all of this waste, human waste and needles everywhere?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't bring my kids to the playground. I wouldn't bring my kids here. JONES: About how many pounds of feces.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At least five to 10.
JONES: And the needles
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 10 to 20. Every day.
JONES: Every day.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, that can vary. It could be anywhere from five to 10 or 20, it depends on what route you take.
JONES: And piles of poop?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, I'd ask that the biggest thing is the smell.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have my grandkids here. You know I'm scared to let them walk on. Sometimes I have to pick him up and carry him. I don't want him to misstep on the needle.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our political leaders are not dealing with this. They're not dealing with this. And I think it's corrupt.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn't normal. This isn't normal. It's crazy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow. Joining us now Fox News Contributor Lawrence Jones, author of The Case for Trump, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Victor Davis Hanson is with us. All right, as we're speaking Lawrence, I'm going to show some of the video. They have people daily cleaning this up. This is the needles and real feces and everybody you talk to says what
JONES: Everybody is sick of it and it's become the new normal, Sean. I mean the moment I walked out of the van, the camera truck within five steps, I saw my first needle and you're looking at people that are doped up, they're on the street. It was like a scene out of The Walking Dead. These people were like zombies. We saw drug exchanges. We saw packages where drugs were clearly there, needles every single block. You see all the light orange capsules that protect the needles that are literally all over the street. And Sean, this is just not like a rough neighborhood. This is - the tech companies, the big tech companies are surrounding this. Right.
HANNITY: How far from Nancy Pelosi's House and office. I don't know it's within walking distance about how far
JONES: Miles away. We didn't pass her house, but we know just based on the map Google. I mean she wasn't too far.
HANNITY: Victor Davis Hanson, this is the thing she can't go to her millionaire friends and say, let's all chip in. She's a multi, multi, multi-millionaire. She can't say let's build a facility, people to go to the bathroom and maybe get drug treatment or warm meal, a shower. She can't do that. Won't do that?
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: No, it's surreal what's happened. Sean, the wealthiest generation, the history of civilization. This is $3 trillion or $4 trillion in market capitalization between Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Supposedly, the most sophisticated and clever. They created - they inherited the most beautiful city in the world. They made it in 20 years into a medieval mess. And I'm not just being metaphorical.
When I read medieval chroniclers about cities in Europe in the dark ages and late middle dark ages, you start to see the same pattern. There is a nob hill, there is a Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights, Twin Peaks and these people live in high elevations, they have banquet halls, they have their private security nights then outside the city walls and places to make the comparison. The Tenderloin or the market, you have peasantry, urban peasants and they live among dong and awful and amid disease and that's exactly what's going on in San Francisco, the common denominator between San Francisco today and the medieval city, the past is there is no middle class, high regulations, illegal immigration, zoning, environmental radicalism drove people out of San Francisco. They can't afford to live there, and they grow in general California as well.
HANNITY: Within walking distance.
HANSON: These people could not be shielded from the consequences.
JONES: There is no excuse.
HANSON: Liberals are only - with your money and our money. Lawrence, great job. Thank you. Victor Davis Hanson, great job. All right. Rush on fire tonight talking about Hillary's ridiculous comments from earlier today and what should happen to the Former Secretary of State and Presidential. You don't want to miss this. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Rush Limbaugh join the story with Martha MacCallum, and he had a few choice words for hypocrite Hillary. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST, THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW: Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated. She needs to be indicted and she needs to be in jail. You're talking about sour grapes. This is a woman who has been rejected by the American people twice, rejected by her party in 2008. She had to rig the primaries against Crazy Bernie in 2016 to get the nomination. She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Exactly, it's called the Constitutional Republic Rule of Law, equal application and equal justice. All right. We're getting there. Let not your heart be troubled. We'll never be the destroy-Trump media mob. Jason Chaffetz in for Laura Ingraham tonight.
Congressman, good to see you again. Great job.
