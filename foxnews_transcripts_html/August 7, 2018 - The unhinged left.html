GUTFELD: It's awesome, anarchists and socialists ruining other people's lunch just to make them miserable before the check comes. It's pure, unconscious brain function where screaming and other reflexes are only possible if it doesn't involve actual thinking. This is what fascism looks like when it first puts on its baby jackboots. It's so adorable when they first try to walk in them. I feel for their families, but I know their families don't talk to them. They just send money because people like this don't have jobs.
What we're seeing is a contagion. This is what failure looks like, unemployable yahoos who join a mob and demand people with jobs just give up. It's physically repulsive. I mean, literally, physically repulsive. Meaning it's time for a Greg's Golden Rule of Anger: Thou shalt not yell. Check out that beard. That's commandment 12. It's right there. The more you yell, the better it feels, but the worse you look. Just watch.

OWENS: It's very hard being a black-white supremacist in this country, may I just say. This was absolute nonsense. Just to be clear, the entire police force was built up, black and Hispanics men, except one out of the 11 police officers happen to be white. The rest were all black and Hispanic and they were shouting race traitor to us. The entire Antifa gang, if you guys don't know watching at home, consists of all white people. There are no black people in this crowd. So it's very rich to watch them yelling at us, calling us white supremacists, telling us we were race traitors because we don't necessarily believe that we have to vote Democrat. 
GUTFELD: Can I ask you, you know, Chris Hahn went after you and it's becoming this thing. I saw -- they're saying like, oh, how could this happen? It's so convenient that these guys are actually eating at the same restaurant.

OWENS: Yeah. They were quite noticeable. They sneered at me and Charlie, and they sat down. But here's what we did wrong. We underestimate the left. We thought they could get through breakfast peacefully and sit there and eat their meal and allow us to do the same. But, of course, they were sending out a bat signal for all of the other Antifa protesters to come and arrive and just stalked and harass us.

Geraldo, I want to ask you, you are an icon. You've been around for like, at least, 70 years on this planet. You've been through so many different eras. So many different eras. And we have a lot of people saying, my god, there's no dialogue, I'm one of these people, I worry about the dissent and everything. Does this seem even close to the stuff that you've been seeing? I mean, is it -- are we over exaggerating?

And if you push me, for instance, I'm going to push you back in a physical way. And I know that -- didn't they spilled water on you? 
OWENS: They -- yes. So, Jim Acosta, they just -- it was a chant, right? They threw water, they threw eggs. They threw food at us. So this was different. And we were not at a Trump rally. This wasn't a political gathering. We were eating breakfast.

RIVERA: What you have this confluence of the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, and the generation gap, so all these things came together. It was a cataclysm. What happened eventually is the draft petered out, first of all, and I think most of the white kids were basically motivated by self-interest. They didn't want to be drafted to Vietnam, or Cambodia, or Laos, so they were protesting and they seemed righteous in the protest. And I was one of them. But what I was really protesting, even if I wasn't saying it, was I don't want to be drafted. I don't want to be killed in Southeast Asia. What happened is the war -- the draft first petered out before the war. We pulled out of Vietnam by '73, '75 the war was over, we have lost.

Jim Acosta was aware that this was a friendly chant, if you will, because if he wasn't aware, he wouldn't have gotten down and taking pictures with the protesters, subsequently. This is a big difference when we're talking about a chant that's meant to get people excited at a Trump rally versus, actually, trying to bring harm to an individual. I would never want what happened to me to happen to Jim Acosta, though, and I will say that.

This race a focus of President Trump, he's urging voters to back congressional candidate, Troy Balderson.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want to have a border. If you want to stop the radical Pelosi and Waters, Maxine Waters, agenda, there's only one choice in this election. That's vote for Troy Balderson. He's going to help everybody. They're going to get the job done.

PERINO: Just to make sure. Troy Balderson benefited from President Trump coming, whether it can actually turn into a win for him, who knows, but the president brought a lot of energy. 
WATTERS: Yeah, the president says he's going to be campaigning 5 to 6 days a week leading up to the midterms. Six to seven, wow.
PERINO: He campaigned more than that.
WATTERS: That's a lot. But that's a lot of political capital he's going to be spending in these midterm elections. He understands the stakes are high because Pelosi running the house, you're going to have congressional oversight. You're going to have subpoenas. You're going to have potential impeachment. It's going to be an absolute disaster. I don't know what's going to happen in this Ohio district if Balderson does win. The media will say, oh, he's expected to win. It's a Republican district. And he loses, it's going to be a huge momentous upset that's going to showcase the trend of the Democrats retaking the house. So we'll see what happens. 
PERINO: The other thing is, Geraldo, you're from Ohio, so you've been seeing this, but if this is a special election, whatever happens tonight, then they go on to campaign again and they have to run again in November in the midterms. 
RIVERA: Well, you know politics so much better that I do. But you know that in the special election you can ask five people on the streets of Ohio if there's an election today, and they'll go, I don't know.
PERINO: But there was a lot of energy. In fact, it looks like turnout could be up to 30 percent.

RIVERA: But that was a Trump turnout, that's not a Balderson turnout.
WATTERS: According to Rosie, those people were paid to show up. Remember, that's.
RIVERA: But, Balderson, this seems like a repeat of the Pennsylvania one with Conor Lamb. 
PERINO: Yeah.
RIVERA: Balderson, older, kind of, you know, OK, he's an OK candidate. The Danny boy, O'Connor, 31 years old, you know, the whole world against him. All these big bad Republicans are against him. This district I don't know if it's ever gone Democrat, at least, in the modern era. Outside of Columbus, is part of Columbus, which is where Ohio State is, and the rural area is dark, dark red. I mean, if the Democrats pull this off, I think that it will be, righteously, big headlines if he wins. If the Republicans hold the district, then I think you're right also. But I think for good reason, Jesse, that they will not be -- yeah, he's expected to win.
PERINO: Candace, do, do you want to talk about this race or the one up in Michigan where you have some very left-wing people running? 
OWENS: That's correct. Look, I try to stay out of all of this because it's very predictable. You don't know who's going to show up. And just because Trump does a rally, as you've mentioned, does not dictate who's going to actually show up and vote. 
PERINO: Right.
OWENS: Michigan, I'm hoping it is Johnny James, but.
PERINO: For the senate seat. 
OWENS: Yes, absolutely. And, look, the thing I think is the most compelling story here is how the Democratic socialists, this whole movement and this whole wave is going to pan out. Like, is this really a movement? Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez managed to inspire a bunch of people who literally know nothing and don't understand math to say, hey, I want to make it. I want to be on TV. I want to sitting next to Trevor Noah. I don't know math, so I want to run as well. That's going to be a very important trend to pay attention to. We can laugh about it, but it's going to get very serious. 
PERINO: And the Democrats have this big split, just as an example, then you can comment on anything you want. But in Michigan, in the gubernatorial election, Abdul El-Sayed.
RIVERA: El-Sayed, yeah.
PERINO: . and Richard Whitmore, they're all Democrats across the spectrum, and someone that is quite far left as the Bernie. 
GUTFELD: That is true. I wish we would ban the phrase gubernatorial. I hate that word. You know what's scary is that we have a large population who think socialism is what you do on Facebook.
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: Oh, I'm just -- I'm being social. That's what -- they don't actually see it. But here's the thing, when you're in power, you've got to try harder because the people out of power have nothing to lose and everything to gain. All you can do is lose because you're in power. So these people -- so the equation is, while the hatred for President Trump exceeds one's knowledge of the bankruptcy of progressivism? That's the equation. Republicans have got to be persuasive. That means visually connect the left-wing beliefs to something visual. So, when you talk about socialism, you talked about Venezuela, toilet paper, or the fact that zebra is catch of the day at the restaurant zoo. 
PERINO: I'm so glad you mention that because.
GUTFELD: Thank you.
PERINO: . one thing that I was thinking about today, and I believe Kevin Williamson who is now back at National Review wrote about today.
WATTERS: Yeah, he wrote that column.
PERINO: . that socialism is the word -- a short-term word that conservatives are using to say it's all socialism. 
GUTFELD: Right, right, right.
PERINO: But what the progressives are doing, Jesse, is trying to address concerns about financial anxiety that people have. So they're saying that we have some answers for you, these gubernatorial candidates are running on, basically, a Medicare for all in the state.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: They're dealing with these questions.
GUTFELD: I like both.
PERINO: . and are conservatives sort of missing the boat to try to find a better way to answer it, because Venezuela might not be working. 
RIVERA: But Ocasio-Cortez is enormously effective. She's young and she's vibrant and people love her in the Bronx and Queens, and I'm sorry. 
WATTERS: But we don't know if socialism can play in the heartland. We've seen it play in the coast. We'll find out if it's going to play in the Michigan or Missouri -- I don't know. I mean, it's every expensive. 
RIVERA: Socialism, like, putting tariffs on imports? 
WATTERS: No, I mean paying $42 trillion for free stuff for America.
GUTFELD: Here's the thing.
WATTERS: That's the price tag. 
GUTFELD: Socialism, right now, is turning zoos into restaurants and people here are eating zoo animals. That is a visual. 
RIVERA: I don't get that joke. What is it? 
GUTFELD: It's not. In Venezuela.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Yeah, they're eating the zoo animals. 
RIVERA: That's a tragic. I used to cover Venezuela.
OWENS: They eat their own dog.
(CROSSTALK)
OWENS: Guys, if you don't want to be forced to eat your own dogs.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: I, for one, I'm against that. 
GUTFELD: But Jasper could feed a family. 
WATTERS: Oh. 
OWENS: Oh, my goodness. 
GUTFELD: I'm kidding. It's a beautiful dog. I would never eat Jasper. Never.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Jasper loves you.
GUTFELD: I know. I know. 
PERINO: All right, we're going to move on. Iran lashes out after getting slapped with new sanctions, the impact of President Trump's maximum pressure strategy ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The Iran deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated. I said who signed the deal when they're marching and saying death to America? John Kerry. Not the best negotiator we've ever seen. He never walked away from the table, except to be in that bicycle race where he feel and broke his leg.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump keeping his promise. After ripping up the Iran nuclear deal, the White House has restored harsh economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted by President Obama. Trump calling them, quote, the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and warning that country doing business with Tehran will not be doing business with the United States. Iran's dictator slamming the move as psychological warfare. So I like the, us, against them attitude. And we have breaking news here. German car company Daimler-Chrysler has canceled plans in Iran to do business because the ambassador, Ric Grenell, convince them you either do business with Iran or you do business with the United States. 
PERINO: Ric has been doing -- I should call him Ambassador.
WATTERS: Oh, excuse me.
PERINO: . Grenell has been doing a very good job because there was another thing that sort of slipped under the radar. Remember how during the Obama administration the United States sent over cash to the Iranians, OK. So there was -- coming up this week, there was an attempt by some people in Iran, wanted to get this money out of Germany as well. They had money in Germany, and Ric Grenell was persuasive and that money did not go. So that is happening. The pressure on the Europeans I think is working.
WATTERS: Good.
PERINO: And I think it will be swift. I think the pressure on the Chinese and Russia.
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: . not so much. 
WATTERS: Yeah, they're going to continue to probably do business with the Iranians. Greg, is this more carrot and stick with President Trump where he slaps on these our sanctions and says, hey, you want to talk, let's talk. 
GUTFELD: Absolutely. You know, Kerry can't walk away from the table because he's made from a table. He's just falls in love because, ah, like he did -- what is it called? Mean 23? What it's called? 
PERINO: Meme 23.
GUTFELD: Twenty three meme, he found that he was from a table. All right. Enough of the table jokes. All right, this is a lot like North Korea. 
RIVERA: That's like a lousy joke. 
GUTFELD: Yeah, I know. But I love lousy jokes, Geraldo. Previous -- he turns it upside down, he starts over. He removes the reflexive roadblocks of the past and says let's meet. Why do we trust him over the previous administration who tried the same thing with Iran and though they have a victory? It's because this new team is murderous row, Pompeo, Bolton, Mattis, Kelly, and Trump. That's a lot of sleeves you can hide a knife in. These are guys that, you know -- I've said it before, Bolton, he's a walking "NO" in all caps. He will -- he might give an inch, but he will extract a tooth in exchange. 
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yes. These sanctions are pretty biting, as the president said, Geraldo. Commercial aircraft, precious metals, carpet exports, industrial software, cars and sovereign debt. And they're basically cutting off all access to the dollar in terms of international business transactions. That's going to be pretty intimidating.
GERALDO RIVERA, CO-HOST: There is no doubt but that these sanctions are biting, and they will accomplish, I think, the goal, which is to get Iran to negotiate on the nuclear deal. 
And I think the president should take up the whole idea of meeting with Rouhani. I like when he meets these people face-to-face. I believe he has the unique and unprecedented, extraordinary ability in the face-to-face negotiations to do something. 
However, I think that our entire policy vis-a-vis Iran is bankrupt. 
WATTERS: Why?
RIVERA: I think that we have totally picked the wrong enemy in the Middle East. In my experience, in decades of war reporting, the nuisance, the evildoer is Saudi Arabia. It was the Saudi Arabians who were the 9/11 hijackers. They're ISIS. They're al Qaeda. They're al-Shabaab. It's the Sunni Saudi Arabians that are the real problem. 
The Iranians, I believe we could do business with them. They're the sheikhs of Rodeo Drive in Southern California.
CANDACE OWENS, CO-HOST: There could be more than one problem.
RIVERA: They're the Persians. I think that we really have gone --
WATTERS: Well, it's the regime in Iran we have the problem with.
RIVERA: We've been -- we've been bought and purchased by the Saudis. 
OWENS: That's exactly what I was going to say.
WATTERS: Not the people. 
RIVERA: The Saudis have bought and purchased American foreign policy. 
OWENS: Exactly what I was going to say, Jesse. This is an oppressive regime. I don't understand why America would be helping to fund or give cash to an oppressive regime. 
President Trump is correct to take a hard line on this. This is "The Art of the Deal." He will bring them to the table. We will stop getting people money that would blow us to smithereens if they had the ability to. So I think this is the right move. 
RIVERA: The way the Saudis did? 
OWENS: Thank you, Donald Trump. 
RIVERA: I think --
GUTFELD: Geraldo. It hurts to say this, but he does have a point. 
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: I mean, the Saudis have been around. We talk about Iranian terror, we also say they're the largest state. 
RIVERA: In the 20th Century, maybe.
GUTFELD: But that's right. It's very hard to say, "Well, which ones ones?" That have -- that in America. But we know which ones in America were Saudis.
(CROSSTALK) 
OWENS: There can be more than one problem. They're all a problem. It's something we have to take care of. It's why we had to have a show of support with Israel, because they're really our only allies in the Middle East. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
OWENS: And he's got to tackle all of it. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
OWENS: It's hard to be the president.
PERINO: You also have the situation that you have now and that has changed. Don't you think, Geraldo, that the Saudis are trying to figure out a way? 
GUTFELD: Yes. They're trying.
PERINO: The Iranians are not. 
RIVERA: The Saudis are perpetrating the biggest, murderous assault on the nation of Yemen. It is the Saudis blowing up weddings. They're blowing up civilians. No one is holding them to task. They are blockading other peaceful Arab countries. I mean, it is outrageous to me that we don't see our own self-interest because of Saudi money, Saudi oil. 
WATTERS: -- with the Saudis because of oil, and we can deal with them next after we deal with the Iranians, Geraldo. 
RIVERA: Thank you.
WATTERS: A Democratic candidate dreams about America with open borders ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
OWENS: I don't know what this is. 
RIVERA (singing): "Yo Quiero Dinero Tambien." 
PERINO: "I want money, too.
RIVERA: Very good, Dana. Very good.
The battle over what to do about America's broken immigration system rages on, as you know. A Democratic candidate for governor in the border state of Arizona raising eyebrows with his vision of the future. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID GARCIA (D), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I want to just take a second and imagine. Let's just imagine. Just imagine no wall. No wall in southern Arizona. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERA: Mr. Garcia's dream of no wall is Donald Trump's nightmare, as you know. The president refusing to back away from his campaign promise to build the wall. 
Candace, you're filled with fury. Do you think the president should shut the government down, if necessary, to get funding for the border wall? Is it worth it to -- life or death, do you know what I mean? 
OWENS: Look, I just want to take a second and imagine, if everyone could just imagine a world with no borders. You would see drugs flying in. Children in Arizona specifically, that is the state that has the highest child sex trafficking over that border. 
So that is the world that he is imagining right now, where there are no rules and no regulation, and that's OK. 
I always ask the question: What bothers you more? The idea of a child being temporarily separated from their parents or a child that is a part of a sex trafficking ring? Because that is what this question comes down to.
RIVERA: I appreciate the emotional appeal of this point.
OWENS: He needs to take a hard line on this issue. I believe -- I support him. I agree that, if the government has to shut down to get it done, let the government shut down. 
RIVERA: Jesse, is it worth that much? 
WATTERS: If he shuts it --
RIVERA: And this is weeks before the midterms.
WATTERS: If he shuts it down, he has to get the funding. Because if he shuts it down and doesn't get the funding, that's going to be an absolute catastrophe for not only his approval rating with his base but also the people running for reelection. 
So it needs 60 votes in the Senate as is. I don't see it happening that way. I'm a little nervous about the wall. They're just going to have to do it brick by brick. I wish we didn't have to build a wall. Mexico wouldn't have to pay for it then, because it's very expensive. But unfortunately, you need the wall to stop illegal immigration. 
And all these Democrats keep telling me when they're in this chair, "Oh, the Democratic Party doesn't believe in open borders." OK, well, this guy does. Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks, she said she didn't believe in borders. 
You had the No. 2 at the DNC, Keith Ellison, wear a T-shirt that says, "I Don't Believe in Borders." Every time someone -- abolish ICE. They don't want to fund the wall. They don't want borders, because they want the votes, and that's part of their party platform. It's just not a winning strategy. 
RIVERA: Jim Jordan, you know him, Dana. Candidate for speaker the next time around, in Ryan's absence. He says, "It's worth the fight. He says, "Shut it down if we have to. The wall is what you ran on. It's been 18 months, no progress. I say" -- Jordan says, also an Ohio congressman, he says shut it down. 
What say you, having been close to the heart of power? 
PERINO: My first day on the job as the press secretary on Capitol Hill was the first day of the first government shutdown in 1995. And I didn't know if I should go to work or not, because I wasn't sure if I was essential. 
I just think government by shutdown is really not a good way to do business. But also because of the partisanship, it's hard to get anything done. 
The best thing that the Republicans could do is try to stem their losses that they could face in the House, try to maybe win some. As the president said, a red wave. That's how you prevent government shutdown, is if you have more of your people. 
Shutting down the government and then not getting the money and then having to say, "Well, actually we are getting the wall, because we are doing these improvements," which are actually already happening. That would probably be a better strategic way to do it. 
RIVERA: I agree. But Greg, you've got firebrands on both sides. There's no way, if the Republicans are threatening a shutdown, if the president is threatening a shutdown, there's no way the Democrats will yield. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
RIVERA: They will prolong the agony to unsettle the electorate on the eve of the midterms and could indeed -- you know, are you willing to stake the future of the party on this one issue? 
GUTFELD: I don't know. I would normally say no, but I have been wrong so many times in the last couple of years, especially about Trump's policies. And -- and I'm beginning to see evidence that Trump's immigration policies are beneficial to the lower rungs of the employment ladder. And it's something he should -- I think he has been talking about it, but I don't know if he's linked it to the immigration policies. 
So as we see illegal immigration decline, there's been an increase in native-born employment, a small increase, like 1 percent, I believe. But that's not -- that doesn't mean whites. That means blacks and Hispanics who are legal citizens here who are actually getting jobs. 
So that may be why his popularity is rising among blacks and Hispanics. It's something like 29 percent among blacks. So they have to show that maybe Trump's policies are having a definite effect on employment. I -- this has been a debate forever. 
OWENS: Of course. Having a debate. Illegal immigration directly hurts the black community. That's who it affects, No. 1.
RIVERA: Oh, that's bogus. Totally bogus.
GUTFELD: No, I totally -- 
OWENS: There are actually --
RIVERA: The black community is not going to go to the --
OWENS: The black labor force, the highest --
RIVERA: -- poultry processing plants, the meat-packing plants. 
OWENS: No, you're absolutely incorrect. OK?
RIVERA: Black unemployment is below 5 percent. Where are you going to find these black people?
OWENS: No, OK, yes, thanks to Trump's policies. 
RIVERA: Where you going to find black people? Where you going to find Latinos? 
OWENS: Sitting right next to you. 
RIVERA: But you have a job. And you're a citizen.
GUTFELD: She's gutting chicken right now.
RIVERA: My advice to the president is to secretly negotiate with Schumer. You get the wall. He gets the DREAMers. Give a green light to the DREAMers.
WATTERS: They had that.
OWENS: He said it. He's offered the DREAMers. 
WATTERS: They had 25 billion for the wall, and they had DREAMers. And it got yanked off the table.
RIVERA: I want the 2013 compromise legislation passed --
OWENS: They don't want compromise.
RIVERA: -- by the United States Senate. That's what I want. They don't want compromise, Candace. You're right.
OWENS: We've got to stop pretending they want to compromise. They put that on the table. He put the DACA on the table. They didn't want that. All they want to do is obstruct. And he's going to have to take a hard line to accomplish anything in the administration. 
RIVERA: So you say fight to the finish?
OWENS: And I take great exception. Because it's factual. The unemployment, illegal immigration directly affects the black labor force first and foremost. 
RIVERA: I absolutely disagree. I've written two books on the subject. I absolutely -- I think that you are one of the most vivid and appealing and intelligent new commentators --
OWENS: Let's end it there.
RIVERA: -- on the team -- on the team today, but you are wrong about that. 
OWENS: No, I'm not wrong. 
PERINO: That's what the breaks are for.
(CROSSTALK)
OWENS: -- after this, guys.
RIVERA: One critic wants to pull the plug on one of America's reality TV guilty pleasures. Find out what and why next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
OWENS: One TV critic wants to do away with rose ceremonies and fantasy suites on TV. She says it's time to retire reality TV dating shows like "The Bachelorette" for good. 
The writer argues that, in the "#MeToo" era, throwing strangers together to find love and happiness on screen is anything but rosy. Is this too much? Why can't Americans just enjoy trashy TV? 
I will ask you that question, Greg. Why can't Americans just enjoy trashy TV? 
GUTFELD: I feel very strongly about this. I don't even believe it's trashy. What I see -- I see it as a purely biological attraction. That people are interested in stories. They're interested in romance. And romance can be sloppy. That's part of it. 
Dating shows also reveal the enemy of the hard left: biology. Men and women are different down to their very cells, and you see this in these shows. You can't change these types of shows with political action. 
And what drives me crazy as we are now dealing with a modern version of Big Brother. We are a nation of narcs. We see people having fun, right, and we want to eliminate people having fun. It's an elimination of entertainment and fun. 
We're going after costumes. We're going after dating shows.
OWENS: Plastic straws.
GUTFELD: Plastic straws. We're going after sports. Every single person has to have fun and agree on it, or no one can have fun. That's where we're headed. We're -- we are a nation of narcs and fun police. And they're all miserable people. You come -- the writer has to be miserable to come out against this.
OWENS: No chance that writer voted for Donald Trump. 
Dana, question for you. A lot, to me, seems to be going under this umbrella of "#MeToo."
PERINO: Yes.
OWENS: Can you perhaps connect the dots here? 
PERINO: And I think that everything is -- they're trying to -- 
OWENS: "The Bachelorette" and "#MeToo"?
PERINO: Yes, everything is under -- they're trying to put it in. Yes, everything is being put in under that. 
Here's -- for me, I don't like this program, "The Bachelorette."
GUTFELD: How dare you?
PERINO: But guess what? 
OWENS: Neither do I.
PERINO: I don't watch it. 
GUTFELD: The whole audience is women.
PERINO: That's my choice. 
GUTFELD: OK, but can I interrupt? 
RIVERA: That's too reasonable.
GUTFELD: It's supposed to be a violation of "#MeToo." The entire audience is women and me. It's, like, 99 percent women --
OWENS: You, too.
GUTFELD: -- and me. 
WATTERS: And me. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I've been through Brad, Juan Pablo --
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: -- JoJo, Andy. I've seen them all. Except this season I stopped watching. 
I love the show. I think it's romantic. 
PERINO: Romantic?
WATTERS: And I have teared up on a few of these episodes. 
GUTFELD: You have. I've seen it. 
RIVERA: Poor boy. Poor Jess.
WATTERS: It's incredibly interesting. And I think what they're trying to do, they want to eliminate men courting women in America because of the "#MeToo" movement. And that's not -- no one crosses the line on the show. 
RIVERA: Didn't they have some kind of seedy thing happen, where it was supposed to be --
WATTERS: On a reality show, Geraldo? You don't say.
RIVERA: Somebody said it wasn't -- it was nonconsensual? 
GUTFELD: Was it "Bachelors in Paradise"?
WATTERS: Well, that's sad, and that should be handled.
GUTFELD: It was "Bachelors in Paradise." 
OWENS: Then it ended up being resolved, and they both said that it was consensual and that the producers made it something that it wasn't. So let's clarify that.
PERINO: They were trying to get some controversy so we would talk about it on "The Five."
RIVERA: I have considerable reality experience. I did the "Celebrity Apprentice." There was no sex in that. But "Dancing with the Stars" --
GUTFELD: With you anyway.
RIVERA: I did "Dancing with the Stars." I was already 73 years old when I did it. I was lame, I was awful. And they had asked me for 20 years or ten years or however long the show's been around to do "Dancing with the Stars." And my kids and my wife always said, "Don't do it. Don't do it. Everybody has affairs with the dancers." All of the celebrities have affairs.
PERINO: I didn't know that.
RIVERA: So I didn't do it until I was passed a fair age. 
GUTFELD: That happened a lot on Lawrence Welk, I hear. 
OWENS: Interesting. The London -- the London School of Economics had a study. I don't know why they were doing a study. Saying that "The Kardashians" -- watching "The Kardashians" makes people not like poor people. So this is also another concern --
PERINO: What? 
OWENS: -- is that we are starting not o like being poor in this country. 
RIVERA: I thought you were going to say it was like taking away their I.Q.'s.
OWENS: Why are they studying this at the London School of Economics? 
GUTFELD: They're trying to -- they're trying to link it to status inequality when you see people doing well. But it's actually aspirational. 
RIVERA: I don't buy that at all. Aspirational.
OWENS: It's good. They don't want to be poor. What's wrong with that? What is wrong with capitalism? 
RIVERA: They're saying 15 years in television. "The Kardashians." No such thing as an accident in TV. 
PERINO: One time I watched, like, five hours of "Bridezillas." 
GUTFELD: "Bridezillas."
PERINO: Because it was raining and we were someplace. And it -- that was horrible. That was really bad.
WATTERS: You should see "The Jersey Shore." It was horrible.
GUTFELD: I like "Bar Rescue." Do you guys watch "Bar Rescue"? 
PERINO: No.
OWENS: "One More Thing" is up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: It's time for "One More Thing," Jesse. 
WATTERS: Here we go. "Jesse's Eyebrow News."
GRAPHIC: Jesse's Eyebrow News."
OWENS: Oh, God.
WATTERS: We have it. Look at it, look at it! You missed it, Gutfeld! They went up and down. 
All right. So Rihanna has some new eyebrows she's rocking. They're thin. All right? See that right there on the cover? So a Latina writer from "Marie Claire" wrote that this is cultural appropriation. 
RIVERA: Oh, no.
OWENS: Oh, no.
WATTERS: And it was problematic, because -- 
GUTFELD: That's the word! 
WATTERS: -- they were too thin for Rihanna. Rihanna responded with this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Rihanna, let's see the -- this email from Rihanna goes, "I'm feeling thin eyebrows." 
RIHANNA, MUSICIAN: Thin eyebrows are such a beautiful, very ladylike. But it's still punk. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes. These eyebrows are not thin, and that is your eyebrow news of the day. 
GUTFELD: Thank you, Jesse. I'm glad you navigated that carefully -- Dana. 
PERINO: All right. Thousands of fans and more than 4,000 dog surfers showed up to the Third Annual World Dog Surfing Championships in Pacifica, California, over the weekend. 
GUTFELD: Terrible.
PERINO: The owners and their four-legged friends rode the waves just outside of San Francisco to see who has the best moves. The judges were human and scored each surfer based on their ability to stand, ride, and move in the wave style. That's also a huge plus.
The championship is more than just fun and games. Each year a portion of the proceeds of the event go to dog surfing. And, of course, it's California, environmental charities. Let me add "One More Thing." Do you know that the water off the coast of San Diego is 73 degrees right now? 
GUTFELD: Wow, that's fantastic.
PERINO: You could take a bath in there. 
GUTFELD: All right. Antifa won't.
All right. It's time for --
GRAPHIC: Greg's Cable News
GUTFELD: "Greg's Cable News"! If you were watching CNN last night, boy, did Michael Avenatti and Rudy Giuliani go after it! Check out this tape. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(TWO SMALL DOGS BARKING AT EACH OTHER)
(ENE VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Just wait. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Did they go away? 
PERINO: We're at the break.
GUTFELD: No, no, no, no. And then he said something else. And then. They're back at it. This went on for three hours! 
Good job, CNN. 
All right, Geraldo. 
OWENS: That was excellent. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
RIVERA: My wife is with me. We're celebrating our anniversary here in New York. When we got together, no one gave us any chance of success at all. I was 60 years old. Erica was 28 years old. The consensus were that we would last 15 weeks. We lasted 15 years. Our 15th anniversary is Saturday. 
GUTFELD: Wow.
PERINO: Congratulations.
RIVERA: My beautiful wife Erica. We also celebrate our daughter, Sol Ileana. Her 13th birthday is a bar mitzvah year. It was August the second. She's a doll, the joy of our life. We love her. And I'm so happy that things have turned out. 
PERINO: Congratulations.
RIVERA: And so many were wrong, and I was right.
OWENS: All right, guys. I want you to feel good going into hump day. So one song, over 4.5 million views later. A family from Anchorage, Alaska, has become an Internet sensation with their a cappella version of the hit single by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line, "Meant to Be." Let's roll the clip. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC: "MEANT TO BE")
(END VIDEO CLIP)
OWENS: Look at the girl in the back dancing. This makes me just so happy, because Jesus is becoming something cool to celebrate again, culturally relevant. This family is singing about Jesus. They have an entire Instagram page, a YouTube page, of them just celebrating the good Lord, which is a beautiful message and a great way to end -- 
WATTERS: But the Saudis! The Saudis are our enemy, Candace! Don't you know?
OWENS: We all looked at it, America. We all looked at it. 
WATTERS: Geraldo is the one throwing punches this time. 
GUTFELD: Set your DVRs, whatever that means. She is a news cannon, and her name is Shannon. 
Hi, Shannon. 
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS: Hi, Greg. We're ready to explode with a bunch of breaking news. 
GUTFELD: Excellent.
