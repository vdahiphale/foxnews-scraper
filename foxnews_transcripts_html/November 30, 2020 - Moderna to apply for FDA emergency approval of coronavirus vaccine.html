NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Indeed, it is a wonderful time of the year,if you like to shop, let's say online, because the Cyber Monday, that'swhat a lot of folks are doing.Now, of course, here at FOX, we're all work all the time, so the last thingwe're going to do is shop when we're supposed to be doing shows.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Good. Got it done.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is your, well, shopping worldon a day we got a reminder here that we, boy, love this idea of justcocooning and doing or buying at home and cozy and not necessarily at thoseold stores, because that's where the dichotomy exists.There's a big separation between going to a mall and just, well, punchingand keying it in and getting what you want delivered to your home. We'regoing to go into that in just a little bit, looking at that phenomenon.Grady Trimble, he's in Chicago, Susan Li keeping track of how Wall Streetis keeping track of all of this, because I should stress, on the bottomportion of your screen there, you're seeing a sell-off in the Dow, but thisis one of the best months we have seen in many a decade, I suspect beforeeither those folks were born, even before I was born.No, OK, that's a lie.All right, a couple other things we're following as well, as what'shappening in Atlanta, Georgia. We're expecting to hear from the secretaryof state, writing off again on what now has been three different votes inThe Peach state that all confirm the same thing, Joe Biden won, end ofstory. Or is it?We will get an idea. When the secretary of state approaches that podium, wewill be approaching him.Let's go to Grady Trimble first on what you have been up to, and shoppingand all of that, because, depending where you are, and how you're doing it,you're either breaking records or you're not doing anything at all --Grady.GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Neil, Americans spent $23.5billion online Thursday through Sunday. And, today, well, we're going tokeep spending.Adobe projects that we will spend somewhere between $10.8 billion and $12.7billion this Cyber Monday. That would make today the biggest onlinespending day ever and would be between 15 and 35 percent more than we spentlast Cyber Monday, which, as of right now is the current record holder.The pandemic, of course, a huge reason for the surge in online sales, BlackFriday foot traffic down about 52 percent, according to SensormaticSolutions. That, in some ways, though, was by design. A lot of theretailers didn't want big crowds at their stores because of the pandemic.And so they drove them online and spread out their sales over the entiremonth of November. What that did is, it heated up the competition withAmazon, but Amazon rose to the occasion. Look at this. Amazon increased itsshare of online sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday to 55 percent.Amazon was followed by Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and eBay. Some of thesales on Walmart's Web site today, treadmills for those keeping up withtheir fitness at home, as well as Apple AirPods. Over at Target, they havevacuums on sale from Dyson, as well as Apple Watches.And, Neil, weather-wise today in Chicago, a very good day, I would say, tosit on the couch and order away online from the comfort of your home.CAVUTO:  Ah. It sounds like my typical day. Thank you, my friend.I have heard of these things called treadmills too.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Thank you for that update, Grady Trimble in Chicago.Hitha Herzog here. No one follows retail activity better than Hitha. I havebeen honored to know her over these many, many years. She can kind of sortout where the strengths are, where the weaknesses are.It is interesting, Hitha. I mean, a lot of people are certainly interestedin buying a lot of things, as long as they don't have to leave their homes,huh?HITHA HERZOG, RETAIL WATCHER:  We have been seeing this trend happen foryears now. As you mentioned, Neil, we have been doing this for a long time.But one thing that I have been tracking are the direct consumer businesses.So, if you look at Shopify and their numbers, you saw that they -- thedirect-to-consumer businesses did about -- these are one million businesses-- did about $2.4 billion worth of business. That is 75 percent more thanwhat they did in 2019.So, while we're tracking the different companies that are taking awaymarket share from Amazon, and Amazon wrapping -- or ramping up their onlinesales, we still -- we have to look at the small businesses especially. AndShopify is one way that we're able to track that.CAVUTO:  So, when you track it, obviously, people are inclined to spend,the pandemic notwithstanding, maybe because of the pandemic.I mean, early on, I remember you were saying, watch. That's what's going tohappen. And, indeed, it did.But I'm surprised that physical structure malls, stores, haven't done moreto entice people to come in, not all, not all.But who is getting this right?HERZOG:  Well, a lot of malls are trying to take into consideration safetymeasures.So, if you walk into a mall, you will see a lot of social distancing, signseverywhere, ways to keep yourself, your hands sanitized. We're even lookingat this one company that I was getting -- I was talking to. It's a companycalled ChargeItSpot.And their business is basically, they were charging phones and a lot ofthese retailers. Now they're sanitizing and charging your phone as youshop, so different retailers. And they have partnered with a bunch ofdifferent retailers in the mall, including Bloomingdale's and Target.So, you're seeing a bunch of different retailers take these measures intoconsideration. But, Neil, according to the study that I was looking at,Oracle, 64 percent of people still want their purchases delivered to theirhomes. And I think, to your point, no one really wants to go outside.I'm here in New York City. It's raining. It's cold. We haven't seen a lotof snow yet here. But I can guarantee that people are just going to want tohunker down this season.CAVUTO:  Yes, they might get their first chance this week. I don't want todepress people on that. But we will see.All right, thank you very, very much, on that, Hitha.In the meantime, we did have a backdrop, a sad last day of November, but donot cry for the bulls, one of the best months they have seen, well, inquite a number of decades, depending on the average and depending on howyou want to look at this.And Susan Li looks at it better than anyone I know here.Susan, what can you tell us about the month of November just wrapped up?SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's definitely a November toremember.So we're looking at new record highs so far this month and best Novemberfor the Dow going back to the 1920s. There's never been a better Novemberfor the broader S&P 500, and same for the small cap, Russell 2000. TheNasdaq is looking at the best November since after dot-com bubble burst,all with double-digit gains, mind you, in just 30 days. That's explosive.So, what stocks did well in the month? The ones that have lagged all year,so, energy, financials and banks, industrials, like equipment and machinerymakers, materials, like plastic paper and metal suppliers.And three main catalysts for this November bump, first of all, vaccinehopes. Then you have stimulus predictions with the Janet Yellen, Treasuryand an orderly transition. One of the vaccine hopefuls, Moderna, says itwill apply for FDA approval on Monday.Meantime, we had the world's biggest company, Apple, getting upgrades todayfrom analysts, now telling the clients to buy the stock. Shopify reportingstrong Black Friday sales, as you heard.Slack, it could be bought up by Salesforce as early as Tuesday. And, yes,Bitcoin as also hit a brand-new record high, surpassing levels from threeyears ago, before crashing 18 months later. But experts say that this timeis different, as Bitcoin is going more mainstream on platforms like PayPal,Square and Robinhood.Now, as we head into the final month of the year, December, it's typicallythe strongest month of the year for the stock market, for the so-calledSanta Claus rally. The S&P 500 has risen more than 80 percent of the timein an election year.So, Neil, we will see if Santa Claus delivers this year.CAVUTO:  All right. Well, Santa has quite the wind at his back. We will seewhat happens.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  All right, Susan Li.Before I get to our next guest, I do want to let you know, I promised youwe would be going to this Atlanta development, where the secretary ofstate's office is going to detail the vote count. It's not the secretary ofstate. It's Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager inGeorgia.We're monitoring this very, very closely. They have had a number of counts,I believe three now, to go through the vote in the Peach State. And allthree have come up the same way, a victory for Joe Biden. The president, asyou know, is apoplectic about that, saying that Georgia's governor let himdown, a host of the bigwigs in politics there have let him down.He is still, I believe, going to be campaigning this weekend for theGeorgia Republican senatorial candidates. But, for now, if we get anythingout of this that disputes that or indicates that they're going to give it afourth try or look at some other mechanisms that maybe were missed, wewill, of course, keep you posted.One of the variables in this election year is, a number of states aremaking their tallies official right now.Art Hogan with us, the National Securities Corporation chief marketstrategist.I think it's -- at this point, Art, the markets have concluded it's goingto be Joe Biden on January 20. That's one constant they see happening. Doyou?ART HOGAN, MARKET STRATEGIST:  Yes, I think that is a -- if you look at theheadwinds in September and October, when the market briefly pulled back 10or 15 percent, one of the headwinds was election uncertainty.And I would say that that's behind us. We can put that safely in therearview mirror. And I think that's a good thing. So, as we look at thatand combine that with good news on vaccines, where we have three of thefour leading candidates out with results from phase three, and likelyheading to the FDA for emergency use, I think that's a -- that was anunknown that's turned into a tailwind for this market.But I think the concept of sooner, rather than later, we're going to getsome fiscal stimulus out of gridlock in Washington and into the hands ofthe people that need it the most, probably not as large as we were talkingabout in September and October, but certainly getting out of Washington.And it may well happen in a lame-duck session. So I think the market looksat all three of those things and says, OK, smooth transition, there's alight at the end of the pandemic tunnel, and more fiscal policy stimulusfor this economy that's very needed right now, and it is celebrating thatAnd I think that is what October -- what November has been all about.CAVUTO:  Let me just throw a couple of variables at you, wild carddevelopments that might or might not happen, but they're worth consideringwhat the market expects vs. what it doesn't.It doesn't expect that split government view to change, the White Houseunder Democratic control, the Senate remaining under Republican control.But what if those two Republicans did lose in Georgia? It's unlikely .Now,you never know. Things could change, certainly, January 5.The polls for both are very tight. Then what? How would the market digestnews like that?HOGAN:  You know what's amazing to me is, when we sort of came into thebeginning of this election cycle, it felt like, on the sort of Thursday,Friday, Monday, before the Tuesday, we were actually celebrating a bluewave. And that would mean larger stimulus, changes across the board andthings that would be stimulative to the economy.And then, when the elections rolled around, that sort of Tuesday,Wednesday, Thursday, we shifted gears pretty quickly to, gridlock is good.So I think this is a market that change shift on that narrative prettyquickly. I think, at the end of the day, though, the market is counting onsort of no real changes to corporate tax codes, no major regulatorychanges, but some form of stimulus coming, and certainly an administrationthat is going to be less erratic in our foreign policy endeavors.And I think that's a positive as well.CAVUTO:  Art, much has been said of the economic team that president-electBiden has assembled, including Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reservechairman, now likely to be the next Treasury secretary, that it's center-left.I don't even know what those terms mean anymore, but that it would be prostill more stimulus. In this kind of world, Wall Street likes that, doesn'tit?HOGAN:  I think so, yes. I think that anything during a pandemic, andcoming out of a pandemic, that we -- that gets more stimulus out there tohelp companies and individuals bridge to the other side of this pandemicgap. And I think that that's important.But you also have to remember the Street is looking at this and saying, OK,there's only so much that an administration can do when they don't controlthe Senate, right? So, we're not talking about this sort of north of $3trillion or $3 trillion. We're talking about something in this sort of justsouth of a trillion dollars and something closer to $600 billion to $700billion in the near term.And then sort of having a president that has worked with the Senate hisentire life and able to get things done, you may see things down the roadthat are stimulative, like infrastructure spend that we can all agree on. Ithink it's a bipartisan issue that we need more of that.So, yes, I think it's a market that's looking at this and saying, OK,here's what we know right now. And then let's make an assumption aboutGeorgia. And let's move forward and say, now what does the future looklike?And the biggest piece of all of that, clearly, is getting a strong,durable, broadly available vaccine. And I think those pieces of the puzzleare starting to come together nicely.CAVUTO:  All right, Art, great catching up with you, my friend. Be safe andwell this holiday season, Art.Art Hogan follows these developments very, very well here.We are still monitoring this Atlanta presser featuring the guy whocalculates and sort of adds up all the numbers for the secretary of state.He has just wrapped up here. But it does not appear to be any change in theoverall vote there.We can tell you that Atlanta and in Georgia itself, after these multiplecounts, they're close to officially certifying. They have, in fact, on thevote there in Wisconsin. The recount affirms a Biden win. Ditto in Arizona,as well in Pennsylvania.So, the president is certainly running out of options here and legalbattles. As to at what point he gives up the fight, whether that'sofficially on the electoral vote tally, is anyone's guess. But, for today,at least, apart from politics, the promising developments have been on thevaccine front.And a lot of people dismissed the president when he said that a vaccinecould be ready this year, and now word that Moderna is already filing foremergency approval to get it out in people's hands as soon as this week,Pfizer as well not that far behind.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Well, it looks like Moderna is going to be out there a lot soonerthan expected.How about this week? Looks like it's going to be granted emergency approvalto do that. And look at the pop in the stock as a result, up better than 20percent on the news.Casey Stegall in Arlington, Texas, on what that FDA vaccine nod could mean-- Casey.CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil. Good to see you.If this is approved for emergency use, by the end of the year, Moderna saysthat it could have 20 million doses of that coronavirus vaccine here alonein the United States.And then the pharmaceutical company says it would be on track to generatesome 500 million to one billion doses for 2021. The U.S. Food and Drugadministration approval process could take a little bit of time. But notonly do the clinical trials show that 94.1 percent efficacy rate, but 100percent in preventing severe COVID cases.Here is what the company's chief medical officer had to say about thisbreakthrough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. TAL ZAKS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MODERNA:  And, you know, on a personallevel, when we saw the first interim results, I think we were all really,really relieved and enthusiastic.I can tell you, when I saw the final results last night -- they came in alittle bit earlier than we had planned for -- I allowed myself to cry forthe first time.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEGALL:  Pfizer, meantime, says that it is preparing for the first massair shipment of its vaccine seeing if it's approved, shown to be 95 percenteffective in the clinical trials.And with all this talk about vaccines, the federal government wants toremind people to beware of any kind of phony advertising or abilities tooffer vaccines to you online for purchase, things like that. Sadly, Neil,as with anything, scams are expected, and ICE, actually, Immigrations andCustoms Enforcement, watching this very, very closely in terms of what iscoming into the country.Of course, the actual coronavirus vaccine will be very limited at first,and it will be distributed in a proper means. So, purchasing it online,anything like that, if it sounds too good to be true, of course, itprobably is -- Neil.CAVUTO:  So sad, Casey. And in the middle of every crisis, people will dothat to try to take advantage of people.STEGALL:  Yes. Right.CAVUTO:  Casey Stegall, in Arlington, Texas, and thank you for thatwarning.Just a heads-up. There are some nefarious characters out there, folks.Dr. Bob Lahita, St. Joseph University Hospital chairman of medicine, NewYork Medical College professor, so much more.Doctor, always great seeing you. I hope you had a wonderful and safeThanksgiving.DR. BOB LAHITA, ST. JOSEPH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  How do you look at this -- these vaccines and the rollout, Modernamaybe before Pfizer, but, in short order, two biggies, at least foremergency use, in a matter of weeks.LAHITA:  We're really excited about this, Neil. This is really more thanlight at the end of the tunnel, as you heard the CEO of Moderna gettingvery emotional with his description of the vaccine.We have seen so much death in our field, in medicine, and there's so muchdepression among health care workers, to have a vaccine come forward wouldbe a big boost to all of us who are taking care of those who are very,very, very sick, and those who are going to get very, very sick. And we'reworried about that, Neil.After Thanksgiving, after the big gatherings that we were warned against, Ihave heard of many patients just today, this morning, who were with theirrelatives who are COVID-positive. And everybody's walking on eggs right now-- Neil.CAVUTO:  Oh, boy, they didn't listen to you, Doctor. And you were here manytimes saying, be careful and all that.LAHITA:  I did.CAVUTO:  But, Doctor, I was thinking of you on this same subject, becauseDr. Fauci now is saying, what you did at Thanksgiving -- I'm paraphrasinghere, sir -- you should consider at Christmas and Hanukkah and theholidays, one more holiday.Go slow. Keep the family members low, because we can do this, if we do itone more time, one more big holiday gathering. What did you make of that?LAHITA:  I think he's right.I think the big concern was the gatherings that we're seeing and thespreading, the super-spreader events. Well, first, they wind up as smallspreader events at your dining room table. And then it goes from there,where people leave that are infected and infect others and infect others.The most important thing is, remember the masks, wash your hands, socialdistancing. But the bump from Thanksgiving should happen around the secondweek of December, which is right into the Christmas holidays.And then, of course, with Christmas, everybody's going to get together in abig clump. And we're back to square one with spreading and people gettingsick well into the new year. And that's what we don't really want to see.But we're prepared for it. However, we're running out of steam. It's hardto staff a hospital when half the staff is ill. It's very, very difficultin towns and cities where there's only one hospital, say, in a 50-mileradius within the country. So that's what we're concerned about -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Doctor, another thing I was curious about -- and maybe just menoticing -- older people who are getting this are not facing the same tripsto the ICU or worse, God forbid, that I saw in the early days of thepandemic.Maybe a reminder of that was none other than 87 years young Chuck Grassleyin the Senate who was -- tested positive, and everyone was worried. Well,boy, he is in that age group and everything else. That could be worrisome.And I have seen anecdotal cases of that, that people who used to followthat trajectory of a certain age and risk group who aren't anymore, andthere's no vaccine out yet.So, I'm wondering what's going on there.LAHITA:  Yes.CAVUTO:  Are you guys just better at treating, finding a way to deal withthis, what?LAHITA:  Well, number one, we're much better at treating it. We're muchbetter at keeping people off of ventilators. That was a big one.And the fact that this is a stepwise increase in cases, rather than a bigsurge that we saw last spring, means a lot. And the other thing is, it'simpossible -- and I have said this over and over -- to tell who is going tosuccumb to this.Now, there's clearly an immunological either genetics or a glitch thatallows you to get very, very sick and die. But it's not present ineveryone. The vast majority of us, thank goodness, are not in that group.But you have got to remember that there are -- you never know who's goingto be the one that will succumb to this virus, even within families --Neil.CAVUTO:  No, you're right about. And all words well-heeded.Dr. Bob Lahita, thanks for all you, all you are, and the good advice yougive, even when people like me don't like the eating advice you give, like,try not to overdo it and all that. But, for the most part, you're very goodto listen to on the subjects that matter.LAHITA:  Thanks, Neil.CAVUTO:  Dr. Lahita, good seeing you again, my friend.All right, in the meantime, by the way, on the eating thing atThanksgiving, did you hear these doctors who are advocating wear a mask?And, in California, they said wear one indoors. I guess the idea was thatit not only makes it more healthy around you, but you eat less that way.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  I found a way around that by cutting a hole in the mask.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, the presidential vote in Georgia might be signed,sealed and about done, but the secretary of state's office is examiningsome registration efforts by some progressive groups, like America Votesand Vote Forward, to encourage people who are outside Georgia to vote inGeorgia.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  President-elect Joe Biden has received his first securitybriefing, a transition briefing that's crucial right now. I believe KamalaHarris was also part of that.Jacqui Heinrich has more from Wilmington, Delaware.Hey, Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil. Good to seeyou. Hope you had a good holiday.Vice president-elect Kamala Harris received her briefing at the Departmentof Commerce. That is where the official transition office is located. It'sbeen rarely used since it was first made available in September. Andpresident-elect Joe Biden received his first briefing, presidential dailybriefing, at his home here in Wilmington.We can deduce that it has now been concluded from the language that I justreceived from one of the transition officials. It marks the very first timeBiden has received this briefing as the president-elect. He was previouslyreceiving limited intelligence briefings as the Democratic nominee, but,after he won the election, he was blocked from the PDB, as it's called, forseveral weeks, while the White House held up the formal transition.It led to a really unusual situation where, for about three weeks, vicepresident-elect Kamala Harris had access to more classified informationthan Biden himself because she was a member of the Senate Intel Committee.Biden, at one point, resorted to holding a national security briefing withoutside intelligence, diplomacy and defense experts.Meantime, Biden announced six key choices for his economic team today,nominating former Fed Chair Janet Yellen for Treasury secretary. Ifconfirmed, she will be the first woman to lead the department. And she willface a unique set of challenges managing economic fallout from thepandemic.Biden also tapped Neera Tanden from the liberal think tank the Center forAmerican Progress to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Hernomination, though, is already being met with a lot of pushback. There arereports that Democrats have floated the idea of a sort of sacrificial lambto let the Senate flex its muscles, so to speak, maybe nix a confirmationof one person to allow others to more easily pass through.And she's being eyed potentially as someone who might fit that description.Lots and lots of pushback against her -- her nomination here today -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, there's always one in those Cabinet choices. And,invariably, that's someone that just doesn't get through.Jacqui Heinrich, thank you very much, Jacqui, of course, in Wilmington,Delaware, following the president-elect.Charlie Gasparino following the president-elect's economic team choices,what we know of them does far.Charlie, what can tell us?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think JanetYellen is going to pass. I think they're all going to get through, exceptfor Neera Tanden. We will get to that in a second.I mean, I -- here's what I think the -- listen, this is all based on --this analysis that I want to give you -- that the GOP keeps the Senate. AndI think people inside the Biden camp believe it's a very good chance thatthey're -- the GOP is going to keep -- take one of those Georgia Senaterun-offs.If that happens, there's 51 Republicans. And you need votes to get through.You need -- you need Republican votes to get through.That being said, Janet Yellen, she will be approved. Not saying they won'tbreak her chops a little bit, which they will. If you saw the column Iwrote in The New York Post, her stuff about income inequality just doesn'treally jibe with the record of income inequality during the Obama years,where income inequality just exploded, and the gaps between the rich andthe poor, and not only that.The wage rate of those on the lower end fell dramatically, where richpeople made a lot of money feasting on Janet Yellen's zero percent, nearzero percent interest rates and Fed easing. So, she's going to have toanswer to that.And I think that's going to be -- but that will be more rhetorical. Shewill get through. Even some of the guys that -- like Brian Deese as head ofthe -- I believe the NEC, he doesn't need to be approved. But, again, he'smore -- again, he's in that tradition of Janet Yellen, much moremainstream, much more policy-oriented.It's the Neera Tanden thing that I keep hearing from my Republican sources,that they're going to try to light her up when she gets out there. She'sbeen very partisan over the years, on the cable TV circuit, doing partisan-- making her partisan points.And I think they believe that they have good grounds to deny her. I don'tknow if she's been put up as a sacrificial lamb. I kind of don't believethat. That's a little too conspiracy-oriented to me. I just think that theydidn't -- they don't realize the type of pushback -- they underestimatedthe type of pushback they're going to get from her, thinking thatRepublicans are just going to, like, roll over and allow anybody to getthrough, including someone who kind of fits the bill.She's a woman, maybe one of the first woman -- one of the few women thatheld that job. But that doesn't negate her record. And her record washighly partisan. She attacked some of the GOP senators, from what Iunderstand, that could be making the decision.I mean, this thing has battle written all over it. And if the Republicanskeep the Senate, she's probably -- based on what I'm hearing, she'sprobably not going to get through, Neil. I mean, that's the one.CAVUTO:  All right.GASPARINO:  The rest of them, I think, go through easy, you know?CAVUTO:  All right, buddy, thank you very much, Charlie Gasparino followingall of that.We're getting more details on this Georgia secretary of state charge. Hewas talking specifically about the Senate run-off elections, not the vote,the third vote wrapping up in Georgia, that has already been virtuallycertified for Joe Biden.This concerns the twin January elections for Senate, which the secretary ofstate is examining registration efforts by some progressive groups, amongthem, America Votes, Vote Forward, and The New Georgia Project.He said some of these groups have been encouraging people who live outsideGeorgia to register to vote in the state. These third-party groups, hesaid, have a responsibility do not encourage illegal voting. If they do so,they will be held responsible.He took great care to say this applies to the January 5 run-off, and notthe presidential election, an election just passed. We will keep youposted.And we will have more on this from Steve Harrigan in Atlanta right afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, well, if the Georgia secretary of state is right, someprogressive groups have some explaining to do regarding trying to getvoters to go out and have a role and vote for the Democratic senatorialcandidates ahead of that January 5 run-off election, even if, presently,they do not live in the Peach State.Steve Harrigan with more on all of this in Atlanta -- Steve.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, two sets of problems, what'salready happened with the voting and what could happen in the future in thevoting, the Georgia secretary of state here worried about both.As for those January 5 senator run-off races, they are concerned aboutthird party groups bringing in new voters, either from out of state ortrying to get college students to switch their registration, then switchback, the secretary of state warning today that such activity was indeed afelony.As far as the general election in November, he said there's at least 250open cases still under investigation, things like double voting, deadpeople attempting to vote, or absentee ballots that outnumber the absenteeballots requested.So far, none of these charges have been verified. There are 23investigators looking into them. And officials said today, at this point,they see nothing that jumps off the page that suggests that these claims offraud could change the results, those results, of course, Joe Biden withmore than a 12,000-vote lead.That third presidential recount still under way. It wraps up December 2.And the president himself comes here to Georgia to campaign for those twoSenate candidates this Saturday -- Neil, back to you.CAVUTO:  You know, Steve, I know that secretary of state there has beencritical of some of what he's called the fantastic stories that have beengenerated. He called them half-truths, fantastic claims that are adding tothe cynical view people have a vote that otherwise, save some of theseexamples you raise, would not have changed the outcome one way or theother.What do you make of that? What have you heard on that?HARRIGAN:  Neil, you're right. The officials are saying, very critically --actually going a step beyond that. The secretary of state today said hethinks the president is being deceived by false actors.So, at the same time, though, he's saying there's 250 open cases. Keep inmind, this is an election with five million votes for president. So, 250 isnot a large number, but the margin between the two is very close, just12,000 votes, a fraction of 1 percent. So, you can see why it's heated onboth sides -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Understood.All right, Steve Harrigan, thank you very much.Want to go to John Bussey right now, John, of course, FOX News contributor,Wall Street Journal associate editor.We already know about the presidential contest there, the Senate, the run-off one that's getting a great deal of attention, probably just as muchcontroversy.But, John, on the issue of Wall Street titans and backers who ostensiblyare behind Joe Biden now, but are holding out on the Senate election, if Ihave got that right, what are they saying?JOHN BUSSEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, maybe it's a matter of kind ofall politics being local, Neil.Bloomberg has an interesting story on this, that (AUDIO GAP) have not beenas forthcoming with donations to the senatorial campaigns in the run-off.And there's conjecture whether or not that has to do with the fact thatBiden plans to raise taxes, and that these individuals on Wall Street don'twant to see that happen.They kind of got what they want, but they want to sort of limit it. I mean,broadly speaking, in America, politics tend to be around the center. It's afairly centrist country. So people do split tickets quite often. And, inthis case, they may have gotten what they wanted with a Biden victory,someone new somewhat to properly manage the coronavirus crisis, a change intone in the White House.But they don't necessarily want the tax increases that come with it. So,the Bloomberg article was speculating that -- interestingly so, that thedesire to maybe kind of keep the Senate the way it is now, in the hands ofthe Republicans to block any potential tax increases.CAVUTO:  Now, the president-elect's Cabinet choices -- and it goes beyondthe Cabinet, as you know, John, to the economic team that with starts JanetYellen is Treasury -- they're called the center-left group.I can never describe these sort of descriptions. But it's kind of neat thatthe notion that Wall Street has is, they're very pro-stimulus, to a woman,only one man right now, and they would be inclined at this point to up thestimulus ante, which I guess Wall Street would welcome, right?I mean, everyone seems to love the money from Uncle Sam these days.BUSSEY:  Yes, low interest rates and government spending.And I think that that's what's run the Dow up and the S&P up the way thatit has...CAVUTO:  Right. Right.BUSSEY:  ... is the expectation that there will finally be a stimulus deal,and that interest rates are going to stay low.At the same time, these same economic advisers, Neil, are facing aballooning deficit. And, at some point, they're going to have to contendwith that. The Republicans are worried about sort of tax increases on bothcompanies and individuals in the form of cap gains taxes.President Trump took the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 21percent. Biden is talking about raising it to 28 percent. It's reallyunclear how much of that tax increase or that tax decrease actuallybenefited the economy.Our Richard Rubin has written on this, that there was a sort of an initialkind of uptick in capital spending by companies, but not enough to pay forthe tax cuts. It didn't stimulate the economy enough to pay for the taxcuts.And a lot of the money went into stock buybacks, record level of stockbuybacks. Part of that may have been the fact that these corporate chiefswere looking out over the horizon, and they realized the Democrats had notsupported the tax reduction, and they were worrying about 2020, theDemocrats coming back in the White House, which is what has happened.And so they were hedging their bets. They didn't want to spend a lot oftheir cap -- their lower tax money, their gains from that on CapEx, thatthey would have to amortize that over years. So this is going to be -- it'sgoing to be very interesting to watch.It's going to be a sort of play against the -- kind of the self-interest ofWall Street and the broader direction that Biden wants to take the economy.CAVUTO:  All right, well-explained.John Bussey, thank you very, very much. I hadn't thought of that. You holdback on some of this other stuff just in case you're going to see a switchin administrations.John Bussey of The Wall Street Journal on all of that.We told you right now that Congress will be back in session for just ateeny bit of time here. They call it the lame-duck session, but some lame-ducks can do some things. What about this one?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, back in session, but really not for long.What can we expect out of an abbreviated period where you have a lot oflame-duckers in there who are not going to be in power come January, notall of them, but some of them.Chad Pergram on the hope for stimulus.We have heard it before, Chad. And the hope now is that something is doneduring this brief lame-duck session. But what do you think?CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  That's right.Well, this would be the last-ditch effort to get a deal. There's been noengagement from the White House so far. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she isgetting some criticism from some Democrats, who think she should have cut asmaller deal sometime before the election. She's going to have a smallermajority next year.Now, in the past hour, you have had the Democratic and Republican leaderson the Senate floor for the first time since Thanksgiving. Let's start withChuck Schumer of New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  We need a true bipartisanbill, not, this is our bill, take it or leave it, that can bring ustogether, can solve the desperate needs of the American people, which weall very much want to solve.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Something new today. There is a Hail Mary effort by a bipartisancoalition of senators trying to get a deal. They believe there's a chance,since Pelosi and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, haven't movedfrom their positions in months.Now, also some good news today. Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator fromIowa, he is back in the Senate. He tested positive for coronavirus beforeThanksgiving. He said that this was the first Thanksgiving dinner he missedwith his wife. But he is back, and he had no symptoms -- Neil.CAVUTO:  That is very good news.And, sometimes, you worry. The older the positively tested patient, thetougher, but not in his case. He's a tough guy.Chad Pergram, thank you, my friend, Chad Pergram in Washington followingthese developments.In New Jersey, though, they are talking about potential lockdowns again.And that, of course, for a lot of businesses already under enormouspressure, was not exactly music to their ears.Meet one very worried -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy not ruling out the possibility ofanother statewide shutdown, as COVID-19 cases begin to spiral kind of outof control.Count Paul Miller a little worried. Paul is the Just Jersey shop co-owner,joins us right now.Now, Paul, it's very good to have you.We should stress that no decision has been made on this. But you'reconcerned that another shutdown would keep you down, wouldn't it?PAUL MILLER, CO-OWNER, JUST JERSEY:  Well, I mean, like any other business,we depend on everyday revenues to make ends meet.We may be a little bit more fortunate than some others. We had made someinvestments in our e-commerce and online presence. While we have got eightor 9,000 SKUs in the store, we have been able to get 800, 900 of themonline.And so during the first shutdown, the three months that our doors werelocked, and we were only able to operate via online, curbside, localdelivery, we're one of the fortunate ones. Unlike many of our neighbors inthe restaurant or food business, our dedicated customers came through forus and continued to order online.With the holidays approaching, the uncertainty is magnified. We do about 30percent of our business during this four-week period.CAVUTO:  Is that right?MILLER:  So, any impact on that is a major impact to us for the year.And for us...CAVUTO:  Now, you haven't heard anything about that. I know you have -- youhonor the distancing rules and all of that and keep things very, veryclean.Do you know of any other requirements, short of shutting down or limitingyour hours, that are being contemplated?MILLER:  We do not.I mean, we have been following the executive orders as they're released andupdated. And, this weekend, Small Business Saturday is one of the biggestdays of the year for us. And we have adhered to the limit of 10 people. Theindoor gatherings, we assumed would mean our customers and employeesgathering in our store.So, we limited the store to 10 people at a time on Saturday. And there weretimes when we had a line outside of more people outside the store thaninside the store.But the feedback we got was, one, it made our customers feel good that wewere taking the steps to ensure the safety of our employees and ourcustomers. And we might have had a little bit of a bonus bump from peopleseeing, hey, there's a line at that store. That must be a place worthwaiting to get into.(LAUGHTER)MILLER:  So, I'm not sure we're the worst-case scenario in this claim.One of the things we have found, that the pandemic has affected people inso many different ways, that we're seeing an uptick in our corporatebusiness, because a lot of corporations want to do whatever they can attheir holiday giving time to support local businesses and show that they'rereally connected to their local communities.Our store is unique, in that our supply chain consists of nearly 300individual artists and makers and small businesses all located in NewJersey. And so those individuals have their own supply chain issues thatare impacting their ability to provide product to us.CAVUTO:  That's right.MILLER:  And so our supply chain is a little bit more complex than many whomay only order from a few different distributors.But, in the end, we're all fighting for the same limited resources of timeand money. And we are just blessed with a great community, as you wellknow, being a New Jerseyan yourself.And our customers and neighbors have been great.CAVUTO:  Well, you have got some very cool stuff. You're doing just fine,Paul. I have no doubt you will weather all of this, Paul Miller, the NewJersey shop co-owner.Hope springs eternal for businesses just trying to survive.That will do it here.Here's "THE FIVE."THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
