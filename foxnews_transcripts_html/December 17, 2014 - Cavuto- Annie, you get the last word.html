Annie Goodman has died.
Some of you might remember Annie. She was the young producer who came out from behind the camera to talk about something horrible on camera. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Something horrible that was happening to her and something she wanted to bring attention to so more young women wouldn't have to follow her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That something was triple negative cancer - a particularly virulent form of cancer for which treatment is limited, and recurrence is all but inevitable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Annie knew her odds, but she also knew she wasn't going down without a fight
When I asked her how it felt to be the face of a disease, leave it to Annie to zing back, "I'm just sorry I couldn't offer a pretty face." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
She was pretty wrong.
But always funny. Always blunt. Always fighting. Never quitting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Leave it to a woman who refused to let you have the last word, to let this most obscure and lethal of cancers continue to leave the world in the dark. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Annie chronicled every turn, every treatment, every fit, every start.
Sometimes she made you cry. But sometimes it's as if she'd pull a Cher in "Moonstruck" and slap herself out of it!
That's when Annie would talk about losing her hair, and about her wigs. Man, did Annie have a lot of wigs! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One time she stopped by my office sporting a particularly garish one and asked me, "Do you think it makes me look fat?"
A woman for whom the New York Yankees were an obsession and Derek Jeter an even bigger obsession.
A news junkie, but one who as this disease progressed, began wondering aloud whether a lot of it was junk, and all of us were too obsessed with that junk 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't think Annie would mind, if I shared this tweet from her back on October 28th, when she wrote: "I beg the world. Stop complaining. Find ways to be happy. Seriously. Dig deep. Even in my worst times, I still try. No matter how hard." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Leave it to a woman young enough to be my daughter, to offer wisdom way beyond her years.
And maybe this suddenly sadder holiday season, jar us back to the things that matter in life. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Neil Cavuto: When everyone complains about silly things and this problem and this pressure, you must just shake your head and say, what .. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Annie: I wish i had your problems. Because sometimes, I think about it, and this has only been in my life for two years. Sometimes it's hard to remember was my life was like before cancer. Sometimes it's hard to remember, what were the trivial things I complained about before cancer. Like, I can't catch a cab, this sucks, or stupid things like that. And you know, you remember what's important. You want to experience as much as you can. That's a big thing. Stuff no longer matters. It's not about having, you know, things, it's about spending time with your family, it is about having experiences that I've always wanted to do and you want to cram in as many things as possible, because you just, you just don't know. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {

Annie, you get the last word.

But just this last time. And only because you've left us speechless, kiddo. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
