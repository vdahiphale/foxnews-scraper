Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Today, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and President Obama honored our vets. They both spoke at the American Legion National Convention. So now it's going to be our turn. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. On Monday, at 7:00 p.m., right here ON THE RECORD, we are going to honor our vets. But we are also going to honor their spouses.
I don't need to tell you, military service is tough. But it's also really tough on spouses and can be extremely tough on marriages. So we're going to take you on a spectacular trip to Alaska with Operation Heal Our Patriots. It's a Reverend Franklin Graham and Samaritan's Purse program. And it's a program to help these vets' marriages, whose stories are incredible. You won't believe what these heroes and their spouses have endured.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

SPC. CHUCK ARMSTEAD, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED: I walk outside, didn't see anybody at the gate, didn't see him. And so I started to proceed to walk further out steps an Iraqi from behind a vehicle with an A.K., and he just shot me. It shattered my hip and hit an artery in there so they couldn't get any circulation to my leg anymore so they had to kind of cut it all away. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

We will hear more from Chuck, another wonderful vet and you're going to hear from their spouses who have scarified so much.
