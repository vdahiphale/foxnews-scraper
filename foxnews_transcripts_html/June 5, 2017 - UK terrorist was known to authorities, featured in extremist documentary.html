GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I am Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she ice skates on a popsicle, Dana Perino. "The Five." 
Yet again, after the latest attack in the U.K., we find out that one of the terrorists have been reported to police at least twice before. And this is crazy: He was reportedly in a documentary on Jihadism -- British Jihadism. But the attack still happened. How could that be?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We know the answer. No one wants to go after these goals and be wrong because then you are suddenly labeled a bigot. It's incentive not to act.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's say you did go up to them and you were right? Then, what happens? If you stop this latest attack it, who would know? A foiled plot lacks the optics of a successful one. Your prevention of the threat remains invisible and so does the threat. It's the worst catch-22 ever.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The travel ban insights debate for a similar reason. Our media doesn't sense the urgency, lightning is more dangerous, they always tell us. So they target President Trump, not terror instead. 
Now, you could say Donald Trump is a crude messenger. You'd be right. But if he is wrong on the little things, what if he's right on the one big thing? That's better than being eloquent on all things but wrong on what matters. We had that for eight years.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The next step? Treat terrorist not as fighters but deadbeats. Future anti-terror tactics must be unbending. No emotion, no politics, as methodical as a garbage man on his morning rounds. He doesn't stop to ponder the empty egg carton. He doesn't refer to coffee grounds as extremist coffee grounds with different beliefs. He just chucks it. 
The scum are the same. Garbage deserving no contemplation, just eradication. One need not be eloquent when taking out the trash. Just right.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Dana, this, I mean, a guy unfurled on ISIS flag and a documentary about homegrown terrorism. And you think maybe --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, the catch-22 is right. What was illegal about that? 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: OK. If there is nothing illegal about that, then how do you stop somebody from doing something if they haven't done anything illegal up to that point? So, maybe, you can catch them for drunk driving or something like that. You can actually prevent something from happening but the problem is --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Assign someone to him. 
PERINO: Okay.
GUTFELD: Assign someone to him.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And so, then it gets to the question of, do we have enough resources to do that?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: And yes, you do. Because if you have enough resources for universal health care --
PERINO: Okay, I'm not --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: No, the only reason why the UK has -- 
PERINO: They don't have enough resources for health care because it's in shambles.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: No, but all their money goes to the social programs. And they always talk about how tight they are when it comes to this sort of stuff.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: It is time that they reprioritize. A lot of Europe can do a lot of these social programs because they rely on us.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
GUTFELD: They know that we will be there. 
PERINO: Uh-hm. We can't be there to help them with this. 
GUTFELD: No. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: I mean, we are not on their streets. We are not that good unless they want us to be.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes. Right. 
PERINO: I am assuming that they don't. So, we can't help them. But we are not in their communities we can't tell. So, I do think that -- one thing about the travel ban though is even someone like -- I don't know about this guy -- whatever his other name was. But then he was born in the U.K.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: So, the travel ban, if you think about it, forget the merits of this for a second but it's long-term thinking.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');

        }
      
GUTFELD: Right.

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Because these are people who are actually aggrieved because of their parents being refugees. They're actually citizens. So, then at what point do you do? How do you round them up, I don't know. 
GUTFELD: Uh-hm. 
PERINO: I think that is the problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Well, it's all a matter of where you want to allocate your resources. And if this becomes big enough a problem and it has, then you should do your level best to make sure that you put forth the amount of manpower and hours and commitment to intelligence gathering and working with agencies to be able to stop this so that you are not thrown off by thinking oh, these guys are okay because they bought some kids some ice cream and had a barbecue right before they decided to get there Jihad on. 
GUTFELD: Exactly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: To throw off suspicion if they're being watch. It's just, we have to do a better job because they can't afford not to. That's what's so frustrating when you see a situation like this. Listen, you know, the United States and the U.K., these are wealthy countries.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Uh-hm.
GUILFOYLE: There really should be no excuse for not getting this right. I am not saying it's easy. It's very difficult. But you have to be smarter, more well-funded and more determined in your cause than they are. And right now, they are showing more determination and that's the problem. And that's why the President is frustrated.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Do you think the President, Jesse, is right? I mean, to exercise his rage or focus it on the other leaders like the mayor? I mean --
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yes, that was a tough call. On the one hand, you are thinking this is our biggest ally and he's the mayor of the city from the biggest ally and they just suffered a devastating terror attack again and you're picking a fight with him. On the other hand, he is making a point. Because this guy has been going after him for quite some time, wasting his breath on attacking Donald Trump where he should have been using his breath to talk about the threat he faces in his own city. This guy said that Trump's travel ban was ignorant and the wall was a dumb idea. He said Trump's rhetoric was causing more terrorism.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know what? The terrorism that happened was in your city, it was not in Washington, D.C. It's a soft target over there. They've imported so many of these radicals. There's so much enemy within that they can't keep track of all them. What a President Bush used to say, used to say? They can only be right once.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Right a hundred percent. 
WATTERS: We have to be right a 100 percent of the time and that's a situation. Now they have 400 people from Great Britain that have gone to Syria and Iraq, train and they will come back and they can't even keep tabs on them because these left-wing civil liberty groups have chipped away at their authority to monitor their phone calls and things of that nature. So, when Trump says he wants a travel ban, he knows it's open warfare across the sea. He just wants an extra level of security not because he loves hates Muslims but because he loves America so much. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, I think he was -- I was referring specifically to the travel ban, because he wants to get to the business of what he promised during the campaign which is protecting the country and based on the intelligence that he is getting, this is the means by which he is entitled that is lawful to be able to do it. So, that is a frustrated businessman saying I've got a business plan, I want to implement it, to put aside ideology.

PERINO: However, I will let Juan say something. 
GUTFELD: Yes. Do you think he is using terror to solve the travel ban? I mean --
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: He certainly came forward in his tweet and suggest that given the terror activity in Great Britain, that it explained why he needed a travel ban here. To protect the United States against terrorism. But there are so many flaws in this. I mean, where did we start? I mean, even George Conway, Kellyanne Conway's husband came and said -- if he's trying to hurt his own case, he couldn't have done a better job.

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: If Justice Ginsburg were a federal trial judge and Circuit Court of Appeals judge and had said about the President what she did, she would be compelled by a higher court not to sit on a case in which the President was personally involved. If she sits in the case and her animus towards him as a person, as a human being is manifest in the questioning or in the decision of the case that will damage, the reputation of the court.

GUTFELD: Oh, we would flip out. 
WILLIAMS: We would flip out. All right. Does anyone says, oh, gee whiz, no problem here. Because if they had guns they would have done a better job of stopping this. And everybody said, wait a minute, if guys, if those terrorists had guns, they would have killed more people. The police got them within eight minutes, Greg. 
WATTERS: Wait a second. Wait a second. No. One of the guys with the Billy club was fighting the guy off for a long time.

GUTFELD: Yes.

GUILFOYLE: Can our police officers, law enforcement here keep their guns? 
WILLIAMS: Look, in this country, at this point it wouldn't make sense. But in Britain, the police don't have guns like we have guns and they have a lot of people killed. 
GUTFELD: Certain groups of police officers do. That's how they died. They killed the three guys with guns. 
WILLIAMS: Okay. But I wanted to respond to something Jesse said because Theresa May, who is the prime minister, right? 
GUTFELD: She said enough is enough.

WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: But secondly, the loss that the police operate under so that they can be stronger and the police can take action. 
WATTERS: It's about time, Theresa. 
WILLIAMS: No. I think that people are trying to figure this out in a way that does not antagonize. I think that's the problem with Greg's approach. 
WATTERS: Maybe we should start antagonizing these people. 
WILLIAMS: No. Because you know, Greg says, just go get them. You know what? You have to have a rational approach. It's not like you can say to every Muslim, every country in the world, oh, we don't care about you and expect them to help us.

GUILFOYLE: But nobody is saying that. Nobody is saying that
GUTFELD: Let us get Dana in this. Do you think there's actually going to be difference between a travel ban and extreme vetting? I mean, could you exclude that in extreme vetting?
PERINO: So, actually, the President's team said in January, we need this travel ban for a temporary basis through like July 16th in order for us to get in place our extreme vetting plan. So, when a reporter asked the press secretary today or yesterday, can you give us an update on how that extreme vetting plan is going? They referred to the State Department. The State Department doesn't answer. They refer to the DOD. DOD doesn't answer. So, there is a question as to what have you -- are you using a travel ban as a political tool? 
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: The other thing I would say is, another tool in the President's box there is twitter. And it is very effective for him if he wanted to be. Every reader gets to choose how they're going to respond to something. And he could have tweeted something that could have imagine burying the hatchet with Khan and saying, Mr. Mayor, we are supportive, we'll help you whatever you need. Going after him was antagonistic in a way that we just can't afford for western civilization. The war is against our way of life, not about individual countries or cities based on whoever your political background is. 
GUTFELD: I know. You know what's interesting is that even when he does these kind of rough misses in the middle of the night, the next day when you talk to people who are British or you talked to people, he has got the sentiment down. Maybe you shouldn't do it. But when I talked to him, I talked to a friend of mine who is a Brit and he was like going, he goes, that's how everybody I know feels. They feel let down by the mayor. 
PERINO: And this is one, absolutely he knows, and he says that there is a backlash coming.

GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Okay? And so, that doesn't mean that your political leadership has to fuel it in a way for the partisan feud for something that happened 13 months ago on Twitter. That's ridiculous. 
GUTFELD: I just don't know -- 
GUILFOYLE: He's talking about, you know, the diplomacy and working together cooperatively. Because we have a shared enemy together. 
PERINO: And we want to be able to share the intelligence but we have to work with Theresa May. 
GUTFELD: The issue is that -- the U.K. has a big problem with this and their media. They refused to filter out the pro-Islamists from everybody else. So, if you go out there like the Muslim lead or whatever, whatever brotherhood, it's like you're going after all Muslims. No, pro-Islamist, you have --
WATTERS: Why is there an extreme Muslim group that is allowed to parade around the city?

GUTFELD: Yes. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: A hundred and 30 mosques in religion organizations in Britain have said that they will not perform funeral rites for these terrorists. So, there is a movement to try to get some -- 
WILLIAMS: And part of what Theresa May said, by the way, is that they have to have difficult, uncomfortable conversations with the Muslim community --

GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: -- about the extremists but Greg that's working to prevent that it's not stigmatizing entire group people and it is not proposing a ban. And then saying, it is not a ban. Oh, but it is a ban, when in fact, what you have to remember, is most of the attacks in the United States since 9/11 -- they have been done by people who are U.S. citizens or legal residents. 
GUTFELD: I agree. 
WILLIAMS: It's not anybody coming in. 
WATTERS: This is why -- extra layers.
GUILFOYLE: And by the way, they call it extreme vetting or travel hiatus or travel ban, it's still constitutional. 
GUTFELD: All right. We've got to go. As the President talks up on terrorists, some on the left are trashing him with ugly rhetoric. Latest examples. Next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: In the wake of the London terror attack, President Trump is renewing his call for a travel ban. Which its currently on hold when the Supreme Court decides if they will hear the case. That didn't sit well with CNN host Reza Aslan who responds it on Twitter, quote, "This piece of -- is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency. He's an embarrassment to humankind."
Aslan later deleted the tweet and apologize for his use of profanity. Well, things weren't any better over on MSNBC with one host suggesting President Trump actually wants a terror attack to happen on U.S. soil. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
THOMAS ROBERTS, MSNBC HOST: The president doesn't want us to be politically correct. Right? So let's not be pc about this. Is the President trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this twitter rant? Because only to prove himself right? It seems like the President is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America. Do you feel that way? 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Greg? 
GUTFELD: Oh, I think Mr. Roberts is a victim of projection. It's the Left that often uses tragedy for political means. So, if there's global warming, they go, oh my God, they want global warming to happen to prove that they were right about coal, when there's mass shootings, they immediately go, see, see, guns, guns, guns. We see lots of that. I don't see that much on the right. And about Reza, you know, he apologized as he never swears. He swears all the time. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
GUTFELD: He also explores the fringes of religion on a show and religions that embrace death. Ultra-Orthodox. His doomed day cults, cannibal sex. 
PERINO: What?
GUTFELD: But he avoids focusing on the toxic elements of his own faith. It is the most biased show you could ever watch. And I mean, he's never gone after -- I've looked at his show. I haven't seen anything but he goes after everybody from scientology to other unusual religions but he never touches -- 
PERINO: Islam? 
GUTFELD: Well, he won't go after it critically. 
GUILFOYLE: So, lying Aslan. Okay, Dana --
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Nicely done. 
GUILFOYLE: Thank you.
PERINO: I would say that, I find that Twitter and also cable news in particular -- like everybody gets a choice of what they are going to say. And if you want to be provocative and you want to like delete a tweet and say you're sorry, you can do that. But you can also be adults and one of the things that they complain about with President Trump was his NATO presence, so he was there two weeks ago. He didn't say article five which, okay, I agree, he should have said it. Right?
And apparently his national security team thought that he was going to and he didn't. Fine. But at this point, why don't you say President Trump, we'll stand with you that NATO needs to do more to fight terrorism. Like the message to these people's madness is that they are driving themselves crazy because of President Trump rather than trying to focus on the fact that what they really want -- that the goal is to try to fight terrorism together to help save western civilization from these radical Islamic terrorists. And instead they don't. They are tweeting comedy on Twitter. Like think about what you are saying before you say it. 
GUTFELD: I wouldn't have a job if I did that. 
GUILFOYLE: We like you just fine, Greg. Okay, Jesse.
WATTERS: I just want to quickly pick up on something Greg just said. You know, this guy, Aslan or whoever his name is, he does not like me to respond in a derogatory fashion. A month ago, he called Trump a piece of blank. He called Dinesh D'Souza, he said, go f-yourself. He said of Corey Lewandowski, you are an a-hole. And then he wished Congressman Todd Akin was raped. So, this guy has a long track of -- 
PERINO: Tomorrow he'll have a long press conference with Lisa Bloom. 
GUILFOYLE: Right.
WATTERS: That's exactly right. 
GUILFOYLE: Exactly.
WATTERS: So, I think, you know, the crazier the left is becoming, I think it shows how effective President Trump is being. He has had a beheading situation, you have Chelsea Handler saying crazy stuff. You have this guy, all this goofy stuff over at MSNBC. The left is coming on glued. I think that is the story. And President Trump is doing it to them. 
GUTFELD: What happened to -- 
WATTERS: He's driving a stake right between the heart of the left and he's peeling the fringe left out this way. Because now Franken has to distance himself from people like Kathy Griffin but he's also driving a real wedge between the mainstream media and the American public. Because they are getting so loopy and they're getting so crazy and they're losing all credibility that the public is just tuning them out. 
WILLIAMS: I don't think the public is tuning them out. 
WATTERS: Look at their credibility in the polling.
WILLIAMS: I'm just telling you, the ratings -- and I think this is true across liberal or conservative outlets. The ratings are whips. I don't think they're tuning them out. The thing that strikes me is -- 
WATTERS: Tuning out the credibility.
WILLIAMS: -- you don't like it when Donald Trump, our president, says things that are provocative, insightful, rude, even offensive. Deeply offensive to people and if someone strikes back and you say, oh, why did you say that? Why did you use language comparable to what Trump is using? He's the president. He should be a leader. He should be a moral leader as well as a political leader but he is not. 
GUTFELD: Trump, how many times have I gone after Trump more than anybody's network? 
WILLIAMS: Oh, come on, you know what, I mean, you said the left -- 
PERINO: Only. But you don't remember last year? 
GUILFOYLE: You don't remember last year?
WILLIAMS: Yes. Yes. But you said the left uses this, who on the right uses the flag like a symbol? Huh? Who on the right uses terror attacks to say let's shut downs and let's propose a Muslim ban -- 
WATTERS: Kathy Griffin -- 
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: Wait. Wait. Wait. I don't understand. Why are you not allowed to embrace the U.S. flag? 
WILLIAMS: No, I said to use the U.S. flag like if they're private symbol and it's not a symbol of our -- 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God, it belongs to everybody, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: Well, sure it does. 
GUILFOYLE: So ridiculous!
WILLIAMS: Which is why I say, why all of a sudden does the right -- 
GUILFOYLE: Oh my God!
WILLIAMS: But I think the bigger point to me is, you know what, it seems to me that you have a lot of people in this press who decided they are going to engage with Donald Trump on his turf, on his terms. And I do think that's not good.
GUILFOYLE: So, with these people did here, I assume you denounce it? That it is inappropriate -- 
WILLIAMS: I think it's inappropriate to speak, I don't speak that way in general. But I must say, Donald Trump's behavior and actions, Kimberly, invite this kind of response. 
WATTERS: So, he invited his head to be beheaded. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't know. 
GUTFELD: Juan?
WILLIAMS: I'm talking about -- 
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Juan, can I add that this kind of response has been involved in progressive humor for edgy alternative comedy forever. This is not new. They would demonize Romney, they would demonize Bush, Reagan, Reagan was Hitler for the longest time. He exists the way before Trump. Trust me, I'm old. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. No, no, no, I am older than you, buddy. But I'm just telling you --
(LAUGHTER) 
WILLIAMS: What strikes me is, oh, he has everything to say about this latest terror attack. What about Portland? What about Kansas? 
WATTERS: He mentioned Portland. 
GUTFELD: He did mention Portland. 
WILLIAMS: He mentioned it like a week later when people shamed him. 
GUILFOYLE: He wants to get the job done. You are objecting to his rhetoric but nevertheless he was trying to fulfill his campaign promises. He was elected. He is the President of the United States. His supporters still stand by him. So, I suggest perhaps you do not vote for him for reelection. 
(LAUGHTER)
Directly ahead, more wild claims from Al Gore about climate change. You won't believe this. Details in a battle, up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: President Trump last week outraged environmentalists by withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. And former Vice President Al Gore is so upset that he has taken to citing the bible.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: We still are not changing fast enough because -- it's not just the scientific in community warning us now. It's Mother Nature. Every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelations.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PERINO: Mr. Gore also appeared on "Fox News Sunday" where Chris Wallace challenged him on one of his more controversial claims. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, "FOX NEWS SUNDAY")
CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: After your movie "An Inconvenient Truth" came out in 2006, you made the following comments, unless we took "drastic measures," the world would reach a point of no return within 10 years and you call that a true planetary emergency. We're 11 years later, weren't you wrong? 
GORE: Well, we have seen a decline in emissions for the first -- on a global basis, for the first time they've stabilized and started to decline so some of the responses of the last ten years have helped. But unfortunately and regrettably, a lot of serious damage has been done. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: OK. I thought Chris Wallace was very restrained in that interview, Greg. 
GUTFELD: But who was he interviewing? That wasn't Al Gore. That was like Al Gore Jr. The guy has more worked on than the Hoover Dam. His hair looks like a mini wind farm. By the way, what he just said there was, yes, a lot of stuff in my movie wasn't true but some of it was? That's an old psychic's trick. 
At the end of the year a psychic will give out a thousand predictions knowing that America will only remember one or two that are right. So he was wrong about Mount Kilimanjaro. He said that would be snow free in a decade. He predicted the storms to get worse due to climate change. Even the IPCC called BS on that. He said there would be no arctic by 2013. 
It's there. There's ice. And by the way, the polar bears are doing great. Imagine if these were a different topic, a different topic and it wasn't climate change and it was terror, and he was lying about terror. The media would be all over him and they wouldn't be calling him up. The fact os, you can lie about climate change because the media's assumptions match those lies so they don't call him on it. 
PERINO: Interesting because today NASA -- did you see their tweet today? NASA said that oh, actually maybe it's not as bad as we thought? 
GUTFELD: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) just walked it back.
WATTERS: It's never as bad as they think it is. 
GUILFOYLE: Especially Al.
WATTERS: Especially Al. I actually like the Al's haircut. I actually think he looks good.
GUTFELD: That's a wind farm. 
WATTERS: No, I think I like the haircut. I can appreciate a good haircut.
GUILFOYLE: He's got some volumizing mousse or something.
WATTERS: He looks quite dapper. The guy has made millions being a climate change preacher and he's saying this is where you have to send your money, to the right people. You have to send your money to the right industries. And he's preying on people's guilt and fear and he's doing very well. I'd love a "60 Minutes" expose about how actually green Al Gore lives. I'm not quite sure he lives that green. 
PERINO: He was asked about that. Can we roll that sound bite? 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: President Trump has gone after you directly when talking about this issue of climate change. This is a criticism we hear from conservatives all the time when talking about people like you or Elon Musk or Leonardo DiCaprio, that you yourself have a large carbon footprint. 
GORE: Yes, well, I don't have a private jet. What carbon emissions come from, my trips on Southwest Airline are offset. I live a carbon free lifestyle to the maximum extent. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Listen, I will ask you your own question --
GUILFOYLE: I mean, come on. He is saying he doesn't own his own private jet. 
PERINO: But he borrows them to fly to his -- 
GUILFOYLE: Let's be honest, you know, he flies private. Has he been on commercial? 
GUTFELD: Have you seen the size of his house? He has two houses, right. They're huge.
GUILFOYLE: He's not hurting, OK? To the extent possible, he lives a carbon free life, OK, whatever. The problem I have with him, I don't care. He can fly private and do whatever he wants, but I'm sorry, your predictions were way off. 
GUTFELD: And he's telling you how to live. 
GUILFOYLE: Way off and I'm still wondering if he really did create the internet. 
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: Juan, did Al Gore bear any sort of responsibility for alarmism that makes actually people question the science or question the outcome -- 
GUTFELD: Good question.
WILLIAMS: Oh no. That is too -- talk about inconvenient truth here. Al Gore I think you could say legitimately, Dana, has engaged in hyperbole. That he says that we all might die. He's trying to like, you know, make you think that the sky is falling at times. I would say yes, that's right. Now, we don't say that about somebody else who tweets every morning, do we? We don't say, oh no, way terrible hyperbole, excessive, offensive at times. But I will say this -- 
WATTERS: That people are dying from terrorism. No one is dying from climate change. 
WILLIAMS: Oh no, I think that in fact, we see coastal waters rising. In fact, the Pentagon is saying it maybe that this causes war and instability in our nations -- in the world.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Why isn't there weren't so in California with the drought? They say the drought caused in Syria. There has been a drought in California forever. Where are the ices cults in California? 
WILLIAMS: So the fact that we are having droughts, the fact that we have terrible rainstorms, the fact that we've had -- I think it's five or six years in a row of the highest temperatures ever, this doesn't -- 
GUTFELD: Margin of error, Juan. You know the facts. 
WILLIAMS: Margin of error is --
GUTFELD: Our audience has a memory from the last show. 
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: You need some facts, that's what you need. 
GUTFELD: You need some drugs.
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: I think we can do an entire show on climate change and we'll watch Juan's temperature rise. When we return, even some prominent voices on the left are saying the Democrats are going way too far with all the Russia- Trump talk. That report, when we come right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: There are a few subjects Democrats love to discuss more than possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. One prominent liberal editor now thinks the left has gone too far. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE NATION: I think Democrats are making a mistake going in Russia, Russia, Russia, all the time. I think Democrats have to have a bold, inclusive populist agenda. Get it out into the country, fight on health care, fight on jobs, fight on a different engagement with the world.
Don't let this overtake it. And I think that that is about a party that needs to be one of proposition, not simply opposition resistance is not enough. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: She might be on to something because the head Democrat on the Senate Intel Community says he's yet to see any damning evidence. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MARK WARNER, D-VA.: We have no smoking gun at this point but there is a lot of smoke. And what I hope our committee is able to do and we've -- very proud of the fact that it's maintained its bipartisan approaches. We're going to just follow the facts.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Juan, can the Democrats run a midterm election strategy on a Russia conspiracy theory? 
WILLIAMS: No, I think it'd be a loser. I mean they could do it but it'd be a loser, right. Now, what is interesting is a lot of talk that in fact what they want to do is something you suggested earlier, Jesse, run against the media. But the problem for the Republicans, they can run against the media, they trash the Democratic candidates as too liberal or whatever, but then the Democrats open the door. 
Democrats are saying you've got the White House, you've got the House of Representatives and the Senate and what happened to tax reform? What happened to repeal and replace? What happened to infrastructure? It's supposed to be a big deal this week. I don't see it coming now. Again, this is the problem. I think that's the smart way for Democrats to run against the party of Trump. 
WATTERS: That's right. Kimberly, if I hear Russia one more time, I mean, I can't believe it. Isn't the country sick of hearing about it? I see people in the street, they're fed up with it. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, it doesn't seem to be playing well for a large part of obviously the electorate and people that support, you know, President Trump. There is the obstructionists and people who want to try to find anything to slow him down from being able to implement his policies and his agenda, that he was voted into office to achieve. So, for me, so far, where's the evidence of any of this? 
There's a lot of big headlines and buzzwords thrown around about collusion, you know, where is this? There's no evidence to suggest that there was anything improper or illegal done between the Trump campaign and anybody -- foreign agents -- in Russia. So, the problem for them is, when this is in fact put to bed and to rest, hopefully soon, then what are they going to say? 
WATTERS: What will the Democrat say, Dana, if some of these investigations come back and --
PERINO: Well, just like -- let's say the investigations don't come back empty-handed -- what will a lot of people on the right say? They'll say its baloney. The people on the left, even if it comes back and they say that there is nothing, the left will say, oh, there was something and it was hidden. There will be conspiracies on either side. 
WATTERS: OK.
PERINO: But I do agree with Katrina Vanden Huevel that the Democrats -- 
WATTERS: Have you ever said that before? 
PERINO: No, I've never said that before. 
GUILFOYLE: That's an excellent --
PERINO: She is right. And that they are seeding (ph) a lot of policy ground. I talked to someone on the Senate today who said that they can expect to the six weeks a health care vote in the Senate. That they are going to advance tax reform. That they are going to try to move on infrastructure and they'll also be probably Iran sanctions and you know that the debt ceiling vote is coming up. 
All of those are very serious policy grounds and if we're only talking about Russia and you're not making your point as to what you are for in those arenas, you're actually seeing all of that grounds to Republicans and they will pass something and then you'll be left holding the Russian bag.
WATTERS: Greg.
GUTFELD: I said this before but I think it's such a good point that I'm going to say it again -- 30-40 years ago, the left had no interest in the USSR. They felt the Cold War was a joke. They were hyper focused on American evil. Now it's 2017 and they are finally caught up. They're focusing on Russia while the world and the new threat is not Russia, its Islamism. It's Islamism. So maybe in 2057, they will finally catch up and go, wow, what about this radical Islam thing I'm hearing about? And we will all be wearing burqas. 
WATTERS: You think Islam will be defeated that?
WILLIAMS: Do you think Islam is as big a threat as Russia? 
GUTFELD: Oh, about 10 times as big.
PERINO: Yes. 
WILLIAMS: Oh my gosh.
GUTFELD: It's an ideology that wants to destroy us. Russia does not want to destroy us. The ideology -- the apocalyptic ideology wants us all dead because the way they interpret their religion is that heaven requires them killing all of us.
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: I think Russia wants to absolutely push us off the world stage and make themselves the dominant --
GUTFELD: Juan, that's be competitive but they're not a party --
WILLIAMS: Like I said --
WATTERS: Who said this, "the '80s called, they want their foreign policy." It's almost impossible to get in trouble for anything on HBO unless your name is Bill Maher. We'll tell you why the comedian is in hot water, up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Comedian Bill Maher has made a career out of pushing the boundaries. On Friday, he went, well, I think too far while interviewing Nebraska senator Ben Sasse.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER"/HBC) 
SEN. BEN SASSE, R-NEB.: We would love to have you work in the field with us. 
(LAUGHTER)
BILL MAHER, HOST: Work in the fields?
SASSE: That's part --
MAHER: Senator, I'm a house (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER)
MAHER: It's a joke. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: In a statement, HBO called the comment "completely inexcusable and tasteless." And Maher apologized for using the racial slur. What do you think Greg.
GUTFELD: Well, I'm sure he's sorry, but the dirtiest secret of white liberals is that they assume they're exempt from these kinds of controversies because they've already embraced the liberal platitude. They have a get out of bigot jail card. Shelby Steele's book, he talks about how a white friend who made a racist joke in front of him because he assumed that Shelby was a black prop. 
Here is my black friend, therefore I can use the N-word or say something. And I think Bill Maher has, you know, talked enough on equality and about being a progressive that he feels he has carte blanche. That he can make these jokes. But the fact is, the joke is real -- the what such things as house, you know. He was making a joke about some kind of suffering. 
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, the thing I don't get, K.G., is you know, we hear all these complaints about Bill Maher. Why not about these black rappers who use these words to excess and it seems to me are equally degrading. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, you're saying there's a double standard -- 
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't like it.
GUILFOYLE: No, no, but if the word is an appropriate use and it is, it should not be used by anybody. I agree. And I think what Bill Maher did is absolutely reprehensible. I'm shocked even to somebody like himself would do and say something like that. I don't know. If he thinks that he's above it and isn't going to be, you know, held accountable, that's really sad. 
WILLIAMS: I agree. Jesse, what do you make of the fact that this comes on the heels of Kathy Griffin and it just seems like the provocateurs are running wild. 
WATTERS: I don't think it's the provocateurs. I think the left and the media, they are ones who have become the deplorable they warned everybody else against. And when it comes to offensive speech, it seems like liberals don't really care what is said, it only matters who says it because if a conservative talks or says anything close to this, they would be off the air in a second. 
He's not really paying a price for this. I guess if you are Bill Maher, you are allowed to say that word on HBO and not get in trouble for it. That's just plain shocking --
GUILFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE).
WATTERS: Yes, and I also haven't seen a lot of other people stand up and really condemn him that strongly. They did with Kathy Griffin, you know, I respect that. I didn't hear anything about Bill Maher. 
WILLIAMS: In fact, Dana, Al Franken, the senator from Minnesota says he's not going to appear -- he was supposed to appear this coming Friday on the Bill Maher's show. 
PERINO: Yes, just imagine if you're Al Franken and basically you're carrying a liberal torch and you have a book out that's gotten all these great reviews and within five days, you have to cancel your event with Kathy Griffin and your appearance on the Maher show, which is hurting your book tour. I mean, basically it's like liberal cannibalism. 
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Oh my god.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: That must taste really bad. 
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Hey, hey, "One More Thing" up next.
GUTFELD: Very good. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Time for "One More Thing." Let's do this. "Greg's Guy News." We need some guy news. This is the true measure of a man. Take a look at this photo. This was taken on Friday. This is Theunis Wessels, if you can see him, he's mowing his lawn as a tornado approaches. This is a small town in Canada in Alberta. His wife was watching him and thought he's interesting. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Don't you notice there is a tornado? And he said, yes, I'm aware of it. I've watched a lot of TV about them and I am monitoring it. This is how you measure your manliness. I go inside. 
PERINO: Or your marriage. 
(LAUGHTER) 
GUTFELD: I go inside when I see a bee. There's a bee, I'm inside. 
GUILFOYLE: Which is why I was thinking maybe that should have been like, Jesse's? 
GUTFELD: That's called irony, Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, I know.
GUTFELD: There you got.
GUILFOYLE: This is so clever and manly. 
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, as you guys know, my kids think I am the least hip person in America. 
WATTERS: So do I.
WILLIAMS: So this weekend -- thank you Jesse -- so this weekend, I was introduced to this song and I want Greg to tell me about it. Go ahead, play the music.
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
WILLIAMS: It's "Despacito" Gregory.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: That's the number one song in the USA and it had been that for four weeks now. First Spanish song to hit number one in the U.S. since the "Macarena" in '96 and the only one -- 
GUTFELD: It's no "Macarena." 
WILLIAMS: Well, and the only one before that was "La Bamba" if you remember "La Bamba."
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: When the "Macarena" comes on at a wedding, things go crazy, clothes comes off.
WILLIAMS: Well, that's the thing because this song by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber -- Beiber sings both English and Spanish. But guess what? I think something is changing when you have this at number one. I mean --
GUTFELD: What about Louie (ph), what's his name, Bega? Remember Mambo whatever? That was a hell of a song. I don't care. Oh wait, Dana. 
PERINO: OK, my turn. I listened to some music last night to the Dierks Bentley concert in Jersey. 
GUTFELD: And what a surprise.
PERINO: It was a great way to start the summer, but I had a chance to hang out with them just a little bit. It's a great show if you have a chance, it's like full of heart, patriotism, lots of fun. And he was the surprise national anthem singer tonight at the Predators game, the NHL game. That's hockey for those of you who don't know who the Predators are, showing up even though he's been under the weather with a little bit of a cold. 
GUTFELD: Is he freaked out by you? 
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: No, I'm like kind of embarrassed. I have a little bit of -- 
GUILFOYLE: You guys are best friends --
WATTERS: Oh boy.
PERINO: -- grateful dead of Dierks Bentley.
GUILFOYLE: I think you guys are best friends now or something like that. Kind of cute. It bloomed. All right, so, it was a concert that brought so much hope and healing to a country that has been torn apart by terror. Ariana Grande returning to the U.K. to headline "One Love Manchester." I'm sure many of you saw different clips of it. Take a listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ARIANA GRANDE, SINGER: I love you guys so much. I think the kind of love and unity that you are displaying is the medicine to the world we need -- really need right now. I want to thank you for being just that. And I want to thank you for coming tonight. I love you so much. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: A powerful role model to young women, Ariana Grande, to do that and go forth. So this event raised more than $13 (ph) million for victims of the attack. They were there two weeks ago -- 22, remember, killed and dozens hurt and Greg has been like a little (INAUDIBLE). 
GUTFELD: They've raised a lot of money. They've raised like what, $14, $15 million? 
GUILFOYLE: -- Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber.
WATTERS: That would make you a "Belieber." 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: No?
GUTFELD: No it won't, but I admire the fact that they raised money for this. It's very good.
GUILFOYLE: All of it to Manchester and the London terror attack victims.
WATTERS: OK, while Greg Gutfeld was doing his monologue, I was playing golf today. So, I hit the links to raise some money for the Planting Fields Foundation at the golf classic at Mill River Club. That was my caddy, Al De Blasio on the right. I never lost a ball and he gave me some great reads and then that's Steve (INAUDIBLE) over there on the left. Another great patriot there. We had a lot fun today. 
PERINO: And also what was the big news today for you at golf? 
WATTERS: I did not cheat. Still didn't break 90. 
WILLIAMS: Well, you know, Trump was golfing on a weekend while terrible things -- I'm glad you went golfing. 
GUTFELD: Right.
GUILFOYLE: Juan.
GUTFELD: Set your DVR and never miss an episode of "The Five." "Hannity" is next. Watch it!
