Quote -- "My health care for me and my family stopped Friday at midnight," He told Esquire -- quote -- "I asked if there was some transition for my Tricare to Blue Cross Blue Shield. They said no. You're out of the service. Your coverage is over. Thanks for your 16 years. Go 'blank' yourself."

Changing Fortune
And finally, the world's largest fortune cookie company is toning down its messages after complaints that they were too racy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The New York Post reports Brooklyn-based Wonton Food received complaints from parents who said their children were bothered by messages like -- quote -- "One who admires you greatly is hidden before your eyes;" "romance and travel go together;" and "the evening promises romantic interest."
The fortune writers say the cookies are supposed to be fun for everyone, so they've gotten rid of these suggestive fortunes.
This isn't the first time though sensitive fortune readers have persuaded them to tweak a message a bit. They got rid of -- quote -- "you will inherit a great fortune soon" over complaints it implied relatives were about to die.  </pre>
