Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. A new law -- we need it -- but the very fact we need it is pathetic. And it shows a very sorry state of affairs in our government. I'm talking about the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act.
This act, if passed, bans government employees -- the ones whose salaries you pay -- from watching pornography on government computers. So why do we need a law like this? Because things in Washington are really messed up. A high-level employee at the Environmental Protection Agency was caught watching as much as six hours a day of porn on his government computer, and he's been doing it for years. Why wasn't he fired? Well, civil service rules make it really hard to just fire someone for not doing his job. Pretty crazy, isn't it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And after more investigation, it was discovered it's not just this guy at the EPA. It turns out this is happening in many government agencies; it's almost an epidemic. Yes, the fact we need this law is pathetic. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But alas, we need to do something. And if some government employees are not innately decent when they're on the clock and on your dime, I guess we have to try to legislate decency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, Washington is so messed up. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
