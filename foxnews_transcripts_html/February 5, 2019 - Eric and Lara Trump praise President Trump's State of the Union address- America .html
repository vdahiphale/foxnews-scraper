President Trump's son and daughter-in-law say Trump's critics are 'petrified' that their 'influence bubble is gone.'

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: This is a Fox News alert. Welcome to “Hannity” from Washington, D.C.
Tonight, we have on the show Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Eric, Lara Trump, so many others.

Well, tonight, we heard from the president of the United States what was one of the most single most inspiring challenges to the country and a list of successes, frankly, unprecedented over a two-year period under his leadership. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Now, the never-Trumpers were wrong, the mainstream media was and is wrong. Democrats were wrong. And two years into the Trump presidency, the state of our great country, our union, is incredibly strong getting better every day. The president has governed, as I told you, he would as a conservative. He has kept his promises. He listed them tonight. He's upheld the principles that have made this the greatest, freest, most prosperous country on earth as those of us that knew him said he would.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For Trump, it's not about a Republican or Democrat, it is about we, the people, the United States of America. Take a look.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.

TRUMP: In just over two years, since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been seen before. There's been nothing like it. We have created 5.3 million new jobs, and importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something which almost everyone said was impossible to do. Nearly five million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.

TRUMP: African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. More people are working now than at any time in history of our country. 157 million people at work.

HANNITY: 5.3 million new jobs, 600,000 new jobs in the manufacturing sector alone. Jobs we were told were never coming back, the economy is breaking records, and hitting on all cylinders. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Despite a constant stream of what is pure hatred from the hate Trump media, their allies in the Democratic Party. Look at this new poll for Rasmussen showing the president's approval rating at a strong 48% percent. It is no accident, halfway through his first term, President Trump's pro-growth, conservative, pro-energy, low regulation policies are kicking this country into high gear and writing America's ship after what were eight long disastrous economic years under Obama. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we saw the lowest labor participation rate in those right years since the 1970s. Ninety-five million Americans out of the workforce. The worst recovery since the '40s and stagnant GDP growth. The only president never to hit three percent. That was Obama.
Instead of imposing strict government controls, new government programs like his predecessor, President Trump, in less than two years now, has given power back to you, the American people, and he's opened up freedom and liberty and unleashed American greatness once again. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And two short years, the president has signed a record, historic low tax cut. He's ended hundreds of burdensome government regulations, opened up oil and natural gas expansion, approved new pipelines. We are now energy independent, and the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas is also negotiated new trade deals that benefit America with Mexico, Canada. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And for the first time in many years, manufacturing jobs are back with a vengeance. And let's not forget the president nominated and he confirmed two highly qualified originalists, conservative Supreme Court justices who will uphold our constitutional values for decades to come.
Dozens of other originalist federal judges have also been confirmed. The president signed sweeping new criminal justice legislation into law. Little Rocket Man is no longer firing rockets over the Sea of Japan. Our hostages are home. The remains of our soldiers from the '50s are now back.
A new summit is now scheduled for February 27th in Vietnam. China's economy is now feeling the heat with new trade restrictions. Russia is being held in check with a series of sanctions. The U.S. embassy in Israel has been relocated to Jerusalem, something so many other presidents promised and never delivered on. And ISIS, on the run. Needless to say, it has been a very busy and productive two years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, despite this tremendous success, Democrats in attendance at tonight's State of the Union, they seemed pretty miserable. Grimacing, scowling, sitting on their hands, refusing to stand up, applaud the historically strong state of our union. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember, after eight years of Obama's economy, oh, we had 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty. And now, we have five million fewer people on food stamps. And many millions out of poverty. And refusing to give President Trump credit for anything.
Meanwhile, what are the Democrats offering you, we the people? Higher taxes, judicial obstruction, open borders, eliminating ICE, they want to keep the disaster of ObamaCare, endless investigation into the president, an insane quest for impeachment. It is literally part of the party of hate. Hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour, of everyday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And to them, well, we saw this with immigration, we saw the things that they stood for just a few short years ago, hating Trump is more important than helping the American people and doing their job. To them, that's more important than, what, protecting our citizens with border security, that we so desperately need. Watch this.

TRUMP: This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all America.

Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. Wealthy politicians and owners push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate. It is actually very cruel.

HANNITY: Now, think about this. How many in the hate Trump media or the Democratic Party said this is a manufactured crisis? All right. The last two years, ICE officers, they made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted. Nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 4,000 murders, homicides.

That's why -- well, not so long ago, former President Obama, he sounded an awful lot like President Trump, as did Schumer, as did many of the Democrats. Now, they oppose that which they supported just a couple of years ago? You may remember this.

So this is not going to be a free ride. It's not going to be some instant amnesty. What's going to happen is, you are going to pay a significant fine, you are going to learn English, you are going to go to -- you are going to the back of the line so that you don't get ahead of somebody who was in Mexico City applying legally.

HANNITY: So President Trump -- oh, President Obama. They sound alike. So what's changed for the Democrats? President Trump is in office. Oh, now they just oppose him with every fiber of their being? I thought they cared about Dreamers and DACA and furloughed employees. Hating Trump comes before protecting the security and safety of the American people. It comes before spurring economic growth, finding solutions for the Dreamers they talk so much about. It was offered to them. The results are sad. President Trump put it perfectly when he tweeted, quote, "Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime."

But tonight, the president is vowing to fight back to protect the lives of those who are the most vulnerable. A powerful moment. Let's take a look.

TRUMP: Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies, who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.

And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.

TRUMP: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.
Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

HANNITY: Democrats, what were they offering? Oh, they want a wealth tax and then they want more death taxes and maybe a 70 percent income tax, maybe a ninety percent one. Oh, that will bring us right back to what Obama gave us, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty, the accumulation of more debt than every other president before him combined.
For them, it appears just about political quests for power, revenge, government control of energy and health care and every aspect of your life, so they stay in power.

But for President Trump, this is much more than politics. It's about preserving fundamental, core principles, and keeping the promises he made to protect this country, an oath that he gave, bettering the lives of all Americans, getting government off our backs, unleashing American greatness for decades and centuries to come using the principles of freedom and liberty and capitalism.
All right. Joining us now for reaction, Texas senator, Ted Cruz. Senator, great to see you. Thank you for being with us.

CRUZ: Well, I thought it was a very strong speech. The president started off with just laying out the incredible success as we've seen in the past two years, the economic successes, the lowest unemployment and half a century. The lowest African-American, Hispanic unemployment ever recorded. The lowest Asian-American unemployment ever recorded. The lowest unemployment for people with disability.
I mean, it's a staggering record of results. He laid out the record on national security, rebuilding our military, defeating our enemies, defeating ISIS. And that is a testament to policies that work.

        }
      
But I think tonight, we also saw just how extreme, just how out of touch the modern Democratic Party has become. You know, at lunch today with the other Republican senators, I suggested to the newly elected Republicans, I said, look, my favorite game to play during this State of the Union.
So number one, it's going to be good calisthenics, you're going to stand up and down and up and down and up and down, you get your aerobics for the day.
But I said, number two, just spend your time watching the Democrats. Watching their faces. The agony as they're trying to decide whether to clap, whether to stand.
I mean, right up to the opening minute when the president is introduced, half the Democrats stayed sitting on their rear-ends and wouldn't clap. You know what? Every time I was there for Barack Obama, I stood up and applauded, not because I agreed with his policies, but because I respect the office of the presidency.

You saw just about every Democrat stay sitting, refuse to clap for the lowest African-American unemployment in history.

HANNITY: I cannot believe it. I'm glad the president brought up the issue of -- this isn't even about abortion. Think of what the governor of Virginia said.
CRUZ: Yes.
HANNITY: Well, we'll deliver the baby and we'll make sure the baby is comfortable, then the mother will decide whether or not the baby needs help or resuscitated, and then we'll have a discussion. Six states -- this has now become the Democratic cost. You were in the Senate earlier today.

CRUZ: It is repulsive where the Democrats have gone. Northam was talking not even about late-term abortion, he was talking about aborting an infant after it's born. That is staggering. You know, it was sad, when the President talked about ending late-term abortion, it wasn't that long ago that, Bill Clinton stood up and said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Now, he didn't mean it but that's what he said.
Tonight, virtually every Democrat in the Chamber stood stone-faced in support of late-term abortion. That is how radical and extreme they've been. So there's one or two Democrats in the entire Congress who decided late-term abortion was too much for them. Same thing on the border, we're on open borders virtually every Democrat supports open borders and anyone watching this can tell that.
HANNITY: I look at the Democratic Party now, this radical, extreme, and a real socialist party. I've never -- we've never witnessed a party go this far left.
CRUZ: I think my favorite moment in the speech was when the President said, we will never become a socialist country. And the look of terror. OK. Somebody needs to --

(CROSSTALK)
CRUZ: -- to a horror film, to the theme from Halloween because you see the Democrats terrified and about half of them stood and half didn't. That photograph needs to be remembered for a long time. Every Democrat who sat has just told their constituents they want America to be a socialist country. Many of the other Democrats who stood, they wanted also but they're at least going to pretend for a little while longer.
But they sorted the wheat from the chaff, as they say, and they did in front of the whole country.
HANNITY: The President made a challenge about protecting our borders, 90 percent of our heroin, fentanyl, cartels, gang members, homicides, sexual assaults, and violent assaults. That is not a manufactured crisis. You know because you were on a border state. I've been to the new Rio Grande a number of times. My question is, these are things that they supported just a couple of years ago. Have they made a decision as a party to put their feelings towards the President, hatred to the President ahead of what they themselves advocated for? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CRUZ: Yes. Back in 2013, Chuck Schumer and every single Democrat in the Senate voted in favor of 350 miles of border wall. Just a couple of weeks ago, Chuck Schumer and every Democrat in the Senate shut down the Federal government to stop 234 miles of border wall. Now Sean, explained to me how you vote for 350 miles and you force a government shutdown over 234 miles and their position has been not even one inch of border wall.
HANNITY: I am worried that some of your fellow Republicans and your body in the United States Senate are not going to support if the President brings in the -- this is -- this is a national security issue. And it is, with those numbers and those statistics, a national emergency. Are there really Republicans that have back away from this? Because you stood up alone on the issue of repealing and replacing.
And I watched you that night and I was proud of you that tonight and I'm thinking, if they do this, they lose me. I will -- I will never support them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CRUZ: One of two things is going to happen. Either the Democrats are going to blink and compromise and by the way, Trump has been clear that he would take less than 234 miles, he's not insisting on an absolute $5.7 billion number but he need a real investment to secure the border and keep this country safe. Either the Democrats break and compromise, which I don't think they're going to.
It's possible but I don't think they're going to. If they don't, I think it is all but inevitable that the President acts unilaterally because I think the Democrats are forcing him to do.
HANNITY: And if Republicans don't support him, you could just -- they're useless.
(CROSSTALK)
CRUZ: I think it is important though that if the President does that, there are a number of different statutory bases he can use but it needs to be grounded in law. Their past they can take to do that and it's important that every president, Republican or Democrat be bound by the constitution and law. And every faith of this administration will do that --
HANNITY: I agree with you.
CRUZ: But how they do it will matter because we don't want to set a president for a slippery slope for a Democrat to abuse his or her power.

CRUZ: We've got to secure the border unequivocally.
HANNITY: Senator, thank you. Good to see you.
CRUZ: Thank you, my friend.
HANNITY: All right. Senator Cruz, border state, he knows. All right. Earlier tonight, during the State of the Union Address, the President announced a second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. It will be in Vietnam. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean peninsula. Our hostages have come home. Nuclear testing has stopped. And there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now in my opinion be in the major war with North Korea.

Much work remains to be done but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.

HANNITY: Joining us now with more, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I was at the first summit in Singapore. 15 months, no rockets fired, the remains of Americans from the 50s are returned, hostages have been returned, that President has given nothing and we are talking about the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. Sounds pretty promising to me and hopeful.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: To those people that are criticizing the President, how well did you do with Rocket Man? So, yes, I'm very hopeful that when meeting -- this new meeting will lead to a breakthrough.
HANNITY: All right. Over all --

GRAHAM: I'll tell you what, I think he's scared. He's scared.
HANNITY: Go on.
GRAHAM: Well -- OK. If you want to get this guy's attention, he is not like Iran, Iran is on a religious mission. You know, if they ever get nukes, they'll use them. This guy is trying to have an insurance policy to keep the mafia state going. But if Trump gives them an alternative between life without nuclear weapons that is safe and secure, he'll take it. If the other alternative is to lose your life.
HANNITY: The thing that stood out the most, more than anything that I'm so happy about the Taliban at the table. It's a great point.

GRAHAM: I've been going --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You ask your own question. Go ahead.
GRAHAM: I like interviewing me. I've been there 52 times. Why are they talking with us now? Because when the first day he got in office, he told the military to kick their ass. We've been killing these guys by the thousands, we've been breaking their back in Pakistan. For the very first time in a decade is beginning to help us on their side of the border because Trump has really unleashed the military.
They're at the table now because of the change in the rules of engagement after Obama left, Trump came in and they're at the table. And we may be able to win this -- in this war if Pakistan will help us. And I predict that the Prime Minister of Pakistan and President Trump will get along very well.

HANNITY: You asked another great question.
GRAHAM: Because he unleashed the military.
HANNITY: Yes, he did.

He's gotten out of a bad deal and I think he would replace it with a better deal, we're more respected, we're safer today than we were two years ago and it's because of this president.
HANNITY: Let me go to the economy. So impressive. In 2016, for me, the election was about the forgotten men and women. I actually bought the original painting of this guy, Jon McNaughton, the forgotten men and women of this country. The 13 million Americans on -- extra American on food stamps, eight million more on poverty, worse recovery since the 40s, lowest homeownership rate 51 years, the debt, more debt the 43 presidents combined.
Lowest labor participation rate. 5.3 million new jobs since he's elected.
GRAHAM: So how did all that happened, Sean?
HANNITY: Well, I can tell you, because conservative economic policies, free-market capitalism, limited bureaucracy, less government intervention, incentivizing businesses to invest factories, manufacturing centers. It's worked for Reagan, it worked for Kennedy, and it's working for Trump.
GRAHAM: He take every -- he took everything Obama did to suppress economic growth and replace it with progressed policies. He took all the funding with one hand tied behind your back approach to the wrong terror and unleash the military. Everything Obama did, this guy is doing opposite and it's working.

GRAHAM: How many times have you heard a presidents' day at the State of the Union what the Virginia governor said was un-American?
HANNITY: Wow.
GRAHAM: So -- OK. Kavanaugh walks down, you get more money in your pocket, your country is stronger than ever, we're going to win. And when you say we're not a socialist country, they couldn't stand up.
HANNITY: Only Chuck and Nancy did because they didn't know what to do.
GRAHAM: The road to the nomination for the Democratic Party runs through Venezuela.
HANNITY: All right. You had to prepare that and think about that all day. I want to go to immigration and I was asking Senator Cruz, your colleague a moments ago, look, it looks like the President is going to have to go alone. Here is my fear and you addressed it this week.
GRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: There might be a number of your colleagues -- I cannot support them. There's too many drugs, too much death, too many assaults, too many angel moms and dads that I met my life. Will these Republicans step up and support securing our border for the safety security? It's life and death for the American people.
GRAHAM: Here's a question I will ask any Republican Senator or member of the House. Do you disagree what the President said about the state of the border? Do you disagree with the drug analysis? Do you disagree with the human trafficking problem? Do you disagree with the threats coming through the border? If you agree with him, then have the courage to do something.
HANNITY: Will your Republican colleagues do what is right?
GRAHAM: They will if people like you remind them.
HANNITY: Oh, I'm reminding them. I'm going to put pictures up.
GRAHAM: I think that will help. So I love all my colleagues but this president, if he gets a dollar for the wall from Nancy, he's got to do it himself. Now after this speech, do you have any doubt that he will do it if he has to alone?
HANNITY: I've known him for 20 some odd years. I know.
GRAHAM: So to my Republican friends, get on the train.
HANNITY: I said 99.999 percent that he --
GRAHAM: After tonight it's 102.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Yes.
GRAHAM: So if you're the president, how do you not secure the border after that speech?
HANNITY: He's tenacious, he's unrelenting and I know you've been become a good friend of his. Senator, good to be -- thank you for stopping by.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: We appreciate it. Thank you.
GRAHAM: That's right. Thank god.
HANNITY: You know who was successful? I'm happy. Our fellow Americans. Better jobs, more pay, greater security.
(CROSSTALK)
GRAHAM: And these stories that were told remind me how great a place we have in America. That was the most powerful thing, it's just the people themselves.
HANNITY: Yes.
GRAHAM: And Alice Marie Johnson --
HANNITY: Oh, I love them. It was amazing. Special moment. Senator, thank you. All right. Now, during the State of the Union earlier tonight, President Trump declared a State of our Union is strong. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
D. TRUMP: Members of Congress, the State of our Union is strong. That sounds so good. Our country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone. Almost double the number expected.

ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: I agree.
HANNITY: Senior advisor for Trump 2020, Lara Trump is with us. Good to see you. You know, you keep showing me pictures of your son and the picture of him sitting in the President's chair in the Oval Office. It's pretty -- that picture going out, that's amazing picture.
E. TRUMP: Yes, I know we're --
LARA TRUMP, ERIC TRUMP'S WIFE: We need to do a new one. He so much bigger now. That was so long ago.
HANNITY: He's a big kid, I know.
L. TRUMP: Yes.
HANNITY: I watched your dad since the day he came down the escalator. And with the level of success that he was rattling off, energy, jobs, bureaucracy, foreign policy, I'm thinking, wow. How did Democrats oppose this? Especially after what we had in the last eight previous years? An unprecedented level of success and I think it made it -- made it the best speech I saw him give.
E. TRUMP: I was so proud of him. Sitting there tonight, you know, everything that we fought through as a family, everything we've gone through as a family, it was his best speech he has ever given tonight. The storytelling was incredible, the accomplishments were incredible. I mean, hey, there were even times when the Democrats stood up and were applauding when he's talking about, you know, lowest female unemployment rates in history.
More women in Congress than ever before and they're up there.
HANNITY: African-American, Asian-American, women in the workplace, youth unemployment gets back to work.
E. TRUMP: Beautiful and it was positive and it was uplifting. And I was talking about how America has always been the greatest country in the world but we can even be better. We can even be better if we just have some common sense in our government, people come together, and we started working for the American people as opposed to political parties. And Sean, he knocked it out of the park. I mean, and literally, there were moments - -
HANNITY: You know, why I think it was more powerful? Because he said it during the campaign, and it worked.
E. TRUMP: He's done it.
HANNITY: He's done it.
E. TRUMP: And you know what, there are also special moments: you saw little Grace, St. Jude's Children's Hospital, you know how close that cause is to my heart.
HANNITY: Wait, wait, you raise $20 million for that cause.
E. TRUMP: To have her in front of me tonight, it literally brought tears to my eyes. And by the way, so many of the other people.
HANNITY: Alice Marie Johnson.
E. TRUMP: Incredible, right?
HANNITY: I interviewed her. I loved her.
E. TRUMP: The SWAT officer who was shot seven times; he was literally right behind me, having trouble standing up. It was so prideful, and he saved --
HANNITY: Oh, wait a minute, criminal justice reform?
E. TRUMP: I mean, right. So many things. It was the best speech my father has ever and given tonight.
HANNITY: OK. So, you're working on the 2020 campaign. We're watching a new slate of candidates trying to out-socialist each other. You know, 70 percent tax rate -- oh, eliminate Kamala Harris, eliminate 177 million Americans health care choice and Medicare For All. $32 trillion, we can't afford it, obviously. And I'm watching this party implode before our eyes, and I'm like, this is a gift.
TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you the thing that I liked, not only from a campaign perspective, but as an American. I have always said, Donald Trump -- and he has said it himself, is the president for all people in this country. When he was running in 2015 and 2016, he said I want to be the president for everyone, and that is what you saw tonight in his speech. There were so many moments, a moment where the entire group of people in that room stood up and in unison chanted "USA, USA." I don't think that has ever happened.
HANNITY: I watched a lot of the speeches. But I think when you can back it up with the track record, it adds this level of power. That is what I think made the speech for success. But he challenged in the beginning of the speech, it's not Republican, it's not Democrat; they are hoping we will govern not as two parties, but as one nation. And then he went on to say, you know, together we represent the most extraordinary nation and all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? Look at the opportunities before us, and I'm asking you the members of congress, our most brilliant achievements are still ahead. I'm asking you to choose greatness.
E. TRUMP: And that's why the people in the audience were so powerful. When he's talking about swarming the beaches of Normandy, when he's talking about planting the American flag on, you know, the surface of the moon, right? When he's talking about the medical achievements of St. Jude, and so many other things, right, and then you look at some of these other fights, the trivial little nonsense fights that we see each and every day, and it really emphasizes how much better we can be if we can get rid of that nonsense. I mean, how much better we can be if we can put that off to the side.
HANNITY: Well, Eric, let me ask you. We saw that the president, just a few short years ago, he offered everything: DREAMers, DACA, ending -- helping furloughed employees, they wouldn't even talk.
E. TRUMP: I said it all the time, they're scared. They're scared. The guy is winning. You heard it tonight. By the way --
HANNITY: I'm not sick of it yet.
L. TRUMP: You're not tired of it yet?
HANNITY: I'm not tired of it yet, no.
E. TRUMP: This country is winning. This country is winning from military perspective, it's winning from an economic perspective, it's winning from just about every perspective. I mean, we are the greatest nation on earth, by far, better than ever, ever before. We're winning and they're petrified that their little influence bubble is gone.
HANNITY: Lara, let me ask you this. So, we watch during the government shutdown, they would not sit with him, they wouldn't meet with him. He offered, kept offering them things --
L. TRUMP: wouldn't come to the White House to negotiate with him.
HANNITY: Your father-in-law was standing up for safety, security, and even life and death, especially with drugs and the violence associated with a border. What was Nancy and Chuck standing for in that fight, in this fight? What are they standing up for?
L. TRUMP: Well, I think they are in a really tough spot, actually, after this speech. Because I think the president masterfully laid out the reasons why we have to secure our border, why we have to fix our broken immigration system, and they're in a tough spot right now. It's on them to make something happen for the American people. Anyone who watched that speech understands it and I think is going to support the president on something on our southern border to protect this country. It has to change. So, we have to see it happen.
HANNITY: It's nice to see the country succeeding. I know you guys really ran over very quickly. We've got next time, I'm going to show the baby because this is one cute kid. And the hair, I love it.
L. TRUMP: It's not so late.
HANNITY: All right. Congratulations to both of you. Thanks for stopping by.
L. TRUMP: Thank you.
HANNITY: All right, just getting things started. When we return, Congressman Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, and much more from our nation's capital, the swamp.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: My administration has sent to Congress a common-sense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: "I will get it built and we will never become a socialist nation," two of the big lines of the president tonight on top of him listing his accomplishments in the State of the Union. Also, renewing his commitment to build the wall, address the nation's growing border crisis. Look at this, from CBS "Evening News," breaking moments ago, their poll tonight: 76 percent of their viewers approving of what they heard in the president's speech.
And look at this, 72 percent agreeing -- they approve of the president's ideas on immigration for safety, security, life, and death. Here with reaction: House Minority Whip, Congressman Steve Scalise; House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, who dethroned in the Freedom Caucus Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. Guys, good to see you all. Let's start with you, overall thoughts. I think what made it powerful, I was saying to Eric and Lara -- the success, the jobs, the turnaround.
REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: No, it's amazing. It's been an amazing two years; regulations cut, taxes cut, economy growing at an unprecedented rate, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the court, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages' home from North Korea -- I mean, it's amazing record.
HANNITY: He could take my job over, because I'd do that.
JORDAN: The best part of my speech in my judgment was when you had the president of the United States talk about the sanctity of human life, in a way that was so powerful, in light of what has happened in the last couple of weeks with some of these New York and Virginia. I thought that was the most -- all kinds of powerful moments, but that was the key moment. When have you ever seen a president of the United States stand up and defend the sanctity and respect for life like this president did?
HANNITY: You know, I've known him for way over two decades. And I know because he lived in New York, donated to Democrats and Republicans, there was doubt among my friends, conservatives. And I remember saying, he will keep his promises. He will -- he means what he says. We see what -- but you're right, on the pro-life issue.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: This is against infanticide issue.
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Really -- I mean, this is against - - you know, he was standing up against murder, is what he was standing for tonight, but it was more than that. He was bold. Greatest state of the union address I've ever witnessed. I can tell you that not only was he bold but he reminded us of how great we are as a nation. He reminded us, starting with the greatest generation, and then bringing it forward to what we can celebrate. Now, the interesting thing is, is that year he got when he says we are not going to be a socialist country. Who would have thought that we would have ever have two say that in the House Chamber of the United States of America? That's how far the left has gone.
HANNITY: The only -- when he says, I'm asking you to choose greatness, and what has made us great? Freedom, liberty, capitalism, free markets, limited government. The exact opposite, what failed us the last eight years, congressman?
REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA, HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Sean, it was a great contrast for what we saw under Barack Obama, where you literally had no jobs being created, millions of people had given up looking for work, people thought that we could never be that great nation again. And there he has in the gallery, three men who stormed the beaches of Normandy. Talk about an amazing story. So, one of these guys who stormed the beaches of Normandy, a year later, liberates Dachau and then sitting right down the aisle from him, is somebody who was in one of those concentration camps at Dachau, that was liberated by that very soldier. What a great nation this is.
These are the men who made our nation great, the women that made our nation great -- the president highlighted those stories. And like Jim said, when he talks about the sanctity of life, you know, Ann Wagner just filed a bill today to prohibit those kinds of -- you know, basically, when someone is born alive, whether it was a botched abortion or whatever it is, everybody, I think, just about everyone agrees, you should not allow that kind of procedure to happen. The president talked about greatness and he challenged us to be the great nation.
HANNITY: Here's the next logical question. OK, we watch the Democrats, they wouldn't sit with the president, and he offered everything they want on immigration. Everything they say they want. They cared more about hating him than DREAMers, than DACA. So, after this speech -- they need a re-evaluation as a party?
JORDAN: Well, to think of what they just said about that issue, (INAUDIBLE) said that we need to abolish ICE. Their candidate for president said, borderless hemisphere. Pelosi said, "walls are immoral." And their response, (INAUDIBLE). Stacey Abrams there weeks ago said, noncitizens should be able to vote. So, they have taken the most radical positions you could take. And yet the president says, let's come together, let's focus on doing what's best for the country; and that was the optimism mark and Steve talked about the greatness of this country.
HANNITY: Do you see that happening? Because I don't.
MEADOWS: Well, listen, I was really encouraged over the last couple of days talking to some of our Democrat colleagues that they were going to compromise. But tonight, they had superglue in their seats. You know, I mean, just at the point. They would not stand up for anything.
HANNITY: You're on your game.
SCALISE: Think about this, Sean, the World War II veteran in his 90s got up more times to applaud that a lot of those Democrats, when he was talking about the greatness of this country and rejecting socialism. That is how far to the left they have moved. Our country wants national security, they want border security, the polling you just shows it. That's why we're in this fight. We got to get this done.
HANNITY: Will the Republicans in the Senate hold the line when he goes on his own?
MEADOWS: They will. I'm convinced they will. Listen, no one wants to do a national emergency, but we've got to stand with this president. There're not enough votes to override a veto, so they better --
HANNITY: He's the commander-in-chief, he has a job. Look, 4,000 homicides, drugs, cartels, phones and fentanyl, 90 percent of the heroin, human trafficking, slavery, and to prostitution. We got to stop it. We have a moral duty to do so.
SCALISE: He's going to rise to that call.
HANNITY: Agree with you. He's tenacious, he's unrelenting, and when he changed strategies, I'm like, you don't know. Relax, we're not done yet. Guys, good to see you. I don't know where we'd be without the Freedom Caucus. You guys hold the line and thank God for those of us that are conservative. And that's you, too, congressman, we like you too. All right, when we come back, Fox News Contributor, we sent our friend Lawrence Jones to New York City to get reaction to some Democrats inviting illegal immigrants as their guests to the state of the union tonight. That's next, straight ahead from the swamp, D.C.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, tonight, believe it or not, the hate Trump Democrats pulled yet another cheap political stunt. Some of them actually invited illegal immigrants to the State of the Union. So, earlier, we sent our own Lawrence Jones to the streets of New York to get reaction. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAWRENCE JONES, CONTRIBUTOR: Democrats have said that they're going to troll the president by inviting illegals to the State of the Union because of the president's stance on immigration. How do you feel about that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's unfortunate. It seems like the Democrats take more the side of the illegals than they do of American citizens. And I think Trump is going to troll them back during the speech.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it waste people's time, to be honest. I really think there are so many better people to choose.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that it's important for the illegal immigrants to be there because they matter in America just as much as anyone else.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel fine with that. I do not support Trump's position on immigration at all. I'm pro-immigration.
JONES: The Democrats decided that they're throw him by inviting illegal immigrants to the State of the Union, how do you feel about this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, I want to feel how they would feel if their family was attacked or somehow affected by illegal immigrants coming into this country.
JONES: When it comes to the president and his wall, how do you feel about it?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a waste of money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the American public feel strongly that we need to enhance border security.
JONES: What's the Democrats' plan?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, they said, they had different security measures, you know, more cameras, more things like that, to update, you know, to protect and to --
JONES: Oh, so the cameras are going to stop people, when they're walking across the border, the camera going to stop?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, I don't know.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. Joining us now the reaction is Fox News Contributor, best-selling author, Dan Bongino; and Lawrence Jones, also a Fox News Contributor. You know, Lawrence, I love when you do these man on the streets, you know, I especially level when you went to Nancy Pelosi's district. And what do we see? Feces and homelessness, and needles everywhere, but she has walls around her house, right?
JONES: Right. Look, you know, Sean, you know, I'm a Libertarian. I believe in immigration reform, but until we get that done, we can't have anarchy. I believe that the Democrats, by doing this, are aiding and abetting. Look at it, Sean, you have the people that are responsible for passing legislation, not abiding by the laws that they passed. What type of example is that for the American people? Is anarchy.
HANNITY: Yes. And you know, Dan, we'll never be a socialist country. When the president stood up against what now are six states, and the Senate blocking today a bill that would protect a baby born alive after a botched abortion, they wouldn't even let it come to a vote. What is happening here with them?
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Sean, I was really touched by his speech tonight. I mean, granted, I'm a conservative, I'm a Trump supporter, that's not a secret. I don't think any Liberal would be surprised by me saying that. But let's be honest, there are good and there are bad speeches. Tonight's speech was incredible. I sat on the couch tonight at my house, Sean, right before coming on the show with you, with my mother-in-law, a legal immigrant who I love to death, who sat there on the couch, and at one point was wiping a tear from her eye, but was actually horrified, Sean, at the scene when Trump said: you know, illegal immigrants are asset to this country, which they are just like my mother in law, but we need you to come here legally.
My mother-in-law was horrified when the Democrats sat on their collective hands. I mean, are you serious? That's the image you want out to the rest of the country? It was really a disgraceful moment in what was a truly incredible speech. Hat tip to President Trump. Terrific job.
HANNITY: But the president -- but listen, the president tweeted: This is now the party of late-term abortion, which is infanticide. Even during the birthing process. Not even an abortion debate. Higher taxes, 70 percent, tax the wealth after it's already been taxed, and tax it again when you die; open borders, eliminate ICE, and crime. I don't think that's a winning formula. Lawrence?
JONES: Well, this is the party now, the energy is what the socialist wing of the party. I mean, when the president said that this will never be a socialist country. To see the look on their faces -- these guys, the AOCs of the world, they want socialism. This is for the fight and the soul of this country, and people cannot just stay at home. They got to go out and vote.
HANNITY: Guys, thanks so much for being with us. Lawrence, thanks for going on the street. Dan, always great to have you. All right, no villain of the day today. It was a hard choice. The hero of the day, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, not a villain tonight, a hero of the day. So, sitting next to the first lady tonight, Melania Trump, was a woman name Ashley Evans. Last night, I had the honor of meeting with her, I spoke to her for quite some time, so impressive. She has struggled with opioid substance abuse, a lot of issues in her early life and in just a few days on February 9th, Ashley will celebrate being sober for one year and one month, and later this month Ashley will be reunited with her one-year-old daughter full-time.
Her journey to recovery, remarkable, courageous, overcoming addiction, extremely hard. And as I told her last night, her future is bright. Ashley, I'm proud to know you. And congratulations. This is not a manufactured crisis, 90 percent of heroin coming from our Southern border.
All right, we will be here in D.C. tomorrow night, let not your heart be troubled, we are always not the hate-Trump media. Laura Ingraham is right next door.
