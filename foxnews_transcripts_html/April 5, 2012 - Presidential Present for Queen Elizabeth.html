     Video  Grapevine: Presidential Present for Queen Elizabeth 
Obama gives gift at Buckingham Palace 
And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine from across The Pond today:  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Pomp and Circumstance
President and Mrs. Obama came bearing gifts during their visit to Buckingham Palace. They presented to the queen a leather-bound album of photographs and memorabilia from her parents' 1939 visit to the U.S. In return, the Obamas were given a selection of letters to and from past presidents and Queen Victoria. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Many people have pointed out the Obamas' choice of gifts were much-improved from the 2009 visit, during which President Obama gave the queen an iPod pre-loaded with some of his own speeches. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
National Review's Jonah Goldberg joked of this year's gifts -- quote -- "Maybe the new iPad preloaded with pictures of Obama in the Situation Room is still on backorder?" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What's in a Name?
President Obama's security code name given to him by Scotland Yard during his stay in country is raising a few eyebrows. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Chalaque" is a Punjabi word that can be used to describe someone as crafty or cunning. A Punjabi speaker in the United Kingdom tells Fox the term can be derisive depending on its use and it's not considered rude.
Scotland Yard insists the code words chosen for VIP guests are completely random and computer-generated. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Party Like It's 2008 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And finally, as President Obama gears up for his re-election campaign in 2012, he might be wishing that it's 2008.
The president appears to have signed the wrong year in the guest book at Westminster Abbey. He wrote - quote -- "It is a great privilege to commemorate our common heritage, and common sacrifice" and then added 24 May 2008.
A Westminster Abbey spokesman confirmed to the London Telegraph it was the president who made the error.  </pre>
