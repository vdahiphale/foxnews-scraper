     Video  Political Grapevine: Money for nagging? 
Taxpayers fund grant for campaign to get women to 'encourage' men in their lives to quit smokeless tobacco 
Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Chew It Over
You've heard of the phrase "money for nothing." Well, this story is about money for "nagging." Two million of your tax dollars are sponsoring a continuing grant for a campaign to get women to "encourage" the men in their lives to quit using smokeless tobacco. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Washington Times reports researchers have established that women can be readily recruited to get their men to quit, but now the project will include a multimedia push.   A spending watchdog group decried the expense, noting: "One wonders if National Institutes of Health has a companion grant program designed to teach dads how to cope with hostile environments in the household." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NIH defends the study, saying positive support has been shown to be an important factor for effective quitting attempts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yogi Bear
Last Friday, we told you about a city in Russia that was cracking down on yoga in an effort to curb the spread of religious cults. It seems that country's president did not get the anti-yoga memo. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This week during a meeting with India's prime minister -- an avid yogi -- Vladimir Putin agreed to roll out the mat, noting he hadn't tried yoga yet. Russia's macho man said, "I will consider yoga based on what I do in sports."
Favorite Putin pastimes include bare-chested horseback riding, judo and hockey to name a few. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Crowded Field 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Finally, each week another well-known presidential contender jumps in the 2016 presidential race. In fact there could be hundreds of candidates filing. However, a dark horse candidate is getting a lot of attention after officially filing paperwork with the FEC.
Actually, it's a cat. Limberbutt McCubbins to be exact. The registered "Democat" is pushing environmental issues and the legalization of catnip.
We have not reached out to McCubbins though about a contender profile or an appearance in our Center Seat segment. We were worried the claws might come out.  </pre>
