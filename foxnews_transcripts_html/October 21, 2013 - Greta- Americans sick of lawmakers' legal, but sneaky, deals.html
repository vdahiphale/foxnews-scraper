'Off the Record', 10/21/13: Greta's annoyed by deals made by some members of Congress that are technically legal, but maybe morally bankrupt

OK, let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. What is up with some members of Congress? Are they trying to make us not admire them? If so, some are doing a great job of it.
If you ask me, American people are sick of some politicians legal, but sneaky deals like legally skimming extra cash off their PAC to cook up something for themselves. Yes, technically, legally correct. But is it morally correct? Morally right? In other words, does it stink? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, here is the latest: According to CBS "60 Minutes," Democratic Congresswoman Grace Napolitano loaned her own PAC $150,000 and charged the PAC big interest rates of up to 18 percent. She reportedly pocketed as much as $228,000 in just interest in 12 years, and she is not only one who is figuring out how to have personal fun with campaign cash. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss spent more than $100,000 entertaining world class golf sources and Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks spent $35,000 on NFL games. And Democratic Congressman Rob Andrews spent $16,000 to fly his family to Scotland for a friend's wedding, reportedly because he was considering hiring the friend as a consultant. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All following the rules? Yes, of course, they are following the rules. But doesn't it seem a bit cheesy to you? Does it make it feel like they don't care, but care about themselves? Go to GretaWire.com and vote on our poll do they care about you or themselves? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you an important story or issue you I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
