Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers, 9/9/15: The Iran nuclear deal may be the most important one of our lifetime and we don't know what's in it - not even the possible side deals

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's go "Off the Record." What is wrong with us? I'm talking about you and me. We're not terrorists. None of us has a sneaky nuclear weapons program in our basement. Nor are we threatening to wipe Israel off the map.
You and I are honest, just good hard-working citizens wanting to do the right thing. So, tell me, why is President Obama hiding from us the full Iran nuclear deal with all its possible side deals? The Iran deal might be the most important deal in yours and my lifetime, and yet we don't know what is in it. None of us does. We can't read it because our government won't show it to us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, our politicians, including the president, pat us on the head and say, "Trust us." I'm so over that. I don't trust anyone. I want to see it myself. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, the deal should be put online on Whitehouse.gov. Transparency - remember that word? And don't tell me the deal is classified. President Obama can un-classify it. He is the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And don't tell me we need to keep it secret from the enemy. The enemy knows all about it. They helped us write it. It's not a secret from Iran. It's only a secret from us, American citizens. Ayatollah Khomeini and President -- they know every page of the deal. You and I are in the dark.
You know that's wrong. This is so messed up. And that's my "Off the Record" comment.  </pre>
