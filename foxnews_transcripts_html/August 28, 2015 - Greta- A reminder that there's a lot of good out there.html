Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I don't need to tell you, the news business field with dissension and sadness. We are 24/7 up to our eyeballs in it, from politicians saying awful and sometimes baseless, things about each other, and course, we cover horrible murders, recently two law enforcement officers in Louisiana on two different days and two young TV journalists in Virginia.
Now, news can be pretty tough to stomach. But then suddenly, you read about people like Robert LeDoux, the Good Samaritan who tackled a man suspected of killing a Louisiana state trooper. Or you meet people like Alek Skarlatos, who helped stop a terror attack on a train from France and you are suddenly overtaken by the basic goodness and decency. And you are reminded that, you know what, here is a lot of good out there. There are people who do a lot of the super human stuff like Alek. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SKARLATOS: He pulled out a handgun. I -- it was right in front of me, so I just grabbed the handgun immediately, pried it out of his hand. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Yes. That's the super human stuff. But there is also probably you, just doing a simple favor for someone, going out of your way, which you might not think a big deal. But it is, because you know what? It makes someone else's life easier, even if just for a moment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, thank you to Alek and his two friends for making all Americans so proud. And also thank you for reminding us that there is so much good in this world. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
