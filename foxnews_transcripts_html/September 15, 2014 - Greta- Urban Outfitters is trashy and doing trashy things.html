'Off the Record,' 9/15/14: If want to make destroy young people, poison their culture, make them glorify violence and the personal heartache of others, that's what Urban Outfitters is doing with their bloody 'Vintage Kent State University' sweatshirt

Let's all go "Off the Record." What is wrong with some people? And tonight, those some people are the executives at Urban Outfitters.
I don't know if these executives think they are funny or clever or even edgy. But one thing is certain: They're trash. They do trashy things. If you want to destroy young people, here is how you do it: Poison their culture, make young people glorify horrible violence or personal heartache experienced by others, make young people think it's cool to promote violence and death. That's exactly what Urban Outfitters did. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Check out Urban Outfitters new "Vintage Kent State Sweatshirt." It has bloodstains and bullet holes on it, representing Kent State shootings on May 4th, 1970, when a National Guard shot into a crowd of students, killing four students, wounding nine -- ending young lives and breaking hearts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm sure the families of those victims are heartbroken tonight, again, by the callousness of Urban Outfitters and don't tell me this is just one idiot at Urban Outfitters who did this. You know, this was OKed by a whole team of quality control people. Lots of people could have stopped it. And now, Urban Outfitters suddenly issuing a statement apologizing for the shirt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that apology is only because they got caught, caught selfishly trying to make a buck by glorifying violence to young people. Don't tell me they didn't know exactly what they were doing. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
