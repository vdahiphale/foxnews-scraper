Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Did you see it? It happened right after we went off the air on Friday night, fireworks in the House of Representatives. Leader Pelosi takes no prisoners. She got her nose out of joint, when Congressman Tom Marino in floor debate over immigration, criticized her for not doing immigration reform when she was Speaker of the House.
Well, that comment set Pelosi on fire and she shocked everyone. She went marching over to the Republican side of the chamber headed right for Marino. Check this out: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

TOM MARINO, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN: They knew this problem existed. They didn't have the strength to go after it back then. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

He says she waived her finger at him and called her a liar, told him, not just once, but twice, that he is insignificant. Ouch. Now, Pelosi spokesperson had a little different version. She he said her boss just wanted to remind the congressman that when she was Speaker, the Democrats passed the DREAM Act. It might have been a better idea though to just slip Marino a reminder note.
But as much drama as that was, it was amateur spat. If you want to see a professional fight between politicians, try the Taiwanese parliament. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
