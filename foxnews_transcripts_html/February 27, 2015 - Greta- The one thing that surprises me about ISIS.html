'Off the Record,' 2/27/15: ISIS's brutality comes as no surprise, but why is most of the world just sitting on the sidelines watching it happen?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Check out this video. This is ISIS ransacking a museum in Mosul. They are destroying priceless ancient artifacts. This vicious act though should not surprise you, because, after all, ISIS has no respect for humans, kidnapping and murdering Christians, beheading innocents, burning people alive, doing the most brutal things to children as they execute them, and videotaping all of this as they brag about their evil.
So why should anybody be surprised that they destroyed this beautiful museum in Mosul? You're not surprised. I'm not. The only thing that does surprise me is most of the world is sitting on the sidelines, spectators, as innocent people are being tortured and murdered. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, a few nations are dropping bombs here and there on ISIS, and that is much appreciated. But make no mistake about it, if the world really gave a damn and stopped the handwringing and the hugs, real leadership would emerge to mobilize the world. The world could stop ISIS. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It isn't easy. But the greatest generation showed its colors in defeating Hitler. What colors will my generation show? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
