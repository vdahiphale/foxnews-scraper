CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.Washington prepares for the inauguration of President Joe Biden, but thenation's capital is under an extraordinary security lockdown.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (voice-over):  D.C. bristling with more than 20,000 members of theNational Guard, after the shocking attack on the Capitol. And now, statesacross the country ramp up after the FBI warns of the threat of moreviolence.We'll discuss security preparations with Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson,vice chair of the National Governors Association.Then, President-elect Biden lays out his agenda calling for an almost $2trillion COVID relief package.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I know what I just described does not comecheaply. We simply cannot afford not to do what I'm proposing.WALLACE:  We'll talk with Brian Deese, Biden's pick to succeed Larry Kudlowas the top White House economic advisor, about the pushback to the plan'smassive price tag.Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about President Trump's second impeachmentand what to expect in the Senate trial.And Apple takes right-leaning Parler off its App Store.Isn't big tech restricting speech?Our one-on-one with the tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday."(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.Three days from now, Joe Biden will take the oath of office on the westfront of the capitol, the same spot where less than two weeks ago, a mob ofinsurrectionist tried to stop Congress from certifying the results of theelection. Now, Washington is locked down by thousands of military andpolice amid threats of more violence.Meanwhile, President Trump's final days in office are marked by growingisolation. Members of his cabinet resigning, ten House Republicans votingto impeach him a second time, and losing access to Twitter, his biggestpolitical megaphone.Later this hour, we'll discuss the power of big tech with Apple CEO TimCook.But first, David Spunt reports on the effort to protect the nation'scapital and cities across the country leading up to the inauguration.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Chris, right now, theU.S. Capitol is a fortress. Twenty thousand National Guard troops are onwatch, more are on the way.MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are committed to anorderly transition and to a safe inauguration.SPUNT:  The vice president's pledge of one week after rioters stormed theCapitol. Five people, including the capitol police officer, died. Everyday, authorities make new arrests including Jacob Chansley, who allegedlywarned the vice president in the note, quote, justice is coming.The TSA may add those arrested to the no-fly list ahead of Wednesday'stransfer of power.CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR:  We are seeing an extensive amount ofconcerning online chatter, it's the best way I would describe it.SPUNT:  Authorities haven't announced any specific threats but the FBI andSecret Service have D.C. fortified with more troops than in Iraq andAfghanistan combined.Friday, authorities arrested a man with a Glock, ammunition, andunauthorized credentials trying to enter a restricted area in Washington.After being released, he claimed he got lost.WESLEY BEELER, ARRESTED NEAR CAPITOL:  I forgot my firearm was in thetruck. I was trying to make it to work.SPUNT:  The nation's governors layering on extra protection in statecapitols across the country.GOV. TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA:  We take the threats to our capital and toour citizens incredibly seriously.GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  There are people in our country who want toturn peaceful protests into opportunities for violence.SPUNT:  Multiple state capitol buildings are closed through inaugurationday -- Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  David, thank you.And, joining us now, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, vice chair of theNational Governors Association,Governor, I want to start with a warning this week from FBI Director ChrisWray. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR:  We're concerned about the potential forviolence at multiple protests and rallies planned here in D.C. and at statecapitol buildings around the country in the days to come that could bringarmed individuals within close proximity to government buildings andofficials.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor, do you have intelligence about rallies like that thisweek in Arkansas? And have you beefed up security to protect our statecapitol in Little Rock?GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), ARKANSAS:  Well, thank you, Chris.And the answer is yes. We have both intelligence that there's going to beactivity around our capitol and capitols across the country. Much of itcomes from the FBI, but our own intelligence, and we are taking necessaryprecautions to make sure that we protect our capitol and our citizens.You have to -- you want to be overprepared versus underprepared because wenever want to see a repeat of what we saw on January 6th in our nation'scapitol.WALLACE:  What are you specifically being told about the threat level ofthe rallies in your state?HUTCHINSON:  It's not to the level that I'm bringing out the NationalGuard. We are using civilian law enforcement. We have response teams there.We'll have a beefed up presence at the capitol for Tuesday. We actuallyhave a rally for today.And, there's not -- we don't have any specific intelligence that there'sgoing to be violence associated with those rallies, but we want to be extraprecautious. Every state has to look at their own intelligence matrix andmake those kinds of judgments. I know some governors have beefed up evenmore than that.But I think the deterrent value of what we've seen over the last couple ofdays has had an impact and hopefully has diminished that threat level.WALLACE:  An Arkansan named Richard Barnett was arrested for violent entryto the capital. We have a picture of him up on the screen on January 6th.He's the man pictured on the left, who broke into Speaker Pelosi's office,posed for pictures and stole her mail. His mug shot is on the right.Governor, is there an element in your state that you believe poses a threatto -- whether it's on the federal level or the state level, poses a threatto our government?HUTCHINSON:  Well, I think there is an historic threat from militia groups,from those that I dealt with in the 1980s when I was United Statesattorney, of neo-Nazi white supremacists, terrorist organizations. That'sbeen diminished, but I would say most states have some element of thatthreat. It exists in Arkansas as well.And let me just say that it is critical that those including the two that'sbeen arrested from Arkansas meet the full measure of the law. That isunacceptable conduct and we will -- and that serves in and of itself as adeterrent.WALLACE:  Yeah, we should point out there's another Arkansan who's beenarrested, he's the fellow who was seen banging, hitting police officerswith an American flag.Back on November 7th, just four days after our presidential election, youissued the statement: While we await the outcome of various courtchallenges it is important that we recognize the likelihood that formerVice President Biden and Senator Harris have won over 270 electoral votes.Governor, in spreading stories over these last two months about a riggedelection, in the words he said to that crowd of thousands of people on theMall on January 6th, what responsibility do you think President Trump bearsfor the attack on the U.S. Capitol?HUTCHINSON:  Well, he asked all of the people to come to Washington for therally and then he used a very aggressive language in the rally itself andhe misled people as to -- and his followers -- as to what happened duringthe election, that it was stolen and that our checks and balances are notworking.And while I do believe there can be an effective review always to make sureour systems of elections work well, the Electoral College is what iscritical to our nation. I supported that, and his challenge to that waswrong and did not serve our nation well and it was demonstrated on January6th.WALLACE:  So, you had three terms in Congress and in fact you served as animpeachment manager for the House in the Clinton impeachment in the late'90s. If you were in Congress now, would you have voted for the Trumpimpeachment? It certainly was much more consequential than the case againstBill Clinton.HUTCHINSON:  Very serious allegations. The impeachment is something that isboth a legal equation, but it's also a political equation and I did notbelieve that with the remaining weeks that were left in President Trump'sterm that that served our country well to go through the House impeachment.Now that the House has impeached President Trump, either the House can holdthe articles of impeachment there, but once they send them over to theSenate, the Senate trial is triggered and there's no option about that. Andso, we're going to go through a very challenging time.And having gone through the impeachment before, I do think it's importantthat the Senate hear both the legal arguments about that, about whathappened, but also the facts and make a judgment and I think at this point,the outcome is unpredictable.WALLACE:  After the riot in the U.S. Capitol, you had this to say aboutPresident Trump: It's going to diminish that cult of personality and Ithink it will help bring our party back to policy and conservatism.Which raises the question, Governor, where does the Republican Party, thenational Republican Party, go from here and how much clout do you thinkDonald Trump will have as the next president and the GOP?HUTCHINSON:  Well, it's a great question and, first of all, the GOP had avery successful election. Yes, we did not win the presidency, but at everyother level, we had success and gained seats.So, conservatism in the Republican Party is alive and well. Right now, weare fractured as a result of President Trump and how he has handled it, thepost-election results and challenged the Electoral College, and that hassome division.But our party will come back together. We're going to have a tough sixmonths or more coming up. We are going to have a lot of soul-searchingthat's going to be done, and it's going to be a fair debate as thedirection of the party both in terms of Trump's influence over it, but it'salso going to be about policy and trade and foreign policy and Biden'sagenda.So I welcome that policy debate and I think we ought to get back to theconservative principles that have made our party the majority party andhopefully, it will move away from that personality-driven that's let us towhere we are right now under President Trump.WALLACE:  Finally, Governor, I want to switch subjects on you. Arkansas hasgiven out 46 percent of the COVID vaccine doses that you have gotten sofar. I want to ask you, what do you think of the Trump plan as it hasworked so far for getting the vaccine into people's arms? What was yourreaction when you found out that the Trump administration in fact has noreserve supply of the vaccine despite what had been promised to you?And briefly, to answer all of these, what do you think of the Biden vaccineplan as you've heard it so far?HUTCHINSON:  Well, we want to get the vaccines out. We were disappointedthat there wasn't going to be an accelerated delivery of vaccines to ourstate and we were not counting on that in our current delivery system, butwe wanted more, because right now, we are going into teachers, those age 70and over, and we don't have the supply to get them all vaccinated.Hopefully, that will increase with our great pharmaceutical industry andtheir manufacturing capacity, but it's got to increase. In terms ofPresident-elect Biden's plan, I've met with their transition team a coupleof times on this and they're looking for ways to accelerate that, but --and the bottom line is, they're dependent upon our manufacturing capacityand if we can't beef that up, then it's going to be a tough couple ofmonths in trying to get a limited supply out to everyone that's in need.We're doing everything we can to accelerate the delivery of the vaccines toour population, so I expect our current percent, about 40 percent, will goup. We're getting our systems in better place, there's a greater acceptanceof that, and it's going well. We just need more supply to get it into thearms quicker.WALLACE:  Governor, thank you. Thanks for joining us. Always good to talkwith you, sir.HUTCHINSON:  Thank you, Chris. Good to be with you today.WALLACE:  Up next, a live report on Joe Biden's plans once he takes office,and we'll talk with his top White House economic advisor when we come rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  One of the first acts of the Biden presidency will be pushing amassive rescue package aimed at boosting an economy hammered by COVID, butit needs buy-in from Republicans in an evenly split Senate.In a moment, we'll talk with a top Biden economic advisor, Brian Deese.But first, let's bring in Jacqui Heinrich, who is covering the president-elect in Delaware -- Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, the inaugural theme isAmerica united. But for the first time in more than 150 years, we will notsee the outgoing and incoming president standing together commemorating apeaceful transfer of power.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HEINRICH (voice-over):  No word yet if Vice President Pence will replacePresident Trump in the inaugural procession and escort the president-electto the capitol. Trump's plans to leave Washington before Joe Biden takesthe oath punctuating what's to be the most consequential speech of Biden'slife delivered to a crowd scaled down by the pandemic surrounded bythousands of troops staged against more violence.SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), INAUGURATION COMMITTEE CO-CHAIR:  The theme ofthe inauguration is about a determined democracy and we picked the themeactually before all of this happened, of course, and it's even moremeaningful now.HEINRICH:  Biden will not wait for bipartisanship to undo Trump's policies,planning a ten-day flurry of executive orders beginning with rejoining theParis Climate Accord, reversing the travel ban on majority Muslim countriesand mandating masks on federal property. But getting his $1.9 trillionpandemic relief package through Congress will require diplomacy.BIDEN:  Top economists agree in this moment of crisis, with interest ratesat historic lows, we cannot afford inaction.HEINRICH:  Maneuvering around a filibuster in Biden's first few weeks couldcome just as Biden launches part two of that package aimed at jobs in theeconomy. Expected to be at least as expensive as the first.(END VIDEOTAPE)HEINRICH (on camera):  Biden also told Congress to expect a sweepingimmigration bill his first day in office and urged Congress to keep thebusiness of the nation on track as they gauge timing for President Trump'simpeachment trial -- Chris.WALLACE:  Jacqui Heinrich reporting from Wilmington, Delaware -- Jacqui,thank you.And joining us now, Joe Biden's top White House economic advisor, BrianDeese.Brian, welcome to "FOX News Sunday".BRIAN DEESE, INCOMING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  Thanks,Chris. Happy to be here.WALLACE:  So Congress has already passed, over the last year, approved morethan $4 trillion in COVID relief. You are now asking -- the president-electis now asking for another $1.9 trillion in COVID relief.Do you really need all that money?DEESE:  Well, we start from where the economy is today. And the truth iswe're at a very precarious moment. We lost jobs last month for the firsttime since this spring. Last week nearly a million Americans fired forunemployment insurance, which is higher than any week during the Greatrecession. And last week 30 million Americans reported that they didn'thave enough food to eat.So we've got an acute economic crisis and human crisis and we need decisiveaction. And so that's really what the president-elect's plan is about. It'sabout targeting the core issues that we know we need to tackle. We need toget shots in people's arms to get the pandemic under control. We need toget schools open so that parents can get back to work. And we need to getrelief out of those millions of families, millions of businesses who,through no fault of their own, are continuing to suffer and the economy andthe virus are spiraling downward.So now is the time to act. We know that this is going to take a lot ofwork, but we are ready to do it. And as you saw, the president-elect'smaking the case that now is the time to move forward.WALLACE:  Let's drill down on specific parts of the package. You arecalling for another $1,400 direct payment to the vast majority ofAmericans. There's criticism why not target it just to those people whohave actually lost a job. There are a lot of people who will get the -- the$1,400 on top of the $600 who have been doing just fine and haven't beenhit by COVID.And then there is criticism from conservatives that you have snuck in aliberal wish list into this package. Let me put some items on the screen.$20 billion for public transit. $9 billion for cybersecurity. Raise theminimum wage to $15 an hour.Whether those last items, Brian, are a good policy idea or not, are -- canyou really say that they are part of emergency COVID relief?DEESE:  Well, if you look at the core of this package, what it's doing isit's going at those core challenges. So about $400 billion in this packageis going at the vaccination effort and getting schools reopened. Anotherportion, as you said, is to buy direct relief that --WALLACE:  You're -- you're going to get -- you -- you will -- you'll get --Brian, you'll get -- you'll -- you'll get used to me interrupting. That'swhat I do on this show.I'm asking, though, about these specific parts, transit, $15 minimum wage.DEESE:  Sure.WALLACE:  I understand some parts of it clearly are COVID relief, but whyadd this stuff to the bill?DEESE:  Sure. Well, let's -- let's look at each of those. The cybersecurityresources there are in the wake of the Solar Winds hack. We have seen andnow understand significant vulnerabilities that are exacerbated by COVIDand the fact that so much federal operations are happening online. We needthose resources to secure our systems now.Transit. Look, our transit systems across the country are facing acutecrisis. That's not happening in Democratic states or -- or Republicanstates, it's happening around the country. And by providing relief now, wecan help to avoid diminished service and diminished support when we comeout of this crisis. And the $15 minimum wage is a concrete and direct wayto help support those workers who are out there on the front lines rightnow providing services to all of us and give them direct support and adirect boost right now.WALLACE:  Then there's the timetable for -- for passing this COVID reliefpackage.Here is President-elect Biden this week.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES:  The crisis of deep humansuffering is in plain sight. And there's no time to waste. We have to actand we have to act now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Plan A is to get this package through the Senate with 60 votes toavoid, to beat a filibuster. But you -- you had Republican senators underPresident Trump who were refusing to go over a trillion dollars. They endedup passing $900 billion. Do you really expect ten Republican senators tosign on to another $2 trillion?DEESE:  Well, I do want to start with reinforcing the urgency point thatyou raised. You look -- just over the weekend an independent firm, Moody's,showed that if we act immediately, this plan -- and put it in place, theeconomy could create seven and a half million jobs this year. That's thekind of robust recovery that we need.And if you look at the components of the plan, you mentioned the $1,400checks. We've seen broad bipartisan support from that, including Republicansenators. You look at other elements of the plan, like an expanded childtax credit, something that Republican senators have supported in the past.And if you look at the vaccination efforts and the school efforts here,we've been talking to governors and mayors across the country, includingGovernor Hutchinson, who was just on, Republicans and Democrats who say, weabsolutely need to try to surge support in this critical period of the nextcouple months to get the virus under control, to get those schools open,help parents get back to work, particularly women who are facing adisproportionate hit here.WALLACE:  Right.DEESE:  I think there's a lot of -- there's a lot of support for takingthese actions. So we -- we're -- we see every reason why Congress shouldmove out and should move out in a bipartisan way.WALLACE:  Yes, of course, as we -- as you know, as well as I do, shoulddoesn't always mean it happens.President-elect Biden has kept open the possibility of ending thefilibuster. If Republicans were to block here -- you have 50 votes, but youneed 60 to break a filibuster. If they -- they block you, would ending thefilibuster so you could pass it with 51 votes with Vice President Harris,would ending the filibuster be on the table?DEESE:  Well, look, we think we need to move quickly here. But I would alsosay, you know, there's a lot of skepticism that the -- a president-elect'scall of unity and working together was going to resonate. And he won theelection resoundingly.There was a lot of skepticism that Congress would come together in Decemberin a bipartisan way and deliver a down payment on this relief. And thathappened.So let's see where we can get here. There is a lot of, again, a lot ofelements of this plan that have support across the board, both inWashington and in state capitals and around the country. But we need toact. We need to act quickly. And that's what the economy is telling us.That's what the experts are telling us. And so that's our priority.WALLACE:  Then, speaking of acting quickly, there's the Senate trial ofDonald Trump. I know the -- the hope is to work out a deal where Congress,the Senate, can work on the dual track, spend part of the day on business,like the COVID relief package, Senate confirmations and then part of theday on the trial.If you can't get that kind of a deal, if the decision is you're going to goahead and do nothing but the trial until you finish it, would there be someinterest on the part of President-elect Biden to delay the trial, get someof the work done before Nancy Pelosi sends over the articles ofimpeachment?DEESE:  Well, look, we think there's every reason that we can move forwardand address multiple issues. We do have multiple crises. We have a -- a --a lot of pressing business facing the country and so certainly weunderstand and expect that the Senate is going to act on its constitutionalduty. But as you mentioned, there is precedent for the Senate movingforward with an impeachment hearing while at the same time holdinghearings, operating other business. There's precedent historically and evenrecently in the first impeachment trial.So that's going to be our focus is trying to get an agreement and astructure that will allow that to happen. And we're able to move out onthese multiple fronts and -- and make progress on these multiplepriorities.WALLACE:  Brian, I've got two minutes left. I would like to squeeze twoquestions in.During the campaign, President Trump said the Biden plan for the economywas exactly the wrong answer.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The Biden agenda, with bigtax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately killeverything.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Unemployment was 3.5 percent before COVID hit back in February.Is raising taxes and increasing regulations, both of which President-electBiden has talked about, is that really the answer to get back to what was apretty strong economy before the pandemic?DEESE:  Look, I think if you ask most American people, was that an economythat was working for them, the answer would be, no. And that's a big partof the reason why the Biden agenda and the Biden economic approach was theone that won out in this election.Right now we find ourselves in an economic crisis. We have to focus on theimmediate issues in front of us and we need to act decisively.One of the things we've learn in crises is that acting decisively will putus on a path to have a stronger economic recovery coming out of this. Sothat's going to be our -- our focus, our immediate focus. Let's getdecisive action. Let's put the economy on a stronger trajectory. That willbe the best thing for American people, American workers.WALLACE,And, finally, I've got less than a minute left. The irony in allthis is that after you were appointed there was a lot of pushback from theleft wing of the Democratic Party that you, in your work for the Obamaadministration, were too conservative, that you actually called forderegulation not more regulations and also called for cutting back onspending. So is the left wrong or have you had a change of mind from yourprevious service in -- in the Democratic administration?DEESE: Well, look, the -- the -- the president-elect has a clear vision formaking this economy work for working Americans again. That's a vision thatI share and that we're going to wake up every day trying to move forward.It involves addressing some of the significant structural inequities in oureconomy that have left out too many Americans, including black and brownAmericans around this country who have not had a fair shot, and that'sgoing to be our focus. It's going to be my focus. That's been my animatingfocus across the last decade or more in public life and private life and Ithink that that's going to be what the president-elect expects of us andcertainly that's what I and the team will carry forward.WALLACE: Brian, thank you. Thanks for your time this weekend and pleasecome back, sir.DEESE: Thank you. Thanks for having me on. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss how the Senatewill juggle the impeachment trial of Donald Trump while also dealing withJoe Biden's nominees and his ambitious agenda.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, a parting shot from President Trump as he lashes out atHouse Democrats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This impeachment is causingtremendous anger and you're doing it and it's really a terrible thing thatthey're doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether a Senate trial detracts fromthe Biden agenda, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We know that the president of the United Statesincited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country.He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we alllove.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi making the case for urgent action byCongress as she pushed for the second impeachment of Donald Trump.And it's time now for our Sunday group.GOP strategist Karl Rove, pollster and Fox News contributor Kristen SoltisAnderson, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Karl, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell says that he is keeping anopen mind about the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. A bigdifference, sharp difference, from his clear opposition from the very startof the first impeachment trial just a year ago.What do you think, Karl, are the chances that 17 Senate Republicans, andthat's what it would take, if all of the Democrats vote for conviction, 17Senate Republicans would vote to convict Donald Trump and remove him --well, he'll be removed from office, but to keep him from running again?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well,normally we'd say not much chance, but I think Leader McConnell's statementis a sign that ever Republican senator needs to take this seriously. And Ithink it's all going to boil down to, what's the president's defense.Rudy Giuliani charted a very bad course for the president in the morningpapers when he suggested that the argument was going to be, well, therecouldn't have been incitement because all the charges of widespread voterfraud are true. Well, those charges and the so-called experts that thecampaign has mustered to advocate them have been rejected by over 50 courtswith judges appointed by President Trump, President Obama, President Bush,President Clinton and I think even one Reagan justice. So if -- it -- it --this would -- if it's the Rudy Giuliani defense, there is a stronglikelihood that more than 17 Republicans will because essentially thatargument is, this was justified, the attack on the Capital and the attemptto -- to end the -- the congressional hearing on certifying the electionwas justified because all these charges are true. And, frankly, theyaren't. They have given -- been given every opportunity to prove them in acourt of law and have failed to do so.So I think it really boils down to, what's the defense that the president'sgoing to -- is going to make. And if it's Rudy Giuliani's defense, I thinkthere's a -- it raises the likelihood of more than 17 Republicans votingfor conviction.WALLACE: Juan, what do you think are the chances that the Senate,Republicans and Democrats, will vote to convict the president and ban himfrom running for office again? And, is this a bad way for Joe Biden tostart his presidency and -- with his calls for unity?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well -- well, Chris, I thinkyou're right in saying, you know, you only need 17. Joe Manchin, on theDemocrat side, is pretty clear he's opposed to impeachment at this moment.But if -- some senators may simply stay away. You need two-thirds of thosewho are present, and I think, you know, going back to Karl's point, ifSenator McConnell decides that he is not only open to conviction, butallowing others to pursue that path, then I think he gives them cover toabsolutely do that.And, remember, the articles of impeachment are narrowly written. I thinkGiuliani's defense is -- is laughable. So this, again, opens the door. AndI think this really could happen.But to your point about unity, you know, unity, I think, is anacknowledgment, the desire for Biden to heal, acknowledgment most Trumpvoters did not participate in this insurrection. And so Biden is reachingout to them.But you cannot use healing as an excuse for people to pursue anarchy andviolence and threaten the stability of our country. That kind of behaviorcan't be excused and shouldn't be normalized even as we try to heal.WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump is not going quietly.Here he is this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The impeachment hoax is acontinuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history ofour country. And it's causing tremendous anger and division and pain fargreater than most people will ever understand.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: A new poll came out this week on the job approval rating peoplegive President Trump after the riot on January 6th. And let's take a lookat the numbers.Only 29 percent of Americans now approve of the job that Mr. Trump isdoing. That's by far the lowest rating of this presidency. And amongRepublicans, approval of Mr. Trump has dropped from 77 percent in August to60 percent now.Kristen, as our polling expert, how bad are those numbers? How toxic isDonald Trump now in American politics?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, ECHELON INSIGHTS, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER" AND FOXNEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Those numbers are not the way you want to leave thepresidency. It really reflects a legacy that is not going to be rememberedfor the things that many of -- of Trump's senior staff were hoping to -- togo out and -- and be remembered for.Right now, within the Republican Party, I think that decline in his jobapproval among Republicans is so fascinating because it's an open questionhow much Donald Trump will be considered a leader of the party movingforward. In that same poll they asked Americans, do you want Donald Trumpto remain a major figure in American politics? Only 29 percent of Americanssaid yes. There's a real, I think, Trump fatigue out there.And even among Republicans, it was relatively split. I think this is aparty that's going to have to grapple with the fact that it has a base ofsupporters who really like Donald Trump. They think that he's done theright thing since the election. They think that he was wronged. And abroader voter base. And, by the way, that's for the folks for -- in theSenate, who they'll be very responsive to because they don't have sort ofgerrymandered or safe districts in most cases who are just ready for Trumpto be gone and off the scene.WALLACE: Well, that raises the -- the big question that I asked AsaHutchinson, Karl, which is, where does the Republican Party go from here?And is there a place for Donald Trump in the GOP in coming years?ROVE: Well, the Republican Party is broken, it's fractured, it's in themidst of a civil war and it's going to be an ugly several years. And it'snot going to be six month. It's not going to be a year. It's going to beyears before the Republican Party can put itself back together. It needs torebuild. It needs to find a way to take the traditional Republicancoalition and -- and bring in and keep as much of the Trump voters, theordinary voters who cared about him taking on the establishment and takingon the elites on the East and West Coast.But the Republican Party, let's not kid ourselves, it is in the midst of acivil war. When you have the son of the president of the United Statescalling anyone who opposes his -- his father a zero and -- and promising tocome after you in a primary, this ain't going to end quickly and it ain'tgoing to be pretty. And the Republican Party needs to find a way to returnto its conservative roots and to update those principles and apply them tothe new circumstances in which the country finds itself. But it needs toget beyond Donald Trump. And that ain't going to be easy because he's notgoing to want to retire and -- and sit on the sidelines.WALLACE: Kristen, as a Republican pollster, let me pick up on that withyou.How do you see this split between traditional Republicans and TrumpRepublicans? Can they find a way to work together? There are a lot ofissues that unite them. There are some that divide them. So can they getback to a unified GOP or is there going to be a split? And is there a placefor -- for Donald Trump in that party?ANDERSON: I think there's a possibility of -- of healing and unity overtime, but I -- I think it's going to be hard to get there. Within theparty, before the election, the data that I was seeing showed that moreRepublican voters thought of themselves as Trump voters first andRepublicans second. But since the election that's changed. It's now a bitmore split. About half of Republicans I survey see themselves as Trumpsupporter's first but half see themselves as Republicans first.And I think there's a -- a middle ground among the party. You've got astrong base of supporters who think the president was wronged. He hasn'tdone anything inappropriate since the election. They think he's great. Andyou have about a quarter of Republicans who want Trump gone. They -- theythink it's time to turn the page. But about 46 percent or so of the partylands somewhere in the middle. They don't love his conduct since theelection, they think maybe it was stolen from him nonetheless, they thinkthat he was not necessarily responsible for the rally -- or rather for theinsurrection, but they -- they'd like the party to move on. They hold somesort of mix of views. And I think finding those folks who say, look, Ithink Trump did some good things but maybe can we do good things withoutTrump's style, without his rhetoric, without, as I think GovernorHutchinson called, the cult of personality. I think that's going to be theway that the Republican Party has to move forward because right now theycan't win with Trump but they can't win without Trump.WALLACE: Right.And -- and -- and 30 seconds, Juan, as somebody who leans to the left, isthis disarray on the right just catnip for you?WILLIAMS: No, I think this is very serious business. Picking up on whatKarl said, you see an American party in disarray and we need a second partyhere. We need the Republicans. But I think Mitch McConnell, Liz Cheney,they're not fringe people but they need to confront the radical wing of theRepublican Party.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, we'll discuss the reach of big tech with our "Power Player of theWeek," the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: It was an unenviable task, filling the shoes of legendary Applecofounder Steve Jobs. But this week's "Power Player" stepped in andexceeded all expectations. Now he's guiding the tech giant through a newera of scrutiny over how its tools can be used for good or ill.Here's our "Power Player of the Week."(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: It was one of the saddest moments of my life, seeingan attack on our Capitol, an attack on our democracy.WALLACE (voice over): Apple's CEO Tim Cook on the horror of watchingrioters breach the U.S. Capitol last week.COOK: I felt like I was in some sort of alternate reality, to be honestwith you. This could not be happening.WALLACE: In the aftermath, big tech companies scrambled to purge violentrhetoric. Twitter band President Trump, cutting off his favorite link tosupporters.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're dividing and divisiveand they're showing something that I've been predicting for a long time.I think big tech has made a terrible mistake and very, very bad for acountry.COOK: Big tech is not monolithic. You know, there are several companies,they do different things. For us, we're always trying to do the rightthing.WALLACE: Cook decided the right thing for Apple was to suspend theconservative leaning social media platform Parler from its app store due tosome users' violent posts.WALLACE (on camera): Isn't big tech restricting speech?COOK: We have an app store that has about 2 million apps in it and we haveterms of service for these apps.We, obviously, don't control what's on the Internet, but we've never viewedthat our platform should be a simple replication of the Internet.We have rules and regulations and we just ask that people abide by those.WALLACE: How did you decide to balance free speech with objectionablecontent?COOK: We looked at the incitement to violence that was on their and we --we don't consider that free speech and incitement to violence has anintersection.WALLACE: What about the argument that by taking Parler off Apple, inaddition to what other companies are doing, that you're just driving thesepeople, these views, further underground?COOK: Well, we've only suspended them, Chris. And so if -- if they gettheir moderation together, they would be back on there.WALLACE (voice over): Cook came on FOX NEWS SUNDAY this week to talk aboutApple's $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.COOK: So what this initiative is about is about opportunity and aboutgiving communities of color opportunity. And we could not be more excitedabout its potential.WALLACE (on camera): Is there something particular about race that puts itat the top of Apple's agenda right now?COOK: Last year with the murder of George Floyd, it brought an urgency tothis.We are thrilled to be able to sort of do our part here and -- and we hopethat more people will follow.WALLACE (voice over): As part of its initiative, Apple is helping launchthe Propel Center in Atlanta for historically black colleges anduniversities, offering programs in everything from artificial intelligenceto agriculture technologies and entertainment.COOK: We hope to make the Propel Center and innovation hub that serves allof the HBCUs, but becomes a source of information and a source ofinspiration for the entire footprint of HBCUs.WALLACE: Apple is also launching the developer academy in Detroit to teachcomputer coding.COOK: Coding is a -- is the most important second language you can learn.It's the only global language. And so we see the power of people learningto code and then designing apps and running their own businesses.WALLACE (on camera): How transformative do you think this initiative canbe?COOK: I think it can be extremely transformative. I think it can make a bigdifference in people's lives. And that's the reason we're so excited aboutit.WALLACE (voice over): Cook grew up in Alabama in the 1960s and '70s.WALLACE (on camera): Did you see racism?COOK: Of course. The systemic racism has been something that has beenacross our country for the length of time that we've been a country.WALLACE: Do you remember a first time when you thought to yourself, in yourdaily life, this is wrong?COOK: I remember periods of time, Chris, where whether you were in highschool or college or -- or beyond where you look around and there are onlywhite people around. And whether it's a college or a university or agraduate school, it doesn't feel right. And so -- and so you ask your --why is this? And I think it's the absence of opportunity. It goes back tothat. And so what we're trying to do with this program is give people theopportunity.WALLACE (voice over): Cook made the leap to Apple and the '90s, helping itturn profits when tech experts thought its best days were behind it.STEVE JOBS, FORMER CEO OF APPLE: Today, Apple is going to reinvent thephone.WALLACE: A decade later, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, reinventingpersonal communication and making Apple part of daily life.Cook took over when Jobs passed away from cancer.WALLACE (on camera): When you succeeded Steve Jobs back in 2011, howdaunting was that?COOK: My focus then was on mourning, was on mourning and leading thecompany through a very, very hard period of time. And so I wasn't reallythinking about how daunting it was.WALLACE (voice over): Under Cook's leadership, Apple reimagined the watch,the first entirely new product of his era. But he sees his role in broaderterms.WALLACE (on camera): What are you proudest of in steering Apple over thispast decade?COOK: I'm -- I'm proudest that we've kept his DNA at the core of thecompany. And that the company has stayed focused on innovation and makingreally great products that empower people and enrich their lives.WALLACE: What's next for Apple? What's next for Tim Cook?COOK: I love every day here. It's a privilege of a lifetime to -- to workwith the people I get to work with. I -- it's hard for me to envision mylife without Apple.What's next for Apple? We're going to continue making the best products inthe world. Not the most, but -- but the best.WALLACE: Does that include an Apple car?COOK: Well, I can't comment on -- on -- on rumors and so forth.WALLACE: Well, you can. You may choose not to, but you certainly -- you'rethe boss.COOK: You're right. I choose not to. Touche.WALLACE (voice over): Today, Apple is the world's most valuable company,but Cook says its continued success hinges on Apple's core values.COOK: We would like to use our platform to -- to help solve some of thecountry's biggest issues.
