Let's go "Off the Record." There is no more important or difficult decision for our leaders to make for our nation than matters of war.

BILL CLINTON: The decision to use force is never cost-free. Whenever American forces are placed in harm's way, we risk the loss of life.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

GEORGE W. BUSH: No president wants war. Everything you may have heard is that but it's just simply not true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });

President Obama is now asking Congress to authorize the use of force against ISIS. The decision is not easy. There are risks for our military, and no one can predict the future. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But what is not difficult is knowing the urgency of debating this decision, now, not later, not even next week. We have watched as ISIS has slaughtered thousands, beheaded innocents and even set them on fire. Now that the president has asked for the use of force, Congress needs to step up and begin immediate consideration. That means Congress should not turn off the lights, close up shop and even go home for the weekend.
Let me remind them, we are not dealing with naming a post office. We are dealing with the possibility of war. Congress owes it to our military, our nation and millions around the world looking to our nation not to delay even for one day. This is life or death. By the way, if our military can drop everything when it's urgent, our lawmakers can do the same. They need to start debating now and don't go home until you are finished. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
