JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Kennedy, Jesse Watters, Katie Pavlich, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
The bombshell college admissions cheating scandal, it's getting a whole lot worse after 50 people charged with rigging the system to get their kids into elite universities. Now accused ringleader William Singer saying he helped more than 750 families. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while Hollywood stars Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are getting the headlines, there are a lot more shocking examples of rich and powerful people allegedly involved in this awful scheme. Documents show the daughter of a finance CEO, quote, gloated with her proctor after cheating on the SAT's. The girl's family is accused of paying more than $400,000 to get her into Georgetown University.

WILLIAMS: A former Las Vegas casino executive allegedly wired $300,000 to Singer and is accused of dishing out $20,000 a month to a former USC athletic director. That athletic director allegedly took more than $1.3 million in bribes.
And today, the FBI has taken Loughlin into custody. The actress expected to appear in court at this hour in Los Angeles. Some people having a little fun pointing to this Full House episode from 25 years ago. Apparently, Aunt Becky foreshadowed the entire scam.

WILLIAMS: You know, Kennedy, you have a young daughter who's an athlete and I wonder how you react to this. I mean, what do you think?
KENNEDY: Oh, I look at this and I say, you know what, sweetheart, stop working so hard in gymnastics and at school. Don't worry about it. You know, if everything falls apart I will buy your way into an Ivy League university. Your path is paved with gold.
It's really infuriating because this story is obviously -- it's not about the students. It's not about the kids. It's about the parents and the parents using this as a status symbol for themselves, because obviously, they're so desperate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And if they really wanted to get their kids into good schools, why weren't they working from the time they were in middle school or early on in high school with tutors and academic prep systems and, you know, the various ways there are to legitimately help your kids' grades that, you know, oftentimes involve work.
WILLIAMS: Yeah.
KENNEDY: And so, you know, and the motivation here, it's not just about the status. It also speaks to their guilt.

KENNEDY: That's on you, mom and dad.
WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, we have 50 people charged at this point, 33 parents, 9 coaches. Some people were test administrators. The most outrageous case I saw was where somebody got a psychiatrist to say their daughter had some learning problems so she could have extra time taking the SAT. I'm thinking, what is going on?

JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Some people need extra time, Juan.
WILLIAMS: I don't think this kid needed it. The idea was she -- it would allow her to have a higher score.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: I never had any extra time, but I scored very well. You'd be surprised. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: You'd be very surprise. But I want to talk about Hollywood because Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy are all over the internet castigating Donald Trump. William H. Macy whose, you know, not charged but who's in on the scheme, said that he doesn't like Trump because he doesn't have any character and lying is the thing that bothers him the most, and Felicity Huffman saying the same thing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I'm sick and tired of being lectured by these hypocritical Hollywood liberals. Look at what they did. They're defrauding universities and bribing people. Their friends are slashing Donald Trump's throat. Their limousines and their jets are smogging up L.A. They're perpetrating rape hoaxes, racial hoaxes, and there's literally dead prostitutes pilling up in the apartments of Democrat donors in West Hollywood. That's Ed Buck. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And they have the nerve to turn around and point their fingers at conservative America and say, you guys are bad people. We're the good people. Meanwhile, everything that they say that they believe in, they say they believe in affirmative action, they believe in, you know, minority ownership. They're the ones that took away scholarships from well- qualified minorities. They said that they believe in the rich paying more. They scammed this thing so they'd pay the charity so they could deduct it away from their income.
So I don't want to hear any more about income inequality or white privilege or any of this stuff anywhere, because they use all that stuff to leverage the scam to help out their own kid because they didn't value education enough to make this kid study and to make this kid value education.
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: That might have to be the most Fox Newsiam response I've ever heard. And you've covered -- I'm serious --

GUTFELD: Enough of that but maybe so. Harvard isn't so Harvard any more. Harvard is like that Instagram model that you find out was just pure photo retouching. Apparently, it's not about how smart you are. It's about how much money your parents have. So anybody who's rich can get into Harvard. So Harvard really isn't that great of a school.

The other thing too is when you talk to people about college, and I -- I say that college is overrated and you should skip it. They always say you go to college for the experience, so how about applying for the experience. Someone should create something called the experience.

KENNEDY: All right. But we're talking about this scam and, you know, there're plenty of people who will point out that your life isn't necessary better or more worthwhile because you've had four years of college in late adolescence. That doesn't necessarily put you on a fast track to success. It doesn't necessarily put your rod, clay pot into the kiln and you emerge a beautiful vase.

That is held by people who have degrees that are worth nothing because they've been sold the experience of college and not understood that you go to college to get a skill set that you can use to then go get a job. But I feel terribly for the middle class parents who work their entire lives to save money to send their kids to a good school. Send them to SAT camp to prep for these exams so that they can do it themselves.
They don't qualify for federal aid. They're kids might not qualify for scholarships because they're in the middle bracket of income, and they're the ones who really get screwed by this kind of stuff. And they work really hard to get their kids into college. The other thing though --

PAVLICH: Can I say this real quickly, Juan, to answer your question. I was going to bring this up. I think this has exposed a lot of the athletic departments at these universities because the standard for academia is clearly yet less because they were using the athletic system to get students who have less -- higher GPA into the program, and then lying about their athletic skill, which proves as a different lower standard for athletes at these schools than there is for academics --
KENNEDY: There's also a shocking number of athletes, female athletes who are awarded scholarships by force, and that's the title nine has done. They force certain sports to give away a certain number of scholarships, and sometimes there aren't that numbers of athletes to fill those roles on teams throughout the country. And I hope there is more research done in that area because then men's sports end up getting cut in order to come to equilibrium.

WATTERS: This is a Fox New alert. President Trump grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 airplanes in the U.S. until more information is gathered about what cause the Ethiopian Air disaster. The president announcing the emergency order earlier.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9. Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded. Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully they'll very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded.

        }
      
WATTERS: The FAA also saying that enhanced satellite imagery and new evidence found at the scene of the Ethiopian air crash led to the decision, Greg. Obviously, something changed between yesterday and today. We don't know what it was.
GUTFELD: Well, I was thinking about that, that maybe, you know, he knew that if anything did happen in the United States, he would take the blame for it. But then, again, I remembered he tweeted about this almost immediately, so this was something that was clearly -- whether it's instinctually he knows that there's something going on or maybe he actually look and had known -- knows more about flying than we do. I don't know.
Obviously, better safe than sorry, probably the most obvious thing to say. But my feeling is that -- it's probably human error but not a human's fault, meaning that technology is ahead of our own human behavior and we see that with texting, causing accidents and death, social media leading to mob. Automation, I mean, we look at people terrified of, you know, self- driving cars. And we're seeing little accidents. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think we are -- because technology outpaces us, we're not fully trained to deal with it. And I would say that that -- that's why I say it might be human error but not human fault. The pilots might not just be ready to deal with that kind of technology.
WILLIAMS: But part of that problem is -- according to the pilots is that they're not being well trained. That's not the explanation, the instruction book coming from Boeing is insufficient to the task and creating problems.
GUTFELD: You know what it's like? It's like imagine when you get the copier at the office and all you know how to do is this and they give you - - here's how to fix it. You know, you need an I.T. person for your computer. The plane needs an I.T. person.
WILLIAMS: But yesterday, Dennis Muilenburg who's the head of Boeing, called president to ask him not to do this. And I think the idea was that, gee, a lot of these other countries that are pulling back have competing airlines manufacturers.
But now the president seems to think there's a greater threat to the public. So you get -- I just see here, United Airline is grounding 14 planes, Southwest, 34, and people are being rebooked. They have to get home somewhere -- some other way.
WATTERS: So now that they've taken this action, Kennedy, do you feel more safe or less safe flying?
KENNEDY: I actually felt fine flying on the 737 Max 8 or 9 because it's had so many successful flights. And if you do the math, like 250,000 to two, that's still a pretty good ratio. And if for some reason you go down in a ball of flames in the third one, you're pretty legendary. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
KENNEDY: I like my odds here, but I understand this. But also, I do think there's got to be some correlation between the two flights in Indonesia and Ethiopia. And also, like the richest conspiracy theories bubble out of planes and government.
So whenever you fear that the government is hiding something that have to do with aviation, that's when people's imagination -- the collective imagination really gets going. So I can't wait to read what people think is really happening.
PAVLICH: The good news is that they were able to recover the black boxes which will give them a ton of information. Flying is still the most -- it's the safest way to get around the world, around the country, much safer than driving in your car, that's for sure. But there are reports of U.S. pilots complaining and reporting problems with this plane. They're similar to what happened with these flights that went down.
Now, you have to ask the question about standards of training. Are the pilots in the United States getting the same training on Boeing as the pilots overseas, and that might not be the case. There could be different standards of training that are not being upheld. So we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
But I will say, you know, to give President Trump some credit, everyone is like, oh, what does he know about planes. The guy has owned planes his entire life. And, you know, when you own a private plane, you know about the way it functions. So, I think --

KENNEDY: It was kind of get off my lawn when he was like older and simpler is better.
(LAUGHTER)
KENNEDY: Don't think it's all broken.
WATTERS: Right, he like walls and he likes very simple-to-fly planes.
GUTFELD: I own a lot of things and I don't know how any of it works. So I think this has lots to do with like -- human beings catching up to the things that they operate because -- I mean, this is going to happen to a lot of things. A lot of things -- especially when we get self-driving cars, which is going to reduce deaths, it's going to reduce death by 95 percent.
But we're going to get freaked out. We're going to get freak out every time there's an accident. And we have to understand that this -- the alternative of human error is far worse.

PAVLICH: And Pelosi's problems could be getting a whole lot worst with President Trump, and the GOP now using her words against her. Trump tweeting that he greatly appreciates Pelosi's statements against impeachment, and that he never did anything wrong.
So, Juan, Nancy Pelosi was brought in as the Speaker again because everyone said she could keep everyone in line. The big question was whether she would be able to. Is she doing a good job?
WILLIAMS: I think quite excellent. Last week it was on the bigotry issue and whether or she could hold the caucus together and she did. And now on this one I think you look at Steny Hoyer who's her number two, he supports here. Jim Clyburn the number three supports her. Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's head of the DNC, she supports her.
You look at the polling, Quinnipiac, 59 percent opposed beginning impeachment this time, 35 percent in favor. So I think she has the general support. But what you're pointing out rightly is that there's some people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez where she to leave. Ilhan Omar on the far left, who are still locked in to let's impeach this guy. I say this guy to be polite, right now.
PAVLICH: OK.
WILLIAMS: You know what she said? I mean --
PAVLICH: At least you're not saying he's not a human. Kennedy?
KENNEDY: No, that was lovely Ilhan Omar.
PAVLICH: Yes.
KENNEDY: It's just a fountain of beauty.
PAVLICH: That's a nice person.
KENNEDY: Springs from her lips. No, it's interesting because, obviously, Nancy Pelosi isn't afraid to get her caucus in line in lockstep, and sometimes Republicans have a harder time doing that. I don't think the last two Speakers of the House Republicans were that strong or effective. And if they were, we would have a solution to Obamacare which we still don't. And that's part of the reason that you've got this, sort of, on- going ultra-leftist crisis.
And Steny Hoyer is also not afraid to tell these three freshmen congresswomen, you know, there are more people -- more freshmen members of the Democratic caucus than just you. There're 62 members and, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her justice Democrats who possibly had money funneled from a Super Pac to an LLC, she has been threatening to primary any Democrats who vote with Republicans. And I think Steny Hoyer is like, oh, you want to primary me? I'll primary you right back.
PAVLICH: But, Jesse, Nancy Pelosi is saying now that they're not going for impeachment. But it's not just the triple freshmen that are causing problems. Let's listen to Adam Schiff what he had to say about the Mueller report and impeachment.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: If there's insufficient evidence in the Mueller report and we're not able to produce sufficient evidence in our own investigation that ends the inquiry. There may be grounds for remove from office or there may be grounds for indictment after he leaves office that the Congress discovers.
One of the issues that we're looking at, which the Mueller report may not cover, is whether the Russians were laundering money through the Trump organization. Our predominant concern in my committee is -- was this President -- is this president compromised by a foreign power.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PAVLICH: So doesn't this just proves that the reason they wanted to protect Robert Mueller so greatly was not because they're interested in Russian meddling in the election and democracy, is that they wanted evidence to use against President Trump to impeach him.
WATTERS: Right. And they might not get it, so we'll have to look what they have. I heard it's Friday, did you hear that? I've heard they're coming with the Mueller report --
(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: I heard it was in five minutes.
WATTERS: That's true.
PAVLICH: Five minutes ago.
WATTERS: Pelosi saying we can't do premature impeachment people because it could risk those swing district Democrats and it's going to jeopardize her House majority. What she's saying is why don't we do the blizzard of subpoenas and the hearings and embarrass this president, and use that as a sledgehammer against him to drive his poll numbers down and try to separate Republican support from him. That might be more tactful and more fruitful. She does have to worry about the Kavanaugh bounce, though.
PAVLICH: Yeah.
WATTERS: Remember when people convicted Kavanaugh before they gave him due process. That's what a lot of the Democrats like AOC and Omar and Tlaib had done. They know he's guilty, there's just looking for the evidence.
PAVLICH: Right.
WATTERS: And Republicans and independents, they get their backs up against the wall when they feel like people have been denied due process. And if that happens with this president, there's going to be people on the streets. Lastly, and Greg mentioned this, the media has caused this fever.
PAVLICH: Right.
WATTERS: They've said for two years this guy is a Russian asset and he's a traitor and that's now bubbling up in their mind. So this new crops coming in and they're going to impeach no matter what and it's going to cause a huge split in the Democratic Party. I don't think Pelosi can contain it.
PAVLICH: Greg wisdom on Pelosi.
GUTFELD: Oh, I actually give her credit. I like what she said about Donald Trump. She said, "You know what, he's just not worth it". That's exactly what a close friend says to another friend after she was dumped by somebody who clearly was worth it. I'm talking about you Sharon 1992.
Anyway, again, it reveals how little we need these people to actually work. They don't - what do they do all day but posture about investigations and impeachment. And I there has to be - is it possible for the President to do an Executive Order that makes the House and Senate part-time work.
Like, we're going to slash to the 20 hours per week, build some barracks where people can come and sleep when they want to, so you'd have to pay the rent. Just make it so that they have another job at home to make a living.
PAVLICH: Yes.
GUTFELD: Because, right now clearly, they have a lot of time on their hands. And by the way, this is all - I think this is all about the Mueller report, I think that she knows.
WILLIAMS: Right.
GUTFELD: She's like--
PAVLICH: I think that's a good point.
GUTFELD: --she's like my childhood pet that could tell when an earthquake was coming in California and she's going this is a 2.1, it's not a 9.3.
WILLIAMS: But your argument seems to make the case that, she should wait, right?
GUTFELD: Wait for what?
WILLIAMS: Wait for the Mueller report, sure.
PAVLICH: Like, whatever they're going to find--
KENNEDY: I think she's read it. I think she got that Amazon sneak peak for Prime members.
WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't know.
PAVLICH: She knows it's not going to show anything worth it.
WILLIAMS: I don't know.
GUTFELD: Impeachment is like eating while driving, it's going to take your eyes off the road.
WILLIAMS: But she's--
KENNEDY: OK. If there were a bombshell - let's do reduction. If there were a bombshell in this report and there was indictable, impeachable information that was going to bring down the presidency, and Nancy Pelosi got a whiff of it downwind like some bad cheese, do you really think she'd be lowering expectations? Absolutely not. She would sound like Al Green.
PAVLICH: Yes.
WILLIAMS: I don't know I think she's right to say let's look at infrastructure, clean air, clean food--
PAVLICH: Well, yes, that's what they were elected --
WILLIAMS: --let's do the business of the people.
GUTFELD: I hate clean food.
PAVLICH: The dirtiest food. OK.
GUTFELD: I want dirty food.
PAVLICH: We have to go. President Trump "The View" pushing an outrageous conspiracy theory about the first lady, you'll see it up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KENNEDY: I'm quite embarrassed. I was dancing celebratorily and that's not OK. "The View" under fire for fueling this ridiculous conspiracy theory about the first lady. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I wasn't going to go along with this, but that one, in that picture, doesn't look like her.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know you weren't going to go now, you will.
BEHAR: No, it's a different shaped face.
SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I'm ashamed to say. I spent like an hour on Saturday involved in this.
BEHAR: That's her.
HOSTIN: Melania is not a very tall statuesque woman and the one that we saw - the first one that we showed, she looks kind of short. Not this one, but that one, look how short she looks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KENNEDY: Oh, could be in flats. Her husband's like 6'7" and a staple genius. President Trump slamming those body double rumors by tweeting "The fake news photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places. They are only getting more deranged with time".
A spokeswoman for the first lady is blasting the show as shameful. So Jesse let's say it's true. Let's say it is a fake Melania, wouldn't you love to have a fake Jesse, take your place?
WATTERS: Why--
KENNEDY: Maybe one day a week.
PAVLICH: He is here right now.
WATTERS: No, I mean, I hate to say this. I kind of do agree with Joy. Can we put the screen back up there? I mean - put the screen back up. There is something very suspicious. You know that's Melania. If you look at the mouth, there's a difference in the mouth and there's a little bit of - hear me out on this. There's a little bit of a height difference - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. No.
PAVLICH: Thank goodness.
WATTERS: And the thing is--
PAVLICH: Is that Caitlyn Jenner with the President?
WATTERS: No, I think what it is that, Melania - you don't need a body double if you're Melania. If you're if you're a model, there's no such thing as a body double for a model, it's just called another model.
I mean, if there was an actual body double for Melania, should be much more famous and have a much better job than being a body double for Melania.
KENNEDY: It really is--
WATTERS: Remember the other conspiracies? Where you remember that Trump was going to hand the reins over to Pence and the Trump is a puppet of Putin or that it wasn't his real hair, do you remember that one?
GUTFELD: And the one in which Trump was from Kenya?
WILLIAMS: You beat him to the punch.
WATTERS: I knew - I wanted to take that joke from you.
WILLIAMS: You just did I'm done, I'm done.
KENNEDY: There was also a rumor that he and Hillary were having a dalliance during the 2016 campaign.
WATTERS: Oh, did Bill know?
KENNEDY: Of course, he knew.
PAVLICH: Because Bill was doing his own thing, which was actually true.
WATTERS: That is true, not fake.
KENNEDY: OK. So - but Katie, what is the subtext here that the first lady has pieced out and that she actually is on permanent Safari, so that she can't stand being around the President, because he's so horrible and for that he should be impeached.
PAVLICH: It's just really stupid. I mean, she can't catch a break. Right? So if she wasn't doing all these initiatives, she's doing on her own, as her own person, building her own thing. They would - she'd be accused of just being a separate wife, right? And just doing whatever a President Trump wanted her to do, because she doesn't have a brain and can't function on her own.
She goes out on her own and proves that she's her own person. She's done all these trips. She's gone overseas. She's capable of talking and speaking and pushing the things that she wants to talk about, and then they still criticize her.
So I think it's just petty. There are other things that they could be talking about. And I find it really interesting that the women who are always saying, "You know the women who don't help women are going to hell", decided to engage in this kind of behavior.
KENNEDY: Juan, isn't Katie right? Leave her alone.
WILLIAMS: Yes. So tell that to President Trump, he's the one tweeting out about this and raising it. It seems to me, he's delight in the idea that he is somehow--
KENNEDY: Well, he is defending his wife. Wouldn't you do the same?
WILLIAMS: What? He's defending his wife.
PAVLICH: Certainly he is.
WILLIAMS: This is not - he is defending himself against the charge that he has a double for his wife, because as you suggest, maybe the wife doesn't want to be there--
PAVLICH: But it's an insult to her.
WILLIAMS: I don't see it's an insult--
PAVLICH: An insult to their marriage.
WILLIAMS: To me this is like, kind of conspiracy theory, wackiness and I don't know - it's a distraction from the reality. Let's say how about the boat in which Republicans will say, "Hey you know what, that's - that wall, that emergency, bogus".
KENNEDY: Greg? OK.
GUTFELD: I was actually - what bugged me where people were making jokes about the picture. Different jokes about how humorless and unfun they look together, without pointing out that they were actually at a really somber event. They were - over - of a natural disaster.
But I have to - you have to be fair, conspiracies are bad on both sides. And when you become a team sport political player, you get into this little prison of two ideas and so your immunity to conspiracies goes away, because you want to believe. So right now what you're seeing is a lowered immunity among "The View", because they hate this guy so much that this has to be an impostor.
But likewise, we have had our share of these kinds of conspiracies, because we had such deep dislike for the other side.
WATTERS: But we never did see the President's transcript, remember?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: And how did he get from Occidental College--
GUTFELD: --that his real name, I don't know.
KENNEDY: What if --
PAVLICH: --that he doesn't think the birth certificate is real.
WATTERS: The long form?
KENNEDY: What if President Obama releases his grades as an olive branch to the President to releases his tax returns, would you accept that?
WATTERS: Not a fair deal. I'm not going to take it.
PAVLICH: Why?
KENNEDY: So what about--
WATTERS: I think we're going to be able to find the transcripts without having to give the tax returns.
KENNEDY: OK. The last question, what happens to Melania? What happen with Melania, did he lock her up?
WATTERS: Did he lock her--
WILLIAMS: Lock her up.
WATTERS: --is that a body double? No, not a body double.
KENNEDY: It's not a body--
WILLIAMS: Wow, this is where the conversation goes in times when people want to ignore real news, I tell you.
KENNEDY: Oh, Juan Williams is just the sage. Juan is the loneliest member and "Wild Card Wednesday" is next, stay put.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: It's like a game show from 1973. All right it's "Wild Card Wednesday". Since Dana is off today, I'm doing the honors. Let's get to our topic. What you do here Katie is spin it like that - isn't that fun. And then you open up this little patch here. What's in here?
Let's see, the first, Study finds that early birds make more money and sleep better than night owls. This is a head of the "World Sleep Day". Who pitches stories about sleep?
WILLIAMS: Me. So here--
GUTFELD: You. What's going on there?
WILLIAMS: So here it, so take a look at this Greg. It says that early birds sleep seven hours a night.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Average $4,000 more income, more likely to talk and move around in their sleep. But they wake up at 6:15 a.m., seems very early. Now compare this to your night owls. Night owls, six hours less of sleep. You know about the lower income. More likely to prefer sleeping with pets - oh, my gosh.
But here's the crazy part. Go to bed at almost 3 o'clock in the morning - that's beyond a night owl.
PAVLICH: A lot.
GUTFELD: But you know what, the reason why they make less than early birds, because they're having a great time. They are up till 3 a.m. boozing it up, meeting people, hooking up. Who cares if they're making less money? Life is short.
PAVLICH: They're not living to make a living. There living to have life, right?
WATTERS: Right.
PAVLICH: OK, working to have life.
KENNEDY: Living on living.
PAVLICH: Living on living.
GUTFELD: Lords of the new church.
KENNEDY: Oh, well said, Greg.
(Crosstalk)
GUTFELD: Jesse, any thoughts about. Are you an early bird?
WATTERS: I'm like burning the candle at both ends, Gutfeld. I was up till midnight last night and then I was up at 6:30.
GUTFELD: Wow, that's amazing.
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: You walked home, did you?
PAVLICH: Responsibly yes.
GUTFELD: All right.
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: Airplane - great story - turns back for mother who forgot her baby in the boarding area. Whose story?
PAVLICH: Mine.
GUTFELD: Yes, why did you pick this one?
PAVLICH: Because that's crazy. And if you're on the flight, "You're like really lady? We're taken off, we're going over the ocean, and we have to turn back to, you left your kid - your baby waiting?"
GUTFELD: Imagine how bad all the passengers are, because I think they were there mid - it's a nine-hour flight.
PAVLICH: That is. Then she goes.
GUTFELD: How do you forget your baby?
KENNEDY: OK. I will tell you how you forget your baby, especially when you are flying. Because when you're flying and you've got a new baby, and especially if it's your first baby, you are so worried about keeping the baby quiet.
GUTFELD: Right
KENNEDY: See there is so stuff and so many toys and so much anxiety.
GUTFELD: Yes.
KENNEDY: And when babies are sleeping, you tend to focus on some of the other things, you have baby brain. So if you are nursing and you are sleep- deprived, it is very easy, so --
GUTFELD: You just forget about the baby.
KENNEDY: My friend Amanda, when she had her first baby, she would always check the top of her car with the baby bucket, because she was so worried that she was going to put the baby on top of the car and forget to buckle her inside.
WATTERS: That's a smart mom - you are Amanda, aren't you?
(Crosstalk)
KENNEDY: No, but one time was wearing my newborn in a sling and I saw the baby bucket was empty and I was - "Oh, my god, where is the baby?" And all the people in the bus were like you are horrible. And then I realized she was sleeping in the sling.
WATTERS: OK. Well, that's better than airplane.
GUTFELD: I'm like that was my car keys or any - my house keys, it's like I'm running around and they're - my glasses.
WILLIAMS: Yes, I can believe. I can see--
GUTFELD: You should simply not have children.
WILLIAMS: I can see that they tell the pilot turn around I left my car keys.
GUTFELD: I would definitely. All right.
KENNEDY: Everything was OK in the end.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's good. They grounded all the planes. All right. Oh, this is mine. Meet "Tengai", the job interview robot, who won't judge you? Do we have a picture of this? There it is. OK. Is that it? Is that the robot? There it is.
PAVLICH: --Ilhan Omar was there--
GUTFELD: Yes, that's the robot right here. And the reason why they are doing is - its Furhat Robotics - is to carry out unbiased job interviews. And I like this, because every one of us has had a job interview go bad because of a personality conflict. Have you ever - this has ever happened to you, and you realize that--
KENNEDY: No, never.
WATTERS: --it's like you are having a personality conflict with someone.
GUTFELD: Do you know I had a job interview - this was for Muscle & Fitness in the 90s and I walked in to situation with the Editor-in-Chief and there was another person there who I'd met at a party. And she was there specifically to bring up what happened at the party.
WATTERS: What happened at the party?
GUTFELD: Let's just say we drank a lot, had a lot of fun. But anyway, that was an interesting - a side note. Do you think it's a good idea, anybody?
WATTERS: Well, I mean, what can they say - what can they see what you look like? I want them to judge me for physical appearance.
GUTFELD: You think they--
WATTERS: Can they see the level of my hair, how I'm tall.
GUTFELD: Jesse, if you stop judging on shallow stuff, Jesse loses, is what he's--
WATTERS: --want it on substance.
PAVLICH: Nobody wants the judging to happen.
GUTFELD: All right one more quick.
PAVLICH: --just not mentally.
GUTFELD: Yes. I think it's a great idea. I think all robots should judge everything, including judges. OK. Last one. Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos how do you rank these essential chips.
WATTERS: Well, this one is mine, obviously.
GUTFELD: Yes, tell me about it.
WATTERS: All right. I don't know anything about it. I just wanted to eat. So what do you guys think?
GUTFELD: You want me to read why you--
WATTERS: You can read - eat--
GUTFELD: This is a Kevin Frederick's posted video on Twitter about debating which chips we're best - and when you get the giant box. This is a good actual debate.
WATTERS: That's like thing you put on your kids like lunch pail or something.
GUTFELD: Or you just buy for yourself and eat it.
WATTERS: Right, right, right. So what were the - what did people decide was the top one?
GUTFELD: They didn't rank. This is not - nobody gave me what was ranks.
WATTERS: There's no rankings?
GUTFELD: There's no ranking.
PAVLICH: On this on this tray, what would you rank first, Jesse?
WATTERS: I could go Cheetos.
PAVLICH: I go Ranch Doritos--
WATTERS: And then Doritos. You go Ranch Doritos?
GUTFELD: Cheetos are you kidding?
PAVLICH: And then barbeque.
GUTFELD: Cheetos isn't a chip.
WATTERS: But it's the worst for you, but it's the taste the best.
GUTFELD: Yes, but it's not a chip. You know what--
PAVLICH: It's a party in your mouth.
WATTERS: --are you bouncing these?
WILLIAMS: Hey, hey, hey --
GUTFELD: I had to--
WILLIAMS: You know what--
GUTFELD: Ranch Doritos are--
WILLIAMS: They are pretty good. But you're not - I don't know they've got more preservatives and artificial flavors. My kids call this the toes - the Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos--
WATTERS: Greg, have a chow, you can do it.
GUTFELD: All right. In the break. One more thing is up next, never Frito.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Time for one more thing. I'm going to kick it off. We're in the middle of this college cheating scandal, so how about taking a moment for someone who did it right. Take a look at high school senior Michael Love of Detroit.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL LOVE. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: I got told a lot when I was younger I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that, So I just wanted to show people I'm better than what they think I am.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: He got into nearly 50 colleges because he is in the National Honor Society. He did make the varsity basketball team and he does hold an after-school job. As a result $300,000 in scholarship money and the offer of a full ride from one school. Here's his mom Micole.
MICOLE, MOTHER OF MICHAEL LOVE: Every time I open up a letter, I jumped up and down we prayed that and everything. I'm super proud of him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Congratulations to Michael, not only for getting in, but for earning it the old-fashioned way. Way to go.
WATTERS: That's how you do it.
WILLIAMS: All right, Greg.
GUTFELD: Just 50. Call me when he gets 75. All right. Fox Nation, if you just subscribe my interview with the great Victor Davis Hanson is up. We discuss d his new book "The case for Trump". Obviously he's a great writer, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Also my podcast is up with Bill Pulte who's the founder of the nonprofit Blight Authority. We discussed the goal of eliminating Detroit's urban decay. It's great podcast. And now it's time for great Fox News. I got some great Fox News, are you excited?
PAVLICH: Yes.
GUTFELD: A fox was killed by a group of killer chickens that ganged up on the intruder in Northeast France after it's snuck into the henhouse.
WATTERS: That was a French fox. It was the French fox, no wonder.
GUTFELD: Yes. I just had a bunch of chickens attack attacking a fox, kind of fitting for this week?
WATTERS: Payback.
WILLIAMS: Yes, how about that Jesse, you are up.
WATTERS: All right. You know one of the dumbest things you could do? Think about it. What is one of the dumbest things you could do? Don't say it. A bunch of guys tried to rob a gun store. Look what happened here in Tennessee.
So these guys just congregating around - snatch a bunch of guns, run out. Well, everybody in the gun store is armed. They chase them outside and they try to make it to the vehicle. And everybody just draws on the vehicle and they can't even pull out of the parking lot. And now they're all charged with theft and probably going to spend some time in jail.
WILLIAMS: Wow that was unbelievable. All right, Katie you are up.
PAVLICH: All right. So today is National K9 Veterans Day, which is a day that set aside to honor the brave dogs who serve side-by-side with our troops overseas and at home. The earliest record of canines being used in combat was in 600 BC. But the United States adopted the practice in 1942 with the War Dog Program, which is awesome, and modern war dogs are trained to sniff out bombs drugs and to track people and attack when necessary. So happy Veterans Day to our canine friends.
WILLIAMS: Way to go Katie. Kennedy take us home.
KENNEDY: All right. This is a great story, because you've heard about the measles outbreak at LAX and all sorts of families were having problems, because children are not inoculated and they're getting horrible diseases.
Well, a pair of teens in Pennsylvania went and bought their mom an ice cream cake - a DQ Dairy Queen and that had thanks for vaccinating us mom. They had gone up to pick up their vaccination records from the doctor and realized that their mom had been responsible for years and years - they are anti-vaxxers and they're showing mom how sweet it is to be a responsible parent. So they don't get that horrific measles.
WATTERS: That mom probably did not leave the kids at the airport either.
WILLIAMS: No.
WATTERS: Definitely remembered to put them on the plane.
KENNEDY: Sorry for my bad joke earlier.
WATTERS: But I think by the way this is an outrage that parents - we have an outbreak of measles because people are irresponsible, crazy. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of “The Five.” "Special Report," up next.
