BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi Jesse, thank you. Good evening.Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, several major stories increasing scrutiny on a Democraticcongressman from California who had a relationship with a woman nowsuspected of being a Chinese spy. President-elect Joe Biden running intoconsiderable resistance on some of his cabinet selections, we'll tell youwho and why.But we begin with breaking news with Biden's son Hunter under investigationby the U.S. Attorney in Delaware for "tax issues", an investigation thathas been ongoing since 2018. And we are learning new information just inthe past few minutes. Correspondent Peter Doocy is in Wilmington, Delawarewith the very, very latest. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. And the brand new information just a few minutes old is a wellgovernment -- a well-placed government sources telling Fox News that JoeBiden is not the subject of any grand jury investigation right now. Butthat Hunter Biden is a subject/target of a grand jury investigation.Target meaning in this way that somebody is -- that there's a highlikelihood that somebody committed a crime, a subject being somebody thatlaw enforcement just does not know yet. Hunter Biden told us late thisafternoon that he found out yesterday the feds are investigating him butthat is not when this probe started. They had been looking into his taxaffairs since 2008.Biden -- Joe Biden his dad, the president-elect has long dismissedquestions that have arose -- that have arisen about Hunter Biden as a smearcampaign and he has always stood by his side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm proud of them.DOOCY (voice over): And he claims not to know much about his son's affairs.DOOCY: How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseasbusiness dealings?BIDEN: I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business.DOOCY: In his announcement that he's under investigation over his taxes,Hunter Biden says, I take this matter very seriously. But I'm confidentthat a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstratethat I handled my affairs legally and appropriately including with thebenefit of professional tax advisers.There's also turbulence ahead for four of Biden's cabinet selections,including Lloyd Austin.BIDEN: This is not a post he sought, but I sought him.DOOCY: The president-elect pick to run the Pentagon is trying to make avery important distinction.GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN (RET.), DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: When I concluded mymilitary service four years ago, I hung up my uniform for the last time andwent from being General Lloyd Austin to Lloyd Austin.DOOCY: The vice president-elect still called him:SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:General Lloyd Austin. General Austin, General Austin, General Austin.DOOCY: That's what the transition is trying to avoid because DefenseSecretaries must have been civilians for seven years.BIDEN: I believe in the importance of civilian control of the military.DOOCY: Austin's been out four years and needs a waiver from Congress toserve and Democrats are wary.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will support General Austin but I will not supportthe waiver.DOOCY: Two other Cabinet nominees are facing questions about acontroversial commutation, former U.S. attorney and DHS pick AlejandroMayorkas.ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, DHS SECRETARY NOMINEE: It is the honor of a lifetime.DOOCY: And former congressman and HHS nominee, Xavier Becerra.XAVIER BECERRA, HHS SECRETARY NOMINEE: I am honored and excited to joinyour team.DOOCY: Both urged the Clinton White House to commute the sentence of acocaine trafficker with a politically involved father and Clinton did. Adistrict judge involved tells the Washington Post it was outrageous.Then, there are questions about Biden's pick to run HUD Marcia Fudge andher connection to Lance Mason who murdered his wife. Before that, Mason didtime on a domestic abuse charge and had Fudge advocating for him from theoutside. In a letter to a judge that said in part, I can only hope that yousee in Lance what I and others see.PETE BUTTIEGIEG, AMBASSADOR TO CHINA CANDIDATE: A strategic competitor likeChinaBiden likes a former mayor as U.S. ambassador to China Pete Buttiegiegaccording to a report in Axios. Less than a year after Biden publiclyquestioned Buttiegieg's foreign policy jobs.BIDEN: This guy's not a Barack Obama. Barack Obama had been a United Statessenator of a really large state. Barack Obama had laid out a clear visionwhat he thought the international society should look like and what theorder should be.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): I just spoke to somebody at the Justice Department whoexplained that it is their policy not to select timing of investigativesteps or of charges in a way that could affect an election or give onecandidate or another an advantage or a disadvantage. That is likely why theU.S. Attorney's office in Delaware waited until now to signal to HunterBiden that they are investigating him, Bret.BAIER: Do we have any information, details about the tax allegations,whether it's tax fraud or what particularly they're looking at in the grandjury?DOOCY: We don't yet and as you remember, throughout the course of thecampaign, President Trump and his allies really focused heavily on HunterBiden's involvement with a Ukrainian energy company Burisma that paid him ahefty salary for several months despite his lack of experience in theenergy industry.There have also been questions about Hunter Biden's connection to a Chineseenergy company. He did a magazine interview last year where he talks abouta Chinese businessman who gave him a diamond. There were conflicts or therewere questions about how much the diamond actually cost and whether taxeswere paid properly.We don't know if these things that we already know about are involved inthese charges or if it is something else or sorry, not charges in itsinvestigation or if it's something else, Bret.BAIER: OK, Peter, thank you for the clarification as well. Panel coming upon this too.Now, to a story with all the salacious elements power, sex, internationalintrigue, California Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell insists he hasdone nothing wrong. And he's cooperating with authorities about hisrelationship with a woman accused of being a Chinese spy. Chiefcongressional correspondent Mike Emanuel has details tonight on this. Goodevening, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Bret, good evening, a major critic of President Trump duringimpeachment is now under intense scrutiny after revelations he had closeties with an alleged Chinese spy before being elected and even after toCongress.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): I was shocked. You know, just over six yearsago, I was told about this individual.EMANUEL (voice over): Yet, Fox News has learned today Congressman EricSwalwell's father and brother are still Facebook friends with an allegedChinese spy. Axios was first to report Swalwell as part of a group ofNorthern California Democrats targeted by a Chinese national named FangFang or Christine Fang.She's suspected of being an operative for China's Ministry of StateSecurity. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany says it was neverRussia and the Republicans, it was the Democrats and China. Swalwellsuggests this leaking out is payback.SWALWELL: This is a country where people who criticize the president aregoing to have law enforcement information weaponized against them. Andthat's not a country that any of us want to live in.EMANUEL: Swalwell insists he cooperated fully and did nothing wrong.SWALWELL: I'm grateful that our FBI back in 2015 reached out to me. Theyshowed great professionalism in seeking to learn.EMANUEL: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham noted a doublestandard on Twitter. Democrats get defensive briefings when there areconcerns about foreign influence, but when it came to President real DonaldTrump, they used a counterintelligence investigation to spy on hiscampaign.After this revelation, leading House Republicans say Swalwell should havenever been put on the Intelligence Committee.REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): It looks like Representative Swalwell wasidentified, cultivated and potentially funded by Chinese communist spy andthat this happened before he came to Congress once he got to Congress.There are real questions about whether or not Speaker Pelosi knew this whenshe put him on the House Intel Committee.EMANUEL: Swalwell says House leadership was aware of this issue and stillassigned him to Intelligence. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spokesmanresponded, the Speaker has full confidence in Congressmen Swalwell servicein the Congress and on the Intelligence Committee.In a video recently uploaded and then removed from Chinese social media, aChinese professor spoke openly about Beijing's past efforts to infiltratethe U.S.DI DONGSHENG, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA (throughtranslator): No matter what kind of crises, we fix everything in twomonths, it's just because we have people at the top. At the top ofAmerica's core inner circle of power and influence. We have our oldfriends.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): In terms of fallout, Florida Republican Senator RickScott is calling on Pelosi to remove Swalwell from the House Intelligencepanel. And Texas Republican Congressman Lance Gooden is demanding a ban onChinese nationals serving as interns in U.S. congressional offices, Bret.BAIER: More on this with the panel as well. Mike, thanks.Meantime, President Trump's team is joining legal action brought by one ofhis allies trying to keep the electoral college from officially castingvotes. Here's Chief White House correspondent John Roberts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): With the electors set to vote on who the next president will be injust five days, President Trump is pinning his hopes on a Supreme Courtcase filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS: These elections in other stateswhere state law was not followed as required by the Constitution affects myvoters because these are national election.ROBERTS: Paxton is asking the Supreme Court to block electors from votingin Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, claiming those statesmoves to massively expand mail-in voting broke the law.PAXTON: That election, we can't go back and fix it, but we can say OK,let's transfer this to the legislature, which used to do this in otherstates and let them to decide the outcome of the election. That would be avalid constitutional situation.ROBERTS: President Trump gave the petition a big thumbs up tweeting, wewill be intervening in the Texas plus many other states case. This is thebig one. Our country needs a victory.Some supporters of the president question the wisdom of him jumping intothe case, feeling it would be better if the president left it to thestates. Arkansas among 17 states joining Texas.Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announcing I have determined that I willsupport the motion by the state of Texas in all legally appropriatemanners. The integrity of our elections is a critical part of our nationand must be upheld.No word on whether the Supreme Court will take up the case, but it hasasked the defendant states for a response by 3:00 p.m. Thursday.The Texas case falls on the heels of a loss in the Supreme Court forCongressman Mike Kelly and congressional candidate Sean Parnell. The courtdenied Kelly and Parnell an injunction to block further certification ofthe vote in Pennsylvania. The two say, they're not done yet.REP. MIKE KELLY (R-PA): We were not granted a temporary injunctive relief.It does not mean that our lawsuit does not go forward. It means that thetemporary injunction relief, that part has been taken away and it's goingto allow the state to move forward with appointing their electors but by noway is this over.ROBERTS: 27 Republican members of Congress sent a letter to President Trumpurging him to direct Attorney General Bill Barr to appoint a specialprosecutor to get to the bottom of how the election unfolded.In the letter, the lawmakers saying Americans deserve a definite resolutionand the legitimate questions of voter fraud remain unanswered.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (on camera): And as far as how long this could go on, we seem tosee a new deadline which is further off in the future that have beenthought that the deadline would be Monday when the electors vote. But oneof the president's top attorneys Jenna Ellis set out a release yesterdaysaying that the next hard deadline is January the sixth when Congress votesto certify the elector's votes.But then she said ultimately the final deadline is January 20th, so wecould be in this for a while to come in, Bret.BAIER: That will be something. John Roberts live in the North Lawn. John,thanks.The House meantime has approved an interim spending bill to avert agovernment shutdown this weekend, the vote 343 to 67. This bill funds thegovernment until midnight December 18th. The measure now goes to the Senatethen to the president.Congressional Democrats are dismissing two Republican sponsored Coronavirusrelief plans so far. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's has a proposalfrom Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin does not do enough to help theunemployed.A team of bipartisan senators has released details of their bill. Itincludes an extra $300 a week covering four months of unemployment aid,$160 billion for state and local governments and 300 billion for thePaycheck Protection Program.Stocks were off today, the Dow lost 105, the S&P 500 fell 29, the NASDAQdropped 244.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SWALWELL: Just over six years ago, I was told about this individual. Andthen I offered to help, and I did help. I was thanked by the FBI for myhelp and that person is no longer in the country.BAIER: How much is China doing? How much is China spying in the U.S.?CHRISTOPHER WRAY, DIRECTOR, FBI: Bret, there's no country that presents abroader, more comprehensive threat to America's innovation, to our economicsecurity and to our Democratic ideas than China does.The FBI is opening a new counterintelligence investigation that ties backto China every 10 hours. And that's just sort of the tip of the iceberg.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER (on camera): The FBI director talked to me there at the end of Junesaid it again in July, as we have this Eric Swalwell story, we want to talkabout Hunter Biden as well. Let's bring in our panel. Early Byron York,chief political correspondent of the Washington Examiner. Jonathan Swan,national political reporter for Axios and Jason Riley, Wall Street Journalcolumnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Let's just start there, Axios broke this story, Jonathan with the exclusivesuspected Chinese spy targeted California Democrats. And part of Swalwell'sdefense has been that he says it leaked by the Trump -- the either thepresident or his allies. It's just -- it's interesting that that's thepushback here to this story. It's happening after the election.JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: I mean, it's reasonable.I mean, it'd be inappropriate for me to talk about my colleague sourcingbut just use your common sense. Even Swalwell acknowledges that he firstfound out Axios was on this in 2019. I know my colleague, his timelineswrong. He says July 2019, it's not July but she's been working on this formore than a year.So, just anyone who has any parsing, understanding of how Trump worldworks, do we really think that they put out some opposition research andthen patiently wait a year beyond an election for the -- for the very wellrespected China correspondent to report it out in a nuanced fashion? Imean, give me a break. It's -- it completely absurd.The story is really important. It shows how the Chinese Communist Partyoperates inside this country. It shows how they infiltrate our localpolitics, how they identify young -- in some cases, soft targets. Peoplewho don't have a lot of staff around them, who don't have experience, whodon't actually understand the tactics of the Chinese Communist Party, andthen they follow them up.And they follow them, in some cases, in Eric Swalwell's case, he has becomea very, very powerful important member of Congress with access to thenation's top secret. So, it's a very important story just to understand howChina is operating. And as you showed in that interview, right now in thiscountry.BAIER: Yes. I want to play this sound bite from the House minority leaderKevin McCarthy. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): This is only the tip of the iceberg. Becauseremember what we're hearing, these are Chinese spies that go down to thelevel of a mayor. They court and help a city council member become acongressman.This congressman now gets on the Intel committee. They are only selectedfrom the Intel committee by the leaders of their party, meaning, NancyPelosi. Nancy Pelosi is one of the gang of eight along with myself.Did Nancy Pelosi know this had transpired when she put him on thecommittee? Why is he still on the Intel committee? Let known why is hestill a member of Congress?(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Yes, Byron, the question is how far does this go? Who else isaffected? And you look at in the context of the Russia investigation andall that has been said and done about that.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it was happening. As lateas 2015, which is the year before Democrats started making a very, very bigdeal of Russia and the Trump campaign at the time, going through 2016, '17,'18, looking with suspicion on any contacts of any Trump figures withRussians.And we heard earlier in the program, Eric Swalwell complained about lawenforcement being weaponized against him. Well, welcome to Washington. Thisis what is happened, and I would not be surprised to see more Republicans,not just Kevin McCarthy, calling to find out more about this, because theirfeelings are still very raw from the whole Russian thing, in which therewas a long investigation into alleged collusion that didn't establish thatit ever even happened. So, you're going to see more about this.BAIER: I want to -- I want to turn to the Hunter Biden situation. And we'rejust getting more breaking news and it's happening just before this showstarted. Telling our own Brooke Singman that two sources familiar with theinvestigation tell Fox News, the investigation being run out of the U.S.Attorney's Office in Delaware into Hunter Biden's "tax affairs" includeslooking at that laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden.Fox News first reported in October that the FBI subpoenaed a laptop andhard drive reportedly belonging to Hunter Biden in connection with a money-laundering investigation in late 2019.One document obtained by Fox was a subpoena sent to the owner of the laptoprepair shop to testify before U.S. district court, December 9th, 2019 goeson to say, we first reported that the FBI was in possession of that laptop.So, we're not only seeing here, Jason, the tax investigation, a grand jurytied to a target subject of Hunter Biden, but also now that the laptop ispart of this. And that it was now overt, not just to covert part of the FBIinvestigation.JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right, and of course there area lot of news organizations that didn't want to look at any of this priorto the election. They thought it might help Donald Trump in the election ifthey did that. So, they avoided the story.And, you know, I can understand Trump supporters looking at this and beinginfuriated by it. Perhaps, there's something there with regard to Hunter'sbusiness dealings in the Ukraine or in China. We don't know yet. But we doknow that there's a very clear double standard here when it comes tolooking at these matters, depending on which party you're a member of whenit comes to the press's attention.So, we don't know if it would have affected the election. But I canunderstand why a lot of Trump supporters right now are furious that this isonly being looked into at this point.BAIER: You know, Jonathan, quickly, the -- we saw in the Durham case thatthe attorney general putting a special prosecutor label just to protectperhaps what's going to continue in that investigation. This one,potentially, he could do the same thing as you're getting ready for January20th.SWAN: Well, this will be the first test of, of what Joe Biden has said hewill do with his justice department. Joe Biden has pledged that he willkeep his justice department at arm's length that he will not intervene.Well, it doesn't get much more of an ultimate test than your own son beinginvestigated by federal law enforcement for business dealings with China orin tax affairs.So, how Joe Biden handles that investigation will be a really crucial testof how he's going to operate with his justice department.BAIER: OK. All this breaking just before the show, we're digesting it all,we'll bring it to you as we get more details. Panel, we'll see a little bitlater in the show.A tale of one city and two states. We'll see how one town has to operateunder two different sets of rules coming up for the coronavirus pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One side's wide open, another side's closed. So, I don'tknow how that is going to benefit anyone.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Tonight, we continue our exclusive reporting from Afghanistan, asAmerican troops prepare for a significant drawdown there from what has beenthis country's longest war. Correspondent Benjamin Hall tells us fromKabul, not everyone is happy the troops are leaving.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over):The drawdown is underway. After almost 20 years, bases are being closed andtroops are heading home. It's believed that just two large bases andseveral satellite ones will remain for the 2,500 soldiers who stay.But on the ground, the situation is getting worse. The Taliban arelaunching more attacks, taking more ground, and thousands have fled theirhomes. For these people, a peace deal seems a long way off.HALL (on camera): This man says that children are dying here. They've gotno food; they've got no heating. But that is still better than the war andthe fighting they've fled, and that, that fighting is worse now than it hasbeen in a long time. He's asked the Americans to stay in Afghanistan untilthey can bring peace.HALL (voice over): The rise in violence is thought to be a tactic by theTaliban to gain leverage in negotiations. Secretary Pompeo says the peacedeal is at risk.MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: And I made clear to themthat the violence levels can't continue while these negotiations go on. Itwon't work. And so, we've asked all of them to stand back and indeed standdown.HALL: The Afghan Army have been trained by the U.S. and conduct all groundmissions and 96 percent of air missions themselves. But it's not thoughtthey can stand up to the Taliban alone.The U.S. will continue air support, funding, and training, all inaccordance with the deal they made with the Taliban. And about 6,500 NATOtroops remain. But for America, this, their longest war is winding down.(END VIDEO CLIP)HALL (on camera): The Afghan war has cost almost 2-1/2 thousand Americanlives and almost a trillion dollars. $138 billion of that has been spent onrelief and reconstruction. Being out here now, it is --BAIER: It was Benjamin Hall in Kabul, Afghanistan.Meantime, you saw that picture there. It's a high-altitude test by aSpaceX's Starship rocket resulting in an explosion today. The prototypetaking off from the company's Texas launch site, blowing up on its returnlanding -- exploding.The ship was supposed to reach about 41,000 feet, but its main goal was totest several individual components. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk had earlier giventhe launch only a one in three chance of success.On the first try, he tweeted afterwards, "Fuel header tank pressure was lowduring landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high and RUD," whichmeans Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly. "But we got all the data we needed.Congrats SpaceX team."So, is breaking up the right thing to do? Government lawyers say Facebookhas been using its dominant position to crush its rivals and harming youand your family in the process. We'll tell you about that and how they'redoing it a bit later.Up next, our series on the coronavirus vaccination continues with thepolitics of the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, saying politics played no rolein the vaccine's development.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: If the United States Food and Drug Administration says that avaccine is safe and effective, I can promise you that I will take thatvaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  British regulators are warning people who have a history ofallergic reactions against taking the coronavirus vaccine. At least so farinvestigators are looking into two adverse reactions occurring on thecountry's first day of its vaccination program.Meantime, Canadian health regulators have approved Pfizer's vaccine. Theysay 249,000 doses will arrive this month and be administered within days.We continue our weeklong series on the vaccine tonight with the politics ofthe pandemic, specifically has the approval process been safe, and if ithas, who gets the credit? Correspondent David Spunt has our report.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  We trust the drug companies. What theAmerican people don't trust is President Trump.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  In 2020, science and politics are onein the same. Millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will likely beadministered in just days. But the political fight over a vaccine startedeven before COVID blanketed the country.DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'd love to see if wecould do it prior to the end of the year.SPUNT:  Through spring, summer, and fall, scientists worked on vaccines inlabs across the globe. At the same time, the 2020 presidential campaign metat the intersection of science and politics.SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I would trust theword of public health experts and scientists, but not Donald Trump.SPUNT:  The next day, standing outside the main entrance to the WhiteHouse, the president mixed the two.TRUMP:  We're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a veryspecial date. You know what date I'm talking about.SPUNT:  The vaccine never made it before Election Day.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We're for a vaccine, but I don't trust itat all, nor do you. I know you don't.SPUNT:  Dr. Anthony Fauci says vaccine safety under President Trump was notcompromised.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  This is a safe and efficacious vaccine.SPUNT:  But safety isn't the only concern for some Americans. A Catholicbishop in California caught Pfizer's attention by calling out the companyover concerns it used aborted human tissue. In a statement, Pfizer pushedback, telling FOX News, "This is a synthetically-design vaccine and doesnot contain any animal or human material." A source close to Bishop JosephBrennan says that information was enough to change his mind.Public health officials are focused on addressing political doubt,religious objections, and safety concerns because they say the more peopleget vaccinated, the sooner the country achieves herd immunity.FAUCI:  The estimate is that you'll need about 70 percent, maybe 75 percentof the people in the country vaccinating to get that umbrella of hearddelivery that will get us really on the road very close to being normal.(END VIDEO TAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  To help with public confidence, former presidents JimmyCarter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and President Trumphave all said, Bret, they are ready to roll up their sleeves. Bret?BAIER:  David, thank you.Tonight, we are taking you to a town on the border of Tennessee andVirginia that is trying to balance two different sets of state regulationsdealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Correspondent Mark Meredith shows usfrom Bristol, Virginia.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  From above, Bristol looks like onecity, but look closely and you'll see the state lines separating Tennesseeand Virginia runs right through downtown, forcing Bristol businesses tocomply with different health restrictions depending on what side of thestreet they're on.LEN COOK, CHAMPION STRIKING AND FITNESS OWNER:  It is a little challengingas a business owner for sure.MEREDITH:  Len Cook owns Champion Striking and Fitness in Bristol,Virginia. His gym remains open for now.COOK:  If you are doing any classes that involve close contact with aperson, we require a mask.MEREDITH:  But as COVID cases surge in the commonwealth, he knows it'spossible that more restrictions could be in place.COOK:  It would be aggravating to see one side like literally across thestreet being able to do anything and us being closed, because that is notgoing to help at all.MEREDITH:  Last month, Virginia placed new limits on in person gatheringsand alcohol sales, a decision impacting event spaces, including Bristol'snew boutique Sessions Hotel.CATRINA MULLINS, SESSIONS HOTEL GENERAL MANAGER:  It's very disappointing.A lot of holiday parties, of course, have postponed. We are still lookingat getting wedding for next year. We've had quite a few inquiries.MEREDITH:  Sullivan County, which encompasses Bristol, Tennessee, so farhas not enacted the same restrictions. Virginia's governor calls the splita health hazard.GOV. RALPH NORTHAM, (D-VA):  In our border communities, people routinelycross state lines to work, shop, and visit their families. What happens inthese other states affects us.MEREDITH:  Bristol businesses appear to be taking the divide in stride.Beth Rhinehart is the president of Bristol's Chamber of Commerce.BETH RHINEHART, BRISTOL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  A lot of business leadersstep up to do things, to have very frank conversations through PSAs andother things to encourage people. Be responsible for yourself, for yourfamily.MEREDITH:  But some Virginia businesses also fear they will eventually losecustomers to Tennessee if more restrictions are added in the weeks ahead.Still, Bristol's leaders insist the city's fate is note split, instead tiedtogether as one.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When one side loses business, everybody losesbusiness.(END VIDEO TAPE)MEREDITH (on camera):  Residents tell us they would like to see officialsfrom Virginia and Tennessee work together on a unified plan for battlingthe virus. And help may be needed now more than ever. The local hospitalsystem reported today it found more than 4,400 new cases of coronaviruslast week alone, a 25 percent jump from the week prior. Bret?BAIER:  Mark Meredith live on the border between Virginia and Tennessee.Mark, thanks.A tough day for Facebook as the social media giant becomes the target ofseveral major antitrust lawsuits. We'll explain.First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. FOX 12 in Portland as Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler sayshe is authorizing police to use all lawful means in ending an illegaloccupation at a home in the city. Protesters have rallied at the privatenorth Portland residence for months to demonstrate against the eviction ofa black and indigenous family.And this is a live look at Orlando from our affiliate FOX 35 there. One ofthe big stories there tonight, Vice President Mike Pence says the CapeCanaveral Air Force station is being renamed Cape Canaveral Space Forcestation.

We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  A pair of major antitrust lawsuits against Facebook is feedingspeculation tonight that the social media giant could be broken up.Correspondent Gillian Turner is here to tell us what this all means.

Take a listen to New York's attorney generalearlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LETITIA JAMES, (D) NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Billions were thrown atsmaller companies in an effort to get them to sell. The two most glaringexamples of this unlawful scheme were Instagram and WhatsApp.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera):  Also alleges Facebook sometimes threatened potentialrivals in order to get them to agree to buy outs. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LETITIA JAMES, (D) NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL:  They also sent a clearmessage to the industry. Don't step on Facebook's turf or, as one industryexecutive put it, you will face the wrath of Mark.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera):  Mark Zuckerberg himself shot down similar accusationsjust two weeks ago. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  I don't think we or anyone else viewedInstagram as a competitor, as a large multipurpose social platform. Infact, people at the time kind of mocked our acquisition because theythought that we dramatically spent more money than we should have.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera):  Tonight, Facebook tells FOX News in response to theselawsuits, "This is revisionist history. Antitrust laws exist to protectconsumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses." Soafter months of marathon hearings on Capitol Hill, threats from lawmakersof reining in and regulating big tech, it does seem like at least Facebookis now finally facing a reckoning, it's just coming through the courts,Bret, rather than through Congress, as we all expected. Bret?BAIER:  That's one to follow. Gillian, thank you.YouTube says today it will start removing content that it says falselyalleges widespread fraud changed the outcome of the presidential election.That is a change to its hands-off stance on videos making similar claims.Google, meantime says it is lifting its political ad ban tomorrow. That banwas put in place ahead of last month's elections. Obviously, the onlyelection pending, January 5th, the runoffs in Georgia. We'll follow them.More with the panel next. Brand-new info on the Hunter Biden tax probe,plus the case of the Democratic congressman and the Chinese spy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  That video from November 7th, Hunter Biden embracing his father,Joe. This on a day that we learn and he learned that he is underinvestigation, federal investigation. Hunter Biden putting out a statement,saying "I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. attorney'soffice in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they areinvestigating my tax affairs. I take this very seriously, but I amconfident that a professional, objective review of these matters willdemonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, includingwith the benefits of professional tax advisors."The transition putting out a statement, "President-elect Biden is deeplyproud of his son who has fought through difficult challenges, including thevicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger."But as this night has progressed, we are learning more and more details,that in fact this investigation goes back to 2018. In fact, there is agrand jury involved and that Hunter Biden is a subject or target of that.In fact, that there has been, according to two different sources, a look atthe laptop, the Hunter Biden laptop that had been a focus of severalreports, and also of money transferred from foreign nations, includingChina.We are back with our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent forthe "Washington Examiner," Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for"Axios," and Jason Riley, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and senior fellowat the Manhattan Institute. Byron, your thoughts as this story comes outand we learn more. We are getting that this is now the overt stage of thisinvestigation, but the covert stage, sources are saying, never reallystopped from 2018.BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Right,and it was going on even as Democrats were really yelling for Republicansto stay away from Hunter Biden. Remember, a year ago, as the move toimpeach the president was heating up in the House, a lot of Republicanswanted to look into Hunter Biden's business affairs. And the word they gotfrom Democrats was absolutely no way.In the end, this is not hugely surprising in the sense that it oftenhappens this way, when someone makes a large amount of money frommysterious sources overseas, you look at whether they paid taxes on all ofit. That is certainly what happened to Paul Manafort in the Muellerinvestigation, and it has happened to a lot of people who have had thesewindfalls from overseas governments.BAIER:  Jonathan, you mentioned this earlier, in a real test for thePresident-elect on January 20th, be the president as his DOJ likelycontinues this. Here is Joe Biden, the candidate from November, 2019,talking about he would run a DOJ and investigations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I would not dictate who should beprosecuted or who should be exonerated. Follow the law. Let the JusticeDepartment make the judgment as to whether or not someone should beprosecuted, period.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That's what he set on the debate stage. Obviously, it's his son.JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, "AXIOS":  Well, and this alsomeans it puts more pressure on the question of who he appoints as hisattorney general. Does he appoint someone who can plausibly be thought ofas independent, or does he appoint someone who is much more political,someone who is much personally close to him, someone that people would notnecessarily trust would be able to keep such a thing at arm's length.So again, it's really going to be -- the test doesn't become more profoundthan your own son being investigated. And he has laid down this markervery, very clearly as one of the things that distinguish him from PresidentTrump.BAIER:  Jason, there will be a lot of loud frustration from Trumpsupporters that this is coming out the first week, second week of December,and not the first week of November or the last of October.JASON RILEY, "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COLUMNIST:  Definitely, Bret. When Ithink about this and the arguments made that Byron alluded to, the stayingaway from Hunter Biden, often the Democrats would say, yes, maybe he wastrading on the family name to cut deals in areas where he really had noexpertise. Maybe it was unseemly, but there is nothing illegal about it.And now we learn that, in fact, the federal prosecutors are looking intothis, making him a target of the investigation. Now, of course we don'tknow if Joe Biden is involved in any of this. He has said he has notdiscussed his business dealings, his son's business dealings with him. Butwe'll see. But yes, the hypocrisy of what has gone on here and the way thatthe president's own family members and children and so forth have beenrelentlessly investigated by the media, who at the same time wanted to takea very kid glove treatment with respect to the Biden clan, it's all beingexposed right now. So yes, Trump supporters are going to be veryfrustrated.BAIER:  Yes, quickly, Byron, obviously we have all the texts that wecovered before the election. The big man in the back and forth that HunterBiden talked about getting money. We are told by sources that Joe Biden isnot a subject or target so far in this investigation. But he's starting anadministration with this that is going to have to be covered.YORK:  Absolutely. And there is a big media angle to this becauseapparently the laptop, information from the laptop is involved in thisinvestigation. And remember, so many news organizations suppressed reportsof this laptop for the weeks leading up to the election. And now it lookslike it's going to play a serious role in a serious investigation.BAIER:  OK, we'll follow all of it. Panel, thanks for hopping on thebreaking news tonight.When we come back, the joy of giving and getting.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, the season of giving.
