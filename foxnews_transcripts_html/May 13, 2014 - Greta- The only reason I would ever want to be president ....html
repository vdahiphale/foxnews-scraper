Let's let all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I just completely changed my mind about something, and that doesn't happen often. I had thought that the only reason I would ever want to be President of the United States is to be able to fly Air Force One whenever and wherever I wanted to go. But forget Air Force One.
I just completely, literally change my mind. And now, the only reason I would ever want to be President of the United States is so that I could have the great honor of bestowing, on behalf of the American people, the Medal of Honor on those great heroes. Today, President Obama presented Army Sergeant Kyle White with the highest military honor, the Medal of Honor. During a deadly ambush in Afghanistan in 2007, showing enormous courage and valor under fire, Sergeant White saved a comrade's life and then he rushed back, while still under fire, to help evacuate other wounded soldiers.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

FORMER ARMY SGT. KYLE WHITE, MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT: Without the teams, there could be no Medal of Honor. That is why I wear this medal for my team.

Can you imagine being able to bestow that on someone? That just tops all. And that is my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
