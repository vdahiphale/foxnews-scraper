Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. This will set you on fire. The GSA, your government, is giving the San Ysidro border crossing facility a $735 million upgrade. That's almost a billion dollars. Did they really need that much?
But here is where you are going to get furious. It turns out the GSA reserves one half of one percent of new construction costs for art. That means your government is spending your money, about $500,000, on artwork for the border crossing. You tell me why people crossing the border need pretty art? I like art, but really? And to the tune of half a million dollars of your money? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If people crossing the border want art, turn on the car radio - that's art and it's free. But get this, this is the very border crossing where Sergeant Tahmooressi mistakenly made his turn, accidentally ending up in Mexico. Would you not think that someone in the government with half a brain might say, if we have an extra half a million dollars hanging around, instead of spending it on art, why don't we spend it on what we need, like more giant traffic sign for miles approaching the border and right at the border, all lit it with giant letters saying, "Last chance to turn around" or "Don't go here," "Mexico only." So that you, or guys like Sergeant Tahmooressi, who served two tours in Afghanistan for us, don't make a mistake and turn into Mexico with no turn around and end up rotting in a Mexican prison. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
