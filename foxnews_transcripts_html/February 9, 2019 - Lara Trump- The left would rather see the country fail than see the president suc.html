JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to "Justice." I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making "Justice" number one last weekend. And let's go for it again tonight. Trump 2020 senior advisor, Lara Trump is here standing by, you don't want to miss that, plus Dan Bongino, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, Gregg Jarrett, John Solomon, Dana Loesch and much more -- all packed into this hour.
But first my open. We are reaching a turning point that will forever determine our future -- how we live our lives and how our children will live theirs. The gap between the ever widening left and right has never been wider, and yet amazingly it continues to widen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Every time we turn on a TV, open a laptop or listen to the radio, another bizarre, offbeat, outlandish idea brings us closer to socialism and the destruction of capitalism and is being pushed by the left. So you have a decision to make. Do you want to live in a country where no matter how hard you work, what you do or how much you succeed, you simply won't improve your lot. Do you want to benefit from your own success or would you prefer the government take over and use your benefit to pay everyone else? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the last few weeks, the left has removed its moderate mask to show its true socialist colors as they cheer laws that allow for the killing of babies already born and born alive, giving the mother the right of a thumbs up or thumbs down like an Emperor in the Roman Coliseum. And every one of the 2020 Democrat presidential candidates supports the Green Deal proposed by a freshman Congresswoman so knowledgeable about Washington that she thinks she came here to sign bill, which Green Deal will literally pull planes out of the sky. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No issue, I guess, since the left is happy with the influx coming in through our southern border. No air travel required for them. This Green Deal supported by Booker and Harris and Sanders and Gillibrand and Warren requires that every building in America be rebuilt for environmental reasons and that high speed rail be developed so that air travel becomes unnecessary.
The Green Deal foresees Medicare for All and considers a deficit not that big a deal because according to Ocasio-Cortez, we can just print more money. You know what? You should have left your Monopoly game home when you came to Washington. But my favorite part is where they seek a net zero greenhouse gas in 10 years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So you may ask why net zero as opposed to zero? The reason is that they are not sure they will be able to get rid of bovine flatulence -- I can't believe I just said that -- aka, cows farting. These emissions from cows are of concern to the left because the bovine emissions have an environmental impact and the methane gas produced by the bovine flatulence contributes to the greenhouse gases that contributes to global warming. Need I say more?
And their hypocrisy. It knows no bound as they hang on to dear life -- political life, albeit -- in the State of Virginia where the Governor and the Attorney General dressed in blackface and the Governor comes out and says that he is now going to explore the issue of white privilege and pursue an agenda of racial reconciliation. Talk about trying to deflect an issue from yourself to everyone else. And he even says it was a terrible week for Virginia. No, Governor, it was a terrible week for you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is accused of forcible sexual assault and forcible rape. Although, the date of one attack was 16 years ago and the other 15 years ago, the victims have a very specific recollection. One asked classmates to corroborate her immediate outcry that Fairfax raped her. One victim remembers the date, the time, the place, and telling her classmates. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One involves a doctor who says that she was forced to perform oral sex on Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, and although she did not bring it up until years later, it's a far cry from the demand of the left that Brett Kavanaugh remove himself as a candidate for the Supreme Court for something that allegedly happened more than 35 years ago with an alleged victim who didn't remember where it happened, when it happened, and who never reported it to anyone.
Fairfax's victim has the date, place, time. So what I want to know is, where are the Democrat senators who turned the Constitution on its head for Kavanaugh saying that all women need to be believed? Where are all the women in their pink hats? Where are the womb he who suffered sexual assault storming the doors of the Capitol during the Kavanaugh hearings? Where are those women, who refused to allow the elevator door to close in the Senate as they had a fit and sought to blame Brett Kavanaugh for their own distress?
I guess if the accused is a Democrat, the rules don't matter. And so it seems the Democrats don't care if someone is in blackface, happens to be a Democrat or if someone accused of sexual assault happens to be a Democrat, or if a baby murdered after it is born. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a group that actually sits on their hands when the President of the United States says he wants to stop human trafficking. A group that sits on their hands when the President says he wants to end childhood cancer. And they sit on their hands when he says he wants to have a plan to eradicate AIDS. Who are these people? Who are more hateful of one man, our President, that it matters not that he wants to protect babies or stop human trafficking or eradicate AIDS.
I'll tell you who they are. They are people who don't care about us. They only care about power and making sure that they keep it, and for all of you who can't make sense of why normal thinking people would not support a border and not care if illegals including MS-13 members come into our country, you need to understand that this group knows that they have lost Americans and their only hope is to get immigrants and illegals into our country so that they can maintain their power base.
And if you think socialism will never happen in this country, just take a look at what has happened in the last 10 days and ask yourself that question one more time. That's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter @JudgeJeanine. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And joining me now to discuss my "Opening Statement" and so much more, Trump 2020 senior advisor, Lara Trump. Good evening, Lara. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LARA TRUMP, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: That was quite an open, Judge Jeanine, I loved it.
PIRRO: Thanks, Lara, I appreciate it. You know, Lara, as you sat there, and I saw you in the gallery. And watched as your father-in-law, the President discuss things any right-thinking person, American or not, would be in support of, whether it's trying to get rid of childhood cancer, which has been something that your husband, Eric, has been involved in since, I think he was 20 years old. I mean, did you sit there stunned when you realized that it was so anti-Trump, that group, that they couldn't even applaud or stand up? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
L. TRUMP: Well, this is what these people have done forever. Wat has happened in this country is the left would rather see the country fail than see the President succeed. So they don't want to stand for anything that he's saying whether or not it makes sense and the rest of the country is behind him, I thought it was appalling. I thought it was shocking.
First of all, let me say, of all the speeches I have ever heard my father- in-law give, I thought that State of the Union was the absolute best I have ever heard, and by the way, to get the entire group of people in that Chamber up on their feet shouting "USA, USA" at one point, no one but Donald Trump could do that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But honestly, it was really shocking to see the number of people who did not react a moments like you were talking about, when a little girl from St. Jude who has battled cancer was there in their presence. When so many of the things you just outlined were said and they sat down and wanted nothing to do with it only because it came from this President. It's really appalling. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: It is appalling and it is shocking and I believe there was a CBS poll that said 76% of Americans thought the speech was a great speech. So, I mean, your relationship with the President has nothing to do with the fact that so many people thought the same thing about the speech.
But you know, when the sex trafficking that the Democrats seem to be so interested in and the human trafficking in stopping seems not to be an issue and, you know, the left is not caring about issues that are almost issues that they were the first to talk about. It has to make Americans feel like they don't really care about us, they are more interested in their own power. It's not even about the left and the right, it's about the people versus the people in Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
L. TRUMP: Yes, and you see so many of this. You saw the President, by the way, during the government shutdown, offering something that the Democrats a year ago said they couldn't live without. Let's take care of the DACA recipients. They didn't even come to the White House to sit down and negotiate with him because, Jeanine, as you are saying, they don't even care. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's all about a power play for them. That's all you're seeing. The good news is that the President is fighting every single day for the American people. He understands the right thing to do for this country. These same people, they are such hypocrites, a couple of years ago under a different President were all for wall, all for border security. And now again, this President proposes it and they have to be against it. It's lunacy and I think the American people are smarter than that, and I think they are seeing through it.
PIRRO: You know, when the President made the statement about socialism, and he said, we will never be a socialist country. It was a statement that was - it was very advanced. I mean, no one has really talked about it, but we are seeing it creep into the national discussion. We are seeing it creep into the laws. We are seeing candidates, even candidates running for President who are socialists.
It is - do you think it average American is concerned about socialism? Or do they think it just - it can't happen here? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
L. TRUMP: They sure ought to be because you have people as you are saying, running on a socialist platform. I think the problem is that there are so many people in this country that do not fully understand what socialism means and what it would mean for this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jeanine, let me name a few countries for you that these people might know and they were all socialist countries. The USSR, China, Cuba, most recently Venezuela where people are starving to death eating dog and cat food to survive. It's something that every American should really take seriously. This is almost full government control of everything.
Here, we have a President who is deregulating things, taking the government out of most of things and you see our country thriving. You see the economy booming. These people want to do the opposite. They want government to control essentially everything. It's a step away from communism and a dictatorship in some senses. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's very serious. It's very scary and if you don't fully understand it, do some research. We do not want socialism happening in the United States of America. Our Founding Fathers would be rolling over in their graves if they knew that these people were serious and they were really running on their platforms and they are, and that's the scariest part.
PIRRO: And they are. And they are openly running on it. Anyway, Lara Trump, thanks so much for being with us tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

L. TRUMP: Thank you.

PIRRO: All right, and joining me now, making a rare solo appearance on "Justice," our friend, Fox News contributor, Dan Bongino. How are you, Dan?
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: Hey, doing great. Yes, where is Chris tonight? What is he -- having some adult sodas out there or something?
PIRRO: No, we just wanted to talk to you solo tonight. You know, Dan, one of the things that there is a lot of discussion about now is, and you know that bipartisan, bicameral group seems to be coming up with some kind of a deal that according to the "New York Times" doesn't look too good in terms of money for a wall. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
And also, in terms of anything more than $1.3 billion, although some say it can go up to $2 billion. The issue it appears on this committee, they never heard from ICE. They never heard from Immigration Customs Enforcement because they didn't want to hear from them. Is that like an omen? Does that foretell us what's happening? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: Yes, it does. You know, Judge, I am glad you brought this up actually because you see this a lot on this network when we debate liberals. They will say things like, "You know, a lot of experts said a wall isn't necessary." And you say, "Well, who are these experts?" And you know, sometimes they will name a member of Congress.
But then when you talk to actual experts, Judge, like Tom Homan on the network who actually ran the agency or Border Patrol agents, who deal with this every day, they are the ones that say, "Yes we need this wall." So them avoiding the input of ICE, CBP and others is not surprising at all. But you know, just think of this in commonsense terms, Judge.

You know, when you want an expert in micro brewed beers, right, you go to a microbrew beer guy. You don't go to an orthopedic surgeon. He may be an expert on elbows, I've got a bad one. But he doesn't know squat about micro brewed beers. So this is standard operating procedure for the Ddemocrats. Totally unsurprising.

PIRRO: You know, one of the things that is especially frustrating is the rumor or the suggestion that the left with want to abolish ICE, I mean, there is no question about it and some of them are saying not a dime for ICE.
But in addition to that, they want to eliminate some of the detention beds. Now, you were in law enforcement. You know what that means, that means that when you eliminate the detention beds, you cannot keep them and you have to release them into the country. There are some reports that said as many as 30,000 could be released into the country. This is what the Democrats want. Why? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BONGINO: Well, they've committed themselves to open borders a long time ago, Judge. None of these is a mystery, but the facts and the data are not on the left's side. They never are.
Large majorities of the people who are then released even with these ankle monitors and other monitoring devices cut them off and disappear for good, effectively creating a de facto open border situation.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Listen, Judge, the left understood a long time ago, they are not stupid, that they have lost on the issues. People want economic liberty, control of their own healthcare et cetera, right? So what do they do? They need open borders because they need voters and basically an open-ended entitlement state. That's why they are in this. This is a pure power play. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This has nothing to do with immigration with them. This is a pure power play on the left.
PIRRO: Well, and you know, as the left continues with this power play, I mean, one of the issues is that the radical shift by the left to now allow for the killing of babies after a baby is born and they actually - I showed the audience in the open, they are actually applauding the passage of this law, I say to myself, "What have we come to, Dan?" Why are we in this place? Why do people allow for the acceptance of that kind of thinking?
BONGINO: Judge, it's really one of the sadder moments I have seen in my 10, 15 years closely following and having run for office myself. Look at this - the termination of life now outside the womb. I mean, how many breaths do we have to take? This is a serious question -- before we are free from the legislative pen of the radical far left? I mean, it's serious question. How long do you have to be alive now? Are we going to have to measure it in weeks outside the womb? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I mean, look at this Green New Deal, Judge. This is the most outrageous thing I have seen. I mean, you opened this show - by the way, your opening was -- I was actually laughing, I am sure they saw me in the control room, I was dying in here laughing, but this is outrageous.
I mean, what? Are there going to be cow assassination squads now? I mean, you are going to have to give your cow Bino to cure up their gastrointestinal issues? To prevent an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez death squad or something?
PIRRO: I've got to tell you, I think it's terrible because I worked in a dairy when I was a kid, and that was before they had these computers that we used to milk the cows. Anyway, Dan Bongino, we'll talk another time.

        }
      
PIRRO: Yes, all right. Take care, Dan. Thanks for being with us. And Gregg Jarrett, John Solomon and Dana Loesch are all on deck tonight. But next, we will continue the conversation. President Trump holding firm on his push for a border wall as the clock ticks down to a deadline for a real deal. RNC Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel is here in a "Justice" exclusive to talk about that and more of "Justice" back in just a moment.
PIRRO: President Trump fired up tonight over the Democrats' refusal to compromise on border security. The President tweeting tonight that, "The Democrats just don't seem to want it." Joining me now with reaction, Chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Good evening, Chairwoman. Good to have you on "Justice." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The President seems very determined and I think he knows or smells what a lot of us are smelling and that is that the so-called bipartisan committee that didn't want to hear from ICE is looking not so much to protect Americans but is looking to allow people to come into the country by not providing for the steel slats and for eliminating some of the ICE detention beds which allows immigrants to just freely roam the country. What do you think?
RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Well, the President is doing something that Democrats aren't doing and he is listening to the ICE agents and the CBP agents and listening to what they are saying on the border every day. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And today, Jeanine, we just saw CBP release that just in the past four months 200,000 arrests have been made at the border. That is an 85% increase over this same time last year. So the President is exactly right. He is listening to the people on the front lines. We have a crisis. Democrats know it. They've known it for a long time. They want it to persist and the President didn't come here to sit on his hands, he came here to solve problems and he's going to get this done.

        }
      
PIRRO: Okay, just quickly, why? People say why? What's your take on why? Why does the left just sit on their hands? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCDANIEL: They want porous borders, I do think that they want porous borders to help get voters. I think they feel like if they have porous borders and they bring these people into this country and they show that they will let them, that they will be voters for them in the future. It changes the electoral map.
California now counts non-citizens in their census to inflate their congressional representation. I mean, this is a power play that Democrats have made. It is certainly not about the working men and women in this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Because as you let people into this country and take more of our hard earnings and give it to people with entitlements or other things that they are taking in education or healthcare, it's not good for our country. And the President is saying legal immigration is great. We have more jobs right now than we have people to fill it. Let's fix the illegal immigration and let's legal immigration so we can bring people in based on merit, based on jobs that are open. That is the right way to do this. Democrats used to agree, this is ridiculous that they are standing down on an important issue and it's making our country less safe.
PIRRO: It certainly is, and you know, today, I mean, another arm of this left socialist-leaning thinking when Kirsten Gillibrand, the Senator from New York, who is one of the 2020 hopefuls said that it was an urgent goal to eliminate private health insurance. What is she talking about and why?
MCDANIEL: Well, you just talked about socialism and how it is creeping in, and this is how Democrats are bringing socialism into our country. They want government to take over our healthcare. A hundred and seventy seven million people in this country right now are on private insurance plans.
So what the Democrats are saying, now it's Kirsten Gillibrand. Before, it was Kamala Harris. They are saying, "We want to cancel all your private plans. We want the government to dictate to you your health insurance and we do not want you to have a relationship with your doctor and make your choices based on your healthcare personally." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And this is just an overreach. It's a government takeover of our healthcare and it will bankrupt - bankrupt our country. This is another step toward socialism and it shows how far left the Democratic Party has become. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

PIRRO: Very frightening. Ronna McDaniel, thanks so much for being with us tonight.
MCDANIEL: Thanks for having me.
PIRRO: All right, an NRA spokesperson and radio show host, Dana Loesch, still ahead tonight, and next why was Special Counsel Robert Mueller, once reportedly hauled into the FISA court? Investigative journalist, John Solomon and Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett join me next to discuss new questions on Mueller's past, as well as the investigation into the President. Interesting stuff ahead as "Justice" rolls on.

TODD PIRO, CORRESPONDENT: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Todd Piro. Demonstrators take to the streets of Paris for a 13th straight weekend of anti-government protests. Police firing teargas into crowds of yellow vest protesters and at one point, things turning violent. Someone losing four fingers as police tried to stop demonstrators from breaching Parliament. The movement is protesting what they say are President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business and pro-rich policies, but recent polls show Macron is slowing winning back the nation's approval.
And Takata airbags are under recall again with nearly two million vehicles affected. Some of the brands include BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes. Officials say the airbags have a high risk of exploding sending shrapnel into drivers and passengers. The explosions have been responsible for nearly two dozen deaths worldwide. I'm Todd Piro, now back to "Justice with Judge Jeanine."

Investigative journalist, John Solomon broke the story this week and joins me now along with Fox News legal analyst and author of "the Russia Hoax," out this Tuesday in paperback, Gregg Jarrett.
Gentlemen, thanks for being here. Now, John Solomon, I've got to tell you, I am always amazed that you get these things, and get these stories and find out this information. When you talk about in your latest article that Mueller was hauled before the FISA court, the very FISA court that he is in a position as special counsel to oversee what Comey, his pal and the rest of them did, I say to myself, "This is truly the fox watching the hen house. Tell us what happened, John.
JOHN SOLOMON, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Yes, it's a great story and it's very important for this reason. Remember when Devin Nunes first started asking questions about FISA and possible omissions about Hillary Clinton funding it and the innocence of some of the people that were being targeted?
James Comey, Rod Rosenstein were all saying, "Listen, the process is so aggressive and the oversight is so amazing, there is no chance for any abuse. All calm down." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, it turns out that system was pretty broken. We found out through reporting that there were more than 75 instances in the early 2000s where the FBI submitted a FISA warrant in the counterterrorism counterintelligence case and it was erroneous. It has omitted the information of innocence. Just all of the things that we are now talking about in the 2016 FISA warrant with Carter Page. It went on before and the court got so mad, the secret court got so mad, they hauled Bob Mueller in and said, "You've got us some explaining to do to us. How are you going to fix this?"
And he put some more procedures in place, and we now know from the 2016 case, those procedures were blown past and omissions and errors were submitted to the court again, this time to target Trump and his campaign.
PIRRO: But John, is there any way for us to know whether or not the FISA court is claiming that any wrongdoing was done as it related to the 2016 situation, the way they hauled in Mueller for the mistakes that he made? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: You know, occasionally the court will release something publicly, but they have been remarkably silent for two years and the President in my recent interview with him, he mentioned that, "Where is the court?" A lot of the members in Congress are wondering where's the court?
I think 2019 is a year where we might hear from them. The Inspector General report comes out on this issue probably in the spring or early summer. That would be an opportune time for the court to finally tell us, do they think they were defrauded like the evidence suggests.
PIRRO: All right, Gregg Jarrett, I am going to won't waste your time with whether or not Mueller has a conflict of interest, that's another issue.
GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST: That's a given.
PIRRO: But tell me, who is in a position to say that Mueller should not be there given the fact that he clearly has a conflict, that he clearly has done wrong before. He has left out information so much so that the most of secretive court in the United States has hauled him in and rebuked him?
JARRETT: Well, it's too late now to remove him. He is at the end. Whitaker testified that you know, he has not interfered with Mueller and his investigation. Nobody has. But John's excellent reporting underscores something important.
The FISA system is badly, egregiously broken. This is a secret court. It's not an adversarial process. It's reminiscent of the infamous Star Chambers in the 16th Century Great Britain. It is inherently structured in a way that it's unfair. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And in this particular case, the Trump-Carter Page spying by the FBI and the Department of Justice, they violated just about every rule that had been instituted and the FISA court never even held a single hearing on this.
They took paper submissions on it all because they have so many applications, an average of 29 a week. So they have to trust the honestly, the credibility, the integrity of people like James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Rod Rosenstein, Sally Yates, who all concealed evidence and deceived the judges.
PIRRO: All right, well, you know, thank goodness for John Solmon's reporting, but John, I am going to go back to you. My favorite guy is this guy, Adam Schiff who is so convinced that there is evidence that, you know, when we say there is no evidence, he says, "Well, it's coming out soon." John, tell us about your reporting on Adam Schiff and Glenn Simpson.
SOLOMON: Sure. You know, we had a big moment this week, the Senate Intelligence Committee through Richard Burr, the Chairman announced that they, too, like the House had found no evidence of collusion with Russia.
So as the evidence of collusion with the Russia-trump investigation disappears, it becomes just a political dirty trick. The evidence of Democratic collusion begins to grow. And so, Glenn Simpson met this past summer with Adam Schiff at the Aspen Security Council. He didn't tell anyone on the House Intelligence Committee. They claim it was small talk, but it is exactly the type of contact that two years ago he demanded that Devin Nunes disclose to the Committee.
So now his standard has boomeranged on him, hit him in the back of the head on this. I have a story coming out tomorrow. More than a dozen instances of Democrats involved in the dossier or in the investigation having contact with Russians. The story that is going to change is going to be Democratic collusion in 2019.
PIRRO: All right, Gregg, you've got 10 seconds. How do we make that a story of Democratic collusion other than you writing another book? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JARRETT: Look, it's in my book. Remarks by Russians that said, we were talking more with the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democrats than we were with Republicans and Donald Trump. So you know, yes, collusion, but it's Hillary, Russia, FBI collusion, not Trump.
PIRRO: All right, guys. John Solomon, Gregg Jarrett, thanks so much for being with us tonight. And my next guest says Democrat Presidential candidate Kamala Harris is an existential threat to freedom. I'll ask Dana Loesch to explain why and you don't want to miss her answer.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Kamala Harris is a lot of things -- a senator, a candidate for President, a former prosecutor -- but my next guest said she is also a threat to your freedom. Joining me now, nationally syndicated radio host, of "The Dana Show" and NRA spokesperson, Dana Loesch. Good evening, Dana. Why is Kamala Harris an existential threat to all of us?
DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON: Well - and Judge Jeanine, always such a pleasure to join you on Saturday evening. And her policies, her socialist policies -- and we need to use that word because that is the platform on which this woman stands -- it does pose an existential threat to the very foundation of our republic.
This is a woman who has come out against semiautomatic firearms. This is a woman who has come out for very, very far left socialist policies. And so this is why there are a lot of people for instance, NRA membership, that maybe, they are gun-owning Democrats, they don't feel as though they have a home in the Democratic Party anymore because it seem the name change Democrat to Socialist is all at this point, simply a formality.
So there are a lot of people that feel politically homeless so to speak, and this is a woman who and while the NRA focuses obviously on Second Amendment issues, you know, myself speaking, looking at how she for instance -- and I know you've discussed this, Judge Jeanine -- how she has endorsed this green disaster policy that Democrats have come out with that literally talks about removing cows from planet Earth and getting rid of planes and de-combustible engines, and I could go on and on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, you can't get any more socialist or crazier than that and Kamala Harris has endorsed that platform. She has endorsed that plan.
PIRRO: You know, Dana, what's interesting about this is so many of the Democrats running for President in 2020 have endorsed it also. From Elizabeth Warren to Sanders, to Kirsten Gillibrand, to, you know, there are a few more, and Kamala Harris. I mean, they are openly socialist. I mean, it doesn't matter, not hiding it anymore.
We just said a few segments ago that Kirsten Gillibrand says it's an urgent need to get rid of private healthcare.
LOESCH: Yes, and this is what I said in the last election, I said that the last election was the last time we were ever going to see anything close to a moderate Democrat in any kind of primary. When you look at the candidates that have pledged to run in 2020, these are all super far left, anti-gun, anti-individual freedom. I mean, anti - pretty much everything we have come to love about being free in the United States of America and these are their own words.
This is what these individuals have stated. I call it the disarmament primary because that's exactly what it is. And then, even beyond that two- way issue, just looking at some of the stuff they endorse. I wonder have any of them have taken a math class?
I mean, when you look at that disastrous green deal for instance, and when you actually get to the portion at the end of it, I think it's like six pages, they have zero way to pay for it at all. And the best, Judge Jeanine, the best is that now they are trying to defend it and say, "Well, actually it was conservative media that put up all of this stuff in the plan." They removed it off of Alexandria Cortez's website, put up a different version and are trying to gaslight everybody in the United States of America that all of these claims were made up, except the way back machine has archived all of it, screenshot exist. I have seen it on her page, they cannot lie about this. It's hysterical that they are trying.
PIRRO: And in the last few seconds we have, I mean, can you think about how the Hollywood hypocrites, they want all this, and yet, they are not going to be able to even fly a commercial airline, forget a private airline, I mean, you know, do people think this isn't going to happen, because if they have their way, it will happen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LOESCH: Yes, and you make a great point. I mean, it's fun to mock the silliness of it and if they are upset about the eradication of airlines being mentioned in this, perhaps Democrats should have written it better, but the serious nature of this is that all of the primary candidates have thus far have endorsed this. And that's why it's funny, but at the same time it's absolutely terrifying.
PIRRO: Scary, absolutely, and Cory Booker is the other one. All right, Dana Loesch, thanks so much for being with us. And back in a moment with Brandon Tatum from Turning Point USA.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: The Green New Deal has everybody talking tonight. Brandon Tatum is Director of Urban Outreach with Turning Point USA and he joins me now. Good evening, Brandon.
BRANDON TATUM, DIRECTOR OF URBAN OUTREACH, TURNING POINT USA: Thanks for having me on.
PIRRO: Oh my pleasure. Listen, I don't get anything anymore. I don't even get the title. It's a Green New Deal. Why not just the Green Deal? Why is it the Green New Deal? I don't expect you to give me an answer, but I want to start with this, Brandon. In my open, I talked about the last 10 days and how the left has taken off its mask and revealed the true socialists that they are, everything from infanticide to cows. What's your take on what's happened the last 10 days? And socialism, as it appears to be creeping into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
TATUM: Yes, it is. I think in the State of the Union address is when I first - I kind of felt the effects of how deranged the left is becoming when they stand and pat themselves on the back for jobs for women, and yet, when it comes to reproductive situations for women, young women who are unborn, they would sit on their hands and not show respect for, I guess, disapproval for late-term abortions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the new green disaster, a new green crazy deal, I don't know what you want to call it, but it is the craziest document that I have ever read. If you want to have a manifesto for the disaster and the destruction of a great nation, you can just read that document. It is ridiculous.
PIRRO: And I mean, what upsets you most? The idea they don't want planes in the sky, the idea that they want to print money to pay for it or the idea that they want to tear down and rebuild virtually every building? Like you say, what do you start with? Like how about the White House? Do we start with the White House or should we take down the Pentagon? I mean, what are they thinking?
TATUM: I don't think they are thinking at all. They have no plan to pay for these things and I read the new green deal or whatever you call it.
PIRRO: Yes, they do, they are going to print the money.
TATUM: Which is not going to be effective, so again, they have no way to pay for it. It is going to cost a trillion a year to function. And I heard a gentleman on the television just earlier, I guess he's a mentor to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and he has said that they are not saying that planes will not fly in the sky, but they are going to produce something that will make planes obsolete.
You are going to ask us to pay all that money and pay all of these taxes for something that you don't even think will work. It is absolutely ridiculous and I don't understand how people can support this. Kamala Harris signed off on it, I think Cory Booker signed off on it. These people are literally setting themselves up for failure in 2020.
PIRRO: You know, but it's like everything else, Brandon, you know, it's like the left is saying we want porous borders. We don't care that 90% of the drugs come through or human trafficking or child -- they don't care about that. It's an agenda that is -- it's uncanny. I can't figure it out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TATUM: Yes, they don't care about America. It's obvious to most people in America, and I hope that people would do their research and not just look at one channel. But do some research and understand exactly what they are doing. Open borders don't work. Drugs are pouring into our country. The President has said it a thousand times. I don't understand how anybody can love this country and then support not securing the border and support ending sex trafficking and all of the other things that come from the south.
And that's not the only thing that is problematic in our country. I don't understand why anybody want to destroy our economy by raising taxes and giving everybody free jobs. That's not how it works. That's not how our society was built and I'm not standing for it.
PIRRO: All right, Brandon Tatum, thanks so much. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Welcome back. By the way, in case you thought things looked a little different, I'm in West Palm Beach, Florida tonight. I'll be back in our Fox News studios at New York next week. Remember to keep up with me throughout the week on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way. "The Greg Gutfeld Show" is coming up, and I'll see you next Saturday night. I can't say same place, because I won't be here ...
