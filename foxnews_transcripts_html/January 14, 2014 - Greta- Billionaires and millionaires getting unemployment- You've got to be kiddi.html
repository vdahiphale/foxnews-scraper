'Off the Record', 1/14/14: Just because billionaires and millionaires can get unemployment benefits doesn't mean that they should. Looks like we now have to legislate decency 
By Greta Van Susteren

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

OK, let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute.
I was scrolling through Twitter this morning -- I know you do that, too -- and spotted a tweet by Sen. Kelly Ayotte. She tweeted, "No reason why millionaires and billionaires should receive unemployment benefits. Am co-sponsoring a Tom Coburn amendment to end this practice." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I thought, you have got to be kidding, millionaires and billionaires are collecting unemployment? That's awful and it's pretty petty, too. The whole idea of unemployment benefits is to provide a safety net for people who really need it. Millionaires and billionaires don't need it. Sure they are entitled by law, like everybody else, to receive unemployment benefits, if they meet the unemployment criteria. But that doesn't mean they have to do it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. You don't always have to settle the score or get even, get what you're legally entitled to it, you know, that sort of knee-jerk "I paid into it, so I'm going to collect it even if I don't need it" mentality. Doing the right thing matters. If you don't need it, just don't get it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One other thing, we don't need this bill. That is legislating decency. They should know better. It's social engineering. And that is all messed up.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
