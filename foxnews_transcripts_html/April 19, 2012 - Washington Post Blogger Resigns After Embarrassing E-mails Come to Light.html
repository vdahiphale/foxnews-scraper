A Washington Post blogger assigned to cover the conservative beat has resigned after e-mails he wrote surfaced that included disparaging comments about the very conservatives he was supposed to cover.
David Weigel's e-mails to Journo-List, a listserv for liberal journalists, were leaked Thursday. In them he wrote it would be a better world if Matt Drudge, of the Drudge Report, would "set himself on fire." Weigel also wished for the death of Rush Limbaugh, and accused pundits and Republicans of racism. Weigel did apologize on his blog before calling it quits.

Ben Smith at the Politico blames the paper for hiring what he calls "a liberal blogger under the false impression that he's a conservative." Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center goes further, calling the incident a disaster for the Post writing, "The Post brought in someone who tried to tear down conservatives and look at the right as if he were visiting a zoo."

          });
        } else {

Disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff is out of jail and back to work but this time at a kosher pizzeria outside Baltimore.
He was hired by Tov Pizza to help with the restaurant's marketing using his previous experience as a restaurant owner. Abramoff was released from a federal prison earlier this month after serving more than three years for fraud, corruption and conspiracy.
