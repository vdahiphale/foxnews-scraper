DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld. It is 9 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five." 
We begin tonight with major developments on two of the President Trump's biggest campaign promises. Today, the House of Representatives passed two Trump's bill that get tougher on illegal immigration. One block spending, the sanctuary cities and the others, Kate's Law which increases penalties on illegal immigrants who defy deportation multiple times.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was murdered in 2015 by a five- time supported felon in San Francisco. After the vote, President Trump released a statement saying, quote, I applaud the House for passing two crucial measures to save and protect American lives. The implementation of these policies will make our community safer. Now that the House is acted, I urged the Senate to take up these bills, pass them, and send them to my desk."  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, President Trump's revised travel ban took effect just an hour ago after the Supreme Court on Monday will much of it can be implemented before the high court makes a final judgment on the executive order.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us from Dallas International Airport just outside of Washington, D.C., with the details. Ed, what do you know? 
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Good evening, guys. We are simply not seeing any of the chaos or controversy we saw here at Dallas and JFK airports all around the country at the end of the first week of the Trump administration. Remember when that first executive order had been signed? Tonight, we are not seen that kind of chaos in part because this is a win for President Trump. He got a partial victory by the Supreme Court earlier this week as you said to move forward for 90 days on this travel ban affecting six mostly Muslim countries.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, you do not have resist protesters here at Dallas or other airports. There are officials I can tell you from amnesty international standing by, just to my left, one of the baggage claim area is waiting to see if anyone's rights are violated or any problems that they see but so far there has been absolutely nothing. The other piece of this of course is that remember, that was a self-inflicted wound at the beginning of the administration when the Trump White House rushed out the first executive order and did not have all the details flushed out. 
This time this is much more narrowly written. And in court, the high court gave the green light earlier this week, because let's look at what this new order says. It says, if you have an existing visa a bona fide relationship with someone here in the U.S., you can come in safely. A parent, a spouse, a child, a son-in-law, daughter-in-law, a sibling. You do not have a bonafide relationship if it's just a grandparent, grandchild and uncle.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Basically an in law, extended family member. So, the bottom line tonight is this is a win for the President. His latest executive order on the travel ban is moving forward. But interesting that just moments ago, we heard the state of Hawaii has filed, yes, yet, another court challenge that its executive order anyway. Even though there's no chaos at airports tonight. Even though it's more narrowly written, there are lawyers on the Left still tonight trying to challenge it -- guys.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: All right. Thank you, Ed Henry. 
And Kimberly, when that original executive order was rescinded and they wrote this one in a much more narrowly targeted way, now you have tonight the Supreme Court saying, okay, you can go ahead and do this and this will be in effect for 90 days. And it looks to me like this is going to be smooth sailing while they put in some sort of new extreme vetting that they haven't released yet. 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes. And I think you are right. That's an accurate assessment, Dana.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Oh, thanks.
GUILFOYLE: So, you know, and this is what we also predicted, you know, on the show that in fact, it would pass constitutional muster. And the SCOTUS, you know, agreed, Supreme Court of the United States. And now it's basically an issue of implementation and making sure it goes through smoothly. And he probably think, well, this would have been nice if this had happened right from the beginning. 
But as you see, the people that are the obstructionists that want to use the courts as a political arm for their movement are still trying to grow in the face of the Supreme Court and want to try to make a problem here. So, let's see what happens with that. I mean, Hawaii, who knew?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: A lot of people from Sudan vacationing in Hawaii apparently.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: We're trying to get there. 
GUILFOYLE: Big concerns.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Now, you can understand, of course, Hawaii is very beautiful. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Juan, the Democrats today, and we've had the travel ban piece but the Democrats today largely voted against the Kate Steinle law and also something that would have actually addressed sanctuary cities. It is not something that Steny Hoyer, the minority whip had actually said that they, you know, sort of twisted arms on. They let people vote their conscience. And yet still, most of the Democrats all voted in the same way. Why is that?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Oh, I think it's pretty clear that what you see from the mayors, from the governors especially the Democrats as you pointed out is that they think this is not helpful in terms of law enforcement. And even you hear this from the police chiefs and the police officials throughout the country who represent police organizations, that they think that this is in fact going to open the door to people who are here without documentation, illegal immigrants, not cooperating with police for fear that it will lead to deportation and also criminalization and charges of snitching on one immigrants, snitching on another. 
They don't want it. But I think for Democrats also, I think they see this as demonization of immigrants overall. And so, it becomes like a cultural divide with the President having run a campaign in which he demonized especially the rapists and thieves that were coming from Mexico and you have Democrats saying, you know, we are country of immigrants and we are very proud of it this Fourth of July and we're not going to go along with this gang.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Well, so the President says, it's about illegal criminal immigration. In fact, here is Laura Wilkerson speaking earlier today. Her son was killed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA WILKERSON, SON WAS KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: He now is serving a nine-year sentence in Texas. It means, he's got 30 years to do it before he's out for parole. We continue to battle some of that, we had some legislation that wants to allow these killers to have a good time. It seems as these families are always battling to stay ahead of the game. If someone wants to change it and let these killers off easy and out early. But one of us deserves to be sitting up here.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Awful. So, Jesse, the anguish happens over and over again not only just because of states that are trying to change their laws in terms of good behavior, et cetera, because of overcrowding of prisons. And what the legislation that they are willing to support now would say that we don't want any other family member that have to go through this in the future.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Of course not. It's a common sense legislation but of the Democrats have no common sense. Kate's Law is very specific. If you're a criminal illegal alien and you were deported from this country and you get caught sneaking back in, you go to jail. Twenty six or 24 Democrats supported that. I applaud those Democrats. I don't see any reason to not support locking of criminal illegal aliens who get caught reentering the country illegally. 
PERINO: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: It discourages illegal immigration, number one. And number two, it keeps criminal illegal aliens off the streets, thus making it safer for American citizens. I haven't heard any good reason to not support Kate's Law. And I would like all the Democrats to tell Kate Steinle's family or any family whose son or daughter or family member was victimized by a criminal illegal alien who is deported and came back. The reason that they don't support Kate's Law --

WILLIAMS: -- answer before we move on, you're ready, if you committed a crime and you illegally enter the United States again, you would be put in jail. What this law was about is enhancing the penalties. 
WATTERS: Yes. Look, what's wrong with enhancing those penalties? 
WILLIAMS: Well, no, that's a different argument than what you just said. It's not that you don't get arrested now.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: What's the Kate's Law, the travel band show was that Trump's mind and his heart is in the right place even if his fingers aren't. These are both small tools as part of a larger shed of safety and security. What I find alarming about this is that these things aren't like horrible, horrible life-changing events. Yet liberals react as if they are. So, even if you try to make a small temporary act like the travel ban, you cannot trust the left or the media with National Security because they constantly react as if this is something either bigoted or out-of-bounds or unconstitutional.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Even when you try the smallest thing, which a temporary ban on six countries that are lawless, they're lawless. This isn't a travel ban, it's a lawless band. The Kate's Law, President Trump did a very important thing. He brought a segment of victims to the table that were never at the table before. The table of politicians and media have acceptable victims or usually victims of police brutality, or Islamophobia and racism. What Trump did was brought these people to the table and forced everybody else to cover this story which has never been covered before. 
And by the way, this is -- now I'm going to bounce back to the travel ban. This is the future. This is what we should be doing. You know, Ed Henry was at the airport. You have to look at America like an airport. You want to come here, you've got to go through security. That's the future.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Because when you have terror meeting with technology where one person could launch a dirty bomb, this is how you have to look at security. Both of these things are about National Security. They're about the safety of the country. They are right. And if you overreact to it, it shows that you are not an adult thinking about things.

Somebody has options that they're offering and everybody on the left, everybody in the media they do the same damn thing. They say that sucks and then they move on but they don't have one option.

GUILFOYLE: No. It's not. And that's the problem. But they are more concerned about protecting the rights of criminal illegal aliens than innocent people who are murdered by those that would re-enter and re-offend that are recidivists. This is not demonizing immigrants. We are a country founded by immigrants. We embrace immigrants but embrace our laws and follow them. 
And you want to come in this country, do it all the hard works and people that have had to hire lawyers and get people to represent them, and work hard to be able to wait their turn in line to take their test and be here. Not people that come over the border and commit murders or commit crimes that we have seen happen to these families across the country. People are tired of it. 
WATTERS: Coming to America is a movie it's not a right. 
WILLIAMS: I'm glad to hear it but this is not news. This is like a cultural divide. You know, I mean, I just think there are people --

GUILFOYLE: President Trump shook up the news cycle again today with some tweets highly critical of two cable news anchors. The broadcast network lead with a story tonight and here's a sample of their coverage. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump touting his energy policy today. But once again drowning out his own message with a tweet. This time lashing out at MSNBC's "Morning Joe" for criticizing him. "How come low IQ Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago three nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said, no!"

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump has turned crossing the line into a political art form. But when he lashed out at two cable TV host this morning, he may have ventured into new territory. Now members of both parties are calling him out. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we begin with President Trump facing the collapse of health care negotiations and the North Korean nuclear threat instead tonight's sparking condemnation with a pair of venomous tweets about the host of a cable TV new show. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Earlier, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reacted to the tweets. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has to meet a higher standards than cable news anchors, right? 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, I don't think you can expect someone to be personally attacked day after day, minute by minute and sit back. Look, the American people elected a fighter. They didn't elect somebody to sit back and do nothing. They knew what they were getting when they voted for Donald Trump and he won overwhelmingly.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Okay. So, obviously this dominated some of the news coverage. You didn't hear much about North Korea or health care but you did hear about the Mika and Joe chronicles. So, Greg, what did you make of this situation? And also how Sarah Huckabee Sanders handled it?
GUTFELD: I didn't like the tweet but I detest them more. And I think that I have more in common with America than the people that are reporting on this. I mean, the horror is coming from the political world and the media world. But what about the world at home that has been treated like idiots by the political world and by the media world? Those two worlds think that America for the most part is stupid. So, here you have Donald Trump going after this two-headed smarm machine. 
These craven opportunists that have been using Trump forever, sometimes they love him. Sometimes they don't. It's an incredibly strange codependent relationship they have. The guy is a real estate developer from Queens. He's not a professor of gender studies. This is what he's done all his life. He's a trash talker. And when he gets pissed off, that's what he does. And by the way, I'm also getting tired of saying that this is somehow sexist. It's sexist to expect somebody to treat a woman differently. 
He doesn't even care who he is insulting. His insults are every bit as harsh to women as they are to men. That actually makes him less sexist than the people calling him sexist because he treats a woman rudely. That was a rude tweet. But some of the crap that they have been saying in the morning, I don't know. I hate the fact though that he has made them into victims after all the sniping that they do. It's like -- I don't want them to be the victims. Because they are just annoying, pretentious people. 
GUILFOYLE: And you love their video. 
GUTFELD: Oh, God. The least talented man on earth.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Oh my goodness. Gracious. Miss Perino. 
PERINO: Well, I have always rejected his personal attacks about anybody's appearance. I never laughed at any of the nicknames. I never thought it was good to actually, it made me crazy. The biggest winner in all of this is CNN. 
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: Because CNN is like the story of the week. And actually, he was on the upside of that. Nobody talked about that today. So, that's over. And that has blown off their front page. He says he doesn't watch "Morning Joe." He's not alone. 
(LAUGHTER)
So, here's the thing. If they are so irrelevant, why prop them up? And basically, what's happened is they were going to go on vacation tomorrow. 
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Now they are actually going to postpone their vacation. They become the heroes. I don't like any of the personal attacks that he does. The biggest insult that he could put against anybody is to ignore them. Because he's the President of United States. It doesn't get bigger than that. 
GUILFOYLE: Let me ask you -- 
PERINO: So, anytime he's going to talk about it, he's punching down. The only two entities that win from these tweets are Trump and the media. 
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm.
PERINO: Nobody that voted for him benefits by learning anything more about our plans on North Korea. What we are doing in Syria. He met with South Korean president today, nobody knows about that. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: The healthcare bill, they're trying to get a compromise on it. There are 100 things that could have been talked about today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
PERINO: But it's his choice. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. And the media is going to cover it instead of, you know, health care and, you know, North Korea. But, you know, perhaps maybe he didn't want them to talk about the health care bill, didn't go through yet. 
PERINO: But the members of Congress who are going home that are trying to get this thing done, need his help and the air cover that he can provide by saying that he's behind it. 
GUILFOYLE: So, let me ask you something. In the interest of, you know, and you've been very consistent on this in terms of saying, you don't like the personal attacks. Greg makes a point that is very valid, that they engage in very tremendous personal attacks against some of the -- 
PERINO: That is true. And he's not the first president to have to go through it. I mean, I worked for a president who was called a liar every morning. 
GUILFOYLE: It's just horrible. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And the thing is, he never reacted. Now, he was criticized for not reacting. Maybe this is a good tactic for President Trump and maybe in the whole new era. I'm not saying that you have to be like President George W. Bush but I was raised to not act like that. And so, it's hard for me to understand why commenting on somebody's personal appearance, even if you are attacked, I just prefer to let it go. 
GUILFOYLE: Okay.
PERINO: And focus -- especially if you are President of the United States. 
GUILFOYLE: But this is -- 
PERINO: You don't get bigger than that. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. But this is consistent with, you know, you hit him, he's going to hit you back twice as hard. And he's very frustrated by the things that they say and the personal attacks. I've never heard Mika and Joe say anything like this about President Obama. I don't think, you know, news anchor should speak like that about any president. You know, there is no justification either way. 
WATTERS: Yes. MSNBC and these guys called President Trump a mentally ill dictator. The President should not have sent the tweet but I understand why he sent the tweet. He had a very long personal relationship with these two hosts. He had been on the show for many, many years. They socialize on and off camera.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: And they had a very nice relationship for a long time and then the "Morning Joe" people turned on him. And he feels personally betrayed. So, he's responding emotionally. 
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm.
WATTERS: He is upset about it. And, you know, one of this phrase, you know, don't show up to a knife fight with a knife, show up with a gun. I probably butchered it.
PERINO: Don't show up to a gun fight with a knife.
WATTERS: Right. That's how Trump operates. Because he protects his brand like it's more precious than anything. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, he shows up with the Moab.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: He shows up with the Moab. Now, I get the whole argument that, you know, it's sexist to go after a woman. And, you know, there's also the argument that, you know, the women want to be treated equally. So, you know, you can't do that. But you said Trump goes after anybody. Old, young, black, white, poor, rich, it doesn't matter. But you know what? It's not the gentlemanly thing to do to comment on the woman's face like that. 
So, I think you should have steered clear of that. I think right now it's counterproductive to the agenda. And it wiped off the CNN -- and it wiped off these two great immigration headlines. But there's a lot of hypocrisy going on. Because when the Democrat representative from Louisiana made the comment about Kellyanne Conway crouching in the Oval Office, vulgar, distasteful joke, Pelosi was asked about it and she said, we did condemn it at all. But now it gets right in front of the microphone. 
Also, Democrats talking about beneath the dignity of the office? These are the same Democrats defending Bill Clinton. And, you know, they responded more passionately to a Trump tweet than an ISIS attack. So, you know, the outrage right now was a big double standard. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, some of these people didn't stand up for the President when they have the beheaded, you know, Jihadi John aka Kathy Griffin, you know, showing the bloodied severed head of the President -- 
WATTERS: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: I mean, you know, it's just bit of a double standard there which is disturbing. Go ahead. 
WILLIAMS: Wow. Holy smokes!

GUTFELD: It's not a performance, Juan.
PERINO: Excuse me?
WILLIAMS: You guys are back on your heels trying to make excuses. 
GUTFELD: Don't start by insulting us. 
WILLIAMS: There is no way -- 
GUTFELD: Don't start by insulting us. Do your facts. Do your facts. 
WILLIAMS: Here's the deal. Here's the deal. This is not normal. And you know what, Jesse?
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: I think Lindsey Graham, I think Paul Ryan, I have to go on are Republicans, we are Republicans. 
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: And they are saying this is not good. This is unacceptable. 
WATTERS: Yes. 
PERINO: Who here said the tweet was good, Juan? (CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Who here said the tweet was good? 
WILLIAMS: No, everybody is like, oh, you know what, Mika and Joe, you know, they said some things I don't know -- 
GUILFOYLE: Mika. 
WATTERS: It's Mika. 
WILLIAMS: Whatever. They said some things too. And people called Donald Trump names. And they say, the President -- and of course, Dana Perino said, you know, he is not the first president -- 
WATTERS: I'm trying to give context to the controversies. It's called concept. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. I appreciate it but let's not get away from the reality. 
WATTERS: Which is? 
WILLIAMS: The reality is, Donald Trump today as president of the United States stooped to a new low. I don't know how you explain it to your kids. I don't know --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: In context, this is mild compared to what he said before. So, relax. 
WILLIAMS: But I will say, let's get back into the blood thing and women, I just want myself -- 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God, he's talking about a surgical procedure. She said that she was bleeding from the face from a face-lift. 
WILLIAMS: And it's not only him, you know, dance group, you know, who tweets for him before that, he is saying dumb as a rocks Mika jealous -- 
GUILFOYLE: Mika! 
PERINO: Mika!
WILLIAMS: Mika. Whatever. But I just don't understand why the personal vindictiveness coming from the White House. 
GUILFOYLE: What about from them? What about all the things that they said about him? They called him a thug -- 
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: What did Greg said -- pretentious media type.
GUTFELD: I agree. And by the way, you know, what's worse than what he said, calling ISIS jayvee. Because that's a bid. You know what? We're talking about words. And by the way, the most transparent words you will ever hear, because people talk about top like this. And they make these insults behind people's backs, he does it to your face. To your plastic surgeon face. And by the way, I will take crap tweets over any, any, like calling ISIS jayvee is insulting to me. That is insulting to me more than this. Acts are worse than deeds.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. You're right. By the way, when they were there at Mar-a- Lago in May, the visit was so pleasant that he offered them to get married at Mar-a-Lago or for them to get married at the White House, with friends like that. 
The media is getting even more vicious about President Trump. We will show you the worst offenders. Directly ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: The war between the press and President Trump somehow got even worse this week. Today, President Trump again set his sights on one of his favorite targets, CNN. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Don't we love that term, fake. What we have learned about fake over the last little while, fake news, CNN, fake. 
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: Oops, their camera just went off. OK, you can come back. I won't say it. I promise, I won't say anything more about you. I see that red light go off I say, well.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But the president isn't taking things lately. Watch these journalists sound off on the president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN HOST: I can tell you working overseas in war zones, you know, people are emboldened by the actions of this administration, emboldened by the all out sort of declaration of war on the media. 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we're witnessing right now is just this erosion of our freedoms in terms of covering the president of the United States. 
JEFFREY GOLDBERG, EDITOR, THE ATLANTIC: Someone if going to do something violent against journalists in a large way an then I know where the fault lies. 
CHUCK TODD, MTP DAILY SHOW HOST, MSNBC NEWS: I'm obsessed with the White House's war on the press and on media. Let's be clear about this. That war is nothing less than a war on the truth.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Square this circle for me, K.G. 
GUILFOYLE: I don't know.
WATTERS: So, Donald Trump calling the news fake is going to cause someone to shoot a reporter, OK, that's what they're saying. But when the media calls Republicans racist traitors and Nazis for a year and someone actually shoots a Republican, they don't have anything to do with that. 
GUILFOYLE: Right, so again we're bringing up like the double standard and homocracy (ph). But listen, the media can act like they have, you know, clean hands in this because they have been trashing President Trump. Anybody associated with him, his administration, his ideas, his very existence, his breathing, whatever. The way he shakes hands, that's another throwback. 
They just call it because he shake hands like a thug, he's a thug. You know, it's just on and on and on. So yes, the man is probably frustrated because he wants to be able to talk about his ideas and his policies and his proposals and put things forward and get stuff on the map like health care and immigration and national security and jobs and GDP and make all these improvements that he promised, that people want to see happen in this country, the working men and women that put him in. 
But nevertheless, it's just you see a lot of this, you know, kind of just like whining and whining and whining. Just ask the questions. Do the job. You guys are journalists. You're fierce. You're courageous. Get in there and do it. That's that.
WATTERS: It doesn't seem like the press can take a punch. 
WILLIAMS: And we talked about this last night. I mean, you know, so the press should be tough but part of being top is standing up for the rights, you know, first amendment rights. They say the press is supposed to be adversarial to people in power or the watchdogs against corruption and that's their job. 
WATTERS: Well where were they for the last eight years? 
WILLIAMS: Oh, I think, oh, come on. This network has been terrific in holding President Obama to account to the point that some people on the left think went overboard but I just think that I don't see why the president of the United States would say the press is the enemy of the American people, Jesse. I find that bizarre. 
WATTERS: He said fake news was the enemy. 
WILLIAMS: No, no, he said the press.
WATTERS: No, he said fake news.
PERINO: Over in the campaign he did.
WATTERS: Dana, what do you think?
PERINO: Well, I do think that the president actually likes this fight though because he has fun. You can see and he's like, oh he loves -- he wants a foil and he's decided the press is his foil. So like the other night they were like make sure you watch the briefing because we're going to be going after CNN. So they like to fight. 
So all of those great things that Kimberly listed, all the things he could talk about, if he goes ahead and he wants to talk about the war with the press, the press is going to cover that. It's like serving dessert first. Everyone is going to eat that first. So, if he wants them to cover his agenda, you got to serve up the vegetables. 
And I also think it'd be interesting to see if there would be a reporter that could match his humor.
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: Right. So, like, just laugh about or like oh, yes, blow him off. See how that works because the fighting is again, it's the only thing that this war is helping, is Trump and the media. It's not actually producing any results for the people that voted. 
WATTERS: That's a very good suggestion. Greg, do you think the more the media talks Trump, the stronger he gets? 
GUTFELD: Well, I think that their anger reveals that they've been found out. So they've had -- they're actually -- I think Trump just happen to be the right person at the right time for this because we've seen four decades of punitive bias against people who do not share liberal assumptions. We've all been through this. 
So right now what you're seeing is, you're almost seeing kind of a radicalization of young conservatives, conservatives in general who now are emboldened for payback. They don't mind talking about fake news and pointing out media bias. We used to do that all the time and nobody cared. But now the free ride it seems is over, that this ideological paralysis that has corrupted an industry is kind of falling apart. 
And I think it's just like Donald Trump happened to be just the guy that's right there calling them out. He is marginalizing the media through his tweeting and his rallies, the way the media marginalized America. You know, if you weren't on the coast, you didn't matter. You didn't matter. And Trump said no, the people in the middle matter and he marginalized the media by going to those people through rallies and tweets. 
And I think they've realized that now the media has to come out of the closet. They have to come out and say yes, we're biased because we're all biased. We are all biased. Either we lean to the left or we lean to the right. But the difference between us, we don't pretend. They do. 
GUILFOYLE: And we host an opinion show.
GUTFELD: Exactly. 
WATTERS: So you're saying the president unmasks the media. 
GUTFELD: He revealed them.
GUILFOYLE: They already had the lowest like ratings in terms of track and likability. I mean the only thing lower (INAUDIBLE) but lawyers and like used car salesman. I mean, you know, he didn't dirty their rap. They did it to themselves. 
WILLIAMS: So the only person we can trust for information in America, Donald Trump. 
WATTERS: And Fox News. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Former ISIS fighters are complaining about not being able to get jobs in Europe. Greg breaks down the insanity when we return.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: So as ISIS crumbles, some surviving members are returning to Europe and finding it hard to get a job. Now I can see that. It's got to be a shock for an employer when she asks about that gap in your resume and you say I was in Syria chopping off heads. Anyway, tell me about your 401(k). 
So does it strike you as odd that they're allowed to return at all? Why aren't they dead? Did we ever worry about the career plans of Nazi war criminals after the war? So far, up to 150 are back in Sweden and according to Newsweek, the paper Expressen talked to some of them. One guy, Walad, whines that he applied for a lot of jobs but the online images he had posted of himself and ISIS tarnished his otherwise great reputation. I don't know, complaining about not being hired because you're an ISIS is like complaining you can't get a date because you're a pedophile.
But Sweden thinks you can reintegrate which puts everyone at risk. One fiend is looking for work right now after posing with corpses. How much do you bet they don't let his future co-workers know about that? Anything for tolerance. 
In England, roughly 400 have returned too. This is why Europe's screwed. You can return from a death cult and they worry about job placement. And they're not even returning due to a change of heart, but because they lost.
So employers are right to be scared but mark my words, in months, there'll be stories about how bigoted it is to hold their ISIS past against them. Forgive and forget, even if they chop your head off.
How can they call it -- I know we've got to go fast. How can they be allowed to call it home if they leave to join ISIS? 
PERINO: I think you need to revoke it, right. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: So this was a concern at the beginning of the war that the passports allow you to go back and forth. In this article it said that 7,000 people have gone to fight for ISIS -- this guy, the local terror expert says the only -- he says the really dangerous ones have not come back yet. Eight-hundred have not returned home from Britain. And so yes, I actually think they should be jailed and they should do something about the family's benefits. 
GUTFELD: Jesse, one of the guys blamed the media for their bad reputation. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Isn't that amazing? I mean talk about fake news.
PERINO: He was like fake news.
WATTERS: Yes, you know, for all those liberals in America that I've interviewed on the street that says we should be more like Sweden. I want you to just listen to this sentence. This is from the article. "Sweden is one of the best countries for a foreign fighter to return if they want to reintegrate. It's trying out a rehab program that gives Swedish extremist housing, employment, education and financial support. They give terrorists welfare in Sweden. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Look at that. 
GUTFELD: Juan, is this unfair to the citizens living there? That they don't know that the guy next door was in ISIS? Was, you know, raping and pillaging? 
WILLIAMS: Why, I can't believe that they even allowed them back in the country just to reiterate a point. Actually Dana and I think Kimberly have said this previously when the British attack, the last British attack that happened, you got to shut down their ability to come back.
GUTFELD: Right.
WILLIAMMS: And take away their rights. I don't think there's any question about it. But the thing that just strikes me is you know, you want to make sure that you don't just execute them. We are not supposed to become terrorists ourselves, but I'm not sure --
GUTFELD: That's not terrorist, that's common sense. 
WILLIAMS: Well, in other words, you have -- 
GUILFOYLE: That's called punishment. 
WILLIAMS: They had trials even for the Nazis, OK. 
GUTFELD: Yes. 
WILLIAMS: (INAUDIBLE) I don't --
WILLIAMS: This is such a weird battle now Kimberly that it's a defeat -- the planet is now the battlefield, so things have changed. I think we need and ISIS Island where we just drop them on an island. Nothing else -- 
WILLIAMS: Oh, Guantanamo? 
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: Right, but they wanted to close. But this is a problem. Sweden wants to bend over backward. It's almost like culturalism and wanted to do all these things. The problem is that now they have an enormous increase in the amount of rapes, OK. They're second in the world only to a part of southern Africa, Lesotho. And now you have all these crimes being committed there. But they think like no, no, no, don't punish the jihadists or the ISIS. Let's give them a job fair and, you know, Swedish (INAUDIBLE). 
I mean, it makes no sense to me. How would you like it if you had no idea that the person you are working next to is like, what your hobbies? Oh hobbies, my hobbies are, you know, getting a machete and decapitating someone. How about you? You know, let's be in a book group together.
This is the problem. So people have no information, at least in this country. If someone is a sex offender, you have to register, you know, who you're around, what to expect to protect yourself. So, it's a huge problem. 
GUTFELD: Imagine working with someone you don't know anything about. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: The iPhone turns 10-years-old today. Have the smartphone actually made things worse in people's lives? That's up ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: The iPhone officially went on sale 10 years ago today and now over 100 million Americans are using them. But has the iPhone actually made people's lives better? So, we have someone here who loves music, Dr. Gutfeld. Greg, changed music for you? 
GUTFELD: No, not the iPhone but the iPod. But I will say this, our bodies are going to evolve to match the posture of this phone because everybody you see now on the street is like this. This is a very strange thing. In construction areas at lunch, construction workers used to sit there and just look at the women, and that's how catcalls started. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my god, that's why they stopped? 
GUTFELD: They've stopped because --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: -- get women on their phone.
GUTFELD: So, they're just looking at their phones. All lined up, they're looking at their phones and every age except older guys -- older guys are doing it, but all the young guns are on their phones and like how many people are going to die because they just aren't looking around? Whether it's like falling stuff, cars, I think it's going to have an impact on our evolution as a species. 
WILLIAM: Dana, did you have a Blackberry?
PERINO: I want to have a Blackberry because I work for the government and so that's why I can't use --
WILLIAMS: Everybody had Blackberry but not --
PERINO: So then when I left the government and I got an iPhone, I do think it's made my life better but I'm still irritated by the keyboard. 
WILLIAMS: You don't like the keyboard? 
PERINO: It doesn't work that well, no.
WILLIAMS: And that is a Blackberry.
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: The Blackberry is gone for the most part.
PERINO: That's true, bye-bye.
WILLIAMS: Jesse, you're so young. You never knew life without an iPhone. 
WATTERS: Thanks, Juan. I appreciate the compliment. So here's all the positive side of my iPhone. I use the iPhone as a babysitter for my children, I like that. Looking at Instagram makes me work out more. I don't have to speak to people on planes anymore, which I like. And emojis are really fun. But there are some negatives. I read less books. I'm going blind. I have no attention span. I'm more obsessed with myself.
PERINO: Really?
WATTERS: My posture is worse. It's hard to believe. I'm afraid to be alone with my thoughts. 
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I don't remember anyone's phone number and I spend hundreds of dollars a year on chargers, right. 
WILLIAMS: I agree. 
PERINO: Oh, yes.
WATTERS: I can't keep my charger. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, you go to the front desk. They have a ton of them. 
WATTERS: What?
WILLIAMS: You know, when the iPhone came out 10 years ago, the screen was like so tiny. It's unbelievable. And now, look at this thing. 
GUILFOYLE: You got the plus.
WILLIAMS: Yes, your phone is like massive. 
GUILFOYLE: I've got a lot of phone. 
WILLIAMS: Like I'm saying the screen is so big.
GUILFOYLE: OK, well, I want to see it, some of it. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: Look, I like the technology because I find it and makes you very organized. Dana and I love lists. I love list on the calendar, that to do, what's coming up next and what you haven't finished from the day before, then you move over to the next day, a little completion. 
And I like the music too. It's pretty nice. You have a lot of options and now you don't even need to get like an expensive home stereo system. You can just get Sonos and use Pandora or Spotify. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, it's pretty amazing. I mean, even now, Siri. It's unbelievable. "One More Thing" is up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right, it's time now for "One More Thing." Jesse, you go first. 
WATTERS: So, some thug tried to pursejack a woman who was pregnant and she fought back with her SUV, ran him down.
PERINO: Wow!
WATTERS: Payback. 
WILLIAMS: Wow!
WATTERS: Well, she got in a little bit of trouble, just a misdemeanor but he was arrested for trying to steal this pregnant woman's purse. 
PERINO: I don't know. Is that the right way to deal with that? 
WATTERS: Not technically the right way, but that's what we call --
GUILFOYLE: Oh my god.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: I mean, take a chance to a jury trial. Good luck. 
WATTERS: -- street justice I think. So there you have it.
PERINO: All right, Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, I love that. OK, so here is something from our good friend Ainsley Earhardt and friends of her in South Carolina sent this. It's very nice. And this is a big tradition, unique tribute to the U.S. military on July 4th in South Carolina. 
The 8th Annual Salute from the Shores, a free military fly-over the entire coast of South Carolina in honor of our armed forces. And you can go anywhere on the coast in South Carolina starting at 1:00 p.m. to celebrate and salute the passing air fleet, which is very nice. And this year, the fly-over will include vintage military aircraft, F-16S, aircraft and you can learn more. It's Salute from the Shores.org so be sure to check it out. 
PERINO: I'm going to check it out. And check this out. So, there's a dog that wandered on stage in Vienna -- no, I'm sorry, it was in Turkey. This is the Vienna Chamber Orchestra performing in Turkey on June 20th. A stray dog just shows up. Gets a loud cheer from everybody and then just like settles down, and (inaudible) say, he's Turkish pianist --
GUTFELD: That's nothing like Jesse's dog videos.
PERINO: -- he said -- he called it the cutest moment in classical music. So, I was trying to match Jesse's.
WATTERS: That's a rough performance.
PERINO: Chihuahua (ph).
WATTERS: Get it?
(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my god, the jokes. 
PERINO: All right, Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right, the fight against ISIS often seems like it's so far away, but check out this video that's going viral. It shows a female Kurdish sniper reportedly targeting ISIS fighters in Raqqa, Syria. She reportedly is with the Kurdish Women's Defense unit. 
Check out how right after she pulls the trigger, a bullet strikes the wall right above her head, inches away from her head. And instead of freaking out, she actually laughs it off. Wow! According to one article I read, she allegedly said something along the lines of I kill ISIS. Well, good for her. 
PERINO: Good for her.
GUTFELD: All right.
GUILFOYLE: God, I love it. 
PERINO: You're next.
GUTFELD: Time for this, "Greg's Hitchhiking News." All right, this as a warning to young men and women everywhere. There's a man out there masquerading as a sea lion trying to get rides on your boat. This happened earlier. Look at how close that sea lion got to that little girl. Do you know what his name is? Sea lion Ted. Sea Lion Ted.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: I don't like those personal attacks. 
GUUTFELD: Yes, I don't like those personal attacks. He's upset. He wants to eat the little girl. That's terrible, but there is -- 
PERINO: Are her parents like not worried, a little bit worried? 
GUTFELD: I don't know what's going on there but clearly there's -- it's just a man in a sea lion costume. 
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: -- loving it.
GUILFOYLE: It's Greg in fact.
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: Kind of a little big for me, Greg.
GUTFELD: Hey.
PERINO: Set your DVR's. Never miss an episode of "The Five." You got "Hannity" up next.
