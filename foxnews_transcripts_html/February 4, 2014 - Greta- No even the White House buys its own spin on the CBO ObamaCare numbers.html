Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. I watched today's White House press briefing trying to explain the new CBO ObamaCare prediction numbers, and I think, "Really?" Discouraging workers through subsidies and taxes? That doesn't sound good or smart for the economy.
How does the White House expect the American people to have any faith in their leadership? It sure doesn't help that they horrendously bungled the health care website. That's still a mess. Plus, the back end system to pay the insurance companies, that's not completed. That's bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Then yesterday, we learned that the ObamaCare website can't handle appeals of enrollment errors. It's not even a priority for the administration. That's mean, because that scares people. Then today, the White House tries to convince Americans that the new CBO report about ObamaCare is good news with splitting hairs with the most nuanced defense. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

JASON FURMAN, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR: It doesn't say losing jobs. It says FTEs. So to some degree, this might be somebody who used to work 60 because they need health insurance and that was the only job that offered it. And now they can get a different job at 35 hours that doesn't offer health insurance but they're getting it through this, and they are switching from one to the other. And that's a better choice for that person. And this is giving them that option that they didn't used to have.

So, does that convince you? I don't know about you, but I don't think that guy is even convinced of his own argument. And if he is not, why should you be, right? At this point, uh-oh, are they just "phoning it in"?
