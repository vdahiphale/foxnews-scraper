BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Immigration now the key issue in the talks about funding the 
 government. This as temporary protection status is coming to an end for 
 number of countries, now announced today. El Salvador, almost 200,000 
 people expiring September of next year, Honduras, 57,000 expires July 5th, 
 2018, Haiti, 46,000, Nepal, Syria, there you see those are also 2018 
 expiration for temporary protection, essentially meaning that the 
 immigrants could come here and stay inside the U.S. DHS, Department of 
 Homeland Security saying the original conditions caused by the 2001 
 earthquakes in El Salvador no longer exist. So it's coming to an end and 
 it's sparking a lot of reaction.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief of The Weekly Standard; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post. 
Let's start, Steve, with this TPS, temporary protection status. The 
 administration saying, hey, listen it's over. El Salvador can take the 
 people back. For different lawmakers they're saying wait a second. 
 They've been here almost 20 years and they've established themselves and 
 their families.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Milton Friedman said 
 "There's nothing so permanent as a temporary government program." This is 
 evidence that he's right.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a program that was put in as an emergency measure. It's been on 
 the books now for 18 years, as you suggested in the intro. The conditions 
 that caused it in the first place, these dual earthquakes, are no longer in 
 existence. And the justification for it I think has shifted quite 
 obviously, and its proponents are not even really pretending that the 
 justification has shifted. 
Donald Trump ran for office saying he was going to change immigration laws 
 and change them in a pretty dramatic way to make them more restrictive. 
 That's what he's doing. Nobody should be surprised that he's trying to do 
 this. And I think the objections are pretty tough to justify at this 
 point. 
BAIER: One of the Republicans, Mario Diaz-Balart, saying "I'm in strong 
 disagreement with the administration's decision. While living conditions 
 may have slightly improved, El Salvador now faces significant problems with 
 drug trafficking, gangs, and crime. Since 2001 these people have 
 established themselves in the United States, making countless contributions 
 to our societies and our local communities. It would be devastating to 
 send them home after they have created a humble living for themselves and 
 their families. I strongly urge the administration to reconsider this 
 decision." It doesn't look like that's going to happen.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: The United States is a wonderful 
 country and it is a much better place to live than a lot of places on 
 earth, but as Steve points out, it's a temporary program. It's like how we 
 talk about DACA. The d stands for "delayed action." Americans have been 
 told that these are programs that are temporary, that they're not 
 permanent, and then there's a large bait and switch where after decades 
 they say, well, now there's nothing we can do. 
To me this points to the much larger problem of our immigration policy 
 which is not very coherent, which doesn't think through what the needs of 
 the country are and how they match with the citizens. And unfortunately we 
 are just not having a very good conversation about it. There really are 
 lots of conflicts here. There is the rule of law. There is with the 
 country needs. There are the needs of immigrants and there are the ways 
 that immigrants help countries and the way that they hurt, and nobody is 
 having a good conversation. 
BAIER: Chuck? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: In a way I give the 
 president some credit for precipitating an issue that has been allowed to 
 sort of rollover somewhat mindlessly for many years and, as my colleagues 
 have said, outstripping the original purpose of this temporary grant of 
 status.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Having said that, I also don't think it's very realistic to talk about 
 returning so many people to El Salvador in effect over the next 18 months. 
 And the reason I say that is it could be a total of about 400,000 -- sorry, 
 200,000 temporary departure people, but they seem to have at least 100,000 
 children among them, many of whom are U.S. citizens. That's a big problem 
 in and of itself. 
And I suspect a lot of them are going to attempt to stay here some other 
 way. They're going to try to get legal status. And a lot of them will 
 just stay illegally if they can't find legal means. So what I hope was 
 going to come out of it is that sort of like he tried to do with DACA, the 
 president has put Congress on notice. They've got 18 months to come up 
 with something permanent that makes sense for these folks, and I would say 
 to Representative Diaz-Balart, that's your job.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: Right, speaking of that, it is the central issue on this government 
 funding negotiation. Here is Mick Mulvaney on DACA. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: There is a $1.6 
 billion in the request for it this year. That's the 2018 funding Bill we 
 have to take up before the end of January. There's about $18 billion to 
 finish the southern border security. The president is absolutely committed 
 to having that as part of a larger DACA agreement. So it's really two 
 piece, 1.6 billion for some money for some wall this year, and then a 
 larger agreement for the entire wall for the entire border security package 
 as part of DACA.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Can Democrats, Steve, get to a place where they don't give 
 President Trump a win? They give him some security. They kind of punt the 
 issue down the road a little bit about the wall, and they somehow come up 
 with an agreement.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HAYES: Democrats are deeply divided on this. You have got the progressive 
 left that doesn't want to even have this conversation, and then you've got 
 more pragmatic Democrats that are willing to try to find some solution. 
 And it's a good guess as to who's going to win that debate.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think the most likely outcome is that they give will be and how we define 
 wall. What does a wall mean? It's not going to be a permanent structure 
 that spans the 2,000 miles of the southern border. It will be a 
 combination of cyber defenses and fences and the existing wall, or the 
 existing border protections which covers some 654 miles of the 2,000 
 already, and that that will be the give. That's where --
BAIER: Is that good enough for the president's base after a campaign of 
 Mexico is going to pay for the wall, we are going to get the wall. There's 
 different pieces of a wall that are already up to look at. The president 
 reportedly is going to go look at them along the border. Is that good 
 enough? 
HEMINGWAY: I don't know exactly, but what really needs to happen is 
 looking at our immigration policy dramatically differently. And we keep on 
 having these problems where every few years we need to have amnesty for 
 hundreds of thousands of people. We need to change at the outset, and 
 there's no reason why it can't be win-win for everybody, really, border 
 security and helping people who are here illegally.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: Quickly, it could be another pond January 19th to, whatever it is, 
 March, end of March, to come up with some deal on the spending.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LANE: That's true, although the clock is really ticking on DACA itself 
 which I think expires in March. 
And as to your original question, is it good enough for the base? It can 
 be if the president finds a way to pitch it that way. He can already claim 
 illegal crossings in Mexico are way down in his presidency. He could 
 declare victory himself, but I think he is very fixated on that physical 
 wall.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HAYES: And Mexico is not paying for the wall. 
BAIER: Or an invisible wall. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
