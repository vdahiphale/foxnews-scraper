'Off the Record' 12/22: Police officers actually protect protesters' rights to say horrible things about them - we need to thank them instead.

Let's go "Off the Record." First, take a look at this wall. This is the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, showing the names of more than 20,000 law enforcement officers, more than 20,000 killed in the line of duty, yes, protecting the rest of us. People like Allen Arthur Albee, Charles R. Smith, and Frank Fabiano, Jr.
Now listen to this: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NEW YORK CITY CROWD: What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Hateful, isn't it? Saying hateful things about all cops who everyday are out there protecting and saving lives. But guess what? Those protesters can say those hateful things only because they have a First Amendment right. You can't do that in Cuba, North Korea, Sudan and many other nations, but you can do it here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But think about this: Who is protecting these protesters' First Amendment right to yell those hateful things at cops? The cops. Extraordinary, isn't it? The police are protecting the protesters' rights to say hateful things about them. That says so much about our police, doesn't it?
So let me say, on behalf of everyone else, not the cop haters, but the rest of us, a big thank you to law enforcement. We may not be as loud as the haters, but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of us who deeply appreciate law enforcement. We get it. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
