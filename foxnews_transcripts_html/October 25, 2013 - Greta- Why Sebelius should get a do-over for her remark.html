'Off the Record', 10/25/13: Greta - Let's not allow the HHS secretary's 'dopey' remark about not working for those calling for her resignation distract us from the real problem: the ObamaCare website 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's all go "Off of the Record" for a minute. Yes, what Secretary Sebelius said about not working for us was dopey -- really dopey and probably on a 1 to 10 scale it probably hovers around 7 in terms of how dopey. Of course, she works for us. She gets paid by the U.S. Treasury. We all fund the Treasury, and she knows that.
Her remark about who she works for was flip and out of line, but let's face it, we have all said really dopey stuff. OK, maybe you haven't, but I have said a few zingers in my life. So I'm all for letting Secretary Sebelius have a do-over on this one, a do-over for doing something very human in the face of lots of heat. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But a do-over means she should fix it, clean it up, and not by having some HHS spokesperson issue some written statement on her behalf. She needs to do it herself and not in some overly grandiose way in some big splashy interview. It's just not that big of deal. But in the next day or so, when Secretary Sebelius is speaking, she should say something short about it, explain how it happened. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The media will then pick it up, her mea culpa, since we are hanging on every word she utters, and then we should all just be done with it -- it's over, forget about the comment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you are thinking, "Why cut her some slack and give her a do-over" first, because her comment wasn't fatal. It's just a dopey remark. Second, there are far more important things about health care to be grilling her about, like that website. We shouldn't let flip statements, like who she worked for, distract us from getting real answers.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
