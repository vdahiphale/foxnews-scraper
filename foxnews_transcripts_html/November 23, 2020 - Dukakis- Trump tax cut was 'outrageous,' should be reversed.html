NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  So many vaccines, so little time, but wewant to kick things off with a count going on in Atlanta. And if at firstyou don't succeed, recount and count again.Right now, the developments on a fast-moving political picture that has anincreasing number of Republicans saying, enough already, Mr. President.You're going to have to call it a day.We will also be speaking with the Georgia secretary of state, BradRaffensperger, on the pressure he has been getting not from Democrats. Trythe president of the United States and fellow Republicans, including thetwo running for Senate in that state.So much going on. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOURWORLD.And what in the world is going on with these constant counts and recounts,Atlanta, Georgia, the focus right now.To Kristin Fisher at the White House on what they're trying to resolve --Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Neil, right now, we'rereally watching what's happening in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two stateswhich are considering certifying the election results today, which issomething that, of course, the Trump campaign has been fighting to stop.But, over the weekend, they were dealt a nother blow by a federal judge whodismissed a lawsuit, writing in part -- quote -- "One might expect that,when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidablyarmed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampantcorruption. That has not happened."So, the Trump campaign is now appealing that decision. But the state'sRepublican Senator Pat Toomey says the writing's on the wall, and hebelieves the president has exhausted his options in Pennsylvania.Also today, more than 100 former senior national security officials whoserved in Republican administrations issued a statement urging thepresident to concede.And then there's this from former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whoover the weekend called the president's legal team a nationalembarrassment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FMR. GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ):  Elections have consequences. And wecannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen.You have an obligation to present the evidence. The evidence has not beenpresented.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER:  In total, the Trump campaign and its allies have lost more thantwo dozen cases contesting the election. They have either lost these,dismissed them, something of that nature.But the fact of the matter remains that the Trump campaign could stillappeal some of these or there are still some of these cases ongoing.But, Neil, I have reached out to multiple White House officials todayasking for comments on all the things that I just laid out in this liveshot, from Chris Christie's comments, to the new comments from Senator PatToomey. And it really has been very quiet here at the White House.They either haven't responded to me or they have directed me to the Trumpcampaign. And it's also very notable that, today, Neil, President Trump hasnot tweeted -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Oh, that's interesting.All right, Kristin Fisher, thank you -- Kristin at the White House.Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta right now, where they're looking at a thirdGeorgia count ahead of our talking to the Georgia secretary of state, maybesome details about what's going on here -- Jonathan.JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we are becoming experts atballot counting here in the Peach State. More on that in a moment.First, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is in Georgia today, campaigning for thestate's two Republican senators. This afternoon, she held a Defend theMajority rally in Griffin, a small town just south of Atlanta, with SenatorDavid Perdue, while Senator Kelly Loeffler continues to quarantine as sheawaits additional COVID-19 test results.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA):  Where our seat, Kelly's and mine, will determinethe direction of our country for the next 50 to 100 years, you all. I'm notgoing to overstate it, but that's the -- that's the turning point that weare potentially at right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE:  senators Perdue and Loeffler face January 5 run-offs againstDemocratic challengers.Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are campaigning on the premise that winningthese two Georgia Senate seats will protect the Affordable Care Act andhelp president-elect Joe Biden accomplish his agenda.After a hand audit of ballots confirmed Joe Biden's narrow victory here inGeorgia, President Trump has requested a recount. It's his legal right todo that, because he's within that half-of-a-percent margin. This will be amachine count at taxpayer expense.Republican state elections officials say allegations of widespread voterfraud are without evidence and are dangerous, regardless of which partythey come from.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA VOTING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER:  Theundermining of the system, either whether it be by Stacey Abrams two yearsago or by Donald Trump's team today, without evidence, we can't buy intoit. There has to be evidence.Everybody has due process.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE:  And Gabriel Sterling, who you saw there, said that he and otherelections officials have actually received threats from people apparentlyupset over the outcome of the presidential race here in Georgia.Police are investigating -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Jonathan Serrie, thank you very much in Atlanta.With us now is Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state.Secretary, thank you very much for taking the time.Sir, as you know, a third vote now. What do you think of that?BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, when a candidate-- and when a candidate is within a half-percent, that's their right to askfor a recount.We will be bringing those ballots through our high-speed scanners. And wewill give you that result. We fully expect it will be very similar to thefirst two results.CAVUTO:  All right.Now, in the second result from the first result, it showed about a 1,000-vote narrowing in the gap, right?RAFFENSPERGER:  Yes.CAVUTO:  I mean, do you expect anything like that this time?RAFFENSPERGER:  No.When did the first audit, we found mistakes in three counties. And thatadded over 1,000 votes for President Trump. And those were all added to histotals now. That has all been accounted for. And so I think this one willbe very close to what we just have now.So, I don't see much difference whatsoever. It'll be just run through thescanners again, and we will get those results to the American people and toboth campaigns.CAVUTO:  You know, you have been criticized, not by Democrats, Secretary,but by Republicans, leading with the president of the United States and thetwo Republican candidates, and indirectly the governor of Georgia, also aRepublican, that you mishandled this.How do you answer that?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, we have had record registrations this year. We havehad record turnout. We had record absentee turnout. We had record in our 16days of early voting, record turnout there, and then record voting onElection Day, all things we have record numbers.We have five million people that voted. Four years ago, it was about 4.1.So, we have had that. And we also defeated a big issue we have been havingin Georgia was long lines on Election Day. This year, the average wait wasonly two minutes in the afternoon.And I posted that on my Facebook page when we saw how short it was. So, wehave actually had so many successes. We also stood up an online portal, forthe first time introduced photo I.D. for absentee balloting. Over 400,000voters used that. So, it's very secure.CAVUTO:  Do you think you would be encountering any of this grief,Secretary, if there was a 12,000-vote right from the beginning in favor ofthe president?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, I think that many of us on the Republican side, wethought that our president would win in Georgia, and we thought that hewould win nationwide.And when that didn't happen, some people just can't handle that fact ofwhat happened in Georgia. But, at the end of the day, the job of the stateRepublican Party is to raise money and to turn out the vote. And thatdidn't happen.CAVUTO:  So, you think Donald Trump, no matter how many counts we gothrough, still lost the state of Georgia?RAFFENSPERGER:  I don't see how we could come to any other conclusion.We told the campaign, if they find instances of voter fraud, we will checkit out. We have not seen widespread, systemic voter fraud that wouldoverturn the results of the people.CAVUTO:  Now, the two Republican candidates for Senate and facing the run-off election on January 5, they thought you should resign.But I'm not quite clear why. What is it that they're saying you screwed up?RAFFENSPERGER:  I think they were just bending to pressure that they'regetting from the presidential campaign. And they're concerned that hissupporters wouldn't come out to support them.But it's really not a productive effort on their part. They need to getfocused and get at it, because these are two very well-financed Democraticcampaigns.But my job, as secretary of state, is to make sure that we have fair,accurate counting of the elections. And we're going to run our elections inGeorgia with integrity.CAVUTO:  So, the charges that they have not been run with integrity, andthat you somehow let this malfeasance go by, whatever it was, how do youanswer all of that?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, we have -- well, some people have talked about ourno-excuse absentee voting, which has been around since 2005.It has no photo I.D. But we brought in a portion of photo I.D. this yearwith our online portal. But, also, we strengthened signature match. Whenyou make your paper application, we signature-match it. And when you thensend in your ballot, there's also signature match.And we made sure that our election directors had the opportunity to get GBIsignature match training, so that we could have safe, secure processes. Wehave checked that. And then we have run the election. And we have gottenyour results very quickly.We are really proud of what we have done here in Georgia. Your electiondirectors have worked hard. We have 159 counties. They have really workedhard, with all the obstacles of COVID, new voting machines. We have averifiable paper ballot trail.We wouldn't be able to -- we would not be able to do audits if we wouldn'thave had this new paper ballot. And we are able to do a hand-count just toanswer the question about the accuracy of machines, because there werethese wild accusations, not supported in fact, just wild ruminations frompeople outside of the state of Georgia.CAVUTO:  Well, among those people is the president of the United States. Hehas singled you out.How do you feel about that?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, I understand that he's got 50 million Twitter --Twitter followers, and I have about 50.And so we...(LAUGHTER)RAFFENSPERGER:  I'm not going to do a lot of Twitter, because I'm not goingto win that war.(LAUGHTER)RAFFENSPERGER:  But, at the end of the day, it's not about that.What it is about, we have a process, we have a law. I'm going to followlaw. I have never voted for a Democrat in my life. But that doesn't meanthat I would ever want to do something that was not filled with integrity.We want to make sure that we follow the process, follow the law. I'm anengineer, and I'm going to make sure that we have a process that works forGeorgia. I'm not putting my thumb on the scale. The people will decide thiselection.CAVUTO:  Secretary, there are a lot of people who are looking at the back-and-forth and the intramural battle among Republicans as hurting theRepublican candidates for Senate in this run-off race.Are you concerned about that?RAFFENSPERGER:  I'm concerned.But they have picked the battle. We're doing our job. And you don't need tobe picking on me. You don't need to be picking on the election directors.Our election directors have been working really hard to make sure that wehave fair, honest elections.If you don't like honest elections, then you have got the problem. We havehonest elections.CAVUTO:  So, do you think the president, regardless of what happens inGeorgia, Secretary, and some of these other fights still raging inPennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where the legal team is looking ateither recounts or throwing away ballots, do you think the president iskind of at rope's end here, that he should concede this election to JoeBiden?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, we have 50 states, and we have 49 that I have nothingto handle. I have plenty on my plate with Georgia.I'm focused on what happens in Georgia. What President Trump wants to do inthe other states, that's his business. At the end of the day, we're goingto make sure that we have fair, honest elections.Integrity still matters here in Georgia.CAVUTO:  Brad Raffensperger, thank you very much, the secretary of state ofthe beautiful state of Georgia.But it's not been a beautiful or peachy time for him or those around him,as this count goes on and on and on, of course, the run-off election onJanuary 5, two Senate races at once.Secretary, thank you very, very much.RAFFENSPERGER:  Thank you, Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, in the meantime, at the corner of Wall and Broad,having nothing to do this, and everything to do with hope of still anothervaccine possibility, three or four, depending on what you're counting, theDow racing ahead 327 points. Across the board, we had significant gains.And, in the meantime, we were just mentioning Donald Trump not wanting toease up on these campaign legal fights. But the guy who won, or says he won-- and most agree he is on his way to becoming the next president of theUnited States -- way too busy doing something else, forming a Cabinet.He's almost halfway done -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it is unusual.President Trump, of course, became famous for announcing some Cabinet folkswere going via tweet. Didn't let them know directly. They would hear aboutthat.The guy who is going to be the next president of the United States has beenannouncing some of his biggest Cabinet appointments, again, via a tweet. Ofcourse, he's let them know about that ahead of time.But Hillary Vaughn joins us now from Wilmington with some of those picks asthey stand right now.Quite a few, Hillary.(LAUGHTER)HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Quite a few, Neil.President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet is filling up with a lot of familiarfaces. A lot of top roles on Biden's national security team are going toObama administration alumni, clearly an about-face from President Trump'sAmerica first foreign policy.Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, served as the secondin command at State as deputy secretary under the Obama/Bidenadministration. Biden's appointee for head of Homeland Security, AlejandroMayorkas, is also an Obama alum and took the lead in implementing DACA.Mayorkas is also the first Latino and immigrant to be nominated to the topjob at DHS.Biden is also appointing the first woman to be the director of nationalintelligence, Avril Haines. She worked as deputy CIA director under Obama.The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who's coming outof retirement to take this job.Biden's national security adviser will be Jake Sullivan, who served asHillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff while she was secretary of stateand was a key negotiator of the Iran nuclear deal.Some progressives, though, are underwhelmed with president-elect Biden'spicks for his national security team, but they are thrilled with Biden'sdecision to add a brand-new position to the National Security Councilfocused on climate. For the first time in history, the NSC will have aspecial presidential envoy for climate. Filling that role, former Secretaryof State John Kerry.Biden took time to meet with mayors around the U.S. today, saying this isnot a one-off meeting between them. He wanted to get information on whatthey need to handle a spike in COVID cases nationwide. And on his way intothe meeting this afternoon, he explained why he announced his foreignpolicy picks first.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  Do you expect Republicans to (OFF-MIKE) significant roadblocks(OFF-MIKE) to your nominations?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Are you kidding me?(LAUGHTER)QUESTION:  Why did you go with national security first?BIDEN:  Because it's national security.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN:  And, Neil, we are getting new information who could be Biden'sTreasury secretary.The Wall Street Journal reports that former Fed Chair Janet Yellen is hispick for Treasury. And that is significant, because that would be the firsttime that a woman has done that job. It's a role that's been filled bywhite men for over two centuries -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Yes, it's certainly a different looking Cabinet.Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much.Without getting into the particulars of who the president-elect has chosenfor his Cabinet, but maybe the tone of that Cabinet, let's go to MichaelDukakis. You remember him, the former Democratic presidential nominee in1988, 87 years young right now.That was as of Election Day, Governor?FMR. GOV. MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D-MA):  Right. That's right, Neil, yes.CAVUTO:  Belated happy...DUKAKIS:  It was a good -- it was a good birthday present, I can tell you.CAVUTO:  Belated happy birthday.DUKAKIS:  Thank you. Thank you.CAVUTO:  All right. So, I -- so, you were not for Donald Trump. I just wantto get that out of the way.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  So, Governor, without getting into the particulars of theseplayers here, some are saying it's a test of the incoming administration,whether it will yield is too strong a word, Governor, but maybe beinfluenced by the progressives in the party, who wanted a front-row seat.Now, the labor secretary spot hasn't been chosen yet, but Bernie Sanderswas reportedly interested in that. Talk that Elizabeth Warren wants aprominent role in that Cabinet.Again, without those individual names, Governor, your thoughts on whetherthis president-elect should populate that Cabinet in one way, shape, orform with more, I guess, progressives?What do you think?DUKAKIS:  Well, I don't know who people are talking about when they'retalking about progressives.I mean, I'm a progressive, I think. I'm -- grew -- I was born during theNew Deal, lived through the '50s, and I think was a relatively progressiveguy.On the other hand, some people will tell -- tell you that, when it came tocertain things, I was pretty conservative. And I think that's true of mostof us, Neil. I mean, it's not -- it's -- this notion that you're in thisslot or that slot or some other slot, I think, is really nuts.We want good people, solid people, people of integrity, people whoobviously have experience, which I think is a good thing. And this is goingto be a very well-balanced and pretty impressive administration, in myjudgment.CAVUTO:  You say you're a progressive. And I don't mean to disparage Joe. Imean, many times during the race and afterwards, I said you...(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  ... were chief progressive. You were very austere, very tight withthe money.DUKAKIS:  Yes.CAVUTO:  And I think, if you're a taxpayer, you value that.I guess, part of the -- what I'm thinking here -- and Republicans arehardly ones to lecture people on deficits. I get that. But, again, underDemocrat and Republican administrations alike, that's what's happened. Thedeficits have gotten out of control. Debt has gotten out of control.We're going to be talking to Sam Zell a little later on, who is veryworried about that.Are you worried about that, that there comes a moment here we have toaddress this, and the options aren't -- aren't wonderful?DUKAKIS:  Yes, of course I'm concerned about it.I mean, I had to listen to Donald Trump talk about what a fabulous guy hewas, and how he had created the best economy in the world, with a trillion-dollar deficit and full employment. I mean, have you ever heard anythingquite like that?OK, now we have got some serious problems, obviously, involving a veryserious public health problem and its impact. And that's going to have aneffect.But I never could understand why anybody thought that a guy like Trump knewwhat he was doing when it came to the economy, when he was at fullemployment, running a deficit of a trillion dollars.And, as you know, maybe it's my Greek heritage or the fact that Greekimmigrants, including my folks, are very tight when it comes to spending,but I was always a guy who cared very deeply about our fiscal integrity.And I think we have to, even though we, at least for the time being, aregoing to have to do some serious stimulus to get the economy back on track.But I'm quite optimistic about this whole situation, Neil. I mean, I thinkonce we get a vaccine, and people get out there and get vaccinated and soforth, I think we're going to snap back pretty quickly.CAVUTO:  All right, there are indications, looking at the economic numbers,that's already happening. The president, of course, would counter a lot ofwhat you just said, Governor, about the pandemic really brought deficitsand debt to a whole new level.But I'm just curious. The approach that the president-elect, Biden, istaking to this is, in that environment that you say is kind of dicey -- I'mjust paraphrasing your remarks -- would you hike taxes on anyone, the rich,the over $400,000 crowd, whatever? If things are so bad, should he hold offon that?DUKAKIS:  Not when there was a giveaway of an incredible amount of money tothe wealthiest people in the country under Trump. I mean, I think that canbe taken back, much of it, and should be. And I think Joe Biden wants to dothat.Will Congress go along with it? Well, we will see. But I thought that taxcut was outrageous.CAVUTO:  So, when you hear that, raising those taxes and the corporaterates from 21 to 28 percent, even bringing it back up to 28 percent, not tothe 35 percent it was at, Governor, as you know, there are many of thesecompanies who say, well, they won't be as competitive right now, and theymight not grow as much right now.What do you say to that?DUKAKIS:  Well, of course, we always hear that.But the tax cut itself was outrageous, never should have been voted in thefirst place. And we're going to need some of that money. And I think that'sa pretty place -- pretty good place to get it. Now...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  But for what? What would the money be used for?(LAUGHTER)DUKAKIS:  Well, among other things, paying our bills. And I think that'simportant.But I think one of the things you have to see...CAVUTO:  But do you think it will go to paying the bills, Governor? Isn'tthat the concern?I mean, when you were in Massachusetts for 12 years, you had a balancedbudget year and year out. Touche to that, one of the few that was able tomaintain that discipline.But the fact of the matter is, I mean, would that be enough? In otherwords, the money gained from a tax cut, which is supposedly going intoother areas, not debt relief, not deficits, does that worry, no matterwho's doing it? In this case, it would be a Joe Biden.DUKAKIS:  Not to take back what I thought was an outrageous tax cut thatbenefit largely the wealthy. I don't -- I don't have a problem with that.And I think we ought to do it.But, at the same time, you got to do it carefully. You got to do it well.Obviously, we want to come out of this current whatever it is in a way thatwill get the country back on track as soon as possible and responsibly,something which did not happen under Trump, and is one of the reasons whywe ended up with a deficit of a trillion dollars, while the economy was in"relatively good shape" -- quote, unquote.So, I think -- I think there can be some work done on that. And I think youwill probably see that under a Biden administration. On the other hand, youhave got to be careful, and you have got to handle it carefully. And Ithink -- I think he will do that.CAVUTO:  All right, we shall see. Time will tell, as they say, right?That's a trite line.But happy birthday, Governor, again.DUKAKIS:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  We will see how all of this transpires, 87 years young.DUKAKIS:  Thank you so much.CAVUTO:  Governor Michael Dukakis, beautiful state of Massachusetts.All right, when we come back here, I told you about the vaccines. I toldyou about the promise and all of that, but left out of that equation arethe lockdowns that are going on across the country right now, limits on howmany you can have over to your house for Thanksgiving.But to force the issue, to force that, to see a police officer tap on yourdoor to count how many are in your house?Some governors are proposing just that -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, how are they going to know how many you have at yourhouse for Thanksgiving, if it's fewer than 10 people, no more than sixpeople?Well, the governor of Oregon has an idea. Your neighbors can snitch on you,in fact, welcoming the idea -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  I believe that law enforcement officer violateshis or her constitutional duty. I don't consider them a law enforcementofficer, because you don't have the right to pick laws that you think youwill enforce and you don't enforce laws that you don't agree with, right?That's not a law enforcement officer. That's a dictator.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, so that's Governor Cuomo his way of saying, even thoughthere are some Upstate police officers in New York who are saying, we'renot going to enforce a policy that says you limit the number of people at ahouse, we're not going to tap on the door and start counting heads here.But that does seem to be a popular trend among many governors who aretrying to crack down on this sort of thing, including Oregon's governorBrown, Kate Brown, who has said that she is encouraging neighbors to callpolice if they see that those next door are getting a little too crowded onthe Thanksgiving holiday.Jim Trusty joins us right now, the federal prosecutor.Jim, how enforceable is any of this?JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Well, it's enforceable in theshort term, to the extent that you have law enforcement officers that arewilling to carry out Thanksgiving Day raids on households with sevenpeople.So, you're already hearing a lot of resistance, proper resistance fromfolks in Oregon, for instance, about the notion of actually enforcing theselaws.Ultimately, I think a lot of it's unconstitutional. It's creating -- usingemergency powers to create executive orders that reach into people's homes,the most sacred -- sacrosanct part of constitutional law when it comes toprivacy.And what you have typically are state legislators with enabling legislationthat says, if you fail to obey an executive order, that's a misdemeanor.Well, that's not the same as the legislature passing a law. It is carteblanche to some degree for these governors.But, ultimately, if it ever winds its way into court, I think these thingsself-destruct pretty quickly.CAVUTO:  Yes, that's what I wanted to know, because a lot of thesegovernors pushing this are saying they're breaking the law, but it's anedict. It's an executive edict. It isn't the law, is it?TRUSTY:  That's exactly right. I mean, it's an executive order.And, somehow, we have gotten used to this concept of executives passingessentially laws that carry even potential criminal penalties, even ifthey're short-lived. Like, this one's supposed to be two weeks in Oregon,before it gets extended.Well, the courts that have started looking at this have not been toofriendly towards these governors. You have had actions in Wisconsin andMichigan that overturned as an overreach some of these executive orders onseparation of powers grounds.In federal court in Pennsylvania, you had one where it was basically turnedupside down on due process and equal protection laws, which call for thestate to take narrowly tailored enforcement actions when it comes to thingslike emergencies. And having a whole state tune out with six people or lessis not exactly narrowly tailored.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Jim. Crazy stuff, but these arecrazy times.Jim Trusty, former prosecutor.TRUSTY:  Right.CAVUTO:  When we come back, the CDC already warned, don't travel, don't gofar. Certainly, don't fly. But people are traveling, they are flying. Whatare the risks they're taking?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, million taking to the nation's airports thisThanksgiving a week.Jeff Flock seeing it up close and personal at Chicago's O'HareInternational Airport -- Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Neil, this ishow the CDC would like the Thanksgiving holiday to look in terms of theairport. There's nobody in line right now. It's actually a slow Monday.But the weekend, that was a different story. But, first, before we startthere, let's say what the CDC is saying. They say, if people travel by airover the holiday, tragedy could happen.CDC is recommending against travel during the Thanksgiving period. They sayone of your family members could end up being hospitalized and severely illand die. How did the traveling public respond to that? Well, on Sunday, apandemic record, over a million people through the TSA checkpoints,1,047,000 people, a new record, still nowhere near a typical Sunday thistime of the year, but still a lot of people.And the travelers that we talk to say they think they feel safe.Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It feels honestly cleaner here than it does at like astore or anything like that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's the safest place right now. I mean, they're verystrict on their COVID procedures. And it was time to get away.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's been one-and-a-half years we haven't seen herand her family.FLOCK:  Wow.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And we're taking precautions, as you see.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got to live your life, at the end of the day.(END VIDEO CLIP)FLOCK:  You know, people are not being stupid about this, I think, Neil.When you go to the airport, people are doing as I am here, because it'srequired here at O'Hare, as well as other airports. You have to have a maskon. You need to socially distance. You need to be smart about it, wash yourhands, do all those things.But if you do it, people seem to believe that they will be safe if theymove forward, not as many people as typical, but people seem to be willingto take the risk and travel over the Thanksgiving holiday -- Neil.CAVUTO:  And it could be risky, to your point.Jeff Flock, thank you very, very much in Chicago.The former acting CDC director on what those risks could be, not just tothe flyers, but who those flyers encounter.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, the CDC could not be any more clear: Just don't travel.Just don't go to another family's house, your own included, forThanksgiving. Keep it small. Keep it under 10, some states saying keep itto no more than six.Want to get the read on all of this from the former acting CDC Director Dr.Richard Besser.Doctor, good to have you back with us.What's behind these guidelines? Because a lot of people still chafe atthem. And, given the fact that millions are traveling this week, they'renot going to pay attention to that. What do you think of all that?DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ANDPREVENTION:  Well, I sure wish, Neil, that the CDC had had a chance to havea press conference and talk this through, so that there could be moreexplanation as to why they're taking such a hard stance.If you look at the heat map for COVID across the nation, it's pretty clear.This is a raging pandemic right now. We're seeing so many hospitals atcapacity, and in particular in the Midwest, but rising across the nation.And the big concern is that these family Thanksgiving gatherings --Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, hands down. But these gatherings couldbecome super-spreader events, or, if not even super-spreader, spreaderevents from relatives to elderly relatives, who could be at really highrisk.CAVUTO:  So, do you get any sense, Doctor, looking at all of this, thatpeople are smart enough to sort of spread out in the house?What are the risks, if they're doing what they would normally do if theywent to a restaurant, if they went inside a business, that this sort ofstrong-arming, as many see it and are going to refuse to follow it, justannoys them?BESSER:  Yes.Yes, it's -- strong-arming doesn't work. It's not a way for behaviorchange. You have to capture people's hearts. And if you capture theirhearts, then behavior will follow.We normally have 20 to 30 people at our house for Thanksgiving. And, thisyear, we're going to have three. One of our sons got tested and could drivehere. So, he's here with us. Our other son, he canceled his air travel. Andmy parents are both 90. They live about two miles from our house, and we'regoing to drop food off at their house, because the risk is just too great.This is the period. I have never been more optimistic and more pessimistic.I'm optimistic because the vaccine data that are coming forward isabsolutely fantastic and lets me have a sense that we're going to reach theend of this, that late spring, summer, we're going to see real changes.But I'm pessimistic because people are just so tired of this.CAVUTO:  Yes.BESSER:  And it's understandable.Nine months of having to change your life, not be able to do your things.The holidays are here. You want to see people. You're -- everyone's beenhurting this year. You understand why people don't want to follow theserecommendations.But if we can come together as a nation for a few more months, and buckledown, we could save tens of thousands of lives. And one of those livescould be your relative. That's how -- that's how you have to connect withpeople on this.But I understand people's frustration. Everyone is just sick of it.CAVUTO:  Yes, they are, but food for thought on the whole meal thing.See what I did there, Doctor? Food for thought.Thanks.BESSER:  Yes.CAVUTO:  Anyway, that's basic stuff on cable.All right, Doctor, very good seeing you again. Hope you have a safe andhealthy Thanksgiving.Meanwhile, Sam Zell, you remember him, business titan, sees opportunitiesin real estate everywhere, what's going on in the cities.But Sam's here to talk about something very different. All this money wewant to spend on more stimulus, he has a simple question. Where is thatmoney?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, Sam Zell, a name you probably know, really invented thereal estate investment trust, you think about it, a mechanism by which youcould look at real estate investments and see the promise on the commercialside, residential side.It grew to expand into a host of other areas. So, he knows what he's doingwhen it comes to money. And he's worried what's happening in Washingtonright now, because, well, they're technically out of money. They have beenout of money for a long time, with deficits in the trillions of dollars anddebt approaching $30 trillion.And he's concerned that, if we don't do something about that, we're in deepdoo-doo.Sam Zell, Equity Group Investments' founder and chairman, with us rightnow.Sam, thank you for taking the time. Good to see you.You're worried about this debt? What do you think the president-electshould do about it?SAM ZELL, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, EQUITY GROUP INVESTMENTS:  Well, I thinkthat the real key is that he shouldn't ignore it.It's one thing to stimulate in the era of a pandemic, but it requires anadjustment once that pandemic is over. I think that more stimulus isprobably caught for now, nowhere near as much as been suggested.But once we're through this, we have to make sure that we get debtunderlined. In the end, if we don't, then we jeopardize the reservecurrency status of the U.S. dollar, which would materially reduce ourstandard of living.CAVUTO:  But you think about it, Sam, you and I have talked for years,decades about this exploding debt. And under Republican and Democraticpresidents, it just keeps exploding.ZELL:  Yes.CAVUTO:  And a lot of people say, well, then interest rates are very, verylow. Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal.What do you say to that?ZELL:  Well, I think there have been plenty of times in history where otherpeople have said, don't worry about it, and it comes back to catch them.And, in the end that, for roughly 30 years, the average risk-free rate was5.6 percent. If we had to pay 5.6 percent on our debt levels today, wewould be broke.CAVUTO:  Right.ZELL:  Maybe we're broke anyway, but that would accelerate the process.CAVUTO:  What do you think would happen if we started paying off our debt,paring down our deficits?You think back to the Clinton administration, when we were starting to dothat, freed up a lot of money. I know that's part of what you're worriedabout. We don't have much room because of -- with all we owe. But what doyou think would happen? What do you think the markets would do? What do youthink we would, as a people, do?ZELL:  Well, paying off debt is also somewhat deflationary.What we need is, we need significant growth that generates tax receipts tothe government that would allow us to pay off our debt. If our growth ratewas 6 percent, instead of 1.5 percent, we'd have a much better ability toget our debt in line.CAVUTO:  We might get back to those days. I don't know.But I did want to pick your brain a little bit on what's going on in citiesand real estate in general, corporate real estate, that has been reallywalloped. People don't want to go back into cities. There is concern thatit's not a safe place to be, not a good place to be. So, they're avoidingit.Are you worried for our nation's cities?ZELL:  Not really.I mean, this is just like every other dramatic change, where, all of asudden, the prognosticators predict the end of the world. We're socialanimals. The reason we have created cities is because we appreciate theurban life. Walking scores are still the governing factor.And I think the population will come back and be very favorable to citiesas soon as this pandemic is over.CAVUTO:  Sam, a lot of people are looking at the incoming Bidenadministration and what it's going to do.It does want to raise taxes, that is, the president-elect wants to raisetaxes on the $400,000-and-over crowd, the Sam Zell crowd, I might add, andcorporations should pay more in taxes. How do you feel about that?ZELL:  Well, again, my answer to that is the same as before.Our country is predicated or developed and built on growth. If we havegrowth, then everybody can afford to pay more tax. If we focus too much onredistribution, that artificially depresses growth. That ultimatelytranslates into the kinds of problems we have had.CAVUTO:  Sam, the markets have been on a tear. The Dow isn't that far froma record, the S&P, the Nasdaq in and out of record territory.Do you like this market?ZELL:  I like the fact that it's not going down.(LAUGHTER)ZELL:  But I think that the market -- the market has a little too muchfroth in it.CAVUTO:  Really?ZELL:  there's a lot of speculation. There is a lot of $2 stocks thatbecome $6 stocks.The fact that the entire up nature of the market since the beginning theyear has been limited to the FAANG stocks, that's not a healthy level ofdiversity. And it's a diverse growing market that ultimately is whattriggers and promotes growth.CAVUTO:  Sam, I know you don't like to talk about politics, but I look atthe economic side, if you will.One of the things that's very clear in hearing some of the people that JoeBiden has already announced for his Cabinet is, it's kind of back to wherewe were before Donald Trump, rejoining the climate change accord, gettingmore engaged in -- with our European neighbors, the -- stopping the tradefights and all of that.What do you think of that approach, to become the world citizen again? I'mprobably loosely defining what he's up to, but the approach he's taking vs.Donald Trump?ZELL:  Well, I have never been an advocate of not being a world citizen.I have historically been very, very favorable to immigration, I think --I'm an immigrant's kid. So there's a lot of things that occurred in theTrump era that might not necessarily represent what I think.I think bringing our country more in line with the rest of the world, Ithink, is a positive thing. Bringing it too in line, which I think we wereat some point, has a lot of consequences.'I mean, I think that we -- to the Trump administration's credit, they havetaken on the China problem. Well, the China problem began when we allowedthem into the WTO without any commitment from them in 2002. It took until2016 and the devastation of our manufacturing base before we came to gripswith it.CAVUTO:  All right.All right, we will watch closely what happens.Sam, great catching up with you. Continued success.ZELL:  Great.CAVUTO:  Sam Zell calls them as he sees them.By the way, real quickly, Michigan's election board has certified a victoryfor Joe Biden, yet another setback for team Trump.Here comes more FOX and "THE FIVE."Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
