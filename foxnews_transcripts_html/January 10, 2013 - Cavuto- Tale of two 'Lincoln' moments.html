The movie about the former president, cleaning up with 12 Oscar nods, clearly lost on another president, teeing up with one more hardly-Oscar worthy pick
Think about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

A movie based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's "Team of Rivals" about a president surrounding himself with a Cabinet of strong-willed individuals, many of whom campaigned for his very job, basking in Oscar nomination glow this day; while another president adds a not-so-memorable addition to what's become a Cabinet of retreads. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now that is not to say Jack Lew doesn't fit in the treasury secretary box. I just thought now might be a very good time for this president to pull a Lincoln and think outside the box. Not with another predictable yes-man, who'd do the president's bidding, but an outside Washington businessman, who'd maybe challenge the president's thinking. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It was Lincoln who calculated "more of the same" just gets you, well, more of the same. He dared to break from his comfort zone by picking a Cabinet that might make lesser leaders feel uncomfortable.
But it didn't make Lincoln any less a leader. From the very folks who challenged him, it made him even more of one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It just seems sad that on a day a movie that heralds that president is found so significant, that our latest president adds to a Cabinet that increasingly seems so... insignificant.  </pre>
