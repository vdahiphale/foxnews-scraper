Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute.
How weak. At least they could step up and vote. I'm talking about our friends in Europe and that midnight vote at the U.N. by its Human Rights Counsel. It was a vote on a heavily one-sided resolution condemning Israel in its actions against Hamas. It said zero about Hamas doing anything wrong, whatsoever, like using civilians as human shields. Twenty-nine nations voted to condemn Israel. Only one nation voted against it. We did. The United States. And good for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The United States stepped up and voted against condemning Israel. We don't forget our friends. But what is disturbing is the weak and cowardly E.U. members not voting, instead, abstaining, just sticking their hands in the sand. Nine European countries did that, including France, Ireland, Italy, Great Britain, Germany. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
These countries didn't have the guts to vote and don't have the courage to vote "no" to condemning Israel. So they hide. Says a lot about our country, don't you think? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
