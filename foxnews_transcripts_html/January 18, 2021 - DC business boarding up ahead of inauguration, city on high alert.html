NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, all eyes right now on thepresident-elect and what he plans to do, we're hearing now, within hours ofhis swearing-in on Wednesday. Can you say executive orders?Donald Trump used quite a few of them. Now we're hearing Joe Biden will usequite a few to undo them. Among the things we're hearing is an executiveorder to rejoin the Paris climate accords, another to repeal the PresidentTrump ban on U.S. entry for citizens coming in from majority Muslimcountries, still another to extend a moratorium on foreclosures againstAmericans, and still another to extend renter protections facing the sameplight.Don't even get started on the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan that will likelybe introduced only days later. It is a busy agenda. It is a busy first 100days, and it takes off in little more than two days.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD on top first ofwhat the soon-to-be-new commander in chief has in store for what will be ablitzkrieg-like start.Peter Doocy with what he's hearing.Hey, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, good afternoon.The next administration is no longer talking just about this return tonormalcy that Joe Biden spoke so much about on the campaign trail, becausewe just heard from Kamala Harris she is talking about big, profoundstructural changes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We're going intoWednesday knowing that we're getting -- we're ready to do the work.And we have got a lot of work to do. It's not going to be easy. As we havediscussed, Joe has outlined our plan for vaccinations, our plan forrecovery, and in particular relief for working people, for families.And there's a lot to do. Some would say that ours is an ambitious goal, butwe do believe, with hard work and with the cooperation and collaboration ofthe members of the United States Congress, that we can get it done.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  There are many executive orders on the way within the next twoweeks aimed at getting tougher on climate change, softer on certainimmigration restrictions, and making health care easier to access.These are all separate from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan thataddresses direct relief for struggling Americans, but also a tax on moneyfor cybersecurity and forces employers to pay employees $15 an hour as aminimum wage.Where does all that money come from? Well, some of it, tax hikes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Asking everyone to pay their fair share atthe top, so we can make permanent investments to rescue and rebuildAmerica, it's the right thing for our economy. It's the fair thing. It'sthe decent thing to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  We were on a Zoom call today with the Biden Inaugural Committee.They had been teasing a big announcement today. And they revealed on thiscall that Garth Brooks will be performing here on Wednesday -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Add it to a long lineup.All right, thank you, Peter, very, very much, Peter Doocy at the WhiteHouse.In the meantime, we have got Francesca Chambers here, McClatchy White Housecorrespondent, also Bob Cusack of The Hill.Francesca, obviously, the administration plans to have a busy start, andincluding doing everything it said it wanted to do, which, by the way,includes those big tax hikes. They're not going to be put off. Indicationsare that they might have a bumpy reception in Congress and a 50/50 Senate,but, in other words, no sign yet from the Biden folks that the tax hikesare put off.What do you think?FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, MCCLATCHY D.C.:  Well, what we have heard from RonKlain, the incoming White House chief of staff, is that Joe Biden will useat least a dozen executive orders on his first day in office, Neil, andthen, over the next 10 days, he will be doing a whole lot more of thoseexecutive actions.The people he's close to, like James Clyburn, have encouraged him to use asmuch executive authority as he possibly can. He said that he encouragedBarack Obama to do the same thing. But he didn't use as much executiveaction as Clyburn would have liked. And that's his advice to Biden for howto get some things done when he faces potential gridlock from Congress.CAVUTO:  You know, in talking to Clyburn not too long ago, Bob, the onething he left with me was the notion, by all means, try to work withRepublicans, as Francesca outlined, but, if you're going nowhere, go theexecutive order route, force the issue, maybe blow up the filibuster,anything and everything it takes.If you think about it, administrations in recent memory have been chippingaway at the whole filibuster thing. Joe Biden could be the president tofinally put a stake in it and call it a day.What do you think?BOB CUSACK, THE HILL:  He could, Neil.I mean, Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia, said he doesnot want to do that.But there's so much pressure on Joe Biden to get stuff done, and not justexecutive orders and regulations, which he can do, and trade policies, butgetting big package deals like the $1.9 trillion bill through Congress.And, remember, these are narrow majorities. Republicans could easily winback the House and Senate in a couple years. Do they really have anincentive to make deals? And that opens a question to, well, if you're notgoing to make deals, Republicans, then we might have to get rid of thefilibuster, or at least curb it in some way.CAVUTO:  You know, it is an aggressive agenda, to your point, Francesca,earlier. And you will have these impeachment hearings they want to keep --or at least many Democrats want to keep, by having the Senate take up atrial to finish what the House did.Do you get any sense from the Biden folks whether that might rob from thetime they have not only to get members of the president-elect's Cabinetthrough, but to do all this other stuff you have both pointed out?CHAMBERS:  Certainly, there's an effort under way to kind of bifurcate thetime, so to speak, to where they could have an impeachment trial, but alsotry to get members of the Cabinet passed through.But, as you just pointed out, Neil, there is also this COVID relief packagethat he would like to get done as soon as possible, because,when thepackage was passed before, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumerdescribed it as a first step and roughly a down payment.And they said that, when Joe Biden got into office, he would get a betterdeal. And so Democrats are counting on that at this point. And he will haveto move very quickly on that. And, as you pointed out, an impeachment trialis certainly something that would make that more difficult for him. TheSenate only has so much time on their hands.CAVUTO:  You know, it brings up a question that touched on how difficult itis to get an agenda through in a 50/50 Senate, even with the vice presidentcast as a tiebreaker.And, Bob, it applies to progresses more in the party who could bedisruptive, who might not think -- in fact, Bernie Sanders has said as much-- that the $1.9 trillion plan isn't rich enough. Still criticism on thepart of many progressives that the president-elect should prove that he canwalk and chew gum at the same time and pursue this impeachment issueagainst his predecessor.So, I'm just wondering if the real trouble for the incoming presidentcouldn't be within his own party.CUSACK:  Oh, it could very well be, Neil.He's going to have to -- Joe Biden's going to have to deal with his leftflank. Now, in his Cabinet picks. He didn't pick a Republican. Usually,there's one -- a person of the opposing party. However, there's also noBernie Sanders, who wanted to be in the Cabinet, or Elizabeth Warren.These are mostly Obama insiders, people who have been in government before.But they're not hugely way left. So, Joe Biden's already dealing with somegrumbling on the left, and that's going to get louder in the coming weeks.CAVUTO:  Bob, final word.Francesca, thank you very much.Only a couple of days away from all of this going forward. We will see howit goes forward, but some history could be very well in the making here,but not before, of course, Donald Trump leaves office, where we're gettingword that a couple of big things he plans to do before he formally leavesthe White House, and that is issue what could be quite a few pardons,commutations.Kristin Fisher with that at the White House.Hey, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, President Trump is expected to issue between 50 and 100 commutationsand pardons before he leaves office. And that's according to multiplepeople who are familiar with the list.But he is not expected to issue a preemptive pardon for himself or formembers of his family. Now, one of the most high-profile names that hasbeen discussed in this latest final round of pardons was Julian Assange.But despite an aggressive campaign by WikiLeaks to try to secure a pardonfor its founder, President Trump is not expected to give him one. He isexpected to grant a pardon for the rapper Lil Wayne, who pleaded guiltythis year to a federal gun charge.And then there's the president's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, whowas arrested on fraud charges over the summer. Unclear, though, at thispoint if Bannon will get one.Now, there has been some discussion about President Trump possiblypardoning some of the people who stormed the Capitol back on January 6.But, over the weekend, Republican senator Lindsey Graham said he thoughtthat was a terrible idea. He thought that it would -- quote -- "destroyPresident Trump."So, it looks unlikely like that will be the case, at least right now. But,Neil, as you know, President Trump could always change his mind at amoment's notice.Now, in terms of timing, tomorrow is, of course, President Trump's finalfull day in office. And that is when we believe that a lot of these pardonsand commutations are going to come down. And there was a meeting here atthe White House on Saturday to really finalize that list.But, Neil, President Trump, he has until noon Wednesday to do it, but we dothink that tomorrow is going to be the day that all of this comes down --Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Kristin, we will be watching very closely, KristinFisher at the White House.In the meantime here, they're getting ready for anything and everything.You hear a lot about the beefed-up security in the nation's capital, betterthan 25,000 National Guard troops and the rest, a lot more Capitol Policethan would typically be the case, and then this other chatter they'rehearing about things that could go down in state capitals, that the U.S.Capitol is locked down like a drum, but what about state capitals and otherstates in general?We will pursue that -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it is an understatement to say there's unprecedentedsecurity beefed up in the nation's capital.A lot of people say you have to go back to 1861, right before the start ofthe Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln was being inaugurated and had to besecreted into Washington to make sure nothing happened to him.That was then. It's a different environment now, but a testy one just thesameRich Edson in Washington, D.C., in the middle of all of that.Hey, Rich.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey. Good afternoon, Neil.And it is a massive security presence here, and it's still growing; 21,000-plus National Guard members are already here, with thousands more on theway. And defense officials say they're examining those Guard members toensure against any potential insider threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM WALKER, COMMANDING GENERAL, NATIONAL GUARD:  In anabundance of caution, we are definitely -- we want to make sure that wehave the right people in this security bubble.And we have the time and the ability to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON:  Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller adds in a statement -- quote-- "While we have no intelligence indicating an insider threat, we areleaving no stone unturned in securing the Capitol."Police say they have already made a handful of arrests at these securitycheckpoints, including this weekend a 22-year-old for carrying a pistolwithout a license. And, on Friday, when Capitol Police say they intercepteda driver who had a handgun and ammunition, the Washington Post interviewthat driver, said he was working security in D.C., rushing to work, andforgot he had his firearm in the truck.Homeland Security officials say they're concerned about threats here in thenation's capital, though much of the focus is on state capitals around thecountry. The National Guard says governors have activated more than 33,000National Guard members to both work security, but also for COVID-19 --Neil, back to you.CAVUTO:  Rich, I'm curious.How close can you physically, just on feet, get to the Capitol?EDSON:  So, this is third street, means that we're three blocks away fromthe Capitol Building right here.That yellow tape right there -- and these folks have been around herethroughout the day -- you come early in the weekend or Friday, Thursday,you can get even one block closer to the Capitol Building. But they havebeen moving that perimeter out. Sometimes, people can walk in and out, but,for the most part, that's now been extended to three blocks out from theCapitol.And there is a massive perimeter all the way not around only the CapitolBuilding, but the House and Senate office buildings that are on either sidehere. You get this all the way around the city here, and then all the wayaround the National Mall as well.It is a massive, massive presence in D.C.CAVUTO:  Just incredible.Thank you, my friend, very much. Great reporting.Rich Edson in the middle of all of that, as I said.I want to get the read on what Jeff Lanza thinks of all of this, Jeff, ofcourse, a former FBI agent, very helpful when it comes to security and justwhat potential bad guys could be considering.Jeff, thank you for taking the time.Now, that's a widening cordoned-off area, I guess not -- no surprise there.But it will get wider still by Inauguration Day. What do you make of allthis?JEFF LANZA, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, it's -- as you said earlier,it's unprecedented in our times.You have to go back over 100 years maybe to compare a situation like this.So -- but I think, based on what happened on January 6, we're going to seea little bit different of preparation. I mean, you could throw plans outthe window, but planning is important. You have to plan for emergencies,plan for contingencies, plan for the worst that can happen.They didn't do that on the 6th, but they're doing that now around thenation's capital and then also state capitals as well.CAVUTO:  Now, they were concerned, I know, this weekend that there would besome protests that might pop up certainly in the capital and othercapitals, really nothing to any substantial or even worrisome degree.What do you think?LANZA:  I agree with that assessment.But, like I just mentioned, you just don't know. You have to prepare forthe worst side of things to happen. And the FBI's Christopher Wray, thedirector, has already said -- in the last couple of days, he said that theyhave been receiving a significant amount of information and pushing it outto the local law enforcement agencies.Now, we're talking about state areas now, state capitals, all 50 statecapitals, and letting them know the information that they have received tohelp prepare for that. Now, there's less social media for the -- anyonewith potential violent intentions to communicate now...CAVUTO:  Yes.LANZA:  ... because Facebook, at the very minimum, and others are shuttingsome of those communication channels down that talk about things, certainkeywords that are hit upon.So, that's a double-edged sword for law enforcement. It helps that maybethe people with violent intentions can't communicate with one another aseasily in those media sites or those venues, but it makes it more difficultfor law enforcement to gather intelligence.Now, there are alternative sites which law enforcement can monitor, as wellas the human intelligence. And that's a big part that we can't forget. Youcan monitor chatter, but human intelligence is more important. And you gotto believe that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies has people makepotentially close enough to the planners where they can get some reallygood intelligence, not just what's being put out in the form of chatter onsocial media.CAVUTO:  Yes, it is ironic, you pointed out here. By social media shuttingdown this type of talk. Forgot about the violent talk, but then compressingit to almost all conservative -- conservative comments or Donald Trump-friendly comments.They have actually made all these guys who might be contemplating that gounderground. How do they track that type of stuff, if it's not through thetraditional avenues?LANZA:  Right.So, the FBI, I mean, they know what the conservative -- or -- excuse me --what the alternative sites are. And the biggest fear, though, of lawenforcement -- and this goes back now years -- is encrypted communications,so the encrypted chat rooms, the encrypted messaging sites that theindividuals can use to communicate that may be more difficult for lawenforcement than to monitor to see what's going on with the planning is.So, that's more of a worry is -- are those encrypted communications. Butthe alternative social media sites, the less well-known sites, the FBIknows what those are. They have been monitoring those as well. And aspeople break off and splinter into those sites, the FBI will gather thatintelligence.But, again, that's no substitute for good human intelligence, people thatmay be involved in these groups that are reporting their intentions in avery timely manner.CAVUTO:  Jeff Lanza, thank you very much, my friend.Jeff Lanza, the former FBI agent, on all of these developments.We will, of course, keep you posted on those developments and pursue thisissue of chatter that you hear so much about to keep people on guard, justin case.All right, 100 million doses of vaccines out to the America people in thefirst 100 days of Joe Biden's administration. Is it doable? Dr. Fauci saysit is. But everything's got to be falling into place. And, right now, it isnot -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Note to the incoming Biden administration, a lot of violence inGuatemala, fighting right now with police, and a lot of them are heading upnorth. They think he will be a friendlier judge at the border. Will he?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, good for Joe Biden thinking big, 100 million doses, getthem out within the first 100 days.But the fact is, 30 million vaccine doses have been distributed to thestates as of now, but far less than half of those have been used thus far.So, how do we improve on the problem that has bedeviled 50 states having 50different set of rules for all of this?Is the issue to federalize it and get a common, one standard that everyonecan follow? That's an issue for the incoming president.Let's get the read on whether that's going to work with Dr. Bob Lahita, theSt. Joseph University Hospital chairman of medicine, New York MedicalCollege professor of medicine, much, much more.Doctor, always great to see you.What do you think of that goal of Joe Biden's to get all those doses out inhis first 100 days?DR. BOB LAHITA, ST. JOSEPH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL:  Neil. I think that's agreat goal, and I think it's doable. And I think it should be federalized.I have to say that. There's -- it's important to get pods wherevaccinations can be given 24/7 round the clock. Train people. Even trainNational Guard people to give the injections, if that's necessary, and havesome mega-sites.Each state should have mega-sites. Those mega-sites can encompass quite afew thousand people. And that can be done thousands of people a day. Andthat can be achieved. A hundred million vaccine doses can be given. Ibelieve it's possible. So does Tony Fauci, by the way.CAVUTO:  Yes, you're right. I heard of that, too.Doctor, I mean, I think you and I are in the Tri-State, New York, NewJersey, Connecticut area, three states that have three different sets ofrules about who gets what and when. So, I think that creates this confusingpolicy.LAHITA:  Yes.CAVUTO:  And I'm wondering, if it's a standard that anyone 65 and older,for example, gets this, anyone with -- let's say, in a nursing home or atreatment center gets this.LAHITA:  Yes.CAVUTO:  But do we need to make it that explicit and that clear, so thatthere are no ifs, ands or buts?LAHITA:  Yes, unfortunately, Neil, we have to make it very clear.You know how the public is and you know how states are. Everybody's doingtheir own thing, particularly in New York state, where things haven't gonevery smoothly. And that's really, really important.CAVUTO:  Right.LAHITA:  It's important to do it right and do it with one rule, andidentifying the subgroups with comorbidities, et cetera, very, veryimportant.CAVUTO:  Do you get a sense, Doctor? I know the incoming CDC chief said sheexpected half-a-million deaths in the U.S. by mid-February.Then, I was trying to crunch the numbers in my head, at the rate we'regoing, that she might not be too far off. But how is that still happening?What has happened? Is it the variant of this that's gotten it? Is it moretesting? Is it -- because it just seems to be out of control when you hearthose type of numbers.LAHITA:  Well, I think, Neil, people are fatigued, so they're not socialdistancing, they're not washing their hands, and they're not wearing masksin various parts of the country.So, because mitigation is not happening, that, coupled with the fact thatwe have a new variant, the British variant, and now the South Africanvariant coming down the pike, these are variants of the virus that arehighly infective.In other words, if you have a larger number of people who are infected,obviously, you're going to have more deaths, and that's what's happening.And this variant also likes young people, just as it does elderly people.So it sticks to the receptor very tightly and causes major problems.So, I expect to see a big surge going forward until we can get these peoplevaccinated. And that's why a federal program is essential.CAVUTO:  All right, so, very quickly, those who get vaccinated might feelthat they're super man or woman, and then not bother with masks and all ofthat, because, well, they're bulletproof.LAHITA:  Yes.CAVUTO:  No one can get it from them, they can't get it from anyone else.What do you tell them?LAHITA:  I tell them to keep wearing the mask, because they are notinvulnerable.Remember, it's percentages. It's 90 percent effective. In fact, the newAstraZeneca is 90 percent effective. The Moderna and Pfizer are both 94 and95 percent effective. But there's that 5 to 6 percent range where thevaccine is -- may not be effective.And everybody is different. Everybody's immune system is theirs and it'sdifferent. So, wear a mask, even if you have been immunized. Wash yourhands, so you can't give the virus to somebody else. It may not affect you,but you can still transmit it.CAVUTO:  All right, Doctor, always good catching up and getting the soundadvice, Dr. Bob Lahita. Very reassuring words there.Everyone, don't take anything for granted.All right, well, imagine being a small business these days, particularly inthe Washington, D.C., area. You have been dealing with the pandemic, theslowdown in the economy, of course, crime, which was rampant not too longago, but things have stabilized. And now they're all but shutting down thecapital for a few days, and maybe longer.What do you do? We will talk to a business owner -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, imagine being a business in Washington, D.C., thesedays.First of all, you have been dealing with a pandemic. And that's been anightmare. And now the city is boarding up and all but shutting you down,in the middle of all of this, right up to and maybe past the inauguration,Steve Harrigan with more on how those preps are going.Hey, Steve.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, all across this part of thecity, this is the scene you see, restaurants, hotels, businesses, plywood,boarding up those windows like before a storm, but these owners are afraidtheir windows are going to get smashed.Ordinarily, inauguration week is great, especially for restaurants. Ownerstell us they make 200, 300 percent a night off their normal take. But thisinauguration, at least from a business point of view, is shaping up to bepotentially the worst ever.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MORAN, CLYDE'S RESTAURANT GROUP:  Without a doubt our busiest time inour restaurant's history, not only January 20, but a couple days before, acouple days after. You add those up in these two restaurants, we do about amillion dollars in sales.And that's not just the sales part. That's all our staff making that money,all the suppliers and vendors who sell us products. So, unfortunately, thisyear, it is zero.(END VIDEO CLIP)HARRIGAN:  We heard that point over and over again.It's not just the owners. It's really a chain reaction, with employees andsuppliers hurt as well. We have spoken to a few places who are trying tostay open. They say it's a real hurdle for employees even to make it to thebusiness. That's because there are so many roadblocks.Employees getting there and feeling safe while they're there has been areal hard time. And especially after 10 months of COVID, people thought,maybe we will get a boost during inauguration week. But it doesn't looklike that's going to happen -- Neil, back to you.CAVUTO:  Steve Harrigan, thank you very, very much.One of those business owners who is worried, to put it mildly, because ofall of this is above Bob Materazzi, Shelly's Back Room restaurant owner.Bob, good to have you.So, you're essentially shut down, right?BOB MATERAZZI, OWNER, SHELLY'S BACK ROOM:  Yes, thanks for having me, Neil.Yes, we are. We have been -- we have been in protocol one since -- foralmost a month now, which means no indoor seating. And outdoor seating istentative at best. It's dependent on the weather, dependent on thedemonstrations.And now the situation exacerbated with the entire area around ourrestaurant closed to pedestrian traffic and then to no metro access. So,it's very, very difficult times, very difficult.CAVUTO:  Yes.MATERAZZI:  We...CAVUTO:  So, I'm sure, for delivery, it's the same thing.So, could I ask you, Bob, then what do you do in that environment,especially if this goes beyond Inauguration Day? At least the troops, weunderstand, are going to be there through the end of this month, maybelonger. It depends. But then what?MATERAZZI:  Well, you hang on.I mean, in 2020, we lost about 70 percent of our sales to 2019. And we'rehanging on by a thread. We're getting some government money. But it's notenough, to be honest with you. We have gone from 25 employees down to aboutfive to 10. We're still paying rent. We're still playing insurance. We'restill paying utilities, and no revenue is coming in.So, it's a very, very scary time. I'm willing to bet that, when this thingfinally ends, a lot of the small businesses in D.C. aren't going to open upagain.CAVUTO:  Incredible. I hope that's not the case for you, Bob.But I'm just wondering now, after all of this, and people, of course, theirview of Washington, if they haven't ever been there, is what was going onthe Capitol the week before last, how violent it was.And I wonder if a lot of people, seeing that, think, well, Washington's adangerous place, we don't want to go, or even locals say, well, maybe justhold off for a while. That could be another, another big problem toovercome.MATERAZZI:  Well, it certainly is.And it's actually been that way for quite a while now.CAVUTO:  Really?MATERAZZI:  Especially when the indoor seating shut down. People just don'tcome downtown. The streets are deserted.If you look around us, everything's boarded up. It's not a very friendlyplace to come. And I'm not sure when all this is going to turn around.Hopefully, it'll turn around when the vaccinations are out. But I'm notsure it's going to happen that quickly.CAVUTO:  Finally, what do you tell your workers as this goes day by day?Obviously, you pared staff just to reflect that and all.They must fear that, if this lingers, you might not.MATERAZZI:  Well, we have -- we have helped all of them apply forunemployment.But that's a two-edged blade, because unemployment, a lot of times, paysmore than what the minimum wage is in D.C. So, it's hard to get peopleback.But -- and the other issue is, in the restaurant business, people maketheir money off of tips. And tips are in direct relation to the amount ofsales that you do. So, again, I'm not sure when all this is going to goback to where we were, but, hopefully, eventually, it will.CAVUTO:  Well, I wish you well.I know you have a lot of classics that are not your typical food, I know,that sound delicious to me, the beef pepper turnovers and your Shelly'ssausages.MATERAZZI:  Yes.CAVUTO:  I mean, that word must get out to your people to make sure thatthat gets out to people, because that alone could keep you going.But I wish you well, Bob. Thank you very, very much. Hang in there.MATERAZZI:  Thanks, Neil. Thanks for having me.CAVUTO:  All right, be well, be safe, Bob Materazzi, in all of that.This is Martin Luther King Day, by the way. It was handled a little bitdifferently, and with the same message being, what can we do virtually thatwe tried to do in person?Lauren Green following all of that and the message that still thrives,maybe particularly so this year.Hey, Lauren.LAUREN GREEN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, Dr. King's message of unity and hope is so important today, probablymore than ever. But faith leaders also want to say what's important also isthat Dr. King first was a Christian preacher.And the riots and protests of this past year are reminiscent of the 1960s,when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. fought for the civil rights of all people.And the foundation of his call to justice was based on his Christian faith.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ALVEDA KING, NIECE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.:  Jesus came into myuncle's life. And my uncle began to have a genuine relationship with Jesus,but he was a man of faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)GREEN:  Even his iconic "I Have a Dream" speech was filled with referencesfrom the Bible.In his writings and other speeches, King challenged the Ku Klux Klan andall the white Christians who fought against him to go deeper into theirfaith. On the issue of segregation, he said it was "a blatant denial of theunity which we all have in Christ Jesus."And in his call for us to love one another, he wrote: "We cannot be trulyChristian people so long as we flaunt the central teachings of Jesus ofbrotherly love and the golden rule."In the wake of 2020's unrest, King's niece says her uncle's message of alove that surpasses all understanding resounds stronger than ever.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KING:  My uncle, if he were here today, I don't have to speculate. I don'thave to second-guess him, because I know, he would just say, I have decidedto stick with love. Hate is too big of a burden to bear.(END VIDEO CLIP)GREEN:  And, Neil, on the issue of race, Dr. King said, there is only onerace. It's called the human race, and each person is made in God's image --Neil.CAVUTO:  Lauren, that's a beautiful report. We're need to be reminded ofthat, Lauren Green, a different look at the life and the message and thelegacy of Martin Luther King on this day, of all days.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it got pretty nasty over the weekend, Guatemalan forcesclashing with thousands of Honduran immigrants. We're told they're headinghere right now to escape what they call persecution and an economy thatgives them nothing, no hope, no money, no anything, and now heading to theU.S. border to see what can be done.We have heard this before. How is the incoming administration going todeal?Ron Vitiello joins us, the former acting ICE director.Ron, very good to have you back with us.RON VITIELLO, FORMER ACTING U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENTDIRECTOR:  Good to be here.CAVUTO:  What do you make of this and whether this we will once again putpressure on Joe Biden to either recognize the type of border approach thatPresident Trump has had, or this new, kinder, gentler approach that hementions?VITIELLO:  Well, we have seen this movie before. We know how it ends. Itends in misery for the people who take that dangerous journey. It ends inmisery for those that are abused and left behind by smugglers. It ends inmisery for the men and the women who will lose their lives in this trip tothe border.They broke into Guatemala, obviously, successfully. They're going to gothrough -- they're going to try to do the same thing in Mexico. And youwill remember, not that long ago, they tried to break in at San Diego. Andif it wasn't for the Customs and Border Protection agents and the BorderPatrol agents, they would have made it into the U.S.They're responding to incentives. This is a -- this is a rational act. Theyhave been told during the campaign that we would be softer at the border.It was just like when, a week or so before Donald Trump was inauguratedthings, at the border were very, very quiet, because these people believedthat the policy was going to change and that they would not be able to comeinto the United States and gain the asylum system in order to stay here.Now they have been told the reverse, that we're going to back off onenforcement at the border. We're going to pull out of the Mexicanrepatriation agreement. We're going to pull out of the accord, the asylumaccords we did with the Northern Triangle.This all leads people to be incentivized to come to United States. And oh,yes, by the way, we're going to talk about an immigration reform that leadsto a pathway to citizenship. These are all incentives that people areresponding to.It is going to end in misery for many people. And it's completelyavoidable, if the Congress would shore up the immigration framework to stopthe asylum abuse, and that the Department of Homeland Security be givenadequate resources to respond to surges like this.CAVUTO:  It's a different matter, but Joe Biden has also made very, veryclear that whatever wall building was going on, it stops, not another footof wall under him.What did you think of that?VITIELLO:  I think it's wrongheaded to assume that the wall that was beingbuilt was only being built because President Trump was supporting it.President Trump came to people like me, people like John Kelly and otherBorder Patrol officials and said, what is it that you need on the border?And we told them the same thing that we told the Obama administration, thesame thing we told the Clinton administration and the Bush administration.We need personnel, technology and infrastructure.And having a wall with access to the border and the sensors and the agentsthat are designed to protect it gives you a much safer border. It gives youa safer border community, and it protects the entire homeland.CAVUTO:  All right, we will see what happens around it.What happens when that group gets to the border, though?VITIELLO:  Well, they're going to -- they're going to be confronted by CBPofficers and Border Patrol agents.And then we will see how the -- by the time they get here, we will have anew administration. And I don't know how quickly they're going to changethe policy. They did walk it back a little bit. But, again, this is wherethe misery starts, when thousands of people come to the border and claimasylum.They're in overcrowded conditions. They're in poor health. That's where themisery comes from. And having that framework shored up is what the countryneeds to have a credible immigration system and to have a border that'ssecure and that doesn't allow people to just walk right in, like we justsaw in Guatemala.CAVUTO:  Ron Vitiello, let's see what happens. Thank you very much.VITIELLO:  Good to be with you.CAVUTO:  Has a lot of folks worried on both sides of the issue here.In the meantime, much ado about California and its problems, all thesebusinesses that are leaving. Then along comes an L.A. Times article, tosay, make America California again, in other words, that the message of theincoming Biden administration is to make California the blueprint, the --sort of like the model.Wouldn't that be a lot like me offering dietary advice, the model for howto eat well and do all that stuff? Just asking -- just after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, no offense to California.This would be like making me the model for a health club and the face ofthe advertising. Probably not the wisest move. But when The L.A. Timeswrites, make America California again, and the Biden plan will sort of echothat, that California would be a great model -- and I'm thinking of all thebusinesses and individuals that have left because of the problems and thehigh taxes in the state -- is that the model you want?Let's explore this with Lawrence Jones.Lawrence, I mean, you could definitely be the fitness model here.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But I don't know if I want to make California our nationaleconomic model. No offense to those fine folks. Right now, they just seemto be a mess.LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS ANALYST:  Well, I would argue that a lot of peoplethink that many of the residents of California are wanting to becomeTexans.So, back in my home state, we're seeing a lot of businesses move because ofthere's no state taxes in Texas. It's a business-friendly environment. Youdon't have to deal with all the drugs on the street and crime.And so I think one would argue, what is this dream, when many of thosepeople that once had a dream in California are fleeing for other states?So, I mean, I think when it comes to a lot of the progressives, though,when you look at it from an ideology standpoint, it doesn't matter if theidea works or not.It's about the dream and the ideas. And I think that's why they say makeAmerica California.CAVUTO:  You know, there are the progressives who love California, itsexample and everything else it does. And it's really the petri dish wherethings are tried out first before they are expanded elsewhere, like rightsfor illegals and all of that.So, it's not a surprise that progressives would look to that as a beacon.JONES:  Right.CAVUTO:  What worries me, though, is if an incoming administration thenwants to establish it as national policy. It would go against the grainthat's evidenced itself, as you said, to people who move to Texas orFlorida or safer tax and regulatory confines, you know?JONES:  Well, I think what they're going to learn as they try these bigideas is that there's already a road map to failure.I mean, L.A. and San Francisco and other cities in California are wheredreams are made. But there's also a place there where they die as well. Andso you can have this utopian wish list, but I think, when you try to testit across the country, I think you're going to find that a lot of moderatesare going to reject it. Conservatives are going to reject it.And I think a lot of the people that, although they may have the rightheart about the issues that are facing America, the prescription, a lot ofpeople are going to reject that prescription. So, I think Democrats aregoing to have to make a decision.And Joe Biden has a tough choice here. The progressives have the energyright now. They have unseated a lot of these mainstream Democrats that wereknown as the party elders. Sure, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi or Hoyer.But when you look at Lacy Clay in Missouri or Engel in New York, these werepeople that had a lot of support, had been in office for 20-plus years, andthey were unseated. And so there's a little fear that -- when it comes toDemocrats as well, if they don't buy into what the Squad or many in theProgressive Caucus have told them is the way, then they won't have theirjob anymore.And, to be fair, it's kind of true.CAVUTO:  Real quickly, Lawrence Jones, I always feel that, when you haverun of the table, and you have the White House and you have the Senate andyou have the House, you do anything and everything you can.And the lesson that Barack Obama learned that he lamented in his book wasthat he wasn't able to push those taxes on the upper income as soon as hewanted. And that's a mistake that Joe Biden will not make.What do you think of that, to take full advantage of this whole Washingtonthat they control?JONES:  Well, as much as he believes that he's going to be able toaccomplish all these things on his list, he got to pick one issue, becausethat's all he has.I mean, although they have control of all the branches, it's a slimmajority. And, plus, the Republicans picked up 20-plus seats in the House.So, he needs to decide what he wants his legacy to be right now, and stickwith that one issue and hope that it's a unifying message, so he canpreserve his majority.CAVUTO:  Lawrence Jones, always good catching up with you, and a good viewof what's happening right now.Lawrence Jones on all of that.Tomorrow, by the way, we're going to be taking a look at the record youprobably don't hear a lot of talk about, the Trump economic record and themarket record, lots of records, a special look back tomorrow.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
