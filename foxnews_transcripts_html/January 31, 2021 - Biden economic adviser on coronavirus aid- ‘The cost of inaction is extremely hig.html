JOHN THUNE (R-SD):  I would hold that they would, again, reach out toRepublicans to find common ground.WALLACE:   We'll ask Jared Bernstein, a top White House economic advisor,and Republican Bill Cassidy, a member of the Senate's sweet 16, about WallStreet jitters and the president's COVID rescue plan.Then, health officials race to vaccinate Americans as new coronavirusstrains keep spreading.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  Viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate.WALLACE:  We'll talk with Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns HopkinsCenter for Health Security, about how much these variants will complicateefforts to stamp out the virus.Plus, lawmakers fret over capitol security and the divide in their ownranks.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will probably need asupplemental for more security for members when the enemy is within theHouse.WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel about new tensions inside Congress.And our "Power Player of the Week," she is opening up new paths for womenin a death-defying sport.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday." (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.Well, markets are anxious and regulators on watch after an online move itto stick it to Wall Street elites sparked a trading frenzy. This asPresident Biden calls for bipartisan support of his massive COVID rescuepackage, but at the same time, Democrats in Congress are preparing to movewithout Republican votes.In a moment, we'll speak with Jared Bernstein of the president's Council ofEconomic Advisors, and GOP Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the 16 Senatenegotiators.But, first, let's bring in David Spunt at a snowy White House with thelatest on efforts to shore up the economy -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, good morning.President Biden spent 36 years on Capitol Hill working across the aisle.Now that he's commander-in-chief, gridlock is his new reality. Add in therecent stock market chaos, he has a full plate not even two weeks into thejob.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (voice-over):  A volatile moment on Wall Street this week.REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  Everyday people were finally able tocollectively organize and get back at the folks who have historically hadall the marbles on Wall Street.SPUNT:  Thousands of traders drove up prices of stocks like GameStopcreating havoc for brokers who bet about this. The Securities and ExchangeCommission is investigating, but the president and his team, at leastpublicly, are mum.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Our focus and our big story isgetting the American people back to work.SPUNT:  Back to work with a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package. PresidentBiden says while he wants Republican support, he'll go it alone if need be.BIDEN:  The risk is not doing too much. The risk is not doing enough.SPUNT:  Republicans are pushing for changes.SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  Republicans can be there, but it can't just bespending $1.9 trillion pulled out of the air with no justification.(END VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  And with just about a week to go until former PresidentTrump's impeachment trial, Chris, we learned last night, his entire legalteam quit, all five attorneys, leaving his legal strategy unknown -- Chris.WALLACE:  David Spunt reporting from the White House -- David, thank you.And joining us now, Jared Bernstein of the president's Council of EconomicAdvisors.Jared, the biggest complaint about the president's $1.9 trillion COVIDrescue package is that it's just too big. I want to put some items up onthe screen.You would give $1,400 -- $1,400 checks to someone who's making $75,000 ayear and has kept his job. Hundreds of billions of dollars already approvedby Congress haven't been spent yet, and there's money for things that havenothing to do with COVID like $20 billion for mass transit and raising theminimum wage.Now, ten Republican senators say that come up with a compromise plan andhave asked for a meeting with President Biden.First of all, your initial reaction to what those were Republican senatorsare calling for? And secondly, is President Biden willing to come down fromthe $1.9 trillion price tag?JARED BERNSTEIN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  Thank you, Chris. Great tobe with you.We just learned about this letter from the Republicans a few minutes ago,but the president has consistently said three things.One, he is absolutely willing to negotiate.Two, and this speaks to your question, this plan is scaled to have thepunch to finally put these dual crises behind us, to meet the challenge ofvaccine distribution, of virus control and of meeting economic reliefthat's so urgent in this moment. The cost of inaction is extremely high.Part three is, as I mentioned, willing to negotiate with Republicans andglad to hear from this letter that they're on board, but we need to learn alot more about it.Right now, we are in a position where delay and inaction are the enemy ofmoving forward.WALLACE:  But just to be clear, when you say he is willing to negotiate,it's clear Bill Cassidy, we'll hear from him a little bit more in the nextsegment, he's one of the ten Republican senators, President Biden iswilling to come down from the $1.9 trillion?BERNSTEIN:  President Biden has consistently said he will negotiate with --with those on the other side of the aisle about getting this plan out asquickly as possible. What's so urgent here is getting relief to theAmerican people and finally gaining control of the virus.I think the way to think about this less than the top line number is thefollowing: delay, inaction, failure to negotiate, wait and see, these havebeen the enemies of virus control, of vaccine distribution and the arrivalof a robust, inclusive, and racially equitable recovery.And the president is willing to negotiate with everyone who signs up forthe urgency of that plan.WALLACE:  Let me follow up on that because the president talks a lot aboutbipartisanship, but at the same time, Democrats in the House and Senate arealready working on a budget which if they pass it would allow -- not sayingit would happen -- but would allow them to pass a -- this COVID reliefpackage on a straight party line vote, just the 50 Democrats plus VicePresident Kamala Harris in the Senate.So which is more important to the president, bipartisanship, unity, orgetting it passed now?BERNSTEIN:  I don't think it's an either/or kind of a choice.Look, the American people really couldn't care less about budget process,whether it's regular order, bipartisanship, whether it's filibuster,whether it's reconciliation, they need relief and they need it now.And I think what's so key here -- and the package is scaled to meet thecosts that I'm about to articulate. If we don't get this package asdesigned out the door quickly, we risk having 4 million fewer jobs at theend of this year, that's from Moody’s. We risk taking a year or longerto get to full employment.Kids who were out of school every year, that costs their lifetime earningsnorth of 5 percent. That's a permanent ding on their ability to prosperthroughout their lives.There are 11 million people unemployed. The African-American on employmentrate is double digits, so the urgency here is the cost of inaction.And the plan is scaled to finally meet the challenge and the reason we hada negative employment report in December, the reason consumer spending, 70percent of this economy, was November -- was negative in November andDecember is because we allowed an economic air pocket to deliver by notgetting ahead of the virus.And this plan is the first plan I've seen -- WALLACE:  Right.BERNSTEIN:  -- that we'll get ahead of this virus and finally put it in the-- in the rearview mirror.WALLACE:  Jared, you talk about a fairly dismal short-term economicpicture, particularly if you don't get the COVID relief plan, which raisesa question a lot of critics are asking -- why would President Biden bepushing a climate change agenda now?I want to put up some of the things he did this week. He killed theKeystone pipeline, which backers say will cost 11,000 jobs short-term, andhe announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on public lands.Does it make sense to be killing jobs at a time when 18 million Americansare unemployed?BERNSTEIN:  So I definitely, completely reject the framing of the question.You know, let me go back -- it was a campaign line but it was one that hadreal economic substance, and this was when the president-elect at the time-- I'm sorry, the vice president at the time was arguing that when hisopponent, former President Trump, hears climate change, he thinks hoax.When Biden hears it, he thinks jobs.Not only are there many more jobs in the climate agenda -- and this will bemore part of the Recovery Act that's coming later than the rescue plan --but this is something where the market is already moving in this directionand our plans -- you know, think of the announcement this week from GeneralMotors to move towards -- towards battery-powered vehicles.This is -- this is us really picking up and trying to amplify where themarket is going anyway and it's a walk and chew gum moment. I mean, thispresident won a decisive victory in part because of pledging to take such avital action on climate. And I firmly believe that this is a pro-growthplan. It also has to occur as we take the steps to finally get to a robustrecovery when we can start building our clean energy industries.WALLACE:  But, Jared, I mean, the fact is the Keystone pipeline is going tokill 11,000 jobs, a thousand right now already, 10,000 that were planned.And that's the argument that critics make. They say you're killing currentgood-paying jobs for the prospect of jobs down the line.Here is the governor of Montana this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREG GIANFORTE (R), MONTANA:  This Keystone XL pipeline is a lifeline forrural Montana. It would have generated over $100 million a year in taxes tohelp us pay for schools, law enforcement, infrastructure. This isdevastating.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  The governor says that when the president signed that executiveorder, the workers on the Keystone pipeline packed up their lunch pails andwent home.BERNSTEIN:  Look, we haven't had the Keystone pipeline in place for a longtime and we certainly had, you know, a very low unemployment rate beforethe crisis hit.The key to getting back to robust job opportunities is to cease any delay,any inaction, any failure to negotiate, any wait-and-see around us rescueplan because this rescue plan is of a magnitude -- and that's so importantbecause you question the top line number -- is of a magnitude to get us tothe other side of this fiscal crisis so we can finally and reliably launcha robust economic recovery.Now, you don't get there without virus control and key to the AmericanRescue Plan is not just virus control, but it's vaccine distribution. So ifwe take the steps the president has outlined, we will begin to see theunemployment rate fall more quickly, as I said. One estimate gets us tofull employment a year earlier, 4 million more jobs, if we pass this planagainst if we don't.So I think that in terms of job availability, robust labor demand andeconomic opportunity, the American Rescue Plan is precisely the rightmedicine.WALLACE:  Finally, and I want to switch subjects on you, we got about aminute left, Jared.There's been a lot of talk this week -- as I'm sure you've heard aboutGameStop and the big turbulence in the stock market. The White House hasreally tried to stay out of this and kept referring things to the SEC.But here is Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren this week. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  When you don't have an honest market, a lotof folks get cheated and a lot more folks just say I'm not going into amarket like that. I'm not going to participate. I'm not going to put mymoney out there.WALLACE:  I'm really asking you, you talk a lot about the economy, is thepresident concerned about market manipulation, whether it's from hedgefunds, whether it's from retail investors and exactly what Elizabeth Warrenwas talking about, that it hurts the economy because it reduces publicconfidence in the markets?BERNSTEIN:  Well, first of all, the president recognizes the stock marketis not the real economy faced by so many people on the bottom leg of thisK-shaped recovery. They depend on the American Rescue Plan to deliver bothvirus control, vaccine distribution, and economic relief.As far as GameStop, I think the president's main concern there is that theregulator in charge, the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, has tomake sure not that there's no volatility and speculation in the market,that's a constant, but that the underlying plumbing of the financialmarkets remains sound. That's the job of the SEC, and if you read theirstatements, you'll find that they are very much on that case.I think that from the perspective of Senator Warren, who I always listenvery carefully to what she's talking about that, really her thematic thereis that we're in a situation where the stock market has been going up andpoverty has been rising and food pantries are facing massive demand,families face hunger. About three -- about 30 million of them, they faceevictions. They're trying to keep a house over their head.That's where the American Rescue Plan comes in and that's where thepresident's focus is 100 percent on that issue.WALLACE:  Jared, we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you. Thanksfor your time this week, and please come back.BERNSTEIN:  My pleasure.WALLACE:  Up next, President Biden continues to chop away at Trump policieswith executive actions and orders. We'll ask Republican Senator BillCassidy what that means for bipartisan support of the Biden agenda. That'snext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  We're just 11 days into the new administration and partisancracks are already appearing in talks over a massive COVID relief package. Now Democrats are preparing to possibly go it alone. Joining us, a member of the centrist group called the Sweet 16, LouisianaSenator Bill Cassidy. And Senator, welcome back. SEN. BILL CASSIDY, (R-LA):  OK. Thank you. WALLACE: So as we mentioned, the Biden White House has been reaching out tothis group, the so-called Sweet 16's, eight Republican senators, eightDemocratic senators, trying to negotiate a bipartisan compromise but justtoday, just in the last hour, ten Republican senators, including you, sayyou've come out with your own compromise plan and have asked for a meetingwith President Biden. First of all, your reaction to what you heard from Jared Bernstein justnow. And secondly, give us a sense of this plan and how much it would comedown from that $1.9 trillion price tag the president's asking for? CASSIDY:  First, let me correct a couple things. The president's team didnot reach out to anybody in our group either Democrat or Republican whenthey fashioned their proposal. So if you want unity, if you wantbipartisanship, you ought to start with the group that's shown it's willingto work together for a common solution. They did not. Secondly, ours is about $600 billion. As opposed to the extraneous things,which Mr. Bernstein kind of tried to glide over, we are very targeted.We're targeted to the needs of the American people, treating our taxdollars as if they're our tax dollars and putting it where we need to comeout of the pandemic. Now, we think there's a lot here to work for -- to work with. We hope wefinally start getting that bipartisan -- and with the White Housenegotiation. So far we've received it. WALLACE: So 600 billion, while it's real money, is a lot different than 1.9trillion. Give me the biggest ticket items that you would include from thepresident's package and a couple of big items that you would exclude? CASSIDY:  So we have $160 billion. We match his figure when it comes tovaccination. To increase capacity to make more vaccine more quickly as wellas to adapt to these variants which are coming across. One area that we decrease, he has 170 billion for schools. Now, we'vealready given schools 110 percent of what they usually receive from thefederal government. Parochial schools have opened with a fraction of thatmoney, charter schools are opened. The real problem is public schools. That issue is not money. That issue isteachers' unions telling their teachers not to go to work. And putting 170billion towards teachers' unions priorities takes care of a Democraticconstituency group but it wastes our federal taxpayer dollars for somethingwhich is not the problem. We have 20 billion to get kids back to school on top of the roughly 66billion which is on top of the 57 billion schools normally get. We can getkids back to school without kind of bailing out the teachers unions. WALLACE:  And real quickly, the president calling for $1,400 paychecks foreverybody who makes $75,000 a year or less, does that stay or no? CASSIDY:  Yes. Ours is targeted. We have $1,000 and it begins to phase out.If you notice, there's been very good analysis that above a certain incomelevel, that money's not spent. Now it may pay down debt and we've seen credit card delinquency go down,mortgage delinquency go down, savings rates go up. But that doesn'tstimulate the economy, it's good but it doesn't stimulate the economy. Ourmoney goes to that income level where we know it will stimulate the economyand theoretically that's what they actually want. WALLACE:  For all the president's talk about unity and bipartisanship, heindicated what his top priority is on Friday. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   I support passing COVID reliefwith support from republicans if we can get it, but the COVID relief has topass. There's no ifs, ands or buts. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Senator, do you see the Democrats already working on a budgetthat, as I discussed with Jared Bernstein, would allow them to pass COVIDrelief on a straight party line vote through this process calledreconciliation in the Senate; do you see them already starting already towork on that budget in a sign of bad faith? CASSIDY:  Well, first, they've never reached out to us. So that's thebeginning of the bad faith. On the other hand, of course. If you say you want bipartisanship and you want unity and you wantRepublicans to join and then you have a budget reconciliation, which ischock-full of handouts and payoffs to Democratic constituency groups -- andby the way, policies which will kill millions of jobs, which is what CBOsays raising minimum wage to $15 would do in normal times, nothing liketoday -- you don't want bipartisanship. You want the patina of bipartisanship what you want to stick it and ram itthrough. So that's not unity. WALLACE:  You heard my discussion with Mr. Bernstein about the decision ofthe president and his executive actions to kill the Keystone Pipeline, toimpose a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in public lands. That clearly would hit a state like -- an oil-producing state like yourhome state of Louisiana hard. But John Kerry, one of the president's topclimate advisors, said this week that weaning the country off of fossilfuel production like coal and oil is not only good for the environment butis also good for workers in those industries. Take a look, Senator. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY ON CLIMATE CHANGE:  Coal plants havebeen closing over the last 20 years. So what President Biden wants to do ismake sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives,that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Does Senator -- Secretary Kerry, does he have a point, greenenergy jobs are some of the fastest growing in the country? CASSIDY: So we've heard this before from President Obama, when he first gotinaugurated green energy was going to take care of anything. What kept usout of a terrible -- the recession -- it was bad, but kept us kind ofemerged, was fracking. It wasn't green energy. We've heard this before and if you think about the picture of the personwho just laid off 11 people and he is in front of his half completed home,this was in USA Today, and he doesn't know how he will complete it, it'sbecause Keystone XL is canceled today. These jobs on the by-and-by which may occur in another state with differenttraining years down the road, pretty cold comfort for someone losing theirjob. And what Mr. Kerry ignores, see this covering, it's plastic. Thatplastic is made from fossil fuel. Yes, coal plants have been closing, but natural gas plants have beenopening. Because of those natural gas plants, we have cheap plastics, cheapconsumer goods, and our nation's greenhouse gas emissions are lower nowthan they were in 2005. Not because of renewable, small fraction, becauseof cheap, abundant natural gas. These are wrongheaded policies which are going to cost jobs now. They speaklike economists, not like somebody that looks in the eye of a worker whodoesn't know how he will pay his rent or pay his mortgage. WALLACE: Senator, finally -- and I've got less than two minutes -- theimpeachment trial starts a week from tomorrow. And as we reported earlier,we just learned that the president has split with his legal team reportedlybecause he wanted them to focus on the fact that -- his claim that theelection was stolen, they wanted to talk about the fact that they thinkthat the whole trial is unconstitutional for a former president. One, what do you think of the idea of that as a defense for the president,arguing that the election was stolen? And secondly, what is it going to doto the trial if the president eight days before it starts doesn't even havea group of lawyers? CASSIDY: I have no clue. I have said already, as I did a year ago, that Iwill wait to judge based upon the evidence presented. And the evidence is,as I understand, going to focus on whether or not the president contributedto an atmosphere to have people charged the Capitol, break-in, threatening,if you will, both members of Congress and Vice President Pence. That's thecharge. So I would hope that whatever defense is put up refutes that charge. Butagain, I will wait to judge based upon the evidence which is presented. WALLACE: Do you think that there should be a delay in the trial now thatthe president doesn't have a legal team? CASSIDY: Chris, I'm not quite sure. This is obviously uncharted territoriesfor multiple reasons. I always thought the president had insufficient timeto come up with a rebuttal. This makes it perhaps even more insufficient.But in a sense, it might be the president, I don't know that for sure, whohas contributed to this so I think this needs to be worked out. There's probably better ways to handle it than we currently are. I hopethose are explored. WALLACE: Senator, thank you. Thanks for joining us this Sunday, always goodto talk with you, sir. CASSIDY: Thank you, Chris. WALLACE:  Coming up, the White House ramps up the vaccine rollout, butthere are growing concerns about virus mutations. We'll ask a top publichealth expert about the latest front in a fight against COVID.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, President Biden promises more shipments of vaccineswhile still warning of pain to come.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  The brutal truth is it's going to take months before we get themajority of Americans vaccinated. Months.930CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: More shipments of vaccines while stillwarning of pain to come.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The brutal truth is, it's goingto take months before you get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll talk to a public health expert about the White Housetimeline for containing the virus. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: We may soon see a third COVID vaccine get emergency approval, butit is not as effective as the two existing vaccines.For the latest on the continuing fight against COVID, we turn to Dr. TomInglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins.Doctor, how concerned are you about the variants to the virus and thepossibility -- like the South African variant, and the possibility that asthe virus begins to spread, we could end up with a strain that is justresistant to the vaccines, that the vaccines won't protect us against?DR. TOM INGLESBY, JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well,good morning, Chris.I am concerned about the arrival of the variants in the United States.Certainly it's -- it's something that we all need to be taking veryseriously.I think at this point the good news is that the vaccines that we haveappear to be still very effective against this vaccine and the companiesand our government scientists are looking very closely at it and aredeveloping the possibility of boosters that would more tightly address thisnew variant if we need to go in that direction. But I think it's a messageto all Americans that what happens elsewhere in the world can affect us andthat we need do everything we can to control this pandemic.This virus is going to continue to mutate as it -- as long as it's allowedto thrive in the world and we need to do what we can to contain it.WALLACE: And -- and -- and just give us a sense, because as it mutates,what are the chances that we end up with a variant that is totallyresistant to the vaccine?INGLESBY: Just difficult to -- to make estimates of the probability of thathappening, but what we're seeing is that in the South African variant, thevariance that was first found in South Africa, that at least in mild tomoderate disease, some of the -- of the vaccine studies are showingdiminished effectiveness. It looks like we still have enough cushion withthe vaccines that they will still be very effective at this point, but it'sa message that's saying that this virus is evolving and could continue toevolve in ways that make it more dangerous, either more transmissible ormore lethal. And so it's important again for us to really do what we can totry and contain this virus, wear masks, avoid social gatherings, decreasesocial interaction until we get this under control. And certainly, if youhave a chance to get vaccinated, if you're eligible for a vaccine, youshould get vaccinated in the larger effort to control this virus. WALLACE: Well, let's talk about vaccine.Johnson & Johnson has announced that it has a single-dose vaccine and thatit may apply for emergency approval from the FDA as soon as this week. Thekicker is that it says that the efficacy rate is 72 percent for its J&Jvaccine, as opposed to Pfizer and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of94 to 95 percent.I guess the question is, if you had a choice -- and I'm not sure you will -- but if you had a choice, why would you take the 72 percent vaccine ratherthan the 94 or 95 percent vaccine?INGLESBY: Well, first of all, I think this is an amazing development tohave a third vaccine that is highly effective against this virus. So Ithink it's very welcome news for the world and for the U.S.I think the vaccine studies were set up in a different way. The Moderna,Pfizer vaccine studies happen before we had the variants circulating widelyin the world. And the J&J vaccine study looked at disease end points thatwent out a bit further, at least were -- have been reported further out.And we see that in mild-to-moderate disease, the J&J vaccine was, as yousay, 72 percent. But as you go further out in time, you see that with --after 28 days, it's 85 percent protective against all strains and therewere no cases of severe disease or death after 49 days after vaccination.We need to see more about the J&J vaccine. So we've only seen the pressrelease. We need -- the FDA needs to review it, see the details. But Ithink it's -- it's promising early information and I'm hopeful that we'llsee it -- we'll see it as a very effective vaccine as part of our overallstrategy.WALLACE: You were, I think it's fair to say, pretty critical of the Trumpadministration's handling of this whole pandemic. Now that Joe Biden is incharge, what are you most encouraged by in the way he's handling the wholeCOVID issue, and are there some issue -- some areas of the way that his newadministration is handling this that still give you concern?INGLESBY: So I think, first of all, we're only about ten days into this, soit's difficult to say. But what I'm seeing in the first ten days is reallyencouraging to me. I think we've seen a very substantial and detailedstrategy around vaccination that's been released. FEMA has been giving outmoney to states for vaccination -- for the vaccination program. New -- newrules were passed to allow doctors and nurses to -- who have retired to --to vaccinate as part of the program. We're seeing increased rates ofvaccinations. So if you look back two weeks ago, about 700,000 to 800,000doses a day were being given out. Now we're up to 1.2 million to 1.3million doses a day. We have some forecasting over the next three weeksthat we'll have more vaccine available, 16 percent more vaccine availablein the next few weeks. So, overall, I am -- I am very encouraged by what Isee. I see scientists now they're promising three days a week, pressconference from CDC director and the NIH director and others involved.WALLACE: Right.INGLESBY: So I think what we're seeing is very encouraging.WALLACE: One of the biggest issues, I think it's fair to say, is schoolsand there are number of school districts around the country that stillhaven't gone back to in-person learning.What is the science, Doctor? Are kids safer in school or outside in thecommunity? And what about the teachers and their teacher unions around thecountry that are refusing to go back to in person teaching?INGLESBY: So I think the science is showing that if schools have verystrong mitigation procedures in place, if they've reduce the density withinthe school, and they're taking all of those measures very seriously, thenschools can operate safely as long as the community prevalence of thedisease around them is not overwhelming. And so that's really encouragingnews.But what we see is that schools that have resources can put those things inplace and that many schools in the country have not been able to put thosethings into place. So that would make them a less safe environment for boththe students and the teachers. So what we need to do is bring up allschools to a certain level of capability so that they can mitigate therisks, they can have good ventilation for kids and for teachers, they cande-densify the classroom so that kids can operate -- can -- can be theremore safely and teachers can operate more safely.I think it's very encouraging that teachers are in the front of the line toget vaccinated and I hope that teachers around the country are able to getvaccinated in the coming days if they haven't been already. That will --that will really help reduce the risk to the adult population in schools.But I do think there's a lot of work to do in a lot of schools that do nothave the things that the better prepared schools now have in place. So Ithink that's the challenge for us now, bringing schools around the countryup to that level of capability to make it safer.WALLACE: Dr. Inglesby, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. It's alwaysgood to talk with you, sir.INGLESBY: Thanks so much, Chris.WALLACE: Up next, as lawmakers beef up security on Capitol Hill, there arenew accusations of violent rhetoric about each other. We'll bring in ourSunday group to discuss unprecedented tensions inside the halls ofCongress. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The enemy is within the House of Representatives.A threat that members are concerned about in addition to what is happeningoutside.REP. MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA) (2019): How did you get over 30appointments with senators? How'd you do that? How did you get major presscoverage on this issue?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Speaker Pelosi pointing the finger at some of her colleagues inthe House and a clip from 2019 showing new Congresswoman Marjorie TaylorGreene harassing David Hogg, the student who survived the Parkland schoolmassacre.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Guy Benson of Fox News Radio, Susan Page from "USA Today," and Harold Ford,Jr., the CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital.Well, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy is going to be meeting withCongresswoman Greene this week about her past actions and statements.Guy, how big a problem is Greene for the GOP?GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Chris, this is not howRepublican leadership had the early days of the Biden administration sortof drawn up in their minds I would imagine. They want to unify the party,they want to unify their caucus in the House and they've gained a lot ofseats, of course, in the 2020 election and put that unified front upagainst the Democrats and -- and try to win some votes here, make theDemocrats' lives more difficult. And, instead, there's just this deluge ofopposition research that's coming out against this woman from -- fromGeorgia, this member of Congress who has said a lot of absolutely insane,crazy things and has apparently spouted or embraced or amplified everyconspiracy theory in the book.So McCarthy has a tough task this week because I think a lot of people inthe conference have had enough of all of these news cycles. They think thatshe's reckless and a huge liability for the party. But she just had aconversation with President Trump, according to her Twitter feed, over theweekend, where she pledged full support for him and vice versa. AndRepublican voters are still hugely supportive of President Trump. So it's -- it's a headache, a very big headache for Republican leadership.WALLACE: Harold, you were a member of Congress for ten years. And, ofcourse, it's not unusual to see sharp disagreements over policy. But whatdoes it mean for the House when you have members literally afraid of othermembers and fearing for their physical safety?HAROLD FORD JR., FORMER CONGRESSMAN (D-TN) AND CEO, EMPOWERMENT ANDINCLUSION CAPITAL: First off, thanks for having me on.I think just asking the question and even listening to Guy's answerconfirms that we're not living in normal times.I think the Republican Party -- and Democrats have gone through this in thepast as well but in different ways -- the Republican Party's trying to --trying to move to a face that -- that Guy tried to outline. Instead, it'sone now that seems to be a grievance and conspiracy theories.I recall when I was in Congress, Republicans, the face of the party wasstrong defense, fiscal restraint, limited government. I think democracy isserved better when you have two parties that are strong and dynamic andinspiring. And, unfortunately for Republicans, that's not where they areright now. I naturally like -- I like to think my party has better ideas,but you -- you -- you can't have a robust debate unless both parties arestrong in -- in a huge way.I hope the Republicans find their way again. It's obvious that hiscongresswoman, she's a little off. I mean some of these conspiracytheories, even Guy for -- neglected to mention, she believed that theClintons killed JFK Jr. to prevent JFK Jr. from running against Hillary.So I hope we can move away from that and find our way back to the kind ofdebate we heard earlier on the show between Cassidy and Bernstein.WALLACE: Susan, you know, you've got a situation right now where there ismore visible outrage inside the GOP over Liz Cheney, a member ofleadership, voting to impeach the president, over -- rather than some ofthese wild conspiracy theories being espoused by Marjorie Taylor Greene.How serious is this for the GOP and what can they do about it? I mean theytake her off committees? Expel her? What -- what -- what are their optionshere?SUSAN PAGE, "USA TODAY": Well, I -- I -- I think you're right, I think ittells you a lot about where the Republican Party is right now that LizCheney is undoubtedly going to face a primary fight the next time she's upfor election, that she has -- there is at least a possibility that she isgoing to lose her place in the House leadership because of this vote ofconscience she took. While Republicans in private expressed concern aboutMarjorie Taylor Greene, not many of them are willing to speak up in public.And the toughest punishment that is being seriously considered is takingher off the Education Committee, which is something I think that probablyis not even a slap on the wrist, doesn't do anything to stop her fromespousing views.You know, you think about-- there are big wounds on Capitol Hill from theJanuary 6th assault on Congress. That's what you heard from Nancy Pelosiwhen she was talking to reporters in the clip you played. There is -- thisis a kind of language we have not heard from Capitol Hill since the CivilWar, and it's not over yet.WALLACE: And then there is Donald Trump's continuing hold on the RepublicanParty.Here was the Republican leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, a couple ofweeks ago when he voted against the -- the -- the House's decision toimpeach Donald Trump, but still called him out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): The president bears responsibility forWednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediatelydenounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But, this week, McCarthy met with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago andissued a statement that the president will campaign for Republicans in the'22 -- 2022 midterm elections.Guy, is Mr. Trump's role in the Capitol attack on January 6th effectively -- has it effectively been forgotten by the Republican Party on CapitolHill?BENSON: The Republican Party on Capitol Hill is trying to figure out whatthe hell to do about him, and they don't know. And this goes, I think, backto some of the paralysis that I just mentioned in my previous answer.President Trump, and I know a lot of people are frustrated by this fact,and some people in the press can't believe it, but President Trump remainsthe most popular and most influential Republican in the country. And it'snot even close when you look at Republican voters.The struggle is for the party, independents and people that they need tobring back into their coalition to win the House back in 2022, to win theSenate back in 2022, they have moved further away from President Trump.There's a lot of very interesting polling data out yesterday, or at leastover the weekend from Georgia, which shows that Trump still has 85 percentsupport among GOP voters, but he's -- he's underwater significantlystatewide in what has been traditionally a red state. It's sort of this --this rock and a hard place situation for the Republican Party where it'skind of a lose-lose and they're not sure where to go, what to do.WALLACE: Well, Harold, let me pick up on that as a matter of practicalpolitics.Can Republicans write off, not only the former president, but the tens of -- of millions of Americans who voted for him on November 3rd and would votefor him again?FORD: I think the real issue here is that the Republicans are afraid andthe Congress and the Senate are -- are afraid about primary contests.Remember, Donald Trump lost the election to Joe Biden by more than --almost 7 million votes. He may retain some popularity, but this week welearned that Rob Portman is not going to run again. I think we can all reada lot of things into that. I served with both Rob and Pat Toomey. PatToomey's not running again.And I think the question becomes -- and I've watched Kevin McCarthy in PalmBeach with the president. It was clear to me that neither of them quiteknow where the party's going but they're -- they appear to -- appear likelyto want to do it together. The question for Republicans, are you moreworried about primaries or are you more worried about winning generalelections and winning back independent voters. That's the choice they haveto make. And I hope they make the right one for themselves and I hope theymake the right one for the country because, again, a dynamic two-partysystem is important for good policymaking and good politics to emerge.WALLACE: And in about 30 seconds, Susan, what's the answer to the question,which are Republicans more concerned about, primaries or general elections?PAGE: Well, House Republicans are more concerned about primaries and Ithink Senate Republicans may be more concerned about general elections.It's kind of the nature of the races in which they won.Right now Donald Trump continues to be the loudest voice in the RepublicanParty. Will that be true in 18 months or in two years? I don't think weknow.WALLACE: Well, all right, we're going to leave it there. Thank you, panel,see -- see you next Sunday.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week," Emily Harrington, on her record-breaking climb and embracing fear. Look at that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: She's one of the top-ranked competitors in a sport that's asfascinating as it is frightening.

I was drawn to the fear.WALLACE: Emily Harrington faces fear in a way few others have. Freeclimbing rock walls, using just her hands and feet, with a rope only incase she falls.WALLACE (on camera): You talk about the -- the -- the place of fear anddiscomfort. I think most people would say they -- they spend their lifetrying to avoid that. You spend your life seeking it.HARRINGTON: I think we, as humans, spend too much time avoiding those --those harder feelings. Those are very normal, natural human emotions thatnobody can ever escape.WALLACE (voice over): Last fall Emily became the first woman to free climbthe Golden Gate Route up Yosemite's famed El Capitan in less than 24 hours.It's a punishing 3,200 foot assent that usually takes days.HARRINGTON: It is one of the most difficult, massive and beautiful walls inthe world, and it's sort of a bucket list thing on every climbers list.WALLACE (on camera): What is so special about the Golden Gate Route in 24hours? HARRINGTON: Yes, it was just this massive challenge of having everythingthat I have worked my entire life on just all rolled into 24 hours.WALLACE (voice over): It didn't come easy.HARRINGTON: The second attempt, I was really close. I failed about 300 feetfrom the top. I was to tired -- essentially like my arms were just givingout on me.HARRINGTON: I just thought I could do it and --WALLACE (on camera): You did And then I decided to try again last year, mythird time, and I actually slipped in the very, very 2,900 feet, you're 300feet from the summit, and you can't go any further.HARRINGTON: Yes. WALLACE: How frustrating was that? HARRINGTON: And there were a lot of tear. There's a little bit ofprofanity.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is today the day?HARRINGTON: Today's the day.WALLACE (voice over): But this November, she was back.WALLACE (on camera): What is it like starting out to climb El Capitan at1:30 in the morning? HARRINGTON: It's really peaceful. It's a really cool experience. You haveyour head lamp and it's just you and your little circle of light.WALLACE (voice over): Emily was doing well, until --HARRINGTON: And I started up this one pitch and I slipped and I fell. Andthen the next thing I knew, I saw black and I just felt like the wetness ofblood pouring down my face.WALLACE (on camera): And how close did you come to giving up at thatmoment? HARRINGTON: I really did want to quit and I told myself, OK, I'm going totry one more time and I'm going to focus just on what's in front of me.WALLACE (voice over): Emily kept climbing. And this time she made it.HARRINGTON: It was now 10:00 at night. I was very, very tired. And I justcried. And kind of a little bit sad that it was over, honestly.WALLACE (on camera): How long had you been climbing that day? HARRINGTON: Twenty-one hours, 13 minutes and 51 seconds. WALLACE (voice over): Emily Harrington has been the first woman to make 14assents. Each one a chance to face fear and beat it.HARRINGTON: I have tons of projects out there that I haven't yet succeededon.
