DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
Virginia Democratic Governor Ralph Northam resisting growing calls to resign over a racist photo that appears under his name in his 1984 medical school yearbook. Northam reportedly meeting with his cabinet today and asking for time to clear his name. The Virginia governor initially apologizing after the photo came out on Friday, but is now saying it's not him.

GOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA.: My first impression actually that this couldn't be me. But there was so much hurt that I was feeling people were calling, so I reached out and apologized to people for this very picture being on my page.

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I think it was almost immediate. I can think of one exception that said, you know, we need to give him time. We don't want to leap to conclusions. I think lots of people, including on this panel said, hey, maybe the Democrats have some regret over Al Franken. Remember how quickly people pushed him over.
But I think this is a different situation in part because he's the governor. He's in a singular position and he's clearly lost moral authority in part because -- and I don't see this as a pond, but dance or board dancing that he did at that news conference where he comes out and apologizes, then it looks like he's not apologizing, and he says, oh, it wasn't me, but, of course, he apologized and left the clear impression that it was him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then the whole thing about black face with the Michael Jackson thing, I mean, that was -- that could have been Saturday Night Live, right? So, it's the idea that he has totally done a bad job of representing himself, but I think on a larger scale, there's so much politics involved here.
The people who broke the story, a far-right wing website, clearly was given a tip because of the position that he had taken on pro-choice issues. And then secondly, that Northam himself seems to have a lack of appreciation for exactly how awful this was because he says, oh, this happens in the 1980's. Hey, this is like so many years after the Civil Rights Act, after the civil rights movement. He's acting like, oh, well, you know, something a teenager -- he wasn't a teenager. He was in medical school.

PERINO: Right.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: So, I think, for the party, Dana, to get to your point, the reason that Democrats are jumping on or jumping off the Northam boat, it's in part because there would be such obvious charges of hypocrisy from Republicans who say, hey, you guys hold a high standard for Republicans and the like. You're always criticizing Steve King or Barack -- or Donald Trump, whenever they're charged with something that's potentially racist. How can you allow this to go on in your own midst?
So I think you've seen everyone, and I say everyone. I'm talking about former governors of the state of Virginia, to people who are in congress, you know, Schumer, Pelosi, say that he's got to go.

(CROSSTALK)
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: The only reason why it matters is where was Gillespie's team -- did they see this but not see this? He -- I agree with Juan. I mean, for me, he's testing the limits of forgive and not forget but to forgive because I believe that people do change over time. I mean, if you look at, obviously, Bird was in the KKK and Barack Obama eulogized him, I believe.
So, I mean, people can change. And things that we might be doing now is something I always think about that half a century from now, we may be seen as, like, I can't believe people did that or said that. It just happens that -- sometimes we aren't aware of how time changes.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I'm with Juan that this is in the '80s, so it's kind of strange. But, OK, I want to forgive him but I don't think I can. And the only reason I think I can is because he has smeared people racially before. He's gone out -- I mean, Gillespie is a case of it. I mean, he didn't, you know --

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: We have an example of that. So Gillespie was his opponent. And Gillespie -- he -- and the Gillespie campaign had accepted the Republican Governors Association request to be in charge of opposition research, whether that matters or not, whether he should go after people's yearbooks or not.
Setting that aside, there was this ad that ran during the campaign. It was about -- after Gillespie had talked about MS-13, he had gotten a lot of criticism for that. A third party group ran this ad. Northam did not disavow it. Watch this.

(END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So here's the interesting point, it was actually Northam who was driving the truck. We didn't know that at the time. You know the thing is -- also, he's so bad on his feet. All these controversies, he's screwing up. But I believe he was a surgeon. There may be a lot of patients right now wondering if they should have x-rays checked for left behind sponges because -- I don't know. Then I feel bad because he has -- he was in the military. He's done a lot of work. I mean, it's like -- I feel bad that he's done good things.

EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah. I think what you're saying and this to -- you know, humans are complex, of course. You can't have someone be all bad or all good, or with rare exceptions, let's say, so absolutely, in that weighing of the entire situation.
But I do feel like a couple things. Number one, to me the irony is that the largest lapse of judgment that I see beside, obviously, those horrible photos, but his management and reaction to this entire thing. Like, to me, the largest demonstration of his inability to serve the people would be this bungling entire situation.
And like you said, you know, is this how he reacts? Exactly. Is this the kind of thoughtful, measured response we want from a governor? Or is this someone who clearly --

Now, if you look at a photo on your own yearbook page and you say I don't recognize myself in blackface, it's not about being able to see if your features behind the blackface. It's about remembering you putting on blackface, standing next to a guy in a robe and then telling the editor, yes, I'm using this photo in my yearbook.

WATTERS: The guy is a stone cold liar, and he's also a masochist. Look at these numbers, 41 percent drop in approval among Virginia voters, 50 percent drop among independents, and he still thinks like he's going to hang on.
PERINO: You hear from people, Emily, that, like, Virginians are saying they're just sad for the commonwealth. They want to figure out a way to put this behind them. And I don't think that they can put it behind them unless he resigns.

WATTERS: Yeah, this makes the Kavanaugh yearbook look like fun and games.
COMPAGNO: Oh, totally. I mean, that was athletes comparatively. And, yeah, it seems to me that it would be best for his career moving forward if there's an opportunity for redemption.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The only way they can win, because they can't win the election, is to bring out the artificial way of impeachment. What they're doing on abortion, what they're doing on high taxes, what they're doing at the border, what they're doing in so many different ways, they want to cut our military, they want to take our wealth and give it away, they want to tax people, not 70 percent, it's 100 percent. So, if you look at what they're running on, they can't win.

So, Emily, if you were a Democrat, who would you be backing?

COMPAGNO: But I think what's interesting about this, you know, as we were kind of discussing these topics, the impeachment thing, you know, I think that Pelosi understands that that would not be the way to go unless there was something specific that they're running on. I think that would be a really bad move.
And for my understanding, after Clinton's impeachment failed, not only -- not only did two-thirds of Americans hate the impeachment process and basically feel like it was a waste of time in their taxpayer dollars. But you know, his job performance approval ratings rose, but his moral character approval declined.
And so, apparently that was the largest factor in the election of Bush, subsequently, was his honesty and moral character. So I do think it's kind of a fine line to walk, but certainly it would be a poor move.

WILLIAMS: Jesse, a lot of talk in D.C. about questions about Trump from fellow Republicans increasing in volume. Last week, we have the Senate Republicans vote. I think it was 40-something Senate Republicans voted against Trump's withdrawal from Syria. You have the whole controversy about the intelligence chiefs.
Do you see that as a bigger threat than the Democrats to President Trump at this point?
WATTERS: Absolutely not. I think it's a healthy party and the party allows difference of opinions, unlike the Democratic Party where it's pretty lockstep behind Pelosi. But that's fine. I don't think anybody is going to run against him or primary him.
On Biden, he doesn't have the machine, he doesn't have the money, he doesn't have the electricity, he has -- he's just has no base within the party. So that, as Dana said before, all name recognition. He doesn't want to run because I think he knows he's not going to win. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

And I think the president is previewing his whole strategy right now. The Democrats are open borders, pro-infanticide, tax and spend, socialists, you know, take away your healthcare, and that's how he's going to run and that's a pretty stark contrast strategy that's going to get a lot of eyeballs.
WILLIAMS: Well, if he doesn't want to run, Dana, he won't run, talking about Joe Biden.
PERINO: Right. And he has time -- because he has all of that name ID, he has time to spend and sit back, decide. Although, this -- it's been going on for a long time, right -- around Thanksgiving, remember they floated the story that said over the holidays he's going to make a decision. And then it was, well, by the end of the month. And now we're well into February and it's still like, oh, I'm really not sure --
WATTERS: Maybe he meant like Valentine's Day?

WATTERS: Yeah.

And I thought it was very interesting to watch on this Medicare For All is now a litmus test for the Democrats. They're not running on improving Obamacare. They are running on destroying the private health insurance industry. And you have 80 percent of Americans actually have health insurance through their employer. They're not going to like that. And so, I think it's a very strange way to kick off this campaign, but I'm having fun watching it.
WILLIAMS: By the way, Greg, so these two don't think that Biden really wants to run. But if he does run, the polls indicate he could beat Donald Trump.
GUTFELD: I just don't see how the new Democratic Party is going to choose an older white male. I just think that they're going to come to him, pull him aside and go -- and, you know, I'm going to use Jesse's analogy from last week.
I think it was a choose your own adventure? Did you really say that? Democrats at the starting line, they have a choose your own adventure. One, they can go way left and energize the loudest voices, the base, embrace identity politics full on intersectionality or they can choose impeachment which will create the Trump folk hero thing and Pence will become president.
And then, if he does get impeached, Trump could actually run as a Democrat and be -- can you imagine those debates with Trump on the Democratic stage beating the crap out of all of them or the third thing could be just pick a winner, like pick a persuasive person --
PERINO: And go for it.
GUTFELD: -- and go for it. You've got two years. And I have a feeling maybe they're scared that they don't have that. But I do think that the Democratic pack is burdened by identity politics and I've talked about it before. But I realize the reason why it's a burden is because it so easy.

Imagine, you don't have to make promises anymore. All I can say is, you know what, I see you as a woman. I see you as a woman and I value your womanhood. That means you don't have to promise jobs, you know, you don't have to promise peace or prosperity. All I have to do is acknowledge your personhood. And I think that's a problem because you're going to have a very thin -- you're going to have very thin gruel --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: I asked Emily if she would pick, if she was a Democrat who would she pick. Now, you said just a moment ago, maybe they would have somebody who would be like an x-factor, a surprise --
GUTFELD: Right now -- right now, I have to say it's Kamala is in charge.
WILLIAMS: Oh, really? You think Kamala Harris.
GUTFELD: I hate to say -- in the intersectional Olympics, she's like a plus three, right? It's like you have -- it's like -- you know, she's got it. But there could be somebody from the outside who is more of a populist. I mention Cory Booker last Friday as being somebody whose also got, you know --

WATTERS: So, Emily, what are your expectations for tomorrow night's State of the Union, and how do you think Nancy Pelosi will behave behind the president?
COMPAGNO: I hope that she keeps an, you know, impassive face, obviously, for at least to the decorum of holding that position. My expectations are, you know, it's -- I will say I would not be surprised if in it he called on that emergency declaration if he referenced it. And basically said again, look, this is what I'll do.
WATTERS: You're predicting state of emergency declaration tomorrow night.
COMPAGNO: No. I don't know. I don't want to be held to that.
WATTERS: I don't mean to pressure you.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
COMPAGNO: But I just think -- you know, the more that I looked into it, it's such a viable option, and in large part, just bird's-eye view, because one of the reasons for emergency power is because of the ineptitude and the inability of the government to get it done legislatively or not in a timely fashion.
That's exactly what we need right now. So, unless something drastic happens on the other side, which I don't see, because everyone is still playing semantics with wall or barrier or whatever, then what other option do we have?
WATTERS: All right. Juan, you're going to be down in the swamp tomorrow night.
WILLIAMS: Well, don't tell Mitch McConnell about your idea because I think the Republicans are pretty clear to President Trump, don't do it. But I don't think he's going to do it tomorrow in any case. I think tomorrow is really, from what the White House is saying, much more about trying to exhibit the capacity to reach out to Democrats and say here are things that we can get done.
The five points that they put out so far include things like infrastructure. Like, you know what, hey, both sides, we can work on this. We can get something done, right? And so he wants -- I think, especially in the aftermath of the declining poll numbers that were caused by the shutdown fiasco, say, hey, listen, I am trying to work with these Democrats. They're the ones that aren't doing right and put the pressure on the Democrats.
So that's what he'll try to do. The Democrats for their part, they're bringing two illegal immigrants who were working for Trump to sit in the audience to mock him.
WATTERS: Oh, OK. So what -- is Trump's going to call ICE? All right, Dana, the president has usually gotten rave reviews from his State of the Union addresses from the mainstream media. Do the Democrats run any risks, you know, sitting on their hands --

        }
      
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: -- when he talks about all the great things economically that are happening?
PERINO: Yes. So I think there's a high chance that you'll have some heckling or some sort of highly staged walkout by Democrats. I think that President Trump will keep his cool and maybe make a little joke about it and he'll, you know, win hearts and minds back at home.
I think that when he is praising troops or certainly talking about the economy and job numbers and unemployment rates, imagine the camera shot then of Senators Harris, Warren, Gillibrand, Booker. There's Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. I don't know -- whoever else is running for president.
And if they're sitting boot face, you know, looking like they're unhappy, that's not going to be necessarily good for them. But they have a choice to make right now because they have to see if they can stand out from one another. I also think the two big bipartisan pieces tomorrow night will be infrastructure once again around that loop.
But Pelosi and Trump has actually talked that they could agree on that. But the other big one is going to be prescription drugs and some sort of a plan to deal with the high cost of prescription drugs. It is not a conservative position, but it is one that you can get bipartisan agreement.

GUTFELD: No, I'm not. Thank God I'm going to be here minding the store. I'll be at the news deck just, you know, doing my thing. Yeah. This is incredibly tedious, this event. I think they should split it into two and let Maroon 5 play in the intermission. Would that be great? You could serve some of your queso. I finally figured out how we can build a wall. You're queso. Anyway -- you know when that stuff hardens. It ain't --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You know with this thing, though, the so two?
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: It's time to take stock of the presidency, but it's hard to take stock of this presidency because all the sound and fury of the last two years, it's like impossible to sit back and go, hmm, this cacophony doesn't really match the deeds when you think about the - you subtract the polarizing business model of the media, you have jobs, economy, military, optimism, North Korea, trade, prison reform. All this neat stuff that basically when you take a look at it, the Left should love this guy.
He's walking around the planet reducing our military footprint. I mean if you look at North Korea, Tulsi Gabbard should be thanking him. Syria, whether you're against or not, he's just very Left wing. Afghanistan, Yemen, I mean you can disagree with all of this, but the steps being taken, I mean he's moving away from conflicts, shouldn't the Left be embracing this? WATTERS: It's everything the Left said that they were about one and now you're against it just because Donald Trump is for it.
GUTFELD: And we're for it because it's Donald Trump.
WILLIAMS: I noticed ISIS fell off your list.
GUTFELD: I know.
WILLIAMS: Because the intel people said, hey, you know what, they're still there and still trying to kill us.
GUTFELD: You can have two competing thoughts in your head. You know Juan, one of is destroying ISIS. The other one is to continue to destroy ISIS.
WILLIAMS: But here is the thing Greg.
WATTERS: Juan doesn't like competition.
WILLIAMS: I do like competition, but I've got to say that the headline to me was the President did sum up his presidency. He said, he's the best President ever over those last 10 years.
GUTFELD: An understatement, I might add.
WATTERS: That's next two years.
GUTFELD: Six months.
WILLIAMS: No.
WATTERS: Involved in a massive scandal over here, a massive scandal. Dana Perino, she faced a social media mob. We'll tell you all about it, next year. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Yes. It was the Super Bowl that wasn't. I don't mean the game which was boring. I mean this. What is this you ask? It's totally OK if you don't know. Most people have never seen something so ghoulish. It's Dana Perino's attempt at queso. I made queso, she wrote like it was a signed confession to a serial killing. I made queso, yes you did. You made queso look like a melted golden retriever.
PERINO: Oh.
GUTFELD: I think we can agree, this is not something you would put inside you, it's something that would fly out of you after drinking the water at a Tijuana hospital. I don't think I've ever seen anything more inedible in my life and I include prison food. Seriously, no one on death row would touch this.
They take the chair first. The picture went viral. Of course, it would. It looks infectious. So, how is this homemade? It looks like the leftovers from the all the oil changes at Jiffy Lube. It looks like a foot spy. You might buy at the chair Noble gift shop. It's the bronzer runoff from the bikini contest. A fondue pot from Three Mile Island. I hear ISIS is taking credit for it. Yes, Dana Perino made queso, it's not her forte. Queso from Perino, it's like Abba doing gangster rap, a care bear doing a lap dance. Of course, Dana took a picture of this bucket of hideous bumbling doom and tweeted it, which is basically making your own kick me sign and taping it to your back. It's going to live forever. You actually made that unholy stew, then forced it on her horrified friends to eat. I could say this is one of those occasions when you're relieved you weren't invited.
But you know who's really grateful for Dana's queso? Yes, this guy at Maroon 5's Adam Levine, who is usually the cheesiest thing on earth. Not last night. Dana looked at that tattooed cringe crooning cheese stick of a dork and said, hold my spatula. Adam should buy her dinner for taking the spotlight off his awful performance. Just don't let her cook. You know you deserve it.
PERINO: It wasn't as - I mean I think it tasted better.
GUTFELD: Look at that.
PERINO: Then it looked--
GUTFELD: Look at the film on that, it's worse than Birth of a Nation.
PERINO: I tried a new recipe.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I've got it off the Internet.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And they said it would be like Chili's Bar and Grill for - they have great queso there.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: So, I thought I would try it.
GUTFELD: Chili's was so embarrassed that they had to go on Twitter and deny any culpability.
PERINO: No, they were very, very--
WATTERS: Is that true?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: No. They were nice to me. They said, at least, I was trying to be a good hostess and I attempted to make queso.
GUTFELD: Well, you know what--
PERINO: The best thing is I had some leftovers, so I brought it for everybody here.
GUTFELD: Yes, and we're not having any of it, at least for me.
PERINO: Jesse is having some.
WATTERS: I'll have some.
PERINO: OK. This is when most southwest grill were brought their queso, which of course is amazing. This doesn't feel warm enough.
GUTFELD: What did you make of the game?
WILLIAMS: It was the worst. You know I like football, I guess but it was hard to watch. Now some people said to me, oh! if you love defense, it was a great game. But even the defense, you know when I look at the word - I'm looking for--
WATTERS: It's not great.
PERINO: It's pretty good.
WILLIAMS: Word for Dana.
GUTFELD: Is that yours. What's that?
PERINO: That's most southwest grill actual queso.
WATTERS: Wait, is your supposed to look white.
WILLIAMS: No.
PERINO: No.
PERINO: It's chili queso.
WILLIAMS: Anyway, about the football.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: I was looking for some spectacular moment like a great catch or a great run or a great defensive play, wow, hey baby did you see that. There was no such moment. GUTFELD: No. It was very - Emily was very - you were a professional NFL cheerleader?
COMPAGNO: Yes.
GUTFELD: I don't have a question.
PERINO: There was a lot that said.
GUTFELD: I just like to see you for the Oakland Raiders who are now playing in San Francisco.
COMPAGNO: I know.
GUTFELD: Is that bizarre? COMPAGNO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And the question is will they play next year? GUTFELD: Yes. Will they're going to play--
COMPAGNO: In San Francisco now.
GUTFELD: Yes, they're going to play in the Giant Stadium right, where the San Francisco Giants play.
COMPAGNO: Correct.
GUTFELD: So, they'll be playing along the - like the first second. You know the dugout, not dugouts.
PERINO: They're going to combine football and baseball for--
GUTFELD: Would that be great.
COMPAGNO: Right now, stadium they have the entire time. So, throughout the first half of the season, it would still have the dirt from the Oakland Athletics you know and then it switches over.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: I don't think San Francisco is ready for major nation to take over every--
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: That go ahead.
PERINO: There is a lot of punting last night.
COMPAGNO: It was totally boring. And Adam Levine--
GUTFELD: And a lot of puking.
COMPAGNO: Cringeworthy. I couldn't look at the screen when he took off, I couldn't. I had to - it's basically like tell me when it's over and I can look back in.
GUTFELD: Couple of months ago, we brought up and I said that this was the worst decision ever. And you actually defended Adam Levine. Do you feel that you owe me an apology?
WATTERS: I do, I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to you, Greg. I was wrong about Adam Levine on the Super Bowl halftime show. I thought he'd do better.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: He sounds great. Maybe in a recording studio or on the radio. But he does not sound good live. He was very pitchy.
GUTFELD: No, he doesn't.
WATTERS: He was very cheesy. He was very weak. And then they brought in this other guy, who didn't really live up to the moment. And I walked out halfway through. I couldn't get through it. GUTFELD: Yes, me too.
WILLIAMS: What about his bare breast.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Janet Jackson, where are you?
GUTFELD: That's true. Double standard.
WILLIAMS: What's the deal?
GUTFELD: It doesn't seem like he's a guy who hangs out in front of the mirror a lot just posies.
WATTERS: I hate guys like that. WILLIAMS: You know what I noticed.
GUTFELD: What?
WILLIAMS: I saw that President Trump said, he wouldn't let Barron play football, which is exactly what got Obama mocked when he said he wouldn't let his kid play football. GUTFELD: I'm telling you they're more similar than you think. Obama and Trump. I think they're more similar than you think. PERINO: I think that President Trump was just expressing what a lot of parents are thinking. Right.
WILLIAMS: Absolutely. It's just that I wouldn't think that the Trump crowd would be glad to hear that he didn't wanted his kids to play football.
PERINO: Like he said it this way, not this way. You remember that commercial. The UPS commercial?
COMPAGNO: This is great. PERINO: The queso is good?
COMPAGNO: Yes.
WATTERS: It tastes better than it looks.
PERINO: You're wonderful.
GUTFELD: Aren't you happy that you're only Twitter scandal.
COMPAGNO: Taste it.
GUTFELD: I wish I had it.
WATTERS: Dana Perino type scandal.
GUTFELD: I know.
WATTERS: Your negative press is my good press. I mean you went viral for bad cheese. GUTFELD: Hey, is Tom Brady going to retire?
PERINO: No.
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: I predicted that at New Year's and now I think I'm wrong.
WATTERS: You also predicted the Rams are going to win. PERINO: Yes. So, two strikes.
COMPAGNO: No, you were close. You were so close.
GUTFELD: Oh! My goodness,
PERINO: OK. So, third one.
GUTFELD: Geez. I almost forgot.
PERINO: What's that.
GUTFELD: Well, you know what, I was thinking that. OK. The best thing about this whole queso story, it's going to live forever. I made queso, fits with any picture. So, I thought I'd make you--
PERINO: How did you do that?
COMPAGNO: Oh! My god. Amazing. So fast.
PERINO: How did you do that?
GUTFELD: Let's just say we have a pretty good production staff that you say, hey, let's make a t-shirt.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
PERINO: Oh! My gosh. New York is the city that never sleep.
WATTERS: It's pretty good.
GUTFELD: Anybody at home wants and I made queso shirt. Call Dana on her private line, 646-8795 and they're like $4 and it all goes to charity, which is the name of my boat.
PERINO: And anyone who like to hate her, just love me please.
GUTFELD: Isn't that great. I made queso. You can put this next to any picture and it works, because it could be just something horrible, it could be a dog. PERINO: Someone tweeted a picture of a burnt piece of bread and said, I made nachos. Anyway.
COMPAGNO: I thought--
PERINO: I had fun with it.
GUTFELD: Not everybody can cook, OK.
PERINO: No. You know the best thing is that from now on the only thing I'll ever be asked to bring to a party is wine.
GUTFELD: There you go.
PERINO: That's like, so I win.
GUTFELD: Don't make it. WILLIAMS: What did your husband say?
PERINO: He said, it was good.
WILLIAMS: That's all.
PERINO: He said, Lucas went back for three bowls. Jenny Landers said, it was good. Ruth Bloom said, it was good. Maria Nanawick (ph), she ate it too. GUTFELD: Did they ever get an ER this morning. R.I.P. The Left's latest meltdown over President Trump's leaked work schedule. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Critics are pouncing on an anonymous leak of President Trump's schedule. Oxy (ph) was reporting that during the last three months, 60 percent of the President's workday is spent in unstructured so-called executive time.
Press Secretary Sarah Sanders attributes the timetable to Trump's different leadership style and says, "while he spends much of his average day in scheduled meetings, events and calls, there is time to allow for a more creative environment that has helped make him the most productive President in modern history".
OK, question for you Juan. When everything this President does is absolutely picked apart by the media and especially the Left, do you begrudge him having a bit of an opaque schedule that he can kind of have a bit room to breathe when obviously he's being productive in those spaces or do you think that the transparency needs to be afforded top to bottom to the American people?
WILLIAMS: Well, most honest people do know because you - not only is that the President's schedule available in most White Houses, but literally there is someone standing outside the West Wing, a military officer tells you when the President is in the office and right now is the big joke in D.C. that guy can just - he can disappear, because he's never there. But this is called executive time. So, I was intrigued by the response from the White House, Sarah Sanders saying, this allows him to be more creative. Creative? Really? That's very creative. I think other people would have a much more derogatory term for people who aren't at work when they're supposed to be at work.
WATTERS: You know who doesn't do executive time?
WILLIAMS: Tell me?
WATTERS: Hillary Clinton.
WILLIAMS: Is that right?
WATTERS: Because she's not President, Juan.
WILLIAMS: He won. I should say, he won Jesse. But you're right. WATTERS: Listen, whatever the President needs to be President is fine. He came from an unstructured atmosphere at the Trump Foundation, that's fine. The real story is who is leaking this type of material to the press. And this is just another really scary and dangerous series of leaks from people on the inside that are trying to either embarrass the President or pump up their own stature. And he really needs to do something about it. They have not yet gotten a handle on people resisting within the administration and they believe they're resisting for the good of the country. They believe they're doing things and they're trying to control the President and make sure the President doesn't follow his instincts too forwardly. And you know, who elected them.
WILLIAMS: Really, only the best people Jesse, only the best.
WATTERS: Only the best. Maybe it was Omarosa. COMPAGNO: Dana, so on that, do you think that the slow drip, drip that it will eventually erode the White House, or do you think as Jesse said-- PERINO: I think there is something to be said that they don't put detailed schedules out because they think it will leak. And I think there obviously there is people within this White House who will do that. I think it's disgusting. They're to work. You don't just work for the President. You work for the United States of America. You work for the people. And so that your responsibility is to us, not to embarrass the person that you are working for. That is - if that's inappropriate.
The other thing is, the government is working well without being micromanaged. OK. So, if you're a liberal who likes--
WATTERS: That's a good point.
PERINO: Who likes bigger government. If you think that the President is not doing enough work, but the government is actually working, then why do you care. Just let it go.
WILLIAMS: Maybe because the government shutdown.
COMPAGNO: Well, but that was from an inability to come to a collaboration. That wasn't because he wasn't doing his job.
PERINO: That was not because the president wasn't spending.
GUTFELD: There is something about your point. OK. It shows you how twisted into a pretzel the anti-Trump faction and their media enablers have become. They absolutely hate what Donald Trump is doing without actually figuring out what he's doing, but now condemn him for not doing enough of it.
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: That's like shouldn't they be happy, he's not working.
WATTERS: That you need to say about Barack Obama. I like him on the golf course.
PERINO: Yes. It's that messing things up.
GUTFELD: But also, about the instructor time is that, this does show how little they understand his skill set. We all knew this skill set is not a political skill set. He's a different person, almost entirely rooted the skill set in pursuing relationships, relentless persuasion and messaging. So, he's watching TV. He's seen - I've said this before, TV Fox News, it's his conduit to the American people. The way he sees the American people, his voters.
So, he looks, and he sees what's going on and then he tweets. This is most of his day. And yet you see things happening with the military, which are positive. North Korea trade. NATO jobs do more of it. Have more executive time, I say.
COMPAGNO: If your schedule was leaked, what would surprise us about it? GUTFELD: That's a great question.
COMPAGNO: (inaudible).
WILLIAMS: I know. Bathroom time.
GUTFELD: There's a lot of me time.
COMPAGNO: All right. We have to go. All right guys, one more thing is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It's time now for One More Thing. I have my - I made queso T-shirt. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Five. OK.
WATTERS: John.
PERINO: It's time for this. Dana, Sports Corner. OK. You know baseball is a game you play with bats. That's not on - for basketball. But the San Antonio Spurs look at these bats here. These bats were in the arena and the staff could not do anything to get rid of them, this disrupted play. The whole thing. And then fast forward to Saturday during the game against the Pelicans, they came back out. And this time however, the Spurs mascot, the coyote was ready for action. Watch this.
(VIDEO CLIP)
COMPAGNO: Oh! My God.
PERINO: He won the Coyote. Took the bats and the Spurs took the win over the Pelicans, maybe they should book the coyote for next year's Half-Time Show, Greg.
GUTFELD: If they wanted to get rid of the bats, they could have just brought out the queso. All right.
PERINO: Your turn.
GUTFELD: I am losing my animals are great mojo. All right. This is such a great video, I couldn't pass it up. Take a look at this great thing, a little rabbit there and this little cat said, hey these cats trying to get the rabbits attention, but doesn't want the rabbit to see. He's trying to do it. So, he keeps going over. Isn't that amazing. He's doing that and he's like, did he - but he's so smart. He keeps going over on the other side.
WATTERS: That's inappropriate.
PERINO: So, adorable.
GUTFELD: Is that inappropriate touching?
WATTERS: That's inappropriate touching.
GUTFELD: There is no me-too movement in the animal world, Jesse, unfortunately. But this is still great. And I just love how they get together which is why, animals are great. PERINO: Jesse?
WATTERS: That was Al Franklin's cat, right.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's right. OK.
WATTERS: All right, Jesse's hair news. Here we go everybody. So, some people go to their hairdresser to get a new do or style or whatever. Or if you're in the polar vortex you could do this. Look at this student Taylor scaling.
GUTFELD: Oh! Yes.
WATTERS: Her hair went outside the polar vortex.
PERINO: Wow.
WATTERS: My hair, Greg, I'm sorry, will never be as high as Taylor.
GUTFELD: I doubt that.
WATTERS: I promise.
PERINO: You've got to hold doing that, right. Juan?
WILLIAMS: I love that. That was cool. Anyway, last night's Super Bowl, a dud, but the commercials. They had some memorable moments. Take a look at this one.
(VIDEO CLIP)
That was NFL and to celebrate the league's 100th anniversary and included 40 of the league's greatest players, two other winners I think in the ad game, Bud Light play on Game of Thrones highlighting the use of corn syrup in competing bears and my favorite Verizon, in an unscripted ad putting Chargers coach Anthony Lane in a reunion with the first responders who saved his life after he was hit by a car in 2005. On the whole, it was a good night to watch the ads.
PERINO: The commercials were good. All right. Your turn, Emily.
COMPAGNO: OK, guys. So, this weekend I'm hosting Fox and Friends on Sunday on Super Bowl Sunday. We had this football competition between us between me, Pete and Ed. So, watch. Check this out.
(VIDEO CLIP)
Loser, because I've got the football through the thing, but apparently, I did touch the wall, whatever. That was awesome. That's me kicking field goals, which apparently and my form is horrible, whatever and then we had - throwing the football through the hole too.
PERINO: Well, we are glad you're here with us.
COMPAGNO: Thank you.
PERINO: And we think you're the winner. I'm still wearing this T-shirt. All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of "The Five."
