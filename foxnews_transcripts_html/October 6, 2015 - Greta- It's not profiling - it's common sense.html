     Video  Greta: It's not profiling - it's common sense 
Greta's 'Off the Record' commentary to 'On the Record' viewers, 10/6/15: Whatever happened to 'If you see something, say something.' Killers in these countless mass shootings are not normal neighbors; they fit a profile 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record." Do you remember this? "If you see something, say something." That means having the courage to risk being politically incorrect. It could save lives.
When we have these mass killings, like in Oregon, the killers almost always fit a profile. It's never your so-called "normal" neighbor or relative. It's someone with a pattern of acting weird, like collecting lots of guns with no good reason. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They are never hunters or target shooters. That's a clue. Most are obsessed with bad stuff on the Internet, or even wearing crazy stuff, like Nazi symbols, and they say hateful things. You know what I'm talking about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
S,o family members and killers' friends, don't you dare buy a person a gun you know who is up to no good. Not for hunting. The same thing is true for a gun dealers. You have a sixth sense. Make a call, not a sale. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So my message to all of us is this: Speak up. Critics will call it profiling it. I will call it common sense. The politically correct are going to rain all over my parade for saying this, but I'm sick of reporting these stories. They are all heart-breakers.
So, if you see something, for God's sake say something. And if it turns out you are wrong, just apologize. I would rather make that mistake than ignore the obvious and be saying something else after the fact - the deadly fact. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
