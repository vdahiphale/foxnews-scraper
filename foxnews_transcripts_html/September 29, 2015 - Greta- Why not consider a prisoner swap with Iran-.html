Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers, 9/29/15: I don't want to start a run on kidnapping Americans, but a one-time exchange may be the best way to bring our Americans held in Iran home

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

Let's all go "Off the Record." Think about this: Iran says the U.S. is holding 19 Iranians for violating sanctions laws. As soon as we lift the sanctions, their conduct would no longer be illegal, although they did commit crimes at the time.
I don't want to start a run on rogue governments kidnapping innocent Americans. But Iran is holding three innocent Americans who never got open and fair trials - Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini, U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, former FBI agent Robert Levinson and Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Iranian President Rouhani said he would consider releasing our four people for Iranian nationals. Maybe we should. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If President Obama can swap five Taliban terrorists for an accused deserter like Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl - a stunning deal - why can't President Obama do a one-time deal? Three Iranians whose conduct will soon no longer be illegal for our three innocent Americans. Or give them five, I don't care. I just want this to end for the families of those innocent Americans. I want those innocent Americans home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Like I said, I don't want to start a run on kidnapping Americans. But let's at least think about this one. Consider it, with all its danger, it still might be the best solution to bring our innocent Americans home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm not convinced it's a good idea, but let me say we should at least think about it. Do you have a better idea? Go to my Facebook page and tell me what you think. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
