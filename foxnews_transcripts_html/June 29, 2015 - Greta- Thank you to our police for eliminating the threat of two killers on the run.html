'Off the Record,' 6/29/15: The killing of Richard Matt and capture of David Sweat shows why we should always appreciate our law enforcement officials

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. This "Off the Record" is so necessary and, frankly, I don't think we can all say it enough. But, here it is: Thank you to all the law enforcement in the state of New York for eliminating the real and imminent threat of two killers on the run.
David Sweat and Richard Matt both have killed before, and there was every reason to believe that if given the opportunity, they would kill again. Law enforcement, for days in rough conditions, never gave up. And they got their men, both of them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, we need to thank the families of the law enforcement. Every day the families saw their spouse or mother or father head out to continue the search, not knowing whether that kiss goodbye would be the last one or if that brave member of law enforcement would return home again or not. That's how dangerous these fugitives were. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, let me repeat the obvious: There is no doubt, if given the chance, both would kill again. So, thank you to law enforcement for the job well-done, and thank you to their families who likewise sacrifice for us. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
