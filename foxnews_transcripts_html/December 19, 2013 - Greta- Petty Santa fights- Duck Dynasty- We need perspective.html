'Off the Record', 12/19/13: We all get consumed with tabloid scandals, but sometimes life can give you a jolt on what's truly important

OK, let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. One view of life is formed by personal perspectives. Perspectives, of course, can be fleeting and I don't mean to be bombastic or sanctimonious, but I have had one of those years that can make a lot of stuff look pretty petty, just something to fight about.
This year, in my family, we got a big dose of the serious stuff, cancer. It's now handled, but cancer sure can shake you up. It gives that you a jolt to remind you what's important in life. And then what I saw last week, when I was in the Syrian refugee camp, people -- children -- cold, hungry and scared. Another jolt to remind us what's important in life. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When I got back to Washington, I took at step back and I took a look at us. The media obsessed with the Santa fight, people ridiculing others for religious convictions, some even criticized for simply saying "Merry Christmas." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Today, we are all consumed with a reality show star exercising his First Amendment right, but also saying something crude hurtful to many. It's no to say these stories are not important. But I can't help but think we are all beginning to look a bit petty when we seem to go out of our way to rough each other up rather than the flip side, to find ways to make it go right for everyone. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
