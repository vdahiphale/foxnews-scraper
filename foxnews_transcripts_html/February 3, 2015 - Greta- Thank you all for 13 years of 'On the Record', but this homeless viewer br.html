Let's all go "Off the Record." Wednesday is the 13th anniversary of "On the Record." Time flies, doesn't it? So I want to stop and thank you, the viewers. Many of you have been hanging in there with us for a very long time, making us and keeping us number one in our time slot. You know I really appreciate that.
But as much as I love all of you. and that includes all the new viewers, this fan touches my heart - maybe, breaks my heart. A friend of mine from another network snapped this picture last night and emailed it to me. This is a homeless woman sitting on a box watching "On the Record" through a glass window of a bank in downtown D.C. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, if you look closely, you can see me in the picture. I doubt the woman can hear the show because of the thick glass but apparently, she reads the subtitles. I'm so flattered she watched. I'm also distressed. It doesn't look like she has a home. Plus, it's really cold in D.C. right now. So I worry about her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, frankly, I worry about our other homeless. There are tens of thousands of homeless across this great nation of ours and I wonder, do we pay enough attention to the homeless problem in this nation? I think not. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
