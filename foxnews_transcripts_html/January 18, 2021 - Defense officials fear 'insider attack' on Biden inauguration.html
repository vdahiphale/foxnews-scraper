BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Thin mints, I got it. Thanks,Dana. Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we are less than two days from an inauguration unlike anyother in our nation's history. The U.S. Capitol city and the U.S. CapitolBuilding on edge and a high security alert tonight.A fire nearby this morning prompted a lockdown of part of the Capitolfacility. This comes amid fears of possibly violent protests here inWashington and in state capitals throughout the country.There are growing concerns of an insider attack. Concerns that have led theFBI to vet all of the 25,000 plus National Guard troops protectingWashington D.C. this week. Correspondent Rich Edson starts us off tonight.Good evening, Rich.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hi, good evening,Bret. And shortly after that lockdown at the Capitol Complex, it returnedto somewhat normal here. Minus the massive National Guard presentsthousands of police officers and a multilayer miles long securityperimeter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (voice over): The U.S. Capitol's alert system came alive shortlybefore 10:30 this morning, warning those inside to keep away from windowsand doors because of an external security threat.Police say that threat turned out to be a small fire nearby, but the momentunderscored the tension ahead of Wednesday's inauguration.25,000 National Guard members are preparing to secure Washington this weekwith about 2-1/2 times more than previous inaugurations.MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM WALKER, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD: We want tomake sure that we have the right people in this security bubble. And wehave the time and the ability to do it.EDSON: Defense officials say they're working to re-examine National Guardmembers assigned to the inauguration over concerns about any potentialinsider threats.Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller says, "While we have no intelligenceindicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securingthe Capitol."Along with federal and local police officers, the National Guard has set upcheckpoints throughout Washington and have through the weekend already madea handful of arrests, including those for bringing firearms into D.C.However, Homeland Security officials say the threat of violence extendswell beyond the Capitol.KEN CUCCINELLI, DEPUTY SECRETARY, HOMELAND AND SECURITY DEPARTMENT: Thereis a lot more online chatter, if you will, that has come up since January6th. But I would point out that a lot of that chatter isn't Capitol night -- nation's Capitol focus, it's more general across the country.EDSON: In Washington, the historic inarguable security presence is in parta response to the Capitol riots two weeks ago. The New Yorker has justreleased video of the mob storming the Capitol invading the Senate chamberand threatening congressional leaders, police and journalists.There are at least 80 active federal cases with prosecutors steadilyannouncing more charges, including Thomas Fee, a recently retired New YorkCity firefighter. Couy Griffin, a New Mexico county commissioner and thefounder of Cowboys for Trump, who prosecutors say promised to return armsto Washington for this week's inauguration and "Plant our flag on SpeakerPelosi's desk."And federal authorities say they are also looking for more, including RileyJune Williams, who authorities say they suspect took a laptop or hard drivefrom House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and tried to sell it to theRussians. The FBI says the case is still under investigation.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON (on camera): As federal law enforcement sifts through the evidence ofthat January 6th attack; they are also reviewing their own performance. TheInspector General for the Department of Homeland Security has announced areview joining the inspector general's from the Departments of Justice,Interior and Defense, Bret.BAIER: Rich Edson on Capitol Hill. Rich, we have thousands of troops herein D.C. and I hear there's some of them are receiving a bit of protectionthemselves.EDSON: Now they are. They're used to giving the vaccines in their homestates, but now they're getting it here. The Maryland National Guard hassown some photos says that a number of their members who are in town todefend the Capitol during the inauguration, they've gotten the COVID-19vaccine. This is at a time when there are guard members in Washington fromall 50 states, all the territories and the District of Columbia.Also, in more than a dozen states, they are working to administer thevaccine, work on logistics. 33,000 guard members according to the NationalGuard are deployed for either that or are in their home states doinglogistics or peace operations there to maintain the peace, Bret.BAIER: Good to see you, Rich, thank you.We did not see President Trump on this the next to last day of his term butthere is said to be plenty of activity in his final hours surroundingpotential pardons and commutations. The big questions who and how many?White House Correspondent Kristin Fisher has that story tonight from theNorth Lawn. Good evening, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. President Trump is expected to issue between around 50 and a hundredcommutations and pardons before he leaves office according to multiplepeople familiar with this list.But he is not expected to issue a protective pardon for himself or formembers of his family as some mainstream media outlets have reported thathe was considering doing. And one of the most high-profile names that wasbeing discussed in this latest round of pardons was Julian Assange.But despite an aggressive campaign by WikiLeaks to try to secure a pardonfor its founder, President Trump is not expected to give him one. He isexpected to grant a pardon for the rapper Little Wang who pleaded guiltythis year to a federal gun charge. And then there's the president's formerchief strategist, Steve Bannon, who was arrested on fraud charges over thesummer. It's unclear at this point though, if Bannon is going to get one.As the president's term comes to a close, many are giving their finalfarewells. And this afternoon, the First Lady Melania Trump issued afarewell address on her Twitter account in which he urged all Americans tochoose love over hatred and peace over violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Be passionate in everythingyou do but always remember that violence is never the answer and will neverbe justified.FISHER (voice over): On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence visited troops atFort Drum in New York and delivered remarks which he described as his finalspeech as vice president.During those remarks, the V.P. highlighted the administration's efforts toget U.S. troops out of endless wars in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I'm proud to reportwith just a few days left in our administration, our administration is thefirst administration in decades that did not get America into a new war.That is peace through strength.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): And in terms of timing for these upcoming pardons andcommutations, a few White House officials say that they will likely comedown tomorrow. But Bret, President Trump has until noon on Wednesday to doit, Bret.BAIER: Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you.The President-Elect Biden's pick to run the Pentagon is getting some moresupport tonight. 16 former defense officials including four former defensesecretaries are backing a waiver that would allow Retired General LloydAustin to serve in that capacity.The waiver is necessary to get around the minimum seven-year gap betweenuniformed service and the top Pentagon job. Several Democrats on the SenateArmed Services Committee have indicated they will not support that waiver.These are President-Elect Joe Biden's final days at his Wilmington,Delaware home before leaving for Washington and his new home 1600Pennsylvania Avenue.

RICK SCOTT (R-FL): And what Biden wants to do is give it to de Blasioand give it to Cuomo and say, here let me -- I know you can't live withinyour means. I know other states have paid for this. But you know, we'regoing to just going to give you some money for -- you know, just you know,because we like you.DOOCY: What's driving the new agenda? An L.A. Times headline reads, makeAmerica California again? That's Biden's plan. It makes the point even someideas that haven't worked out so well in California are on the nationalagenda now. Biden is a fierce proponent of high-speed rail, as well as newprotections for gig economy workers that California voters diluted inNovember.Today, Biden and Harris volunteered at food kitchens. Biden inPhiladelphia. Harris in D.C., where she teased major policy changes.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let's say thatours is an ambitious goal.DOOCY: And the now former California senator has been told she'll be thelast one in the room with Biden before anything big happens.BIDEN: I may not be much, but I know how to pick them.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): And the sun has set on Joe Biden's final full day inDelaware before the swearing in because even though he and President Trumpstill haven't spoken since the election, tomorrow, Biden is going to stayin a building officially known as the president's guest house warehouse,Bret.BAIER: Right across the street, White House Correspondent Peter Doocy,thanks.

Social media sitescontinue the crackdown on users, accused of violating big tech's rules. Butconservatives are finding ways around it.This comes against the backdrop of the waiting game on just when the U.S.Senate will hold its impeachment trial of outgoing President Donald Trump.Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel brings us up to date.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Senator Lindsey Graham is calling on incoming majority leader ChuckSchumer to hold a vote to dismiss the article of impeachment againstPresident Trump.Graham warning in this letter, "In your first act as majority leader,rather than begin the national healing that the country so desperatelyyearns for, you seek vengeance and political retaliation instead."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Now, I'm asking Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden towithstand the pressure from the radical left, stand down what I believe tobe clearly an unconstitutional impeachment of a president leaving office,it will create further division in the country.EMANUEL: The senate democratic whip, says dismissal is unlikely.SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): I think there is precedent to suggest that even ifDonald Trump's left town, he is still going to be held responsible for whathappened, January 6th.EMANUEL: There are also signs of more targeting of conservatives followingthe riot at Capitol Hill. Loews Hotels will no longer allow a fundraiserfor Senator Josh Hawley at one of its hotels.Hawley firing back, "I will not bow to left-wing corporate pressure."

And they're expressing the hope it won't take long to get it done.Bret.BAIE: All right, Mike, thank you.Up next, we're just minutes away from one of the moments created just forWednesday's inauguration. We'll show you that live. Stay tuned for adisplay you're unlikely to see anywhere else but the comfort of your home.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago, as a California man who told police hewas afraid to fly because of the pandemic is arrested on charges that hehid in a secured area at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for threemonths. Aditya Singh is charged with felony criminal trespass andmisdemeanor theft.Fox 11 in Los Angeles says legendary music producer Phil Spector dies in aCalifornia prison. Spector who was convicted of murdering actress LanaClarkson at his home in 2003, reportedly died of COVID. He was 81.And this is a live look at Atlanta from our affiliate Fox 5 down there. Oneof the big stories there tonight.The pandemic forces organizers to move the Martin Luther King Junior DayCommemorative Service to a virtual format. Dr. King's daughter, CEO of theKing Center, Bernice King says she is saddened people could not attend theservice. But says the virtual format allows more creativity and apotentially larger audience.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: You're looking live at the National Mall there. In just a fewseconds, more than 191,000 U.S. flags will be lit up with 56 pillars oflight. It's called the Field of Flags. You'll see it here live on Fox.Meantime, Wednesday's inauguration will be historic and most exceptional,obviously, the oldest incoming president and absent outgoing president fromthe ceremony. A female vice president of color, and with the pandemic infull force a change in the usual pomp and circumstance.Correspond Kevin Corke takes a look at the final preparations includingsomething, as we mentioned, happening right now. Good evening, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Bret. Apublic display of art here on the National Mall not very far from where weare standing here tonight. You mention 191,000 U.S. flags -- to be exact,191,500. And you're right, 56 pillars of light. By the way, the 56 meant torepresent the U.S. states and territories.Again, this is the Inaugural Committee's idea about creating an environmentof American unity ahead of the inauguration. And certainly, this country,frankly, between you and me and the fencepost could use a lot of thatmoving forward.Now, as you know, modern inaugurations have really spanned the gamut. Wehave seen them be historic. We've also seen them, of course, be quitebuzzworthy. And this year's inauguration can obviously turn out to be both.Among many firsts, as you mentioned the first woman vice president and vicepresident of color, Kamala Harris. Another first, President Trump, thefirst outgoing president in more than 100 years, 152 years to be exact, tonot attend his successor's inauguration, a reflection of political tenureof the times to be sure. But also in sharp contrast to the lastinauguration when both President Obama and former Secretary of StateHillary Clinton did attend despite their obvious political differences withthe then incoming president.Another difference, Bret, is the pageantry that we've come to expect fromthe inauguration. That has obviously changed not just because of COVID-19but certainly because of the heightened security situation here in thenation's capital. So you're going to see a number of very different thingshappen here this year for the inauguration. We're going to talk about thetraditional parade, for example. Yes, there will be a parade, but it won'tbe the kind we are used to seeing, and there won't be an inaugural balllike we are used to seeing. We're talking about replaced by virtual videoproductions instead.Meanwhile, back out live in Washington, the display on the mall, as Imentioned, all those flags representing all the American people who will beunable to travel here to Washington to take part this year, Bret.BAIER:  Kevin, we are looking live at this picture, and we should take iffull again. We were told it was going to be 6:30 on the nose when thiswould launch. I haven't seen it yet, unless there is something I'm missingin this live picture. But we will continue to show you this live because itis supposed to, according to pool reporting, be pretty cool once ithappens. Despite these changes this year, Kevin, you have a list ofluminaries from music and art and sports, pretty long. What about that?CORKE:  Yes, pretty surprising, actually, when you consider everything thathas happened, they're still trying to create celebratory atmosphere. Sowe're talking about a Wednesday night broadcast, Bret, that they are goingto have on Inauguration Day, the Inaugural Committee hoping to invitepeople like Lin-Manuel from "Hamilton" fame, Lin-Manuel Miranda from"Hamilton" fame. John Legend is also expected to take part in that event,Justin Timberlake, Demi Lovato, just to name a few. Again, the idea is theyshould be a celebration for all Americans, and by having then performWednesday night, they are hoping this will bring us all together. Bret?BAIER:  Hopefully we will get the field of flags to bring you that visual.It promises to be good. We'll bring it to you when it is.All right, up next, the special panel with the final destinations, thefinal days of the Trump administration as we wait for pardons, that iscoming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DICK DURBIN, (D-IL) SENATE DEMOCRATIC WHIP:  I don't think there's anypromise to date when Speaker Pelosi is going to present the articles ofimpeachment. We understand under the Constitution we have a responsibilityto act as quickly as possible.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC):  This is insane at every level. It will createfurther division in the country. What good comes from impeaching DonaldTrump after he leaves office? This is a scarlet letter impeachment.REP. JOE NEGUSE (D-CO):  We cannot be, as a constitutional republic, acountry where the president of the United States can incite an armedinsurrection and face no consequences.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The impeachment, when will it happen, the trial in the Senate? Thisis a real question as you get to the beginning of the Biden administration.Let's bring in a special panel, they used to spend a lot of time with eachother on this show, FOX senior political analyst Brit Hume, Mara Liasson,national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and FredBarnes, senior columnist at "The Washington Examiner." Panel thanks forbeing here. And I couldn't help but quote from someone else who wouldusually be here, and that is Mort Kondracke. And he had an op-ed saying"Why rushing to impeach Trump is a gift to Trumpers," saying "A good casecan be made that Senate Democrats would only help him by trying to convicthim now and failing again, which they're most likely to do. If more than 17senator Republicans stick with Trump, as seems likely, he will claimexoneration and feel encouraged to continue dominating the GOP and runagain in 2024. So the best course may be to hold off sending the House'sArticle of Impeachment to the Senate, at least until President Joe Bidenhas completed his first 100 days. It would provide time for the January 6Capitol invasion to be thoroughly investigated, possibly turning up newevidence of Trump's involvement and making it harder for Republicans toresist conviction if Democrats decided to pursue it." Mort Kondracke therewriting an op-ed. And Brit, you could say, oh, Mort, or however you want torespond to that.(LAUGHTER)BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I haven't had a chance tosay "Oh, Mort," for a long time. And I don't totally disagree what he issaying. I think there is a more compelling reason, though, and that isWednesday is the day the Trump era officially ends and the Biden erabegins. It is the traditional beginning of proverbial first 100 days when apresident wants to hold the spotlight, place it on his or her agenda,hasn't been a her yet, but on his agenda, and move forward.And if you are in an impeachment conviction trial for conviction in theSenate, you are off on an entirely different mission, one that is bound tohog the headlines and keep Trump in the limelight, and detract from whatPresident Biden is trying to do. So I think it's a good question of whetherNancy Pelosi will send the articles over right away so that a trial canbegin right away. She has the option of holding it. Remember, she did it inthe original impeachment of President Trump, she held it for some time,trying to lever the Senate into doing something the Senate didn't do. Butshe might well try it again.BAIER:  We are trying again to get this visual of the field of flags thatis taking a lot longer than the 6:30 start, they said. Fred, what aboutyour fellow beltway boy and the prospect of Mort Kondracke saying 100 daysafter the Biden administration takes office to then go after the presidentin the Senate trial who has left 100 days earlier?FRED BARNES, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Good luck, Mort. I don't think that isgoing to happen. I don't think Trump is going to be convicted under theimpeachment charge anyway. The votes probably aren't there. And look, whathas happened that is more important than that is that Trump's career isgone. Look, he's finished as a politician now. And this is what makes itsuch a fine thing for Republicans in Congress, in the House and the Senateand running around the country, Trump is no longer a drag on them.Look what has happened. He didn't win reelection. He was barred being onTwitter, that really hurts Trump who leaned heavily as his communicationwith the whole country on tweet. Of course, he had rallies, but tweetingwas important. All the events on January 6th, we know those, and thosecertainly hurt Trump. And look, his polling has dropped down to the low30s. I think he's gone. And now Republicans are where they want to be, andthat is the opposition to the Biden agenda, which we know now, we see whathe's done, he sounds like Bernie Sanders. Biden is not acting like acentrist.BAIER:  Mara, what about that, and the launching this agenda with theprospect of the specter of that impeachment looming?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, look, Joe Biden has said he wants to somehow bifurcate the Senateproceedings where you do impeachment half the day and work on his agendathe other half. He wants to keep impeachment at arm's length. He wants tofocus on the pandemic and say impeachment is something that Congress isdoing.I don't know if that's going to be possible for him to continue that. Onething that Mort has put his finger on is Democrats have a lot of things,equities to balance. They want Trump to have some kind of consequences,they want to hold him accountable for what happened, but they don't want tomake him a martyr or make him even more popular.I don't know if I agree with Fred that he's finished. He has a very stronghold on the Republican base, 70 percent of Republicans say they believe theelection was stolen from him, that he won. That is simply false, but theybelieve it. He has very strong support out in the country among Republicanstate party officials. So I don't think he's finished. I think there arebig questions about, how do you handle a Senate trial for a president thatis not president, for an ex-president?BAIER:  But Brit, how, to Fred's point, how left the Biden agenda tries togo for as opposed to moderation to get things across the finish line mayaffect how Trump's future is in a Republican Party, at least the shortterm.HUME:  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is in a very,very red state, has said he is not prepared to vote to end the filibuster,which will mean the filibuster remains in effect, it will take 60 votes topass anything in the Senate, with the exception of certain categories orcertain legislation you can pass with 51 votes. But the broad sweepingagenda about which Joe Biden has been speaking can't pass without 60 votes.You're not going to get 60 votes for anything that's truly, truly heavyduty, controversial liberal stuff, which is the kind of thing he's beentalking about.So as long as you have the filibuster, he needs to find a way to passlegislation that can be supported by at least some Republicans and give himsome achievements to get started with. Otherwise, his agenda will bestymied, and we've now got these markers, 100 million vaccine shots in thefirst 100 days, he is going to bring us together. A truly controversialliberal agenda isn't going to help to bring us together. It will dividepeople even further and make for an even more divisive atmosphere inWashington. So I think Joe Biden has got some thinking to do about what hewants to try to do in Congress.BAIER:  There will be a lot, I'm sure, that falls into the COVID bucketwhen it comes to legislation.But when we come back, we'll talk about the Biden agenda and those firstfew days in office.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE BEDINGFIELD, BIDEN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Across the course of thefirst week-and-a-half in office you're going to see him move on promisesthat he made on the campaign trail to ensure that we are focused onworkers. You'll see him make good on his buy American promise. You're goingto see him make good on promises us toward a more just and raciallyequitable society.The second piece of the agenda will be working with Congress. You sawPresident-elect Biden roll out the American Rescue Plan. This is a plan toget desperately needed direct relief to the people who have been hardesthit by this crisis all over the country. And it's an effort to fund acoordinated federal vaccine effort.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Kate Bedingfield with the President-elect's team, talking about theagenda in the first 10 days of office. There are a series of executiveactions expected, rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, reverse the travelban on people from Muslim majority countries, extend a pause on studentloan debt payments, cancel Keystone XL pipeline, permit perhaps, orderfamilies separated at the border to be reunited, expand COVID testing,expand access to health care.We're back with the panel. Fred Barnes, what about that effort, how muchcan President Biden overturn of a Trump agenda early?BARNES:  It would be difficult for him to do it early because much of theTrump agenda is in legislation, and that would have to be turned. You can'tdo it by executive order. I, frankly, went to sleep hearing who that wasoutlining the Biden agenda. Look, it's $1.9 trillion to spend, $130 billionfor the teachers union, more money for food stamps, $400 to people who arealready getting employment insurance, they're getting an extra $400 foreach payment. And how does that compare to Barack Obama did in 2009 when hehad a similar program to help out people, he added $25, not $400 to thewhole unemployment payment. And it goes on and on and on, all this moneybeing spent without doing one thing that's so important -- creating jobs.It's paying people not to work.BAIER:  Mara?LIASSON:  Yes, the Biden people say they're going to have a jobs bill, ajobs package that they're going to be presenting pretty soon too. Look,some of the things that he wants to do, the things that he needslegislation for, it's going to be tough in a 50/50 Senate, there is nodoubt about that. But there are a lot of things he can do by executiveorder, and I think one of the biggest things he can do is, as he put it,manage the hell out of the pandemic, which means get a lot of vaccinationsout there. If he can, he'll be showing that government can actually helppeople on a day-to-day basis. He can get the supply going and thedistribution going. That's really his first job in the first couple ofmonths. He's got to get that solved.The other stuff, some of them are popular -- raising the federal minimumwage to $15 an hour. Don't forget Florida voters voted for that by 62percent as they were voting for Donald Trump to win the state by threepoints. So there's stuff in there that has bipartisan support. Other thingsare going to be a lot harder.BAIER:  Brit, "The L.A. Times" had a piece called "Make America CaliforniaAgain." That is Biden's plan, to use California as his think tank for whatto do for the rest of the country. What about that?HUME:  I think it's dangerous because people are pouring out of Californiaand other states as we speak. California has had a terrible experience withthe coronavirus. A lot of ideas do come out of California, but in recenttimes, they haven't always been the best ideas, as California's recentfortunes tell us.I would say this about Biden, he cannot undo a lot of things that Trump didby executive order, and that list that you presented at the top of thesegment exemplifies that. But as my colleagues have been saying, in a 50-50Senate and also with a narrowly divided House, moving a lot of really big,ambitious stuff, such as green new agenda type stuff, is going to be verydifficult. And I think what Biden has to be concerned about is he's made alot of promises, he may make some more come Wednesday. And we will start,finally, to stop thinking about Donald Trump and start measuring Joe Bidenagainst what he has promised. And we'll see how that scorecard turns out,but that's where we'll be.BAIER:  But Brit, to stop thinking Donald Trump is a big thing, because thelast two Democratic presidents in 1994, Bill Clinton, and 2010, BarackObama, lost Congress after their first two years. And if Trump is hangingaround --HUME:  Well, Trump may be hanging around. It remains to be seen what kindof role he will have. Trump has financial difficulties and otherdistractions to deal with, and he's lost some of his platform, to say theleast. So it will be interesting to see whether he will be able to makehimself as visible as he has been.BARNES:  The media is going to -- BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by. When we come back, something new,something new, the panel on tomorrow's headline tonight. As we go to break,those flags, finally, those flags, there they are.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  And we are back with our special panel with a new segment. We'regoing to look at tomorrow's headlines, what that might be, a look at ittonight. Mara, first to you.LIASSON:  My headline is business group surprisingly positive about partsof Biden's agenda. That is something that surprised me, to hear the Chamberof Commerce praise his COVID-19 agenda. I don't think we are seeing a hugerealignment here. Business community is pretty solid Republican. But Ithink it's surprising that they are as open as they are Biden's plan.BAIER:  All right, Brit, your headline tonight?HUME:  My headline tonight, or tomorrow, would be Pelosi sends Article ofImpeachment to Senate, or Pelosi declines to send Article of Impeachment tothe Senate, which would tell us a lot about what will lie ahead asPresident Biden takes office.BAIER:  All right, Fred, headline tomorrow, give it to us tonight.BARNES:  Biden orders Americans to wear lifetime masks.(LAUGHTER)BARNES:  I'm only partially joking there. Biden is fanatical about masks,which has really become an ideological issue. Conservatives are very easygoing about masks, and Democrats, so many of them get all whipped up if youdon't wear a mask. And I wear when I need to.BAIER:  All right, I'm not sure that headline is coming, but we'll see.Thanks, panel, a lot of fun tonight.Thanks for inviting us into your home. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.Fair, balanced and still unafraid.
