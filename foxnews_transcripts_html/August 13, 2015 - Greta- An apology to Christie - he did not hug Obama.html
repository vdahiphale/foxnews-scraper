     Video  Greta: An apology to Christie - he did not hug Obama 
'Off the Record,' 8/13/15: Nearly three years after Sandy and after reviewing pictures and video, it is time to fix a wrong. NJ Gov. Chris Christie merely extended his hand to President Obama and did not hug him.

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's all go "Off the Record." You heard me apologize to Governor Christie for my loose use of the term "hug."
Now here's the picture of the day I was talking about. It was taken October 31, 2012. And this is the important date. It was only six days before the November 2012 election. And many Republicans have been unhappy with Governor Christie for his greeting that day of President Obama, who then went on to trounce Governor Romney in the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, after looking at the picture and the video, I concluded there was no hug. That was Governor Christie extending his hand to greet the president, and the president arrived in New Jersey to check out the damage just three days after Hurricane Sandy had slammed the state. I see a handshake. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the president putting his hand on Governor Christie's shoulder - no hug there. Of course, I'm trying very hard to be fair to Governor Christie and all the other candidates, so I show the photo and the video. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I add, I report, you decide. Take a look. Hug or no hug? I say no hug. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page. And by the way, there is no doubt a hug between Florida Governor Charlie Crist and President Obama. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
