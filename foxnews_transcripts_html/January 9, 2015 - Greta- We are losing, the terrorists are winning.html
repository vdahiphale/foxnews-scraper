'Off the Record,' 1/9/15: Terror cells are growing by leaps and bounds, our strategy for fighting terror clearly isn't working. It's inevitable we'll get hit again. #ParisShooting #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. OK, I will say it: We are losing. Terrorists are winning.
We are losing, and if you think I'm wrong and that terrorism is something they need to worry about only in Australia, Ottawa or Paris, I want to know what you are drinking. We've seen it before. We've been hit before. Think 9/11. So, of course, we're going to get hit again. Why wouldn't we? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You think the terrorists suddenly like us -- woke up one day and like us? Well, that thought is absurd. They hate us. They say it. They threaten us. They destroy our embassies. They kidnap Americans. They behead Americans. How much more proof does anyone need? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you can't ignore the obvious. Terrorist cells are not shrinking. They are growing and growing by leaps and bounds. That is solid proof we are losing, and we're losing big-time. So, whatever our nation's strategy to fight terrorists and terrorism is, it's just not working. You don't keep losing unless your strategy likewise is a loser. So we have obvious problem and we need a new strategy, a new plan. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What should we do? OK, I confess, I don't have all the answers. I don't have any, in fact. But then again, I didn't ask you for your vote. I didn't run a campaign promising to keep Americans safe. We need answers from all those people, all those politicians who did. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
