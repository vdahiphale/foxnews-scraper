'Off the Record', 10/17/13: Greta wonders whether Reid-McConnell budget deal should have included the expensive project from McConnell's home state

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Last night, much of the nation watched that political chaos. It was embarrassing. Our politicians, well, they failed us, forcing that last-minute race to the finish line to avoid the debt ceiling deadline. Our lawmakers rushed that quickly directed bill to the floor of the Senate for that hasty vote.
You and I both know no one or almost no one read it. They didn't have time if you wanted to read it, they just blindly voted. But here's the catch, something for you to think about. What was the sole purpose of last night's bill, at least supposedly? Reopen the government and avoid going over the debt ceiling cliff, right? Really? So why is there $2.9 billion earmark in it for a Kentucky dam? What does that have to do with reopening the government or raising the debt ceiling? I don't get it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Wouldn't you think this is the one time to play it straight with us? That's what we want. Politicians just can't help themselves. They are like addicts, sneaking in that pork any chance they have. And as an aside, this is not whether the $2.9 billion for a Kentucky dam is a good idea or a bad idea. It's the process. It got sneaked in. Is that right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
