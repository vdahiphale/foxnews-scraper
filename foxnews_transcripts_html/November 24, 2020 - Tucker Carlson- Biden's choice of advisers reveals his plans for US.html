TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. Happy Tuesday. So here's a question for you. What does Joe Biden believe? What are hisplans for our country? Well, it is hard to comprehend this, but the truth is, we still don't knowthe answers to those most basic questions, we don't. Somehow Joe Biden madeit through an entire presidential campaign, most of the year, withouttelling us. A partisan press corps let him get away with it. That may bethe single most dishonest thing that has ever happened in Americanpolitics. If you're looking for election rigging, there you go. Tens of millions ofpeople voted for a candidate who wasn't real. They voted for a ghost with awhitened smile. They had no idea who this man was. They had no idea whothey were voting for, or what he might do if he got elected. But at theurging of the media, they voted for him anyway. And so now the rest of us get to find out what they voted for. Joe Biden is starting to assemble his Cabinet. So we're going to go by hischoices to let us know what we can expect. And what is emerging so far asof tonight looks a lot like the HR department at a large left-wingmultinational. Heaps of woke authoritarian social policy mixed with acorporatist economic agenda. So the rest of us will get stern lectures about our moral failings -- thosenever end -- while a small group of highly connected people will get evenricher. Does that sound familiar to you? If Jeff Bezos and the Google guys took over the entire U.S. government --and effectively they have -- this is what it would look like. Steve Ricchetti is the archetype for the new Biden aides. He is now one ofJoe Biden's closest advisers. Ricchetti has spent years as a lobbyist. Heis representing companies like General Motors, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, EliLilly, Nextel, Novartis, Pfizer -- all the big -- all the big pharmacompanies. Ricchetti is one of the people who helped lead the alignment of BigBusiness squarely behind the Joe Biden for President Campaign, and he wasthe perfect man to do it because he shares their goals and their worldview,particularly on the question, the central question of China. Twenty years ago, Steve Ricchetti was the Deputy Chief of Staff to BillClinton. And in that role, he helped lead the effort to allow China intothe World Trade Organization. That turned out to be not a small thing atall. His lobbying worked. The result, in the end, it was one of thegreatest disasters ever to befall this country in peacetime. One study by the Economic Policy Institute -- and there are others -- butthis one found that thanks to that decision to let China into the W.T.O.,the United States lost nearly three and a half million good paying jobs,and the effects of that have rippled through the generations. If you're wondering why there's a fentanyl epidemic in Middle America, ifyou're wondering why the life expectancy for American born, middle classAmericans is in decline, that's a big part of the reason. Millions of men lost their jobs, and an entire society collapsed. If you live inward from the coasts, you've seen it firsthand. Steve Ricchetti was one of the people behind it, not the only one, but oneof the key people. He wasn't punished for it. In fact, he has beenpromoted. Joe Biden wants more of it. Biden also wants less dissent from the population. Biden knows what we allknow, which is that an armed society is an independent society. He's notfor that. And that's why he's hired Congressman Cedric Richmond as a senioradviser. Richmond plans to disarm law-abiding Americans -- not criminals -- peoplewho commit gun crimes are now being let out of jail, but law-abidingAmericans, people who have done nothing wrong, who have tried in good faithto protect themselves and their family, they will be punished. That's notspeculation by the way, Richmond has said so on television. Here he is onCNN last year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND (D-LA):  It is a buyback, then I'm all for it. If it'sa mandatory buyback, I think you may run into some complications, but thethought of it does not offend me and it sounds like something I couldsupport. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So gun control didn't play a large role in our debates coming upto the election. There was almost no discussion about issues for sixmonths. But it's becoming clear that preventing Americans from defendingthemselves and their families is a big part of the Biden agenda, and that'spart of the reason that campaign manager Jennifer O'Malley Dillon to be hisDeputy Chief of Staff. At a time when a record number of Americans have purchased legal firearmsto protect themselves from skyrocketing crime, Dillon has called for thisconfiscation of more than 10 million legally owned firearms. Again, we're not making that up. It's not propaganda. Here she is saying itherself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER O'MALLEY DILLON, DESIGNATE WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF UNDERU.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN:  Put a plan that supports -- we'll see --mandatory buybacks of weapons of war. The assault weapons ban is very, very important, and we need to have it.But that only takes weapons of war off the streets in the future. It doesnothing for weapons of war that are currently out there, and I thinkthere's 15 or 16 million. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  "I think there's 15 or 16 million." She doesn't know the numbers.She doesn't know anything. Imagine what she knows about firearms or aboutanything else, probably about zero. What end does the bullet come out of?She doesn't know. But it doesn't matter, she plans to seize them anyway. Mandatory buybacks are seizure. Taking private property by force. Notbecause the people who own those firearms have done anything wrong, theyhaven't, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon just doesn't think you should be allowedto have them. So what's that going to look like? What's it going to looklike when the Biden administration tries to disarm law-abiding Americans?Apparently, we'll find out. We do know the entire country could look very different very soon.Alejandro Mayorkas will make certain of that. Biden has chosen him to runthe Department of Homeland Security. Now, the Department of HomelandSecurity, if you're old enough, you will remember was created almost 20years ago in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and it had just one purpose,protect the country. Mayorkas has a different plan for D.H.S. though. He plans to use the agencyto radically increase the amount of immigration from the Third World intoAmerica, because America doesn't have enough going on right now. We justdon't have enough problems. So we're going to mix it up a little bit. In an interview a few years ago on PBS, Mayorkas called for amnesty --legal amnesty for anyone who arrived in the United States illegally underthe age of 31, regardless of how old they are now. Think about that. Howmany people would that include? Well, probably tens of millions. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS HOST:  So what else would you look for? ALEJANDRO N. MAYORKAS FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATESDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  Perhaps a greater population ofindividuals who would qualify in terms of their age. So one of the limitations on DACA was one had to be under the age of 31 atthe time of application, even though one might have been brought to theUnited States as a two-year-old decades ago. And so really, thedeterminative factor should be how old was one when one came to the UnitedStates, as opposed to how old one is now. WOODRUFF:  But you could see it being -- you'd like to see it expanded? MAYORKAS:  I would. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, I would. Guys like that and Barack Obama is a perfectexample, are the opposite of Donald Trump. No matter what Trump says, hecould be reading the phone book, he could be reading the lyrics to thebirthday song and it always sounds rah, big, loud, jarring. But people like that, the actual radicals, people who are saying thingsthat are completely out of the mainstream -- and you can check the polling.That's not speculation. That view is not a majority view. It's the view ofa tiny group of radicals. But people like that, say those things in thecalmest tone, like it's totally natural, of course, yes. Not a big deal. Itis a big deal. If Mayorkas gets his way, this will be a different country overnight, withvery different politics. And of course, different politics are the entirepoint. So that's a snapshot of domestic policy as it shaping up under the Bidenadministration. How about foreign policy? Well, Joe Biden says he is nominating a man called Anthony Blinken -- TonyBlinken to be Secretary of State, the head of our foreign policy. Blinkenis the co-founder of a so-called strategic consulting group known asWestech Advisors. We know that Westech has represented Silicon Valley firmsand pharma companies. But because technically, it is not a lobbyingoperation, we don't know that much more. Westech is not legally required todisclose where they are getting their money. We do believe Eric Schmidt of Google, at least reportedly was a client ofWestech and that tells you a lot. Blinken himself has written op-eds for"The New York Times." He has been a global affairs analyst at CNN and thattells you a lot. Like everyone else on that channel, Blinken fell hard forthe ludicrous Russia collusion line. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TONY BLINKEN, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Every time the President tearsdown the F.B.I. or Mueller or any of our institutions, he is actually doingMr. Putin's bidding. It's exactly what Putin was trying to do in ourelections that is sow doubt about the credibility and legitimacy of ourinstitutions. The President's ongoing collusion with Russia's plans isreally striking, intentional or not. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So when you criticize the F.B.I., that's not your First Amendmentright as an American. No, you're quote, "Doing Mr. Putin's bidding." It'sall part of quote, "The President's ongoing collusion with Russia." Now, Tony Blinken is the best we produce. There's not a credential that hedoesn't have. He went to Harvard, unlike you. But as with so many people with those credentials, he's not a genius. Andyou can tell that by his position on the invasion of Iraq. Here was Blinkenduring the Obama administration, celebrating our occupation of thatcountry. Like it's been a roaring success. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BLINKEN:  The wisdom of going to war in Iraq is something that is going tobe debated for years, and I'll leave that debate to the historians. Butwhat's beyond debate and what news coverage of Iraq in my judgment, toooften fails to acknowledge is that Iraq today is less violent, moredemocratic, and more prosperous, and the United States more deeply engagedthere than at any time in recent history. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, Iraq is in great shape. Good point, Tony Blinken. You seemlike a pretty smart guy, you should be Secretary of State. And so under JoeBiden, he will be. Not impressive. But what does it all add up to? It starting to look like the opposite. Themirror image of what Donald Trump ran on in 2016. Policies that were sopopular, Trump got elected on them, despite having no background inpolitics whatsoever coming completely from the outside and rattling peoplea little bit and he still got elected, because those policies were popularand they remain popular. But Biden apparently is about to give us the opposite. More giveaways toour chief global rival, the government of China, more pointless wars in theMiddle East that no one outside Washington supports, massive increases inillegal immigration, along with a huge drop in American wages that alwaysis the inevitable result of that. When you flood the low end labor pool, the price of labor goes down. That'scalled supply and demand, geniuses, but they don't care. And then, ofcourse, the attendant chaos and instability at home, which they have stokedfor months now. Fewer Americans able to defend themselves and theirfamilies in the face of that chaos, which they caused. And above all, and this is the defining characteristic so far, morecorporate control over our lives. This is the point. This is the theme.Let's hope we're wrong. But as of tonight, it looks like this is what we'restaring down. If you believe the Federal government is powerful now, in some cases toopowerful, wait until it fully aligns with Big Business. That appears to behappening. The question is, how many people knew they were voting for thatwhen they voted for this guy? Probably not too many. Charlie Hurt is the opinion editor at "The Washington Times." He saw it allcoming. We're happy to have him on tonight. So Charlie, you're watching this Cabinet, come together, these choices byJoe Biden, this is really the first glimpse we're getting of what Bidenreally believes, because no one thought to ask him as he ran for President,what's the picture that you think is emerging? CHARLIE HURT, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  It's truly extraordinary.And, of course, the arrogance of Joe Biden in, you know, finding ourselveswhere we are right now, not only did he not have the decency to even askfor the job, or to campaign or to audition for it or to interview for it. And in fact, at one point, he even told people about when at one point whenhe was asked a question about it, he said, I'm not going to tell you untilor unless I get elected. This is the kind of, you know, say what you want about Donald Trump, DonaldTrump asked for people's vote. And what comes with that is we know theissues. But then the candidate comes with a mandate. And when you have somebody like Joe Biden, he comes with a blank slate, andhe fills it with whatever he wants to fill it with. And what he is fillingit with right now is this globalist statist, you know, everything he isknown for the past 50 years. And what's really frightening about this is, 2016 was a rejection ofexactly that mentality. 2020 was, you know, I don't think 2020 was anembrace of the state. I think, you know, Joe Biden ran as I'm a nice guy,I'm not Donald Trump, don't ask me any questions. That's what he gotelected on. But if you go back to 2008, remember, Barack Obama ran on rejecting theexact same stuff going on inside of Washington, D.C. Remember hope andchange? And so Joe Biden thinks he can put Humpty Dumpty back together inWashington and everything is -- you know, obviously the terrifying thingis, who knows whether Republicans will be able to capitalize on this andmake Joe Biden pay for it, but what voters are getting right now is notwhat they wanted out of this election. CARLSON:  If you look at the backgrounds for almost everyone Biden says heplans to hire, these people are lobbyists. They're consultants. They areshills for this big multinational, that big multinational. And you've gotto wonder, if Republicans on Capitol Hill are paying attention, if they'renot concluding, wait a second, we are not really the party of soulless, bigcorporations. We've got to be the party of everybody else. Do you thinkthat they figured that out? HURT:  I don't know if they have because of course, one of the biggestobstacles in Washington for President Trump was Republicans and that'sbecause they refused to understand that. And the single greatest lesson, the most important lesson, Republicans inWashington can learn from Donald Trump is exactly that. That they are hereto represent the people and not whether its corporate interests, stateinterests. And when you look around today, all these people who are just -- you know,Wall Street is thrilled with what's going on in Washington right now. Myfavorite is the international community, whatever the hell that is. They'rethrilled with what they are seeing out of Washington right now. That's notthe American people. CARLSON:  I can't resist asking you this. It's a little bit off topic, butit was just so striking. You saw General Mattis, who worked in thisadministration, left on bad terms, of course, saying that the first thingBiden needs to do is take America first as an idea out of the military'soperational understanding, like America first is no longer the point ofhaving a military. What do you make of that? HURT:  Well, you know, obviously, you know, President, you know, on theface of it, it's absolutely insanity. And you would think that Democratsand Joe Biden, anybody that would utter such a nonsensical thing would paya heavy price for it. But again, the question comes back, are Republicans in Washington smartenough to weaponize that against Democrats? I don't know if they are. Ipray they are because they're our last hope. CARLSON:  I agree with that. Charlie Hurt. Great to see you tonight. Thankyou. HURT:  Great to see you. CARLSON:  So the coronavirus lockdowns came, small businesses died, JeffBezos made $70 billion. One of the casualties of this has been Rick Savage,a business owner in Maine. He refused to go along with the program. Wetalked to him back in April and he has been under attack -- relentlessattack by the governor of Maine ever since. Rick Savage joins us after the break to tell us what he's gone through forthe crime of speaking out. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, the coronavirus lockdowns have really hurt the country, butyou know, who they have been great for? Companies that don't like thecountry, places like Amazon. Amazon has profited enormously, maybe morethan anyone else from the coronavirus pandemic. Small businesses, family-owned companies, restaurants especially have beendestroyed. Research by the website Yelp found that more than half therestaurants that temporarily shut down because coronavirus, closed for goodby July. One restaurant that refused to close is the Sunday River Brewing Company inNewry, Maine. The owner of that business, Rick Savage came on this show inApril, to announce that he would remain open in defiance of the Governor ofMaine, Janet Mills, one of the worst governors in the country, in defianceof her order. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICK SAVAGE, OWNER OF SUNDAY RIVER BREWING COMPANY IN NEWRY, MAINE:  We'vehad enough of it. We're encouraging all businesses in Maine to open up. Weshould have never been shut down in the first place. We need to open back up. Get the summer tourist business going or we'regoing to lose a third of our restaurants. Who knows how many motels andother businesses? So we're advocating for everybody, not just for myrestaurant, it's time to go back to work. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So that was in April. Rick Savage, openly defied the Governor ofMaine who is both incompetent and vicious. And she said about -- and thisis not a governor's role, by the way, but it happened -- she set out todestroy his life. Not an exaggeration. Finally, Janet Mills got that restaurant -- his restaurant -- shut downthis week. Rick Savage joins us tonight with an update on what he has beenthrough. Rick, thanks so much for coming on. So you knew you were taking a risk in speaking publicly against yourgovernor. It shouldn't be the case in a free country. But you knew that itwas. Tell us what's happened since. SAVAGE:  A hundred percent. Tucker, since I've come on your show, the nextday we opened up, they brought in -- she had the State Troopers in heroffice at nine o'clock in the morning, trying to figure out how they couldshut us down. She had department heads in her office trying to figure outhow they could shut us down. We said we were going to open up at four o'clock on Facebook. We actuallyopened up at 11. They showed up a little bit after four. Two healthinspectors were there -- I mean, one health inspector and two liquorinspectors, they came in, shook our hands. We walked them down to theoffice. We were in a small office, the six of us. The office is like a six by 12. We talked for a few minutes. The healthinspector took our health license which meant now we can't serve boozebecause you need a health license in order to serve alcohol. So we signed the paperwork. We were very good with them. And then theyleft. The next day, we got another one. We're up to like 30 something inspectionssince I was on your show. The state has been coming right after us. We'vebeen in court -- they opened up a court for us. The courts have been shutdown. She had a court open up for us. These are court papers right here that we've been dealing with just sinceMay 1st. We've been cleaned. We've been open. We've done about 80,000 to85,000 people. No cases. Same people in there every day. The same staff,same people sitting at the bar. We've got -- CARLSON:  Let me just interrupt you there and just get to the sciencereally quick. Is there any evidence at all that your restaurant has been asource of coronavirus infection? Is there any reason to be doing this toyou other than personal pique? SAVAGE:  Not at all. CARLSON:  Okay. None. SAVAGE:  Not at all. No, they've been fining me $600 a day for months tostay open. The health inspector that were in my office, they didn't havemasks on. They weren't doing social distancing. Then from the same health inspector, she writes a sworn affidavit for thecourt that she witnessed nobody with masks on and not social distanced, asthey didn't have them on. They came in several times with no protectiongear on themselves. I'm talking three or four times for inspections. We've been inspected so much. We're the most inspected restaurant in theState of Maine. We're the only restaurant in the State of Maine that's beenin court. Okay? We're the only restaurant in the State of Maine thatthey've shut down. We are the only two people, my brother and myself that have a mask mandatefrom a judge that orders me to wear a mask a hundred percent of the time,I'm in my restaurant, even if I'm drinking a cocktail or eating. Okay? I made a deal -- we tried to make a deal yesterday that I would stay out ofmy own restaurant to keep it open for my staff until this is all over. No.They struck it down. They imposed a $5,000.00 day fine on us startingtoday. The Assistant Attorney General was chuckling when he read the court order.She was chuckling. She was like a kid in a candy store, like she just gotwhat she wanted after months of trying to put me out of business. I'm like,are you kidding me? You know, I've got 65 families that work there. We're coming into theHolidays, and we will take care of our staff. We will definitely take careof our staff to make sure they are taken care of for the Holidays. My brother and myself don't even work in that restaurant. We've got sixother companies. We work other places all the time. So they are singling meout because I called Janet Mills out and we are so broke in the state rightnow, it's ridiculous. We had a Commissioner of Alcohol had a meeting two weeks ago, a Zoommeeting. He basically said in a Zoom meeting, he apologized for beingbehind and said he is working on a 39-count indictment against the SundayRiver Brewing Companies which put him behind. So they are not even doingtheir own stuff. CARLSON:  This is an instrument of tyranny. You're being punished forspeaking out. The media in your state, which is utterly corrupt has takenthe side of your Governor who is incompetent. I've almost never seenanything like this before. You're a brave man, Rick Savage. I hope you'll come back and tell us howthe story ends. SAVAGE:  I appreciate it, Tucker. We do have a GoFundMe. It's Maine Back toWork Fund. We raised $100,000.00. We gave a lot of that back to smallbusinesses in the State of Maine. I wrote the checks out myself personally,and we use the rest for lawyers, but we need to raise some money for somehigh class lawyers to help my lawyer and get through this because honestly,it's about the freedom of people in the State of Maine right now. We're in a really bad spot right now with the businesses in the State ofMaine. CARLSON:  Yes, I noticed. SAVAGE:  It's not going to be good in another month or two. We're going tolose a lot more businesses. CARLSON:  It's already a poor state. Rick Savage, thanks so much. SAVAGE:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  Well, just a couple hundred miles away from the Sunday RiverBrewing Company, New York's Emmy Award winning Governor Andrew Cuomo isurging his subjects not to celebrate Thanksgiving this year. So it came as something as a surprise when he announced that he wascelebrating Thanksgiving with his own family. Listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  The story is my mom is going to come up, and twoof my girls is the current plan. But the plans change. But that's my plan. (END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON:  Oh, so you're not allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving with yourfamily, but Governor Cuomo is because he is the Governor and you're not.Shut up, serf. Well, people didn't respond well to that. So now, he has changed his plan.He has announced he will be working on Thursday. He almost got away withit. Good luck to other New Yorkers who try to behave as Governor Cuomobehave. He has threatened use law enforcement to enforce this cancellationof Thanksgiving and he has attacked any Sheriff who won't comply with thisorder. Well, Sheriff Richard Giardino of Fulton County, New York is one of those.He is refusing to enforce this unjust order and he joins us tonight.Sheriff, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us your position on this order,if you would. SHERIFF RICHARD GIARDINO, FULTON COUNTY, NEW YORK:  Well, my position isfounded in my background as a County Court Judge for 20 years, as aDistrict Attorney and now, a Sheriff and basically the Constitution, andthe Constitution says that a Sheriff for law enforcement basically has anobligation to the oath I took, which in this case is an executive orderaimed at how many people you have in your own house at Thanksgiving on itsface is unconstitutional. And so I had a man bump into me and tell me that he was scared to go to hisson's house and have Thanksgiving because there would be 14 of them. And Isaid, what are you scared about it? Well, we don't want to get a ticket, wedon't want to get a fine. So I responded in a Facebook post a week and a half ago, and it just tookoff. And I said, I'm not going to enforce an unconstitutional executiveorder. Now, some executive orders are constitutional and enforceable againstbusinesses, bowling alleys, restaurants, because there's an executivebranch that can do that. Well, you should be free of government intrusioninto your own home on Thanksgiving. CARLSON:  So you are defending the Bill of Rights, and for taking that rarestand, and God bless you for doing that, the Governor has attacked you, ineffect. GIARDINO:  Thank you. Well, he has made remarks about myself and otherSheriffs being arrogant, acting as dictators, picking and choosing the lawswe choose to enforce. This is not a law, it's an executive order. CARLSON:  Right. GIARDINO:  Well, some executive orders have the force of the law, becausehe's got a State Liquor Authority and he has got a Health Department. TheState Liquor Authority is similar to the gentleman you had from Maine,Savage, the State Liquor Authority has control over you because you have abar license or a license for liquor in a restaurant, and he can set fines,suspensions and revocations. One thing, though, that so many people have come to me about and said is,they want to be included. They will protect their families and their lovedones, but when it's dictated that you have to, you know, you have to let uscome in your house, you have to limit then that right away puts people upon their backs. And, and they don't want to cooperate, not because we'regood, because everybody wants to reduce the COVID certainly. And you know what's funny, my mom is in a nursing home for eight months,and I haven't been able to hug her or to kiss her, or to caress her, andwhen I have visited her now, she only recognized me one in four times. Andthe nurses and doctors I've spoken to tell me that that's the most -- theworst part of it is people can't be with their family members, especiallywhen your family members are dying. CARLSON:  It's the worst. Sure. Sheriff, thank you for articulating that soclearly. I appreciate it. GIARDINO:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  So in January, there are going to be and there's a lot going onright now, but it is worth thinking about the two Senate races, runoffs,both in the State of Georgia, they will determine the fate of the UnitedStates Senate. If Democrats win, they will control the entire government.What would that mean exactly? Again, it's worth knowing, and we'll tell youafter the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, for the first time in a decade, Democrats are set tocontrol the House of Representatives and the Executive Branch. Now inJanuary, the State of Georgia will vote in two separate runoffs for Senateseats and the results will determine which party controls the Senate. The stakes are huge. You're hearing some Republicans say well, maybe weshould let the Republicans lose because they're mad at the party inWashington. By the way, they have every reason to be mad at the party inWashington, they should be punished. The problem is, the rest of us should not be punished. And if Democratstake full control of the U.S. government, all of us will be punished. Sobefore you decide to sit this one out, you should think about what thismight mean, you know what it's going to mean? Senate Majority Leader ChuckSchumer. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Now, We take Georgia, and we change the world. QUESTION:  I'm sorry, can you repeat that, Mr. Schumer? SCHUMER:  Now, we take Georgia, then we change America. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Then we change America. They are not kidding, and you should knowthat. If Democrats take full control, the first priority will be to passsomething called the Heroes Act. Now, you're told that's a coronaviruseconomic relief package, and there's some of that in there. But there's alot more than that. The current House version contains a bunch of policies that will and thisthe point of them, create a permanent Democratic majority. The bill wouldlegalize ballot harvesting, for example, that would allow Democratic Partyorganizers to collect absentee ballots and send them in. Sounds like a goodidea, right? Future elections would be like the most recent one, but even worse and morecorrupt. That's a fact by the way. The bill would also allow illegal aliensto receive the $1,200.00 stimulus check that American citizens receivedearlier this year. People who have no right to be in this country would be receiving taxdollars. Really? Why? They don't explain, but that would happen. The bill would release Federal inmates with health conditions and felonsover the age of 50. Now, some of them probably won't cause any harm whenthey get out, but health conditions is so broadly defined. A lot of healthycriminals are going to be on the street like we need more of that. The bill includes a $500 million grant that would pay states to releaseprisoners. What? It calls for more visas for foreign physicians, even asAmerican doctors continue to face unemployment. What's the purpose of that? This legislation calls on Washington bureaucrats to find ways to expandfinancial services based on race specifically in the marijuana business.Really? That's the answer? Even if you're for legalized weed, what's thisabout? It's about corporate profits, of course. The word "cannabis" appears 68 times in the bill. The word "diversity"appears 20 times. You get the point. If Democrats take the, Senate things are going to change really, reallyfast in ways most people aren't going to like at all. Legislation, by theway, would no longer take 60 votes to get through the Congress because ifDemocrats control the Senate, they will eliminate the filibuster. And thatmeans they can do whatever they want. They've already promised they're going to do that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  When the Democrats have the White Houseagain, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama, thenwe should get rid of the filibuster. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If all this takeseliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure theGod given rights of every American, then that's what we should do. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Oh, so checks and balances are racist, says Obama, the mostdishonest, divisive President we've ever had, by far. With no filibuster, the Democratic Senate could do whatever it wanted andyou should know what they want to do. They could pass the gun confiscationprogram that Joe Biden's advisers have talked so much about. You might think the courts would never allow that, but Democrats would havethe power to transform the courts by packing them. Say goodbye to anindependent Judiciary. With democratic control of all three branches of government, no more checksand balances to Joe Biden's power. Biden promises to pass something calledthe Equality Act. That sounds like a good idea. Who is against equality? But the bill achieves the opposite of equality. It would force publicschool to allow biological males to participate in girl sports. Really?What's that going to do to your daughters? Now, what else is there? Well,there's a lot else. Senators Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, for example, unveiled somethingcalled the Justice for Black Farmers Act last week. Who is against Justicefor Black Farmers? Nobody. But read the bill. If enacted as a law, it would create an agency devoted to quote, "equitableland access." What would they do? Well, the agency would spend up to $8billion buying private land and doling it out on the basis of race. The Robert Mugabe plan. Oh, that sounds like a good idea. A Democratic Congress can wipe away any Federal law that protects faithfulChristians, for example or faithful Jews; could end right to work states.It would bankrupt the gun industry, an American industry, one of the fewleft, allowing people to sue gun manufacturers for crimes committed bycriminals. That doesn't make sense. The trial bar loves it, they'd getrich. Democrats could make it impossible to legally carry firearms across statelines. They repealed the Hyde Amendment that prevents your tax dollars frombeing used to pay for abortions. With a Democratic Senate, Biden could pickCabinet appointees without needing to negotiate with a bipartisan Congress. What would happen then? Well, Stacey Abrams, your new Attorney General.Good luck. Susan Rice, Secretary of Defense; Andrew Cuomo running H.H.S.We're not kidding, this could happen. It's not secret, by the way, they've talked about it openly. If Democratswin the Senate seats in Georgia, there is no limit to what they can do. Youmay be angry at the Republican Party. Again, you have every right to be,but do you want to live in that country? You should think about that. Well, a new study by scientists in Norway completely upends the officialnarrative on climate change. You're going to want to know more about thisgiven where we're headed. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  You're always hearing people bark about climate science. Okay.Here is some climate science. A new study by Norwegian researchers shows that even if human beings wereto cut greenhouse gases and emissions to zero, global temperatures wouldcontinue to rise for at least 400 more years. Well, that's not what theyare telling us. Michael Shellenberger is the author of "Apocalypse Never" and he joins usnow to explain the study and what it means. Mr. Shellenberger, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us what this studyfinds and its implications if you would. MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, AUTHOR, "APOCALYPSE NEVER":  Yes, I mean, what thestudy finds is that even if we stopped all emissions today, we would stillsee climate change. We would still see global warming over the next 400years, through a combination of factors: the release of methane frompermafrost, other factors and, you know, stuff that we've sort of known. But I think for -- I think you're right to point out that there's a verysimplistic idea that if the United States takes action, that somehow we aregoing to stop climate change, and that's just not the case. CARLSON:  Right. If you take the bus while Barack Obama and John Kerry flyprivate, we can stop the rise of the oceans, but that doesn't seem evenclose to true. SHELLENBERGER:  Yes, and I think the big thing that gets missing in all ofthis, Tucker, is just the fact that we've been doing really well adaptingto the climate. I mean, deaths from natural disasters have declined 90percent. In this recent scare around the fires in California, we saw that a well-managed forest survived these fires very well. They didn't have the highintensity fires. Sea level rise is something that we've been adapting tovery well. In fact, in some places we see it makes us more resilient. So what I object to with all of this is the sense in which we are all sortof these helpless people unable to adapt to our conditions even that studythat you're citing mentions that we've passed the point of no return. Thatsounds really apocalyptic. But actually, that's how it always is. I mean, you know, and who would want to return to some past years? I thinkmost of us are happy to get through 2020 or happy that we're past the pointof no return. So it's just the kind of thing that I think is aimed atgrabbing headlines. It misses the big picture of just how well we're doingin terms of adapting to our environments. CARLSON:  This is bad news for the people who increase their own power andcontrol over the rest of us with climate solutions, isn't it? SHELLENBERGER:  Yes, I mean, I think if you look at the Biden climate plan,it's still the Green New Deal repackaged as a $2 trillion deal. It's mostlygoing to go to things like energy efficiency, which Obama's own economistfound cost more than it delivered in terms of benefits, and also just thebuying a lot of solar panels, almost all of which are made in China,unboxing solar panels and spreading them over landscapes is not good, highpaying jobs in the United States. If these guys really cared about climate change, they will be pushing for aGreen Nuclear Deal, but instead we're at risk of losing our nuclear plantsbecause of the policies proposed by climate alarmists and Democrats. CARLSON:  Which in a lot of cases just spoil the natural environment theyclaim to want to protect with wind turbines. It's really -- MichaelShellenberger, great to see you tonight. Thank you. SHELLENBERGER:  Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON:  Silicon Valley got Joe Biden elected. That's a problem. Democracycan't continue under these circumstances. A tech entrepreneur says he has aplan to fix it. He joins us next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  The most powerful companies in history, the tech monopolies ofSilicon Valley did everything they possibly could to get Joe Biden elected-- and it worked. But they didn't stop with his election. In the days following the election, Facebook implemented a new, moreaggressive policy that elevates left-wing media outlets over everyone else.So CNN, NPR, "The New York Times" will get more visibility on the site,while conservative sites will get less. What is this exactly? And how longwill it last? Peter Rex built a multibillion dollar tech company by the age of 40. Hesays he knows how to deal with the tech industry, which is clearly out ofcontrol. We're happy to have him on tonight. Peter, thanks so much for coming on. So it does seem like these companiesflex their muscles and they did in the months before the election, but theyare continuing to do that and it's clearly a threat to our democracy. Howdo we respond? PETER REX, TECH ENTREPRENEUR:  Absolutely, Tucker, and I want to explainthe reason why I decided to come out. Big Tech took a cheap shot on theAmerican people, particularly the working class. And although I went to Harvard Law, and I am a CEO in tech, and I spentfour years in Silicon Valley and Seattle, I am not a member of the working-- I am a member of the working class, I believe in them, and they are mypeople. And the working class has suffered tremendously from what they've done hereand there is a feeling of despair and darkness. But my message to them is amessage of light and hope. Because Big Tech has awoken a sleeping giant.That sleeping giant is much bigger than Big Tech. It is the American peopleand they are now ready to fight. CARLSON:  What should that battle look like, do you think? How do you kindof fight back against it? REX:  I think the solution requires strategy, and we need to do threethings. First, we need to invest in technology entrepreneurs who aregrounded in Judeo Christian thinking. Second, we need to create new techpower centers outside of Silicon Valley and Seattle where faith, family andfreedom flourish. Third, we need to launch a new tech movement committed toserving people and we need to rally those tech professionals out there andthere are many of them who believe the same. CARLSON:  Wow. So, you just set up, I hope a number of future segments onthe show where you can put some meat on those bones. But in 30 seconds,tell us, do you see this forming now? REX:  Absolutely, Tucker. I think that -- I believe there's great hope inthe future, and I want the audience and you to know that because we aregoing to take leadership from Big Tech. They have proven that they are notable to serve people. They don't believe in people, and we do. They canonly speak to computers, we can speak to the soul. CARLSON:  Do you plan to work yourself toward this solution in the comingmonths and years? REX:  Absolutely. I've already relocated my company to Texas in Austin. Andwe are growing like crazy. We are having a lot of influx of peopleinterested since we've taken a stand on the issue. And we're going to keepcoming and we're going to be victorious, ultimately. CARLSON:  Peter Rex, we will see you again. Thanks so much for that. REX:  Thank you, Tucker. Keep me in your prayers. CARLSON:  Amen. That's it for us tonight. We'll be coming back onThanksgiving Day with a special show. We're going to have someone sittingin this chair tomorrow and Friday. We'll be back Monday you'll like it. Jason Chaffetz sitting in for Sean Hannity. Have the best Thanksgiving. We'll see you soon. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
