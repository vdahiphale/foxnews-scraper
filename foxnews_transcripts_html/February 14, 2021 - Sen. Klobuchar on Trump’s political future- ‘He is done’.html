CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.The school reopening debate heats up as the CDC issues new guidelines andthe White House faces criticism it's setting the bar too low.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  His goal that he set is to havethe majority of schools open by day 100 of his presidency and that meanssome teaching in classrooms, so at least one day a week.WALLACE (voice-over):  Backpedaling from the Biden administration andpushback from frustrated parents, students, and lawmakers who say one day aweek is not enough, while some teachers unions oppose any return to theclassroom.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The school district is hell-bent on forcing thousandsof educators into unsafe buildings.WALLACE:  We'll ask CDC Director Rochelle Walensky if the agency's newguidelines will speed up school reopenings.SEN. PAT LEAHY (D-VT):  The yeas are 57. The nays are 43.WALLACE:  Then, the Senate votes to acquit former President Trump ofinciting last month's deadly riot at the Capitol.We're joined by Lindsey Graham, one of Mr. Trump's staunchest supporters inthe Senate, and get reaction from Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about the fallout from the trial and whereit leaves Donald Trump as a political force.And our "Power Player of the Week," best-selling author James Patterson onwhy his latest book on real life soldiers may be his most important yet.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(MUSIC)(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.The big story in the nation's capital this week was the second impeachmenttrial and second acquittal of former President Trump, and we'll get to thatin the next segment.But when it comes to affecting people's daily lives, the real news was theCDC issuing updated guidelines for getting the nation's students back toschool quickly and safely.That includes mask-wearing, distancing, handwashing, and cleaning, but notnecessarily vaccinations for teachers, as well as a color-coded guide tohelp school districts decide under what conditions they can offer in-personinstruction.The phased approach based on community spread corresponds to either fullin-person, hybrid, reduced attendance, or virtual-only instruction.And joining us now, the Center -- director of the Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky.Doctor, as I understand these new CDC guidelines, if you have propermitigation in place, even in communities with high transmission, somestudents can go back to school at least some of the time for in-personinstruction, is that correct?DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC DIRECTOR:  Good morning. Good to be back withyou.In fact, that is correct. So even in the areas of the highest communityspread, we are advocating with the strict mitigation measures that youdescribed, including universal and mandatory masking, as well as six-footof distancing that at least our K-5 children should be able to get back toschool, at least in a hybrid mode.WALLACE:  So given that, Doctor, is there any scientific reason why forinstance the 52,000 public school students in San Francisco have been shutout of school for 11 months now, since last March?WALENSKY:  It's a great question. What we have tried to do with this newguidance is to take the extensive literature that has occurred fromSeptember through now, where we had experiences from other schools, fromother countries to see what the science says and how we can do so safely.It's not just that we need to include these mitigation measures, butthey're hard to do.So some of them suggest, for example, diagnostic testing and contacttracing within 48 hours of a contact to ensure that people can be properlyisolated and quarantined. So, really, it's a layered mitigation approachand what we put forward in this guidance is the road map to get us there.WALLACE:  But to just press on this issue, given your CDC guidelines, ifyou have proper mitigation in place, is there any reason why a publicschool district needs to shut down for the better part of a year?WALENSKY:  So, in -- we need to make sure the K-5 schools and the densityis down and part of the reason I haven't been able to open is because wehadn't previously had the science in order to inform how to open safely. Wedidn't have the data, and prior, we didn't have any guidance as to how todo it safely.So, we are really anticipating that with this guidance emerging, thatschools will be able to start opening.WALLACE:  President -- you talk about science, President Biden since thecampaign has talked about we're going to follow the science. But 11 daysago, you were speaking a formal briefing and you said that teachers do nothave to be vaccinated for schools to reopen and after you said that, theWhite House said not so fast.Take a look, Doctor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALENSKY:  A safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to bevaccinated in order to reopen safely.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Dr. Walensky spoke to this in herpersonal capacity. Obviously, she's the head of the CDC, but we're going towait for the final guidance to come out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  When you're speaking in public, since you took this role and youwere speaking there as the CDC director, are you ever speaking in yourpersonal capacity, and is it clear now that when teachers unions insist andcontinue to insist that all teachers, all staff must be vaccinated beforeany schools can reopen, that that's not based on science?WALENSKY:  You know, here's what I will say: My goal is to make sure theguidance got out. The guidance has gotten out and it was released on Fridayand the guidance does specifically say that there are many mitigationstrategies that are layered mitigation strategies that are necessary toreopen. There were also additional mitigation strategies such as teachervaccination. That's what our school guidance says.Our other guidance on who should be vaccinated, our Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices suggests that teachers should be prioritized in the1B group. That is the group with greater than 75-year-olds.So I am a big advocate of ensuring that the ACIP guidance is followed, thatteachers are prioritized. But from a scientific standpoint, we know thatit's possible to reopen schools safely without all of the teachers beingvaccinated.WALLACE:  During the campaign, the president set a goal for what he wantedto accomplish in the first hundred days in terms of reopening schools. Butthe White House backpedaled on that this past week. Take a look at this,Doctor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My team will work to see that amajority of our schools can be opened by the end of my first 100 days.PSAKI:  Well, teaching at least one day a week in the majority of schoolsby day 100.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But according to a national study, 64.8 percent of students K-12are already attending schools that are open at least one day a week. So,Doctor, aren't we already meeting the goal that President Biden has set forthe nation to meet by next April? Aren't we already meeting that goal?WALENSKY:  Well, the first thing I'll say is that we know that the lesscommunity spread of this disease is out there, the more children will beable to get back to school. So we know that as our numbers come down, if wecontinue, each of us as individuals continue to follow these mitigationstrategies to get the spread of disease down in the communities, we willhave more and more children back to school. The guidance that we releasedon Friday is the road map to get there, to follow how much diseases in thecommunity and how much our kids can safely be back in school.And so, if everybody is doing their part to decrease disease in thecommunity, we will have more children back.WALLACE:  So, you've talked repeatedly here about mitigation, and yourguidelines depend on schools spending money to make the environment insidethe classroom, inside the building more safe.But I want to put this up on the screen. As part of his COVID relief plan,the president wants $130 billion for those improvements to schools. Buthaving said that, Congress has already approved $68 billion, and so far,school districts have only spent $4 billion of that $68 billion.Isn't the $64 billion that's still in the pipeline, enough money maybe notto solve all the problems but to get a lot more kids back to school?WALENSKY:  You know, these schools need -- need space, they need to de-densify their classrooms, they need staffing, they need nurses. They --another layer of mitigation would be school screening to keep folks safeeven after vaccination.So I think we need a lot more resources in order to get the schools safe.One of things that's really been emphasized in the school reopening is howunsafe some of our school ventilation systems are. That's a problem notjust for SARS-CoV-2 about for other respiratory viruses, for children withasthma, for exposure to mold.So I think that there's a lot of work that we need to do in order to getour children -- our schools a safer environment.WALLACE:  Doctor, in the time we have left, let's do a lightning round --quick questions, quick answers, about some of the issues that areconcerning people.Where are we right now on these variants? And are there any variants thatare out there now that can already beat the vaccine?WALENSKY:  We have over a thousand cases of the B117 variant in -- acrossthe country, 39 states. Other variants, the P1 --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Is that -- excuse me, is that the U.K. -- is that the U.K.variant?WALENSKY:  Yes, the B117 is the U.K. variant. The P1 variant, we have acouple of cases, three cases so far that we know about. That's the Brazilvariant. As well as the B1351 variant, we have at least 15 cases in atleast five states.So, we have -- we are increasing our detection of these variants. Some ofthese variants, we are studying in the lab -- well, these variants we arestudying in the lab to understand how they will work, how the vaccine willwork against them and more information to follow essentially.WALLACE:  But at this point, the vaccine can still handle all of thesevariants?WALENSKY:  As far as we know, the B117 in the lab has -- is susceptible tothe vaccine as well as the B1351, has decreased susceptibility in the labbut there is enough of a cushion in terms of efficacy such that we believethe vaccines will work against that variant as well.WALLACE:  Dr. Fauci says that by April, that it should be open season, hiswords, for everyone wants a vaccine to get a vaccine. But then later thisweek, this past week, President Biden said it could be past the summerbefore everyone actually gets the vaccination. I understand there's adifference between availability and the logistics and all of that.But let me ask you, when will everyone who wants a vaccine be able to getit, and when do you think that we are going to be back to somethingapproaching normal?WALENSKY:  So we anticipate by the end of March, we'll have 200 millionvaccines available. I'm proud to say that as of yesterday, we have put 50million vaccines into people's arms. We anticipate by the end of thesummer, we will have enough vaccine in order to vaccinate the entire U.S.population that is eligible.What I worry about is the vaccine hesitancy. So once we have enoughvaccine, at some point, we are going to have more vaccine than peoplewanted and we very much need to make sure that everybody rolls up theirsleeves when it's their turn and when they are eligible. And much of thehard work that we're doing now is to ensure that we can inform all of thosewho might be hesitant now as to the reasons why it's safe and why it'seffective.WALLACE:  Do you think that by the end of this year, you and I will be ableto walk down the street without a mask?WALENSKY:  I think that very much depends on how we behave right now. Ithink we need to do -- all of us need to do our part. If we have anothersearch because we are not taking the proper mitigation strategies, I thinkit would be foolish for me to project.WALLACE:  Dr. Walensky, thank you. Thanks for your time this week. Andwe'll stay on top of those schools opening back up, thanks.WALENSKY:  Thank you very much.WALLACE:  Up next, Senator Lindsey Graham, one of former President Trump'sclosest allies on his second impeachment trial and his second acquittal.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  The Senate voted yesterday 57-43 to acquit former President Trumpin his second impeachment trial. Seven Republicans broke party ranks tojoin with all 50 Democrats, making it the most bipartisan vote ever toconvict a president. But it was still well short of the 67 votes needed tofind him guilty.In a moment, we'll speak with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who was inthe center of the action.But, first, let's bring in David Spunt on Capitol Hill on the trial'ssurprising final day -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Chris.As expected, Democrats voted unanimously to convict, but they needed 17Republicans to join.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We have no power toconvict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen.SPUNT (voice-over):  While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted toacquit the former president, seven Republicans voted to convict. NorthCarolina Senator Richard Burr, who is retiring next year, surprisedcolleagues with his vote to convict on the lone article, incitement ofinsurrection.Donald Trump's fate almost hung in the balance another few weeks after afloor fight erupted live witnesses.REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  We would seek the opportunity to take theirdepositions via Zoom also for less than an hour.MICHAEL VAN DER VEEN, TRUMP DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  None of these depositionsshould be done by Zoom. These positions should be done in person, in myoffice, in Philadelphia. That's where they should be done.SPUNT:  But in the end, both sides agreed no witnesses. Next, closingarguments.RASKIN:  He abused his office by siding with the insurrectionists at almostevery point rather than with the Congress of the United States.SPUNT:  The former president's attorneys defended their client withoutwavering.VAN DER VEEN:  This has been perhaps the most unfair and flagrantlyunconstitutional proceeding in the history of the United States Senate.(END VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  Chris, former President Donald Trump out with astatement from Florida last night, I want to read part of it to you. Hesays: I have always and always will be a champion for the unwavering ruleof law, the heroes of law enforcement, and the right of Americans topeacefully at honorably debate the issues of the day without malice andwithout hate.Meanwhile, the current president, President Biden, out with a statementcondemning violence saying the United States needs to move forward,underlining the word "united" in United States -- Chris.WALLACE:  David Spunt reporting from Capitol Hill -- David, thank you.And joining us now, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.Senator, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday".SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC):  Thank you very much.WALLACE:  Senator, let me ask you, have you spoken to President Trump sincethe acquittal yesterday, and if so, what was his reaction?GRAHAM:  Yes, I spoke to him last night. He was grateful to his lawyers, heappreciated the help that all of us provided. You know, he's ready to moveon and rebuild the Republican Party. He's excited about 2022 and I'm goingto go down to talk with him next week, play a little golf in Florida.And I said Mr. President, this MAGA movement needs to continue. We need tounite the party. Trump plus is the way back in 2022. He's mad at some folksbut I understand that.My goal is to win in 2022 to stop the most radical agenda I've seen comingout of the Democratic presidency of Joe Biden. We can't do that withoutDonald Trump, so he's ready to hit the trail and I'm ready to work withhim.WALLACE:  Let me ask you about one person that he might be mad at and tellme if he is or he isn't, Mitch McConnell, who made a curious speechyesterday in which he basically said the president is guilty, but that theSenate doesn't have the power to convict, to act against a formerpresident.What did he think of McConnell's speech? What did you think of McConnell'sspeech?GRAHAM:  Well, number one, I was a bit surprised but I heard this in 1998,I've been in three of the four impeachments. I'm sorry about that, but thebottom line in 1998, you had a lot of Democrats acquit Clinton but got onthe floor and said how bad he was, so you know, Nancy Pelosi called us allcowards. I don't think most Republicans care what she thinks. And I thinkSenator McConnell's speech, he got a load off a chest obviously butunfortunately he put a load on the back of Republicans.That speech you will see in 2022 campaigns. I would imagine if you're aRepublican running in Arizona or Georgia or New Hampshire, where we have achance to take back the Senate, they may be playing Senator McConnell'sspeech and asking about it as a candidate and I imagine if you're anincumbent Republican, they're going to be people asking you will yousupport Senator McConnell in the future.So I like him, Senator McConnell, he worked well with President Trump. Ithink his speech is an outlier regarding how Republicans feel about allthis. I felt the impeachment trial was not only unconstitutional -- Icondemn what happens on January 6th, but the process they used it toimpeach this president was an affront to rule of law.He is the first president to ever be impeached without a lawyer, without awitness, without an ability to confront those against him and the trialrecord was a complete joke, hearsay upon hearsay and we've opened Pandora'sbox to future presidents and if you use this model, I don't know how KamalaHarris doesn't get impeached if the Republicans take over the House,because she actually bailed out rioters and one of the rioters went back tothe streets and broke somebody's head open.So we've opened Pandora's box here and I'm sad for the country.WALLACE:  Does Donald Trump bear any responsibility for the attack on theCapitol on January 6th?GRAHAM:  No, in terms of the law, no. He bears responsibility of pushingnarratives about the election that I think are not sound and not true, butthis was politically protected speech. The speech on January the 6th wasnot an incitement to violence. Every politician has used the word fight,fight hard, so I don't think that he caused the riot.His behavior after the election was over the top. There was a preplannedelement to this attack, Mr. Wallace, that we need to look at. Did NancyPelosi know on January the 5th that there was a threat to the Capitol? Whatdid President Trump do after the attack? We need a 9/11 commission to findout what happened and make sure it never happens again and I want to makesure that the Capitol footprint can be better defended next time.So I want to look at what Pelosi knew, when she knew it, what PresidentTrump did after the attack, and on the Senate side was Senate leadershipinformed of a threat, so there was a preplanned element to this attack,totally unconnected with the speech. And I thought the --WALLACE:  Well, let me --GRAHAM:  -- managers failed miserably in making the case.WALLACE:  Let's pick up on something that you specifically talked about.Let's look at the timeline of what happened that day, especially after theriot began.At 2:24, the president tweets "Mike Pence didn't have the courage to dowhat should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution."Two minute later at 2:26, the president speaks to Senator Tommy Tubervillewho tells him Vice President Pence has been evacuated from the Senate.Around that time, the House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy calls thepresident, pleading with him to do whatever he can to call off the rioterswhen the president says he thinks it was actually Antifa that was involved,McCarthy told Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler that he had topersuade the president it was his own folks who did it.Take a look at this exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER (R-WA):  These are your people. They have MAGAhats on and the president's response to him was, "Well, Kevin, I guessthey're just more concerned about this election then you are."(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  What does that tell you, Senator, about how the president viewedthe riot while it was happening?GRAHAM:  It doesn't tell me a whole lot, because it's all hearsay. Whydon't we have a 9/11 investigation? I think it's at 2:28, he told people tobe peaceful. He tweeted out several times at 4:00 and did a video basicallyto be peaceful and leave.Could the president have done more? Yes. Did he incite this riot by hisspeech? Absolutely not. If Donald Trump's speech is going to be seen asincitement by a politician to call violence about every Democrat andRepublican up here is in trouble but I'd like to know that. I'd like toknow did the Capitol Hill police inform the House sergeant at arms and theSenate sergeant at arms the day before the attack that they needed moretroops? So I want to look at all of it.WALLACE:  Senator, I want to just pick up on that because -- and thequestion of the president's personal responsibility, whether it was legalor not, whether his personal responsibility. Here's what you said onJanuary 7th, the day after the riot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAHAM:  It breaks my heart that my friend, a president of a consequence,would allow yesterday to happen. And it will be a major part of hispresidency.When it comes to accountability, the president needs to understand that hisactions were the problem, not the solution.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  His actions were the problem, allowed the riot to happen. It suresounds like you're saying that he violated his oath of office.GRAHAM:  No, I think what he did is he encouraged supporters throughout thecountry to fight like hell to take back an election that he thought wasstolen, a lot of politicians have said that. On January the 7th he wasn'timpeached. The guy was impeached within 48 hours, he didn't have a lawyer,no evidence gathered. The speech of January the 6th is politicallyprotected speech in my view, did not cause the riot. It doesn't representthe 74 million people who supported him. This will be part of hishistorical record of the Trump presidency.But Democrats, because they hate his guts, wanted to impeach him beforethey ever met him, have now started a process that you can impeach somebodyin the House within 48 hours without a lawyer, without a witness, withoutthe ability to cross-examine those against you and have a trial recordbased upon articles from the media. This thing is turning into a nightmarefor the presidency.I rejected the article of impeachment. I didn't think President Trump wasguilty, and you have now opened up Pandora's box.As to Senator McConnell, he is a friend but he's going to be center stagenow in the 2022 effort to take back the Senate. I've been asked by a lot ofpeople, Chris, calm President Trump down, talk to him, get him to calmdown. Sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't. But to my Republicancolleagues, this is a two-way street.Ninety percent of the Republican Party thought this impeachment was apartisan exercise. That's what I thought. He is out of office and so to theRepublican Party, if you want to win and stop a socialist agenda, we needto work with President Trump. We can't do it without him and to you,President Trump, you need to build the Republican Party stronger.I'm into winning and if you want to get something off your chest, fine, butI'm into winning.WALLACE:  Senator, I've got one final question, Nikki Haley, the formergovernor of your state of South Carolina, made some pretty tough commentsabout Donald Trump this week. I want to put them up on the screen.She said "He went down a path he shouldn't have, and we shouldn't havefollowed him, and we shouldn't have listened to him. And we can't let thatever happen again."Senator, is Governor Haley wrong about Donald Trump's future in theRepublican Party?GRAHAM:  Yes, Donald Trump is the most virulent (ph) member of theRepublican Party. The Trump movement is alive and well. People believe hebrought change to Washington. Policy wise it was long overdue.All I can say is that the most potent force in the Republican Party isPresident Trump. We need Trump plus and at the end of the day, I've beeninvolved in politics for over 25 years, the president is a handful and whathappened on January 6th was terrible for the country, but he's notsingularly to blame.Democrats have sat on the sidelines and watched the country be burned downfor a year and a half and hadn't said a damn word and most Republicans aretired of the hypocrisy.So no, Nikki is wrong about President Trump. North Carolina, the biggestwinner I think of this whole impeachment trial is Lara Trump. My dearfriend Richard Burr who I like and have been friends to a long time justmade Lara Trump almost the certain nominee for the Senate seat in NorthCarolina to replace him if she runs. And I certainly will be behind herbecause I think she represents the future of the Republican Party.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Senator Graham, thank you. Thanks forcoming in today. Please come back, sir.GRAHAM: Thank you. I will. Thank you.WALLACE: Up -- up next, what did Democrats get out of the second Trumpimpeachment trial? We'll ask Senator Amy Klobuchar when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Democrats pull back on calling more witnesses in theTrump impeachment trial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): We've offered you overwhelming and irrefutableand certainly unrefuted evidence that former President Trump incited thisinsurrection.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of her party didenough, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Now that impeachment is over, Democrats hope to make a hard pivotto President Biden's agenda. But what did they accomplish in trying DonaldTrump once again?Here to discuss that, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.And, Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Chris. t's great to be back on  hear your voice as ahost of the show instead of having your interviews used as an exhibit in animpeachment trial. So it's good to be on. Thank you.WALLACE: Well, thank -- thank you for noticing.But any case, what was -- what's the fallout from the trial? You heard mydiscussion just now with Senator Graham.What did Democrats accomplish impeaching and trying Donald Trump for thesecond time and then seeing him be acquitted for the second time?KLOBUCHAR: Well, you know, Chris, it's really not what we accomplished.This wasn't a matter of convenience right now as our number one goal is toget this pandemic under control. It's what our republic accomplished. Whatwas the right thing to do for our nation? And as Liz Cheney, the numberthree in leadership on the Republican side in the House said on your showjust last week, we've got to make sure that this doesn't happen again.And what this was about to me, Chris, is about not hiding history. Thiswill now be seared in the memory of Americans for generations to come. Andwhat the House managers did was put the case together as you just discussedwith Senator Graham, put a timeline forward and showed exactly what DonaldTrump did. And it resulted -- I was disappointed in the result, but itresulted in the most bipartisan vote we've ever seen in an impeachment of apresident of the United States. Seven courageous Republicans, includingfrom very red states like Louisiana and Alaska voted to convict thispresident because they agreed with Liz Cheney, this cannot happen again.And they joined, of course, every single Democrat who stood up with thosepolice officers, who put themselves between a mad mob and our safety. Andwell -- as you listen to the shrieks of that police officer wedged in thedoor, I thought to myself, he stood up for our liberty when the presidentof the United States wouldn't even send out a tweet to save the Capitol.WALLACE: But, Senator, if this was so serious and so terrible, why didDemocrats back off on calling witnesses? You could have called HouseRepublican Leader McCarthy to ask him about his conversation with thepresident. You could have called Senator Tuberville to ask about hisconversation. You could have called White House aides to -- to ask themabout what the president was saying and doing while the riot was going on.But, instead, you didn't.Why -- how come?KLOBUCHAR: Look, first let's make clear, I voted for allowing witnesses.But I think, in the end, when you look at what people said after the trial,it wasn't more witnesses that were going to change their mind.Mitch McConnell, who didn't vote to convict, said himself there is noquestion, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsiblefor provoking the events of the day.Chris, he said -- he basically said right there that they've proven theircase. They proved their case on the facts.What happened here was a number of Republicans used as what I would call anexcuse, not as a reason, a faux constitutional arguments that somehow youcouldn't convict a president after he was out of office. We know that's nottrue from precedent with the secretary of war back in the 1800s. That's nottrue, including comments by conservative lawyers and scholars --WALLACE: Right.KLOBUCHAR: The Republican lawyer of the year and it's just not correct inthe plain language of the Constitution. But that's what they wrappedthemselves around when they gave their excuse for how they voted. It wasn'tthe facts. So my answer to you is, in this case, it would not have changedtheir minds. That's obvious or Mitch McConnell would not have given thespeech that he gave.WALLACE: Let -- Senator, let me ask you, though, about some of the facts inthe case, and the case that the House managers brought.Yes, it is true that President Trump summoned the crowd to Washington onJanuary 6th. Yes, it's true that he asked them to fight like hell. But,yes, it's also true that he said this.Here is the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (January 6th): I know that everyonehere will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully andpatriotically make your voices heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Does that, Senator, meet the Supreme Court test in Brandenburg v.Ohio that his speech was directed to inciting or producing imminent lawlessaction and was likely to incite or produce such action? Does it meet thelegal standard for incitement?KLOBUCHAR: What the standard here is, Chris, it's about impeachment andwhether or not he followed his oath of office, committed high crimes andmisdemeanors. So let's look at what he did. To me, it's not just what hesaid in that speech. I mean I've asked for people to fight for things, tofight for 48 hour maternity leave -- maternity -- staying in the hospitalfor new moms and their babies. That was my first fight that I took on. Butthose moms didn't storm the maternity wards with bear spray and handcuffs.They didn't do that. Why? Because that's not what I asked them to do.Look at the facts. Leading up to this, on your interview he would notcommit to a peaceful transition of power. He undermined the election. Hecalled it a steal.Then we get to the day of the speech. He told people to show up on January6th, put a target on the Capitol, basically told them to go wild, leadingup to it.WALLACE: Right.KLOBUCHAR: Then he gives a speech, tells them to march down The Mall. Andwhat happens after they invade the Capitol and they're impaling policeofficers? He does nothing. I'm sorry, just throwing in the word peacefullyonce isn't enough. To me the answer is in his 6:00 p.m. tweet, after peoplehad already died, when he called them great patriots and once againrepeated the lie that the election victory, in his words, had beenunceremoniously and viciously stripped away and he said, remember this dayforever. It wasn't a one word, it was an entire plan.WALLACE: Senator -- Senator, I've got less than 30 seconds.Lindsey Graham makes it clear he thinks that Donald Trump is still a viableand important force in Republican politics. Is he?KLOBUCHAR: No. And that's because, and you can see where the numbers areright now with how he's doing, what people think of him across the country,I say no. One, as Mitch McConnell points out, there's a lot of otherinvestigations going on about this man. Two, the American people have nowseen clear out what he did. He violated his oath of office in what LizCheney called the greatest betrayal of a president's oath of office inhistory. And those memories and those police officers screams will beforever etched in the memories of Americans. He is done.WALLACE: Senator Klobuchar, thank you.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.WALLACE: Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what acquittalmeans for Donald Trump's future as a political force.And, Governor Andrew Cuomo faces even more criticism for his handling ofCOVID in nursing homes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): There's no question, none, that PresidentTrump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events ofthe day. No question about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell blaming last month's riotdirectly on Donald Trump after voting to acquit him on the grounds theSenate can't try a former president.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Marc Thiessen of the American Enterprise Institute, Fox News correspondentGillian Turner, and Charles Lane from "The Washington Post."So, Marc, what do you think the second Trump impeachment trialaccomplished? Was it a failure for Democrats or did they at least succeedin tying him more closely and more directly to the events of January 6th?MARC THIESSEN, RESIDENT FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, WASHINGTONPOST COLUMNIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's a little bit of both,Chris. I mean, first of all, if you believe that President Trump committedimpeachable offenses, and I do believe that, this is the headline he getsto hold up today. Just like he did last impeachment, Trump -- Trump isacquitted by the Senate. So he gets to hold that up and declare victory.At the same time, the trial did force us as a nation to confront whathappened on that day. We did -- we saw for the first time with thatsurveillance video how close the mob came to actually reaching senators andcongressmen and Vice President Mike Pence, seconds away from seeing -- fromVice President Mike Pence.And even if you believe that Trump is not responsible for inciting theriot, his behavior after the riot began is absolutely indefensible. Thefact that he didn't stand up immediately when he saw what was happening andsay, no, no, that's not what I meant, stand-down. That when -- that whenKevin McCarthy called him and was begging for help, he said, these peoplecare more about the election then you do, Kevin. You know, these -- these -- these are indefensible things. And so that is all on the record now andthe country is better for that.WALLACE: Chuck, do you think Republicans face any downside from voting, 43of them, to acquit President Trump, or is that good politics for them? Andwhat you think this does to the president? Does -- is he tarnished or --and I guess maybe the answer is both, is he tarnished or -- or is he seenas the victim once again of a Democratic witch hunt?CHARLES LANE, "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think I'mgoing to answer that by referring to what Lindsey Graham just set on thisshow, which was, quote, I'm about winning. And he believes that winning forthe Republican Party means doubling down on the party's attachment toDonald Trump and disparaging those Republicans who voted to convict andotherwise, including even Mitch McConnell, who didn't vote to convict butjust condemns the president. I was really struck by that because there's asenator from the south, from a red state, who does the politicalcalculation and decides that the future of the party lies with Trump. And Ithink that's impressive. It's very sobering. It's almost shocking becausewe -- as Marc very ably said, whatever else you can say about thispresident, his fingerprints are all over an ugly act of mob violence in theheart of our capital and yet he does still seem to have sway over the bulkof the Republican Party.WALLACE: Gillian, let's pick up on exactly that point. You heard mydiscussion with Senator Graham about his former governor, Nikki Haley'svery tough statement in which she said that Donald Trump has lost anypolitical viability. He said she's wrong. Do you think she's wrong?GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AND FORMER NATIONAL SECURITYCOUNCILSTAFF: I do. I think that former President Trump still has a strangleholdon the vast majority of the Republican Party. Maybe not every singlepolitician in office, but most of them. I think yesterday's acquittal votedemonstrates as well as the fact that, Chris, he left office just threemonths ago. He'd already been impeached twice. He had an 87 percentapproval rating among Republicans. So I think those two things put togetherdemonstrate exactly what Lindsey Graham said.The other, I think, million-dollar question to ask right now is, doesSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have any control over his caucus inthe Senate moving forward? That's much less clearer than -- I think thanthe Trump question.WALLACE: Let's turn, in the time we have left, to another politician whohad a very bad week, and that is New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. It firstcame out that -- that the state of New York had -- had severelyundercounted the number of -- of people living in nursing homes who haddied from COVID-19. And last month Governor Cuomo said this about that.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We're below the national average in number ofdeaths in nursing homes. But who cares? Thirty-three, 28 died in ahospital, died in a nursing home. They died.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Now, one of Cuomo's top aides was quoted this week as having saidthat the Cuomo administration froze on -- her word, froze on releasing thenumbers when the Justice Department asked for them because they wereconcerned that the Trump administration was going to use those -- thosefigures against them.Marc, how damaging for Andrew Cuomo?THIESSEN: Well, just think of it this way, imagine if Donald Trump had donewhat Andrew Cuomo did and falsified data on the pandemic for politicalpurposes, we'd have a -- we'd have a third impeachment going, you know?But the other thing is that I think people are missing the real scandalhere. So everybody's focused on the fact that he did not give data that wassupposed to go to the Justice Department on August 23rd investigating thedeaths.The real scandal is that for months before that, starting in May, he wasproviding false data to public health officials. So public health -- this -- the virus started -- that spread across the country was not the varianton the West Coast, it was the Italian variant that started in New York, andthat seeded the entire pandemic across the country. Public health officialswere desperately trying to figure out how this virus was spreading, who wasmost vulnerable, how they could stop it and Cuomo fed them false data aboutwho was getting sick and where. That -- that is an unbelievablyirresponsible thing to do and it probably led to the deaths of a lot ofAmericans across the country because it interfered with the public healthofficials ability to fight the virus. So I think that's the real scandalhere and it's very damaging.WALLACE: Chuck -- Chuck, we got a little over a minute left.Cuomo was getting a lot of praise in those first months, last -- lastspring for what were considered very factual briefings. It all seems to becoming apart for him now.LANE: Especially because the criticism he's coming under is bipartisan.Don't forget this latest round began with a Democratic attorney general'sreport. A number of Democratic members of the New York state legislatureare criticizing him.You know, he has sharp elbows. He's not shy about making enemies no matterwhere, and what party. And I think some of that's coming back to haunt him.And so that is what's particularly damaging about this, is it's not justRepublicans coming after him.WALLACE: And, Gillian, in -- in the 30 seconds we have left, there's alsothe basic criticism that he was ordering nursing homes to take people whohad COVID.TURNER: Yes, and that speaks to the broader problem, which is much biggerthan Cuomo himself here, which is that Americans sadly don't really careabout policy that much anymore. They care about the persona of politicians.If you're in a press conference and you sound authoritative and commandingand also sympathetic, they give you a pass. Nobody really pays closeattention to the underlying policies that politicians are implementinganymore. And I think there's a real reckoning coming with that pretty soon.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Happy Valentine's Day toall of you.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week," bestselling author James Pattersonon his publishing empire in the new book he says just may be his mostimportant ever.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: He is the best-selling author of the past decade. And if you thinkI'm talking about Stephen King or John Grisham, think again.Here's our "Power Player of the Week."(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAMES PATTERSON, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR: I love to tell stories, and I want toknow what's going to happen at the end.WALLACE (voice over): Author James Patterson tells lots of stories. Threehundred and fourteen books, 241 best sellers, over 400 million copies sold.Loyal fans buy so many. Their hash tag is patterstack.WALLACE (on camera): What's the secret to a best-selling book? PATTERSON: Oh, I -- you know, characters and interesting situations.I'm James Patterson. Welcome to "The Inn."Read about it in "The 18th Abduction."WALLACE:  There does seem to be a bit of a James Patterson formula, bitesize chapters and a plot that -- that races like the dickens.PATTERSON: Yes, for sure. I think it's a good way. I think it fits themodern world.WALLACE (voice over): Patterson's signature character, Detective Alex Cross(ph), is a publishing franchise, adapted into hit films.But his latest book, "Walk in my Combat Boots," written with Retired ArmySergeant Matt Eversmann, is a non-fiction page-turner.PATTERSON: These are the people on the ground. This is their stories.WALLACE (on camera): Why was that important to tell, and particularly whyto tell now?PATTERSON: If you've been in the military, if you've been in combat thatyou'd say, these people -- these guys got it right. And if you haven't,you'll understand, maybe for the first time in your life, what it means toserve, what it means to put your life on the line for somebody else.WALLACE (voice over): His favorite story is about twins, Jason and KevinDroddy, who both served as Army Rangers in Iraq.PATTERSON: One of them would go through a hair-raising experience, and --and all he would think about is, I hope my twin is OK. And Jason wouldalways say over and over again, Kevin and I are going to go home. We'regoing to get home. And they did get home.WALLACE: Patterson runs his own story-telling army.PATTERSON: I have some co-writers. What I do is I will write a 50 or 60page outline for everything. There was one year, two years ago, where I had-- I wrote I think it was 2,700 pages of outlines, which is crazy.WALLACE (on camera): Do you ever get writer's block?PATTERSON: No. No. I -- what is that? I've heard about that, but I don't --no. Obviously not. Some of my competitors wish that I would get writer'sblock.WALLACE (voice over): No writer's bock, but he still finds mystery in theprocess.PATTERSON: I never know for sure how it's going to turn out.WALLACE (on camera): When you write a book, you don't know what the endingis going to be?PATTERSON: Frequently, I don't know the ending, because I get to it and Igo, it needs more.WALLACE: You've got to have a sense that, OK, that -- that is coherent withwhere he took me along the trip.PATTERSON: Or it's, you're hooked, you're hooked, you're hooked, you haveto -- and it's aliens. You go, what?  No, not aliens. You can't do that,you copout. You -- that's awful.WALLACE: Maybe the butler, but not the aliens. PATTERSON: I haven't done the butler yet, but I -- I'd like to do that.That would be humorous. (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Patterson has just finished another nonfiction book, hisautobiography.
