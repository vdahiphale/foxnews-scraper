MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Above that Georgia race this evening,but this is an extraordinary time, and we are witnessing trulyextraordinary events. Bret, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight,as always. And we go back to these images. Watch this video. Just watchthis Capitol Hill police officer as he grabs a stick and runs up thestairs, followed by a column of people who are chasing him and backing himup this staircase as they march toward the Senate chamber, as lawenforcement tries to keep them back.When he gets to the top of the stairs, he's joined by other policeofficers. Because up until that moment, you're just looking at this saying,where is the backup? Where is his help for this man as he is overrun bypeople coming up the stairs of the Senate offices, guns drawn on the floorof the United States Congress today, keeping people back who had broken andshattered the windows.This rioter defiantly standing at the House podium, yakking it up, having agreat time. How about this one. In Speaker Pelosi's office doing the samething. Obviously, these pictures are all quite clear. These individualswill be found, I would imagine, and law enforcement will take over.These moments as members of the House chamber got on their knees andprayed, all of it, bringing the presidential transition process, which wassupposed to be happening today to a screeching halt, although we dounderstand there's an effort to get it back underway tonight to continuethe continuity of government, which is obviously so important in the UnitedStates of America.So, this was a historic breach of our seat of government. We are on thescene live tonight as these events continue this evening to unfold. HouseMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy was on the House floor, of course todayduring all of this. He spoke with the president several times throughoutthe course of it. And he's going to join us in moments to update us on whatis going on this evening.Also, tonight on THE STORY, Katie Pavlich, Sarah Palin, Trey Gowdy andBrian Kilmeade joining us throughout the course of the evening with theirobservations about the state of America as we enter this transition periodat a very rocky time. But we begin tonight on the north side of the U.S.Capitol building with White House Correspondent Kevin Corke with an updateon the ground there. Kevin, good evening to you.KEVIN CORKE, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Martha. Just incrediblepictures. I'm so thankful that you were able to share that moment ofhistory with the audience. This is something none of us will ever forget.Fortunately, we're here on the north side of the Capitol, as you pointedout, and we have been here for the better part of five hours now. And thiswas a very, very active protest area. Throughout the day, we saw protestersattempting to gain access on the north side of the building. We heard themsinging songs and chanting.And for the most part, remaining outside of the building from where we werestanding. But tonight, it is a very, very different circumstance here. Asyou know, a curfew went into effect here in the nation's capital at 6 PMEastern Time, since then, we have seen this crowd, for the most partdispersed certainly on this side of the building. I'm going to step offcamera for just a second and allow you to see just what's happening behindme. You see a fairly decent number of law enforcement officers still campedright here along the north side and to the east of the Capitol dome.We have seen traffic coming in and out. You heard Chad Pergram earliertalking about the idea of maybe, just maybe getting back into this buildingand getting back to the business of the people tonight, perhaps as early as8 o'clock, although very unlikely. But right now, despite the fact that inthe distance I see tons of not dozens of red and blue strobe lights stillmoving, not a lot of activity, at least so far. Thankfully, nothinghappening at this very moment. Martha.MACCALLUM: Yes. Kevin, thank you. Sadly, we know that a woman was shot andkilled in the course of the chaos at the United States Capitol today.Joining us now, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who was inside theCapitol as this unfolded. In fact, we were speaking with Bill Hemmer thisafternoon, and you were relaying this to Bill. And you could hear LeaderMcCarthy, the shock and just fear in your voice of what was happening atthat time. Can you tell us more about that tonight?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, this was the worst we've seen of Americathis afternoon. Now, hopefully tonight you'll see the very best of whatdemocracy in our Constitution tells us when we get back to work. But thisis unacceptable. And I think for the heart of every American, we have totake a pause and we have to realize what has gone on for the last couple ofyears, the anger we've had to one another, if somebody disagrees with oneanother.We are so much better than what transpired today. And I would hope we'dtake this moment to start to heal and unite the nation together. We candisagree. We can protest, but not what transpired today. A woman lost herlife. People were scaling walls. People were breaking the symbol ofdemocracy into the Capitol. It was appalling to see. It was the saddestmoment I've ever had as a member of Congress. And we are so much betterthan what today displayed to the world.MACCALLUM: So, we watched the president earlier at the rally and he wastelling everyone that the election had been stolen, that he had won in alandslide, and that important things were going to happen, that he wantedVice President Pence to do the right thing. And then we heard that VicePresident Pence said, I have analyzed this in every way I can, and my jobis to oversee and preside over the certification of these states vote.And I heard one man who was walking along the street with our Griff Jenkinsand he said, yes, I just heard that Vice President Pence is not going tooverthrow this election. What do you think of what the president said todayto the people there and of what transpired after that and what they were soupset about?MCCARTHY: Well, people could be upset about an election, but you don't goto this direction, this is way too far. We can have a debate where we candisagree. We can have a debate about election integrity. We can fix theproblems that we have going forward, but not in a display that took placetoday.I want to get back in that chamber tonight to show that that mob cannotcontrol this government, that we are so much better than what transpiredand will show what democracy looks like to the rest of the world, that wecan have a transfer of power peacefully like we've done every year before.And we will debate issues, but we will not act this way.MACCALLUM: So, you spoke with the president several times today. What canyou tell us? How can you characterize what he was thinking and feeling ashe was watching all of this? We saw the video. He again came out and talkedabout his landslide win, and he said that he loved the people that were outthere, and he wanted them to go home. And then he tweeted, everyoneremembers this day with an exclamation point. What do you think about allof that?MCCARTHY: I remember the day for a different point, I remember the day as alow point, I hope this day changes the course of history. I hope this dayunites one another. I mean, if we all think for one moment, we all have aresponsibility as Americans, we may disagree with somebody. But think aboutwhat do you say on social media? Think about what you talk about oneanother. Did you lose a friend because somebody else won an election?Can't we respect to differences of opinion? I mean, that's the uniquenessof who we are. That is why we are the beacon of freedom for the rest of theworld. Today was not that day. But we can be and should be and we'll havedebates. But in this election, we do our very best. We know there'schallenges in the election. We know there's challenges about the integrity.We fix that. We fix that through the process that we all respect through aconstitution, not through arms, not through breaking in, not throughintimidating where a person ended up dying today, where the Capitol Police,there are broken bones, there are injuries with others defending thenation's Capital from Americans. That's what's wrong. And that's what hasto change.MACCALLUM: I was just told that Twitter has suspended the president'saccount for 12 hours and they marked with violating the course of history.You've had a lot to say about Twitter and Facebook, and they have wieldedtheir power in a number of ways. What do you say to that move this evening,violating civil integrity, excuse me? That was the phrase.MCCARTHY: I think that builds up to everything else. I mean, that's whyeverybody has responsibility in here. Do you deny a person a voice? Youjudge them based upon their opinion? You know who we created a nationbecause we believe in the First Amendment. It's the very First Amendment.We don't believe in mob. But this idea that now we're going to deny peoplebased upon what they believe, it adds to this.What we watched happened in the streets through the summer thinking someonecan break into a person's store because they have a right to take it. Wehave gone too far this year as a nation that we should take and I've hopein 2021, it was going to be so much different. This is our moment of a timeto change course. This is our moment of time that everybody should standtogether, unite, and find what is the very best about us, because thiscountry is exceptional. But the moment today was not, and we should not letit stand. We should not be silent about it, but we should change course.Let me make sure we do come together.MACCALLUM: I think everybody agrees with you on that. Let me ask you aboutthe some of the housekeeping, so to speak. It's pretty messy inside all ofthose buildings right now. Do you think that you will get back in there andthat you will get on with the business of this certification tonight? Anddo you believe that all of the efforts to question the certification and wehad heard anywhere from three to six states, are Republicans stillcommitted to doing that for six states, which would take hours and hoursand hours? Is that still going to happen?MCCARTHY: I believe we'll get in there tonight. I've talked to those on theground in security. It's taken us some time to clean the chambers. I knowall leaders are committed to making sure we get this done to show thecountry we can do our work, we can follow the democracy, we can follow theconstitution. There's nothing wrong with having questions about theelection. There's nothing wrong with questioning because this is the onlytime.Remember, this is the people's house. This is where debate should takeplace. This isn't where mobs should take place, but debate. It's healthy tohave debate. I believe we'll finish Arizona. Not sure what we'll continueon, but we have to finish the rolls. We have work to be done and we shouldfinish it.MACCALLUM: But I'm told that Cathy McMorris Rodgers has sort of pulled backfrom the full dispute over three to six states given what has happenedtoday. Do you recommend that? Do you would you say to your party that it'sthat they should move on from that, or do you want them to continue downthat path?MCCARTHY: I would like us to finish Arizona, we've got another hour ofdebate, but I think in light of what has transpired now, everybody has aright that gets elected to Congress or the Senate. And this isn't the firsttime that this has been challenged. The Democrats have used this everysingle time a Republican has been elected in modern history since 88.But I think what has transpired today may hopefully bring people togetherin a different light, finish it, but also think about the challenges thatare out there that has transpired when it comes to the integrity of ourelection. Let's solve that. So, the frustration that we watched today doesnot continue into the next election, let's not be silent about it. Let'ssolve it.MACCALLUM: Senator Tim Scott had an Election Integrity Commission that hewants to begin. And I think that work will be done in the future andabsolutely needs to happen given all of the disgruntlement over theelection.One last question before I let you go. And I have Senator Rand Paul comingup next. I just want to let everyone know, but we're told that by ourreporter at the Pentagon that it has been Vice President Pence who has beendealing with the Pentagon on the questions of the National Guard anddeploying them to help around the Capitol. Why is it Vice President Pencerather than the president who has been handling that?MCCARTHY: Well, I know the vice president has been in constant contact withus and also along with the security inside the Capitol. I communicated withthe vice president early on in regard to getting the National Guard there.He said, I'll call right now.I had conversations with the president staff as well about calling in. Iknow the president when I talked to him about getting out to the Americanpublic to make a statement, but also to make sure the security of theCapitol is intact. I know it was his concern to make that happen too, but Iknow the vice president jumped from the very beginning to make it happen.MACCALLUM: Interesting. OK, thank you., Minority Leader McCarthy. Very goodto have you. I'm glad you're OK. It's been a horrible day for everyone onthe Hill. And we do hope that you all can get back to the business that youstarted today to show that continuity of government, I think it would be avery important symbol to everybody who's watching this from the outside.Thank you, sir. Good to see you tonight.MCCARTHY: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, joining me now by phone is Republican Senator Rand Paul ofKentucky, who says that he does not think there is going to be anotherobjection tonight. Senator Paul, thank you for being here.First of all, it's been quite a day, a horrible day for the country towatch all of this. Your big picture thoughts about what we've witnessed atthe Capitol today.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): It wasn't a good day for our country, people hereare rattled, brought back bad memories of being shot at the ballpark twoyears ago when we had congressional baseball practice. Fortunately, itdidn't end that way. But someone did die tonight. Having a mob break intothe Capitol is a terrible thing. And I just don't understand it, exactlywhat's going on. But with the question at hand, conservatives should knowthat the Electoral College is something we support because it supportsstates' rights to run the elections.When there's a problem, it's going to have to be fixed at the states. Thefix isn't up here for people to be led to believe that the ElectoralCollege can be changed after the vote and the people can come in Washingtonand have Congress overturn the election is an absurdity. It's really amistake for people to believe that. It's never happened before. It wasnever intended to happen. And if it did, it would be overturning everythingthat we cherish about states' rights, that these powers are something thatare left to the states and the people and they don't belong to the federalgovernment.But can you imagine what would happen to this country if every four yearswe have Congress overturning an election? It would be chaos. And that'swhat we saw today, chaos and anarchy. And we have to stop it. People needto know this is not the way you try to preserve your country or make yourcountry better. I have a lot of the same complaint. I want the elections tobe better, but I'll spend the next two years lobbying state legislatures totry to fix the election law, so this doesn't happen again.But this isn't constructive. And it started out with a bad premise and bysome people who I think are confused in the Senate and the House who think,oh, Congress is allowed to overturn elections, that was never appropriate.It's not a conservative tradition. And it was a big mistake to do this.MACCALLUM: I think there's two elements to what you're talking about. And,when you do look at the constitutional issues that arose in places likePennsylvania, where you have a legislature that was overruled by theSupreme Court in Pennsylvania, that is a real constitutional issue. I don'tunderstand why the Supreme Court didn't take that up. It is a clearquestion about how the Constitution should dominate in that issue. So,there are real issues that people have been fired up about, and I thinkrightfully so.On the other hand, you're also saying that people should never have thoughtthat this could be overturned once each state because the states have thepower to certify their own electoral college. But they were told that byPresident Trump and they were told that Vice President Pence was going todefend him in that and do something different than what he ended up sayinghe was going to do, which was to allow these states to have their peace.What do you say to the president about all of that transpiring before thishappened?PAUL: The message I have really is for everyone. The Electoral College isthe friend of those who believe in states' rights and it destroys theElectoral College to think that Congress would overturn them. The statecertifies the elections. Not one state sent other electors. Not one statedisputed the election. Now, you're right. I disagree with changing theelectoral laws, having secretary of states in Pennsylvania changed thelaws.But what happened is in there and also in Michigan is the law was actuallysilent on whether or not you could solicit votes, whether or not secretaryof state could send out solicitations, applications, and ballots. And so,what the courts ruled was, well, the law doesn't say you can't do it. So,you must be allowed to do it.Disagree with the ruling. But the way we fix this is next year inPennsylvania, we control the Pennsylvania state legislature. We should passa law that says you're not allowed to - the taxpayer dollars aren't allowedto be used to solicit votes and that absentee voters have to - votes haveto be counted according to the law and that secretaries of state can'tchange the law passed by the legislature.But we don't do it by destroying the Electoral College. If we destroy theElectoral College, all the calls now are going to be from the Left to getrid of the Electoral College. Conservatives will never win again in thiscountry, so we shouldn't be trashing the very institution that has been theway we win the presidency. And the only way we've been winning thepresidency recently is through the Electoral College.MACCALLUM: That's absolutely true. With regard to your party, on the whole,the Republican Party, we heard from Mitch McConnell today. He talked abouta shared commitment to truth and ground rules. He said he was worried abouta death spiral for democracy. And this is before any of this happened.He said that he had respect for people's decisions and would defend oursystem of government for the future. Now, that put him in stark oppositionto Ted Cruz and to Senator Hawley, who wanted to use the process to contestthese states, which they have a right to do. But where does this leave theRepublican Party when you've got this very deep cleave over how all of thishas been handled?PAUL: Well, there's a certain degree of disingenuousness from those who areobjecting. They're saying, oh, we will want to overturn the election. Wejust want to protest. Well, hey, baby, I've been protesting since the verybeginning with the most - with the best of them. I'm all for protest.Protest is a rally where you protest, and you speak your mind. But protestisn't trying to overturn the Electoral College. The vote we will take andwe're going to take it in about an hour. And I think the vote has beencondensed to one vote. I don't think they'll appeal all of the states, Ithink the events of the day have chastened them somewhat.But they aren't protesting. They are voting to overturn the election. Andas much as I don't like the outcome, as much as I think the states couldhave done a better job and we should fix the election laws in the states, Ican't vote to overturn the election. But they keep telling us, oh, we'renot voting to overturn the election. We're voting to protest the election.That's not what the vote is. They're characterizing the vote as a protest,but it's not a protest. The vote is not to seat these electors.The result is Donald Trump would win the presidency. That's what they'reasking us to do. It's an extraordinarily radical idea that would overturneverything we've ever done in this country with regard to the ElectoralCollege. And I can't believe people have been thinking, oh, yes, this willjust be normal. And I think that this heightened tension that everythinghas been stolen just has led to this feeling that nobody believes there'sany integrity anymore.And so, they're just going to riot. And the thing is, is that we can fixthis problem, it's not a problem that can't be fixed, we fix it by going toall the state legislatures and that's what I'm going to spend the next yeardoing, going to every state legislature, and trying to pass election reformlaw so they can't do this again. But rioting and anarchy is not the answer.MACCALLUM: So, you think even though Republicans will not have a majorityin the Senate, that these things, these vote fixes can be pushed throughRepublican state legislatures and will make a difference by the time the2022 elections roll around?PAUL: It's the only thing, it's the only constructive thing being offeredis what I am offering. Fix it at the state level. At the federal level. Wedon't control the House, we don't control the Senate, and we won't controlthe presidency. But the other thing is, is as a conservative and someonewho believes that elections should be done at the state level, it's what webelieve in. We don't believe in a federal fix to this. So, what happens ispeople jump to the easy solution. They say, oh, there's this problem. Wegot ripped off in the election, so Congress should fix it.But the problem is it's against our philosophy to say, Congress fix it. Ourphilosophy says, it should remain with the state and really state capitalsshould be important place to state reps, state senators should beincredibly important. I will lobby mine. I've already started lobbying mystate reps and state senators to say, we need to pass election law reformsin Kentucky, but it's not the business of Washington to do it and thensetting up this false expectation that will overturn the Electoral Collegeand everybody is going to be happy with that. No, it would have led tochaos and war coming from the other side had the election been overturned.MACCALLUM: Senator Rand Paul, thank you. Good to have you here tonight on avery rough day for the country. Good to speak with you, sir.PAUL: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, my next guest organized a March to Save America rally inD.C., which took place earlier today at the beginning of all of this. KylieJane Kremer is executive director of Women for America First. Kylie, thankyou very much for being here today.Tell me what your experience was today and what you think about all of whathappened. Kylie, are you hearing me?KYLIE JANE KREMER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WOMEN FOR AMERICA FIRST: Can youhear me, Martha?MACCALLUM: There we go. Hi, Kylie. I don't know if you heard my question.Thank you for being here. My question is you were one of the organizers ofthe rally. Everything sort of started out on a very positive note. I wantto know what you think about what happened today in the end.KREMER: Thank you so much for having me, Martha. And yes, absolutely. Theday started out, tremendous. We had a huge crowd, hundreds of thousands ofpeople showing up at the Ellipse where the president came and spoke to, Wethe People. Unfortunately, the day that was so great this morning has beenovershadowed by what took place at the Capitol this afternoon.And a few bad actors have completely spoiled it, not just for the peoplethat were there and the president and all the other dignified people thatwere on our stage. But also, I mean, for the millions of Americans that areat home. And unfortunately, I think that the intolerance from the Left andDemocrats of advocating that violence is OK with BLM and ANTIFA has helpedcontribute to get us here to the situation today.MACCALLUM: When you look at, it's very interesting because we've seen thisargument and this discussion on the other side, as you point out as well,we've seen people with ANTIFA and more prominently, I guess, with BlackLives Matter who say, look, I'm here because I'm upset about policebrutality. I don't want to be any part of any violence.And today you're seeing that this is being sort of lumped together. We allwatched this morning; we saw people waving their flags. There's nothingwrong with the gathering that happened on the Ellipse. But this will makeit very difficult for the causes that you support, because these people -because these people are criminals, they're rioters and they broke into theUnited States Capitol.KREMER: Absolutely. And we do not tolerate any sort of violence. We've heldtwo successful events prior to today here in D.C. where we did not havethis issue. And again, there was no issue at the event, at the Ellipse thismorning. It was when people marched to the Capitol and they decided to takethings into a different direction than we had been advocating for thatmillions of other conservative Americans have been advocating for. And Ijust really want to implore that those few bad apples, although today wascompletely horrific, should not overshadow what we have been workingtowards as a movement that we want election integrity.It is so unfortunate. And just as Senator Paul talked about, the baseballshooting, of course, that brings up terrible memories. But conservatives asa whole have not been the ones that have been advocating for violence. AndI think that not feeling heard making that their ballots that were legalballots that were cast, that were disenfranchised by illegal ballots thatwere cast is certainly causing a situation that people feel very angry andthey feel that we are moving in a direction that we no longer have free andfair elections.MACCALLUM: I hear that a lot. And I understand that feeling when you lookat what has happened. But did you - today when you came to Washington, didyou believe that the election might be overturned by the vice president inthe Senate chamber?KREMER: I thought that there's certainly a possibility for the Americanpeople to see the evidence on the floor when each state was brought up andthat we could really see firsthand from the senators and House membersmouths exactly what evidence that the mainstream media has helped cover upthe 200,000 plus ballots more in Pennsylvania, the trucks that were broughtfrom New York to Pennsylvania that have never been investigated.I mean, there are a lot of different things that we've been hearing about.We want to see the direct evidence. And I thought that we would have theopportunity for that. I understand that they're still working towardsmeeting again this evening and starting to vote again.MACCALLUM: Yes. In fact, there's Senator Josh Hawley. What we're seeingright now are the senators leaving their hunkered down positions and theCapitol has been deemed safe. And I believe this is probably the beginningof the process of going back over to do this joint session and to getthings back underway, which I think would be probably a good way to end theday to get everybody back where they should be and to mend the capital andbegin the process of putting things back together. Kylie, thank you verymuch. Good to have you here tonight.KREMER: Thank you so much for having me.MACCALLUM: So, moments ago, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia saying ofPresident Trump on Twitter, 12 hours is not sufficient. He is a danger toour democracy and should be banned from Twitter for the next 14 days. Thatwould be heading all the way into the inauguration. Trey Gowdy, formerHouse Oversight Committee Chairman, and Jonathan Turley, ConstitutionalAttorney, both are Fox News contributors. Join me now. Good to have both ofyou with us, gentlemen.Trey Gowdy, let me go to you first. As you watch these senators leavingtheir positions where they have spent much of the last several hourshunkered down, what's going through your mind as you look at today?TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Just what a terrible day it is forAmerica. I never, never thought I would see Americans scaling the wall toattack the people's House, the Capitol. So, if you're thinking about movingto a narco state or a banana republic and you wonder what it's like todaywas a good idea of what it would be like. That is not America. That is notthis idea of America. We're a nation of laws. We're not a nation of peoplewho attack law enforcement officers trying to accomplish a goal that wasnever going to be accomplished in the first place, Martha, this was alwaysa fool's errand.So, why people are surprised that Mike Pence did exactly what theconstitution calls him to do. I'm surprised that they're surprised.MACCALLUM: Let me stay with you for just a moment, Trey. I spoke withMinority Leader McCarthy at the top of the hour, and I asked him about thefact that our reporting at the Pentagon is that the vice president has beenoverseeing the security effort here to coordinating with the National Guardand all of that. And Leader McCarthy confirmed that, yes, he had been intouch with him and he seemed to be the person who was overseeing that. Whatdo you read into that, if anything, tonight?GOWDY: Well, I don't read anything into it because, I mean, the way Iunderstood Kevin was that because Pence was there on Capitol grounds, heshared his concerns with the vice president and whether or not the vicepresident talked to President Trump or not, I don't know. I didn't read alot into Kevin's response.MACCALLUM: And what did you think about the president's tweets today andthe video that he made at the White House?GOWDY: Tepid at best. I watched his entire speech this morning. There are38 allegations. he has factual legal allegations related to electionintegrity, not a single one of which is going to be solved by scaling thewalls of the Capitol. You got to go to the courtroom or go to the statelegislatures. None of what he was complaining about this morning is goingto be solved by the rioting and assaulting the Capitol.MACCALLUM: It's a great point. Jonathan Turley, your thoughts as anobserver of history and a lawyer who - an attorney who writes a lot aboutpolitics. What did you think about today?JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY: It was a devastating day. I havea great deal of attachment to the House floor because I first entered it asa young 14-year-old page. And it's a beautiful room and it representssomething that people have gone to war to protect. And so that's why I'mnot sure this is an insurrection, but it certainly is a desecration. Thatis what these people were doing really bordered on a desecration of themost sacred moment of our constitutional system.And the terrible thing is that we just had two of the most redeemingmoments. When Vice President Pence defied President Trump and said I'mgoing to stand with the Constitution, not convenient, it was an amazingmoment to behold. For all of us. It reminded us that we are all in thistogether.And then when Senator Mitch McConnell stood up and called on his colleagueto stand down, this is a man known for brass knuckle politics, telling hiscolleagues to put politics aside, it was perhaps his greatest speech of hiscareer. And that was a high point for us as a nation.And then this, this happened. And it's chilling for all of us, because itshows a crisis of faith. You know, that's what the Constitution is, its aleap of faith that we take together. The people that scale the walls hadbroke into those bodies, they have lost their faith. And the question ishow much of America is now faithless? And that's a serious problem.And in order to trigger that any one person or any one party, it's aproblem for all of us to deal with because the Constitution is valueless ifpeople don't believe in it. And there is clearly a crisis of faith.MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera):  I am told that VicePresident Pence is back in the Senate. So, I think this is an encouragingsign. I think that it's a positive way, Trey, to end this day. I think it'sgoing to be reassuring to people to see that the building has been secured.And that the rioters have been vanished from the building. And that thisprocess is going to get back underway.Your thoughts on that and on the fact that it sounds like they are going todo a truncated version of the objections tonight.TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I agree with you, Martha, the lawwins. We're a nation of laws, and kudos to the senators and the Housemembers for getting back to business and not letting this insurrection stopthem. It was always going to be a fool's errand. Whoever believes that MikePence was going to declare Donald Trump the president or that Josh Hawleyor anyone else was going to work some magic, it was always a fool's errand.I don't want elections with mistakes, whether they are fraudulent,negligent, I want good elections. The place to fix that is statelegislatures or the courtroom. You go to court. I heard 38 allegations thismorning, Martha, from President Trump. Thirty-eight, all of which can andshould have been litigated in court. Not by scaling the walls of Congress,and not by attacking the people's house, which is what, which is whathappened.MACCALLUM:  Jonathan Turley, before I let both of you go, what's the impacton the Trump presidency of today as you look at it?TURLEY:  I think this has truly left any legacy that existed in tatters.The president was incredibly reckless today. His rhetoric has been thesubject of criticism for four years, but today was a particularly lowpoint. There was a presidential moment, but it was a vice presidentialmoment. It was the moment that Pence had when he sent that letter and defyPresident Trump.I don't think that there has ever been a lower moment for the presidency ofthe United States. And that's going to take a long time to repair for theoffice. I don't think that we will ever be able to repair for PresidentTrump.MACCALLUM:  Thank you both very much for being here tonight. I just want toput that image backup on the screen of what we are watching right now. Wejust lost to the live shot, I'm told, but police are pushing people back asthe vice president is being brought back into the chamber. It's a stunningscene that we are witnessing on Capitol Hill tonight, as we have watchedjust an unbelievable event that has unfolded on Capitol Hill.Trey Gowdy, thank you. Jonathan Turley, thank you. It's dark, but you cansee a little bit of what's going on there. Everybody at home, they arecontinuing to push people back away from the capital to secure it for there-entrance of the Vice President Mike Pence to preside over thecertification of the Electoral College for the states and the country forthe presidential election of 2020.So if you are just joining us, and if you perhaps missed what happenedtoday, here are just some of the shocking scenes when people broke into thewindows and pushed back the capitol police up the staircases and plowedtheir way in to protest and riot inside the United States Capitol building.It was just an absolutely astonishing site that we saw today.And you know, we talked to Kylie Kremer before, she was at the early rallythis morning and, you know, had her own reasons for being there and wantingto protest the election. But what we saw was something wholly differentfrom any of those motivations.So, moments ago, those are the mahogany boxes that contained the sealedcertificates of the electoral votes making their way back to the capitalthrough the Senate tunnels. And we were told earlier that some of the aidesmade sure that they protected those boxes and got them out of the way asthose walls were breached and the doors were broken to the United StatesSenate chamber.Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has been reporting live throughoutthe day on Capitol Hill. Chad, I know that you have seen a lot in youryears on Capitol Hill, but today was something that none of us will everforget.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is one that willgo down in infamy without question. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicatedthat, quote, "today was a shameful assault made on democracy. It wasanointed at the highest level of government." She said however, this cannotdeter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.And that's what we are going to have a little bit later today. Senatorswere off in another part of the capitol here where they have beensheltering in place for several hours being escorted back to the Senatechamber here where they will pick back up, at some point, we're told, maybesometime after 8 o'clock tonight in both the House and Senate, they have tomake sure that the capital is secure.The fact that they were bringing the senators back and Mike Pence, the vicepresident was coming back is significant. Keep in mind, this is where theywere. They were in the middle of the debate of the -- on the Arizona slatesof electoral ballots. So, what happens in both the House and Senate, theycome back individually into session in the House and the Senate, and atsome point, you have to have a vote on this so that they can do it one ofthree ways.They can have a good old-fashioned roll call vote, they can do this byunanimous consent, or they could actually have a voice vote where everybodyyells yea or nay and the loudest side wins. That's the fastest way. Butthen they have to come back to the joint session in the House chamber, thisis where Mike Pence, the Vice President presides under the 12th Amendmentto the Constitution.And I'm told that the House and Senate chambers are just littered withdebris and trash and glass is broken and windows. You know, I was askedearlier today, people are saying, you know, why did the capital policeofficers and some of the chamber security people have firearms have theirarms drawn.Well, they were concerned about what was going on outside the chamber, theywere trying to keep people outside, but you mention what is in thosemahogany boxes. Those are the actual pieces of parchment, the actualelectoral votes themselves, and if something were to happen in them, we arein a constitutional crisis on top of the mayhem that has happened today,because you don't actually have the pieces of paper.Now granted, things are sent to the archivist of the United States and thesecretary of states, so they have multiple copies, but that is critical asyou point out to try to protect those electoral ballots here which areactually being adjudicated under the 12th Amendment and the Electoral CountAct of 1887.Now it might take a while for the House and Senate to get back into sessiontonight. Now Nancy Pelosi, I'm going to read to you from her statementtoday, she said, quote, "we always knew that it would be our responsibilityto take us into the night. It might be a long night ahead, but we arehopeful for a shorter agenda," she said, "but our purpose will beaccomplished."And Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky says I don't thinkthere is going to be another objection tonight, I think it's over. Martha?MACCALLUM:  Yes. We spoke with him earlier on the program, and hereiterated that. Chat, thank you so much. Great coverage today --PERGRAM:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  -- on a day that as we all say is going to be burned into allof our memories for a long time.Joining me now, Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute scholar andFox News contributor. Marc, very good to have you with us today.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Your thoughts on everything from the White House to the capitol--THIESSEN:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- and how all of this played out.THIESSEN:  So today was one of the darkest days in the history of CapitolHill, but also, it's going to be considered one of the greatest. And here'swhy. First of all the darkest, the President of the United States invited acrowd to Washington incited them with lies about the election of beingstolen, he -- and then he sent them and named members of Congress as beingweak and complicit in the steal, and then sent them to walk downPennsylvania Avenue to the capital where they stormed the capitol, attackedboth chambers of Congress, and a woman was killed.And Donald Trump is responsible for what happened today. But at the sametime, we are also seeing the resilience of our democracy. We saw VicePresident Mike Pence in his role as president of the Senate push back andchoose the Constitution over as president.We saw Mitch McConnell deliver an impassioned speech talking about how hewould not allow our democracy to going to decline by overturning theelection, and now we are seeing, we just saw the images of the senators andmembers of Congress going back after the capitol has been cleared to dotheir constitutional duties.So, this is a dark day. And the images of what had happened, but it is alsoa great day because it shows the resilience of our democracy, becauseCongress has not been deterred from doing its job and meeting itsconstitutional responsibilities despite the rioters and the president whosent them.MACCALLUM:  What do you say to the people who are big supporters of thepresident and who believe that the courts let them down and believe thatthe law changes that happened before the election, because a lot of thiswas legally changed, and ended up being detrimental to Republicans cause inthe election, what do you say to them tonight?The frustration that they feel separate from these people who breached thewalls, the frustration that they feel them wanting to sort of, you know,throw over the apple cart and get a system that they think is more fair,what would you say to them this evening?THIESSEN:  Well first of all, if you think back to the race riots we hadthis summer when people were, you know, they burn down, they tried to burndown St. John's Church in Lafayette Park and actually burned down abuilding in Lafayette Park, they burned down businesses, they killedbusiness owners, and individuals, a lot more death and destruction causedby that, and the Democrats were appalled when Republicans pointed out thatpointed to the violence. And they said most of them are peaceful supporter.Well the same is true for Trump supporters. Most of them are peacefulprotesters. There were a lot of people there today, it wasn't a fewhundred, it wasn't dozens, it was thousands of people causing mayhem, butmost of the people out in the country people who go to Trump rallies arepeaceful protesters that support the president.And the fact is they have been lied to by the President in the UnitedStates. He has telling them lies. They believe that their democracy hasbeen stolen so they are angry and upset.And here's the problem. You know, on one hand the Congress as aninstitution has to stood up and do its job, but another institution hasfailed us, which is the media. Because whose job is it to debunk the lies?It's the media's job to debunk the lies. But the problem is from Trumpsupporters' perspective, these are the same people who spread for two yearsthe Russia collusion conspiracy theory that Donald Trump had colluded withVladimir Putin to steal the election.They push the Steele dossier. They attacked the president nonstop anddistorted his record. Wouldn't give him credit for the things he did right,attack him and distorted the things they felt he did wrong, and so there isno trust. They don't trust the media, and so we've lost the only arbiter oftruth that we have which is the independent free press.And so, as a result, the truth lies in tatters and we can't even agree withwhat the truth is. And in a sense, if you feel the election was stolen fromyou, despite the fact that there is no evidence that it was stolen, thatfeeling is enough, because the president says it and the media isn'tcredible enough to rebut it.MACCALLUM:  Marc, thank you. Always good to have you with us especially ona night like this.THIESSEN:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Marc Thiessen joining us. So, my next guest says that she isoutraged over the, quote, "insincere fake D.C. patriots who showed uptoday."Former Alaska governor and former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palinjoins me now. Governor Palin, good to have you with us tonight. What do youmean by that when you call these people fake patriots?FMR. GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK):  Because anybody who would storm the capitoland create this at least the perception of condoned violence is not a truepatriot. It's not one who is supporting law and order, which is afoundation that conservatives stand upon.So, you know, what Marc was just saying, though, Martha, is so spot onabout how dangerous it is in our time, in society, to not be able to trustthe media. And I've been saying this for years and years, when we can'ttrust on either side, really, what the information is being fed to us, thenyes, things like this will be a result, because there are a lot -- there isso much frustration out there that some misguided -- very, very wrongheadedyahoos are out there causing this mayhem, and we don't -- and a lot of itis the media's fault.But Martha, keep in mind, we don't know who all were the instigators inthis of these horrible things that happened today. I think a lot of it isthe antifa folks. I've been sent pictures of the same characters who werecaptured on images today storming the capitol as had been protests on theother side of politics earlier in the summer.So, I don't know, there is a lot of questions out there, and I wish wecould trust the media to do its job to go research and report who all thesepeople are.MACCALLUM:  Yes. One of the things that I'm looking for is whether or notwe see arrests for the individuals who broke into the capitol today. Theirimages are very clear. You can see their faces, they are smiling. It oughtto be fairly easy to identify these people.Just as we called for that over the course of the summer when we sawbusiness owners who were beaten, whose businesses were set on fire, wecalled for arrests as well. I think too often these things happen and wedon't have that follow-through to make it perfectly clear to people thatthe line between protesting and illegal destructive behavior which is notallowed in this country.You know, I think there is a lot of when people look at you and theyremember, you know, sort of the tea party, they remember the beginnings ofthe movement that sort of questioned whether or not the government hadbecome too big. Whether it had infringed on your life too much.I saw a lot of people in the crowd today with don't tread on me flags and,you know, some of the symbols that we saw become so prominent during thetea party. What do you think about the motivations for all that movementand where it has gone at this point in our history?PALIN:  The motivation for the movement that ushered in the Trumppresidency, really, --MACCALLUM:  Yes.PALIN:  -- because we saw so passionately changed in the typical politicalarena that, you know, we have been used to and was not serving Americanswell, the motivation is right. The motivation is simple. You know, rememberthe tea party, even the acronym t-e-a was taxed enough already. It startedfrom that. Some real basic principles that just go to, you know, the heartof who America, what America really is, and that is independence, freedom,liberty, one nation united under God.Just trying to get government back on our side and get it off our back. Andstand firm again, politicians, bureaucrats, on that foundation of which wewere created. So, the motivation is right. There has been a lot of weakknees, though, in the movement itself, because a lot of people fear whatthe media can do to you. And the media can clobber you. The media candestroy your reputation, your record. They can destroy your family if youare not strong enough to be able to handle what the media can do.So, a lot of people have backed off, and kind of pointing fingers expectingsomebody else to get out of there and do it for them. The passion is stillthere though --MACCALLUM:  Yes.PALIN:  -- within patriots to have smaller, smarter governments, to allowour charters of liberty to be adhered to again. The motivation is right.It's just a matter of not having a lot of leadership in the movement.MACCALLUM:  Well let me ask you about that, before I let you go, Governor.You know, the future of the party today you see a divide between PresidentTrump and Vice President Pence, which we never thought we would see. Andyou see the divide between, you know, the Ted Cruz's who want to notcertify the election, and Tom Cotton on the other side who a lot of peoplelook to as potentially a future leader. What is the future of theRepublican Party given the divide that exists right now?PALIN:  Well, right now the Republican Party, the machinery is a mess.President Trump tried to win over too many anti-Trumpers whom he hired. Andthat was a source of frustration for him and I don't blame him at all. Imean, you live and learn in politics in your years of service. You realizeyou can't win over those who are adamant into being disloyal to you.You need loyalists around you, but that is kind of water under the bridgeat this point, because yes, too many anti-Trumpers, never-Trumpers got inthere and created their own sorts of mayhem. I've always said though,obsessive partisanship when you get all involved in the inside baseballpower plays in the Democrat or Republican Party is going to get you introuble, because you start losing sight of what the planks and the platformreally are.And in the Republicans case, they are the right planks and the rightplatform for this country. But you get all wrapped up in those power playswithin the party, and, yes, that causes the division. We may be looking ata time for a third party that is strong, free, adamant, and has learnedenough lessons by being a part of Democrat or Republican machinery. And wedidn't like it, because it doesn't work. It's not fair to Americans. Andperhaps it's time that there is another kind of healthy and sane andpeaceful uprising via a third party.MACCALLUM:  Interesting. Sarah Palin, thank you very much. Good to have youwith us tonight.PALIN:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So, we can confirm now that Majority Leader Mitch McConnellwill speak in about 15 minutes or so on what happened today when the Senatereturns to session expected about 11 minutes from now.Joining me now is Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com news editor and Fox Newscontributor. Katie, great to have you with us tonight. Thank you for beinghere.KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.MACCALLUM:  It has been a long day. And as you have reflected on whathappened today, this extraordinary violence that we saw at the UnitedStates Capitol, a woman lost her life in the middle of it, your thoughtstonight?PAVLICH:  Yes, Martha, looking back on the events of today I think it'svery important to point out that we can't look at this in a vacuum and wecan't just look it as a culmination of events today. I think the countryhas been on edge for a very, very long time. Both sides have very seriousproblems with the other when it comes to policy issues and fairness.I think Marc Thiessen was spot on when he talked about the lack of trust ininstitutions. What we saw today was a complete breakdown in the electoralprocess and people having faith in their electors to carry out the process.There is no excuse for what happened today. And even if you went into todaybelieving that the objectors in the Senate and the House had any kind ofability to overturn the election, there is no reason -- there is no excusefor what happened even if that was your belief.And so, moving forward, I think in terms of understanding how this playedout, you know, I think that the people who are most disappointed are thepeople who are at the ellipse earlier who did not engage in the violence atthe capitol. The people who have spent a long time defending the president,his policies, who believed in his America-first agenda, believed that hebrought so much good to this country both domestically and on the foreignpolicy front, and to watch his presidency ending like this is justhorrific.And to see the fallout between Vice President Mike Pence who has been soloyal to the president, and to hear that he is the one who has been incharge of the National Guard, and to have Vice President Joe Biden who isnow the president-elect and within a matter of hours that will be set instone to come out with a formal statement about what happened before thepresident did is a lack of leadership.And I think it's really an unfortunate end to what he has been able tobring to the country over the last four years and all of hisaccomplishments.MACCALLUM:  Katie, thank you. Good to have you here tonight.PAVLICH:  Thanks.MACCALLUM:  So, we are now more than an hour into the mandatory curfew inWashington, D.C. The National Guard, approximately 1,800 troops aredeployed around the capitol perimeter to prevent any more violence of whatwe saw this afternoon.Senior correspondent Mike Tobin is out on the grounds tonight. Goodevening, Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Martha. What we are looking atreally seems to be the tail end of this effort to clear out the capitolgrounds. You can see some of the metro police that are behind me right nowwith their riot gear. As you look past them, it's hard to see right now,but some of them national guardsmen are back there supplementing the ranks.It looks that they are in a rest position right now with their shields onthe ground.But what we saw starting a little more than an hour, it's actually morethan two hours ago is they started all the way up at the capitol buildingthere to the northwest side, and with a very deliberate force startedpushing those crowd, the crowds off of those grounds. They cleared theentire line when they did that.And as they pushed, they weren't gentle about it. They were knocking guysdown, they had the truncheons at the ready, and there was a lot of pushingand shoving and scuffling going back and forth as they did that. But theymoved everybody out here. We have seen them do it. We're now to the west ofthe capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue. And we saw at times they changed uptheir tactics.At one point they enveloped the remaining protesters, spooked them a bit,and then created an opening where they could walk out and the protesterswho were here still took their -- or their -- that advantage -- tookadvantage of that opportunity and got out of here, instead of gettingarrested for violating the curfew.So, as we continue to take a look around, you've got more metro police overthere. And just really a handful of protesters to the west of them whoremain. So, there is effort to clear the capitol grounds was ratherefficient. As we are looking at it now, Martha, it appears to have beenrather effective.One thing I would note is how similar this has been to so many otherdemonstrations that given -- disregard the fact that it was at the U.S.Capitol, but how similar the tactics of the demonstrators came to the BlackLives Matter demonstrators and people say in Ferguson, that they stillresent.They did the same things, these bike racks that are used to curb, controlthe crowds. They took these and use those as barricades against theadvancing law enforcement officers. They heckled the law enforcementofficers. Berating them throughout this process, really villainizing. A lotof these people are the ones who say that they support law and order.So, it was a really dramatic and sad scene that we've seen out here. But itappears as far as the large number of people who have been out here to thewest side of the capitol, that is drawn to a close, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Yes. It's been a very tough year for members of law enforcementacross this country. And today was just another example of the enormouspressure on them. And we thank them for what they do. Mike, thank you verymuch.So, I'm getting word from Chad Pergram who is watching the situation asit's going to unfold tonight. He says that the House and Senate recess inthe middle of the debate on Arizona. So, they're going to come backseparately as House and Senate they'll resume that debate which is part offinishing the result on Arizona.And then they will take a vote on Arizona, and then ostensibly they willproceed through all of the states approving them leading to the finalannouncement by the vice president of the vote totals of the ElectoralCollege for the former Vice President Joe Biden, and for President Trump.And then the vice president will announce the candidate with the mostvotes, quote, "shall be president."That from Chad this evening as the lights are back on, they were never off.But it's good to see them on tonight at the United States Capitol building.And we'll watch as they finish that process this evening.Joining us now, Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox & Friends who has justspoken to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany who was on the jobtoday. Sort of speaking for the president and talking about what was goingon at the White House during all of this.Brian, great to see you tonight. Your thoughts on this historic difficultday for America?BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  Absolutely. I have a lot of thoughts. Butfirst, just to move the story forward and to pick up on what Katie wassaying, she said she was disappointed that Joe Biden made the remarks livebefore the president. Kayleigh told me the president was been recording hisremarks be wow Joe Biden, and right before Joe Biden even took to thestand, and asked the president to speak out.Number two, as well, he is horrified obviously by the chaos on the capitol,those are my words. But that's how she characterized it. He did note too,that it's amazing that Joe Biden suddenly about law and order, they've inlaw and order all along. Where was he for the year as he said he's burnedto the ground and alluded people died and lost their lives, David Dorn isan example of that.Also, she brought up the fact that other people have said that, anothersource of the White House on the relationship between the vice presidentand president, essentially they do not know if they have spoken, but whatdisappointed the president is that in the written remarks from the vicepresident before saying he have to approve the Electoral College.But the vice president didn't list any of the fraudulent problems that tookplace in this election according to the president and many in the Trumpteam that the president was protesting spoke about, and has written about,and has tweeted about, and actually mentioned to me two weeks ago at thearmy-navy game that there was no mention of that and that disappointed thepresident.So those two of the things just moving the story forward. About how I feelabout the whole thing? I just thought the tone, the attitude of defianceplayed out in the capitol. The lack of security stunned me. I do not knowTrump supporters that have ever demonstrated violence that I know of in abig situation.The violence that I have seen taken place is whether it was after the RNCis confrontation while there was a demonstration. That's why I personallywas relieved to find out that the mayor of D.C., who suddenly became thelaw and order mayor was going to put out the National Guard first. Wherewas that National Guard?Now that group that took over the capitol, I don't think I'll ever see thatin my lifetime again. You know, back to 1814, the last time we saw thecapitol breached like that. I think this is a culmination. This is aculmination of four years of them denying the president won the election,claiming that Russians flip votes, this is four years of investigation, andthere was four years now of a very frustrated electorate, 75 million thatvoted. They feel that they haven't had their day in court, let alone lostin court.And that's what happened. My thought is overall, Martha, that they say inrehab, and I know so many people have gone through it. Things have to hitrock bottom before you get better. We have hit rock bottom. I hope. And nowmay be people say, enough of the rhetoric, and trying to score points, andnow it's time to dial it back, Republicans and Democrats, and do this thingcalled cooperation, make deals, and get something done.MACCALLUM:  Just a minute left, Brian, what do you think about the futureof the Republican Party? We have talked about it a lot, but you know, yousee this division and even, you know, between the president and the vicepresident as you pointed out some of the reasons for that today.KILMEADE:  I will take a word that Bret have been using, dismount. Thepresident has had a horrible, in my view, dismount from November 3rd. Andhow he leaves will decide, how he comes back and how much momentum he has.When you leave Senator Lee on the sideline, Senator Lindsey Graham on thesideline, Senator Tom Cotton on the sideline and put them on the bad listand now you have your vice president there, that is a problem.And I think these people that have been there from day one, you don't wantto alienate them. The president has got a couple of weeks to bring themback together and decide if he wants to lead. For the Republicans, theypretty much agree on almost every policy issue, it's a personality issuethat divide it. The president is still the leader. The last two weeks willdecide how long that will last.MACCALLUM:  Brian, thank you very much. Good to see you here tonight. We'llwatch you obviously on Fox & Friends in the morning. Thank you very much.KILMEADE:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  What a day. So that is THE STORY of Wednesday, January the 6th,2021. So much has changed since we woke up this morning. And as always, THESTORY continues. So, we will see you back here tomorrow night at 7 p.m.Take care, everybody. Watch throughout the evening as this vote gets backunderway and they secure the perimeter of the capitol. Good night.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
