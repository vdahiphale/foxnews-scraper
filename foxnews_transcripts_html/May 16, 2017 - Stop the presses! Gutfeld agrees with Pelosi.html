Every day we are told this is it for the Trump administration. It's over. Pack up the jet. Leave the keys to the White House with Pence. True, Trump makes it pretty easy for his critics. He's a lotion for commotion. What he says out loud makes leaking so easy. But now all the coverage of him is a nonstop shrieking car alarm as Trump defenders fight every battle like it's the last. But maybe everyone should calm down and -- I can't believe I'm going to say this -- listen to Nancy: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF. Again, you're talking about impeachment, you're talking about what are the facts? Not that I don't like him and I don't like his hair. What are the facts? I don't like what he said about this. What are the facts that you would make a case on? What are the rules that he may have violated? If you don't have that case, you're just participating in more hearsay.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

Yes. For more on this, we go to hell. Just as I thought, hell has frozen over. Nancy is right. And by admitting that I now have a rash all over my body. When Nancy is the voice of reason you know things are nuts. But the point is, we need to separate the personality from the policies. When you do, you see Trump's policies are largely benign. It's his behavior that's so brash. And the hate toward him so visceral that every misstep becomes the end. So, will the American public finally grow tired of the coverage before they tire of Trump? Who knows? Because both are exhausting.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So does President Trump talk out of turn? Yes. That's plausible. But then are his words exaggerated by those who can't accept an election result? Yes. That's plausible too. See, the two extremes -- is he nefarious or noble -- are never right. It's always going to be in the middle.
So instead, relax. Everybody relax and take inspiration from the world's greatest movie.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That worked out well.  </pre>
