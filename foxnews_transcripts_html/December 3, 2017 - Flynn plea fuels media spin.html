HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: On "Buzz Media" this Sunday, 
 saturation coverage as Mike Flynn pleads guilty to lying to the FBI. An 
 intense spin on both sides by whether the former national security adviser 
 could point a finger at President Trump.

In the explosion of coverage about Mike Flynn's guilty plea in the Russia 
 investigation, ABC's chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross quoting 
 an unnamed confidant said this about Flynn.

 BRIAN ROSS, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, ABC (voice over): He's 
 prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate Donald Trump 
 ordered him to record him to make contact with the Russians which 
 contradicts all what Donald Trump has said at this point.

 consult with Russia about ISIS.
Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Shelby Holliday, senior video 
 reporter for The Wall Street Journal, here in person; Mollie Hemingway, 
 senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Marie Harf,

Shelby, award winning correspondent Brian Ross says he holds people

SHELBY HOLLIDAY, SENIOR VIDEO REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: It was a major 
 mistake and it moved markets. It created a huge buzz in the media. The 
 tweet was seen, I believe, 25,000 times before it was deleted from ABC. So, 
 yes, it was a big mistake. ABC has apologized.
This has actually given the president something to seize on. It's creating 
 a side show for the president temporarily. But it did not change the 
 direction of the Flynn investigation or the fact that Flynn is the fourth 
 Trump associate to be charged in this Russia investigation.
KURTZ: Well, the Dow dropped 350 points. It wasn't only probably because of 
 this report but President Trump tweeting horrendously and inaccurate and 
 the sounds report congratulating ABC for suspending Brian Ross.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR FOR THE FEDERALIST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: 
 Yes. Brian Ross might be award winning, but he also has been the source of 
 many fake news stories and many false reports. He blamed the Tea Party for 
 the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado which turned out not to be true.

He claimed that Saddam Hussein was behind the anthrax attacks in Washington 
 D.C. shortly after 9/11. He was told that was false. He ran with it.
He has a series of problems here. So, it is not just real damage caused to 
 the markets when you have fake news. It also does real damage to the 
 credibility of the media.

        }
      
KURTZ: Let me interrupt you a second, quick thought on Brian Ross before we go to Molly.
MARIE HARF, FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SPOKESPERSON, FOX NEWS 
 CONTRIBUTOR: This is actually a place I agree with Mollie. I know that is shocking, but 
 Brian Ross has a long history of stories that are really on the edge of believability. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He has sources that I do not think coming from the national security world 
 when I was CIA spokesperson. He routinely ran stories that were not 
 accurate. This was a very big screw-up. I think he has a long history of 
 really screwing up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KURTZ: Well, he also has broken stories that were true. But, we can all 
 agree, I think, Mike Flynn, former national security adviser, pleading 
 guilty in this investigation. This is a very big deal for the press. But 
 there has been a big gap in the interpretation/speculation about what this 
 means or doesn't mean for the president.
HEMINGWAY: Right. And so we frequently see with stories like this, the 
 media will make a huge claim, then we'll see a little bit of backtracking 
 to the point where it might even be meaningless. And there is the cycle 
 that has been repeated.
It is big news that Mike Flynn pled guilty particularly because the FBI had 
 previously said that they weren't even going to prosecute this. They didn't 
 think that he really lied, so much has misremembered. That's a big deal 
 that something happened here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But in general, we have a story that we are supposed to believe that there 
 was treasonous collusion with Russia to steal an election and what we 
 actually get is learning that there was diplomatic ground work being laid 
 by an incoming administration. That's a big difference from what we were 
 promised when this investigation -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KURTZ: But is there a sense of indication for news organizations who have 
 insisted all these months that the Russia investigation was not fake news 
 as the president has repeatedly labeled as well as calling it a witch hunt.

 HARF: Absolutely. And, look, a lot of the reasons the public knows about 
 what Mike Flynn has done is because reporters have broken the story. They 
 broke the news that he had talked with Ambassador Kislyak about sanction. 
 That was The Washington Post.
KURTZ: That was The Washington Post back in February or March. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: Exactly. So, a lot of these stories, every time they come out, the 
 Trump White House says these are fake news. This vindicates a lot of that. 
 And I think it is fair for experts and commentators in the media to be 
 analyzing the Flynn guilty plea and what that might means for President 
 Trump -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KURTZ: Yes, right.
HARF: -- and for the investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HEMINGWAY: I have to disagree here. I think what it shows is that the media 
 had been too frequently willful vessel of an intelligence apparatus. That 
 was an illegal leak about Mike Flynn. He was doing something completely 
 legal. Having a completely good conversation --
HARF: Well -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HEMINGWAY: He lied to the FBI. That was the story. Lying to the FBI was not 
 legal. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: And I am not sure he was doing something completely appropriate in 
 that conversation.
HEMINGWAY: This is a big part of the of the story, is whether the 
 intelligence apparatus under the Obama administration was doing things 
 properly or not. In fact, they have been doing thing very improperly and 
 that continues. That story that the media have not done a good job covering 
 in part because they are just willfully receiving these leaks without 
 thinking critically about what they signify.
HOLLIDAY: Here is the thing with Mike Flynn. I think some -- I don't even 
 want to say liberals and conservatives. Some Trump haters have acted like 
 Flynn guilty plea, boom, investigation is over.

 reporting which is the president feels sorry for Mike Flynn and know he is 
 in trouble.
They think that what he is accused of doing, not the lying part, that in of 
 itself having contact during transition with Russia when they are trying to 
 fill out new foreign policy, that there is nothing wrong with that in 
 itself.

KURTZ: Flynn lies to the FBI. His life is destroyed. Not crooked Hillary 
 because of rigged system. Double standard. Critics say we focus too much on 
 presidential tweets. But how do you not report when he's again bringing up 
 his defeated opponent?
HEMINGWAY: Well, not just that, but the substance of what he is saying is 
 also worth covering. We have an FBI that let go their chief investigator on 
 this Russia probe because he was proven to be biased. He was tweeting out 
 insults or tweeting out hatred towards Trump.
He was also the chief investigator on the Hillary Clinton email probe. We 
 know that she broke the law. We know she obstructed justice, and she got 
 away with it. Everyone around her was granted immunity.
So the FBI's credibility really is in play here. Mike Flynn has said during 
 the campaign, he would go to jail if he did one-tenth of what Hillary Clinton 
 did. And that looks like it might be true. That speaks the FBI credibility.

 investigators have been asking for months what happened there.
(CROSSTALK)
HEMINGWAY: They stonewalled and obstructed what actually happened there. 
 They weren't telling House investigators.

        }
      
KURTZ: Right.
HEMINGWAY: And in fact, they leaked this to the media, which suggests they 
 are not being very good about their congressional oversight.
KURTZ: Other administrations have reached out to foreign governments during 
 transition periods.
HARF: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
KURTZ: So this would have to be connected to other dots. Otherwise, it's a 
 simple perjury plea.
HARF: Exactly. They're not going to let him plead guilty here without him 
 giving them something. I think most legal analysts agree on that. This is 
 not normal behavior. I was in the administration. We put the sanctions on 
 Russia in December over their election interference.
And if Mike Flynn -- I know you want to get in here, Mollie, let me finish. 
 If Mike Flynn reached out to the Russians about those sanctions on election 
 hacking --
KURTZ: Which the White House denies. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HOLLIDAY: Which is true, now we know.
HARF: Which is true, now we know. Then, that is a problem. And it may not 
 be criminal, but any other administration that did that, you would be 
 furious.
HEMINGWAY: This is not the way to look at the problem though. You have the 
 media willfully receiving this opposition research campaign talking point 
 that Russia interfered with the election with the help of the incoming 
 Trump administration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the intelligence apparatus was part of that. Even imposing sanctions 
 can be part of that. To hype this claim of Russian interference. Our 
 media are not able to think like take a step back and think a little bit 
 critically about what they are seeing. They are just too willing to accept 
 what Obama era --
HARF: The media will always report significant intelligence.
KURTZ: I got a job in here. I did want to mention New York Times report 
 that President Trump had called the Republican leaders. Some of them are on 
 the record. He asked them to shut down or wrap up their probe because that 
 is rather unusual.
All right. So, Matt Lauer, we are going to talk later about he was fired by 
 NBC for allegations of sexual misconduct.
The president on the Twitter talking about, wow, Lauer was fired for 
 inappropriate sexual workplace behavior, but when will top executives at 
 NBC and Comcast be fired for putting out fake news. Check out Andy Lack's 
 past.
Andy Lack is the president and the chairman, excuse me, of NBC News. Trump 
 taking a shot at him without explaining.
HOLLIDAY: This shows you have personal -- the media -- his --Trump's 
 relationship with the media, it is for the president -- the president also 
 spent this week tweeting about TIME asking him to be the cover man of the 
 year. He called for a ban on CNN. He trashed "Morning Joe" ratings. He 
 actually called NBC fake news practitioners. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The entire week, most of his tweets have been about the media and slamming 
 the media. So, not talking -- not The Wall Street Journal.
HEMINGWAY: He is going after former colleagues. He used to be at one of 
 these -- at these outlets. But that's also that --
KURTZ: Well, he did ‘The Apprentice’ for 14 years at NBC.
HEMINGWAY: Right. I think -- I think he feels a really certain level of 
 hypocrisy on how they covered his "Access Hollywood" tape all while like 
 now we find out that there were many dense of inequities throughout the 
 media establishment that was covering him. I think he likes to highlight 
 that hypocrisy.
KURTZ: It is interesting. You feel like not only he does have this sort of 
 resentment at NBC from having worked there, and now feels the NBC is one of 
 the most critical networks against him, but you feel he is suggesting, 
 implying that there is a double standard on allegations against him in the 
 sexual arena. But on the other hand, NBC fired Matt Lauer pretty quickly.
HARF: Donald Trump became president. He should not be tweeting about 
 allegations of sexual misconduct. I'm sorry. I just think -- talk about 
 hypocrisy.
KURTZ: You think he should just stay silent? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: On this issue? Absolutely.
KURTZ: All right. Let me put up this one other tweet related to Lauer from 
 the President of the United States. "So now that Matt Lauer is gone, when 
 will the fake news practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil 
 Griffin?" He is the president of MSNBC. "And will they terminate low 
 ratings Joe Scarborough based on the "unsolved mystery" that took place in 
 Florida years ago? Investigate!"
You want to explain that?
HOLLIDAY: Well, I'll try. He's calling for an investigation of something 
 that actually we do have the facts on. It is an unfortunate situation. 
 There was a woman working in Joe Scarborough's office. She had a heart 
 condition. She fell. She hit her head. She passed away.
KURTZ: Yes.
HOLLIDAY: Trump is spinning this unsolved mystery and suggesting in some 
 way that Joe Scarborough murdered this young woman.
KURTZ: He is suggesting that. But it was investigated. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HOLLIDAY: Well, he's calling for an investigation. It is not a mystery.
KURTZ: This is 2001 when Joe Scarborough was a congressman. It was in 
 investigated. It was natural causes. Mika Brzezinski, his partner, said the 
 president crossed another deeply disturbing line in advancing a false 
 conspiracy theory to intimidate the press. I was surprised he went there.
HEMINGWAY: Yes. That is exactly right. we have a responsibility as 
 Americans not to be passing on fake news. If you are the president, that is 
 even more incumbent upon you, to check your facts. And also think about 
 whether you are adding heat or light to a conversation. He did not do that 
 to this case.
You know, it's sad because it kind of works. We just talked about the 
 conspiracy theory.
KURTZ: Yes. Right. It was out there even though it is total lying stories.
HOLLIDAY: It seems surprising that he tweeted this, but in the scheme of 
 what happened this week, when Kushner was interviewed by Bob Mueller, we 
 knew that --
KURTZ: I understand. We are trying to focus on the media as they say -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HOLLIDAY: Looking back, it makes sense that the president --
KURTZ: Let me get a break. When we come back, a flood of leak stories as 
 the pundits are challenging the president's mental health. Is that insane?
And later, was NBC engaging in damage control when the network fired Matt 
 Lauer?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KURTZ: The top newspapers quoting unnamed sources saying President Trump is 
 privately suggesting that the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape may have 
 been doctored. The pundits are plunging into crazy talk.

 CHRIS HAYES, ALL IN HOST, MSNBC: The president of the United States

INGRAHAM: Questioning President Trump's mental fitness for office is 
 becoming a vicious relentless obsession of the left.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Mollie Hemingway, this is based on reports in The New York Times and 
 Washington Post also saying that privately, president still questions 
 Barack Obama's birth certificate. And then you have Washington Post, Trump 
 simply rejects back as he spins a new reality. What do you make of this 
 sort of intensified media chatter?
HEMINGWAY: Right. It does almost like a sick cycle to this. We heard this 
 in January and we heard it again a few months later. It seems to be part of 
 the campaign to undermine the president as opposed to well-reasoned 
 analysis. These are frequently --
KURTZ: Based on leaks by the way. Somebody is telling reporters this.
HEMINGWAY: Right. Well, it is a campaign based on anonymous leaks. So it is 
 very difficult to determine how much to take seriously this conversation. 
 But, in general, it's people who haven't accepted the reality of Donald 
 Trump winning the election who are making this claim. Nobody should be 
 really be evaluation other people's mental health, particularly not people 
 who are still struggling to accept reality a year after it happened.
KURTZ: Well, I agree that some of this goes too far. But on the other hand, 
 if the president is saying things privately that contradict, for example, 
 everybody know it's his voice.

        }
      
HARF: Right.
KURTZ: He apologized for the "Access Hollywood" tape. Billy Bush got fired, 
 said it was him. So, what do you make of the commentary part of this?
HARF: So I think these are some fair questions to ask, particularly if it 
 is about something like if he is fully aware or coming to grips with how 
 serious the Russia investigation is. Things like that.
The question of if he really understands the severity of things. It needs 
 to be done very carefully though because it is a very sensitive issue. We 
 can't evaluate someone's mental health from far away on television.
KURTZ: That hasn't stopped a lot of people.
HARF: Well, that hasn't stopped people. But it is a fair -- I think there 
 are fair questions to ask. How the president sees what is happening in this 
 country. How he sees policy issue? How he looks at certain things? That is 
 fair, but it needs to be done very carefully.
KURTZ: One of those is questioning the media's coverage on this very point 
 of Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Let us take a look at that and also 
 what he had to say as presidential candidate Lindsey Graham in 2016.

 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: You know, what concerns me about 
 the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as 
 some kind of kook, not fit to be president. He did win, by the way.
I am not going to try to get into the mind of Donald Trump because I don't 
 thin there is a whole lot of space there. I think he's a kook. I think he's 
 crazy. I think he's unfit for office.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Shelby?
HOLLIDAY: I think those back-to-back clips just say it all. I think 
 generally, there is a lot of hypocrisy not just in the media, but on 
 Capitol Hill. People have questioned Donald Trump's mental state since the 
 beginning of the campaign.
I don't necessarily think it is productive. We know that Donald Trump likes 
 to crack his own narratives, cracks his own reality, tries to convince 
 other people that what he said is true even if it is not.
But we also know Donald Trump likes to joke around. It is hard -- I think 
 the big nugget of this story is the leaks. Are the people inside of the 
 White House leaking this information because they are genuinely worried 
 about his mental state?

KURTZ: Yes --
HOLLIDAY: Or is he just joking around --
KURTZ: -- for their own agendas and also --
HOLLIDAY: Not that those jokes would be appropriate, but it's hard to know.
KURTZ: Right. The president also takes a lot of it, for re-tweeting his 
 anti-Muslim videos from a British far-right party that upset Prime Minister 
 Theresa May. We will have to stop talking at this point, Marie Harf, Mollie 
 Hemingway. Shelby, we will see you a little later.
HOLLIDAY: OK.
KURTZ: Thanks for joining us this Sunday. Ahead, Matt Lauer apologizes as 
 stunning details emerge of sexual misconduct by the former "Today" show 
 star. But up next, harassment on the Hill. John Conyers losing democratic 
 support as one of his accusers goes before the cameras.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KURTZ: Very few liberal pundits or democratic polls have been pushing for 
 the resignation of John Conyers, the 88-year-old dean of the House despite 
 multiple accusations of sexual harassment. But then his former deputy chief 
 of staff, Marion Brown, went on the "Today" show.
(START VIDEO CLIP)
MARION BROWN, ACCUSER OF JOHN CONYER: It was sexual harassment, violating -
 - violating my body. Propositioning me, inviting me to hotels with the guys 
 discussing business. And propositioning me to, you know, for sex. He has 
 touched me in different ways, and it was very uncomfortable and very 
 unprofessional.

KURTZ: Within hours, the House democratic leader dropped her support for 
 her embattled colleague.

 NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF 
 REPRESENTATIVES: I pray for Congressman Conyers and his family and wish him 
 well. However, Congressman Conyers should resign.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Joining us now, Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent 
 for The Washington Examiner. So, how important was Marion Brown? She is the 
 one who got this previously secret $27,000 settlement of a sue with 
 taxpayer money. How important was it for her to go on the "Today" show and 
 then suddenly we see Nancy Pelosi changed her position?
SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I think that's part of the reason that Pelosi changed her story, but I think the real reason behind it was that this was Washington politics colliding with the national outcry and demand for us to deal with sexual harassment issues.
What Pelosi called for initially which was that's waited out to see what the ethic committee does, that probably would have worked a couple of years ago.
KURTZ: Right.
FERRECHIO: But things are different now. So it was pushed forward of course by Marion Brown and her very compelling story that she told to few media outlets.
KURTZ: Right. And you can see her on television as opposed to print. I always think that that can be a game changer.
FERRECHIO: We found it credible. We did.
KURTZ: Yes. Do you think the media has been as aggressive with John Conyers as they have been? Let's say with the allegations against Roy Moore, especially given the fact that he has been around forever. He is the co-founder of Black Caucus and so forth.
FERRECHIO: Oh, yes. On Capitol Hill, they were really chasing down Democrats to try to find out why there is this different standard between what goes on in private sector where people getting fired immediately or in the media where we saw big media people go down fairly quickly.
KURTZ: Yes.
FERRECHIO: But on Capitol Hill, they stick around. And they, you know, takes a while or gets referred to the ethics committee. We got several cases turning around right now. There has been no immediate exodus of those who are accused. And I think the press has done a really good job pointing out that there is a different standard.
KURTZ: OK. And now we also, speaking of standards, have Democratic Senator Al Franken, who has now half a dozen accusers. One woman says he groped her breasts during a photo op. Another accusation is like that. Another says he aggressively gave her a wet kiss. He certainly is drawing critical coverage. But do you think the press has been a little more restrained with the former SNL star?
FERRECHIO: I think the press is paying attention to the different levels of accusations here. The Detroit news has a great story that parses out the difference between why Al Franken and why not John Conyers being allowed to stick around in congress. You know, he is being accused of groping. Certainly, this is terrible.
KURTZ: Right. I am not going to defend him for a second.
FERRECHIO: Of course not. Now, Conyers is a different thing though, because this is a pattern of harassment.
KURTZ: Right.
FERRECHIO: You had one thing that Marion Brown said I thought was really compelling is that she believes that he enjoyed creating a really negative atmosphere for women in his office. And that this was long-term pattern.
KURTZ: Just briefly, the media are making those distinctions, but people who support John Conyers may see a racial aspect here as compared to Franken?
FERRECHIO: Yes. They were talking about that last week about, you know, who is accusing Conyers and also hat he is being asked to leave and Franken is not being asked to leave. You know, I don't think that argument works as well in this case, but there are other people being accused right now, Blake Farenthold of Texas.
KURTZ: Right.
FERRECHIO: Let's see how quickly he is forced out. I suspect it won't be long.
KURTZ: All right. Susan Ferrechio, thanks very much for coming by this Sunday. Ahead on "Media Buzz," a conservative actress peddles false charges about Roy Moore to The Washington Post and gets busted. But first, is MSNBC telling the full story about Matt Lauer and sexual harassment at the "Today" show?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Matt Lauer is the face of NBC News and has been a franchise player for two decades. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MATT LAUER, HOST, NBC NEWS: You have said I understand to some close friends that this is the last great battle and that one side or the other is going down here. 
HILLARY CLINTON., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: Savannah Guthrie and the "Today" show team looked stunned as they 
 reported the news that NBC had fired their colleague for sexual misconduct. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, TODAY SHOW HOST, NBC NEWS: And we are grappling with a 
 dilemma that so many people have faith in these past few weeks. How do you 
 reconcile your love for someone with the revelation they have behaved 
 badly. 
AL ROKER, TODAY SHOW HOST, NBC NEWS: Yes, we are still dealing with the 
 news of a friend of 30 years and we're all trying to process it. I will 
 deal with it and along with you folks as well. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: And some past "Today Show" skits looking rather creepy in 
 retrospect. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAUER: Drink it in, ladies. 
JENNA BUSH, NBC CO-HOST: Again, Matt, really? It's the third time this week.
TAMRON HALL, FORMER NBC CO-HOST: Did your mommy give you that?
NBC CO-HOST: Stop it. You're making me lactate.
LAUER: Get it while it lasts.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
KURTZ: After Lauer was ousted Variety reported that Lauer gave one woman a sex toy with an explicit note and exposed himself to another woman scolding her when she did not respond. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RAMIN SETOODEH, NEW YORK BUEAU CHIEF, VARIETY: Our sources say it wasn't 
 even considered a secret. It was known my many employees at the "Today 
 Show." 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: And the New York Times reporting that Lauer pressured an unnamed 
 NBC staffer having sex with him in his office back in 2001 and that she 
 passed out with Lauer's assistant taking her to a nurse. Joining us now 
 from New York, Lynn Sherrer, former correspondent for ABC News who once 
 dealt with sexual harassment complaints and in Los Angeles, Matt Belloni, 
 editor of "The Hollywood Reporter." 
Matt Belloni, NBC News chairman Andy Lack shoved Lauer out the door rather 
 quickly, said very little about what actually happened. Was the network 
 trying to control the narrative before the "New York Times" and "Variety" 
 came out with a devastating details of alleged sexual assault and 
 harassment by Lauer?
MATT BELLONI, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: Well, it depends 
 on who you believe at this point. NBC is adamant saying that on Monday 
 night they got word of an accuser and that is what prompted the swift 
 action. Now, in media circles a number of outlets have been looking into 
 Lauer's behavior over the last, you know, two months. So, it's hard to 
 believe they didn't know this was out there. 
But, you know, they claim that it wasn't until they were presented with a 
 hard evidence accuser coming forward they were able to go to Lauer and say 
 hey, is there truth here and then they acted . 
KURTZ: Right. I'm going to contradict that in just a moment. First, let me 
 put up Matt Lauer's statement of apology, there are no words to express my 
 sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. 
 To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. Some of what is being said 
 about me is untrue or mischaracterized but there is enough truth in these 
 stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.
And Lynn Sherrer, we saw Savannah Guthrie and other Matt friends and 
 colleagues saying how heartbroken they were and they had no idea about 
 this. Jeff Zucker, a friend of Lauer's for 25 years, once produced the 
 "Today" show who became the president of NBC said I didn't know this Matt. 
 Your thoughts about that. 
LYNN SHERRER, FORMER CORRESPONDET, ABC NEWS: You know, there is no doubt 
 that this kind of upheaval is very, very painful and I sympathize with 
 that. But Howie, the real shock is that they didn't know. The real shock is 
 that they didn't expose him sooner. This is a man who was treating the 
 workplace like a brothel and it was known. 
There were people out there who knew things were going on. I heard the buzz 
 for a long time just as I heard it about Charlie Rose before he was outed, 
 just as I've heard it about so many other people. And I think the shock is 
 that they didn't know sooner. Really, it's a news organization. 
KURTZ: Right. Look, this happened at Fox with Roger Ailes. This happened 
 at CBS with Charlie Rose. Many people said they didn't know. I think 
 everybody knew, but coming back to the point we were discussing Matt 
 Belloni, I had said look, NBC at least knew for weeks based on my reporting 
 that the news organizations were pursuing these allegations instead acting 
 all shocked to hear about this complaint just this past Monday night. 
Now, the New York Times reporting that NBC News president, Noah 
 Oppenheimer told staffers that he and Chairman Andy Lack repeatedly asked 
 Lauer for weeks about whether he engaged in inappropriate conduct with 
 staffers and Lauer denied it. That's kind of at odds with the original 
 statements.
BELLONI: A little bit yes. I mean, they are saying that you know, it 
 depends on what they ask because when you hear that somebody is reporting 
 around a star like Matt Lauer you might say to him, hey, what's going on 
 here? Is there something we should know about? And if he dismisses it maybe 
 you give your $20 million a year star the benefit of the doubt. But I think 
 the difference that they are saying is that they were presented on Monday 
 with hard evidence from an actual accuser not buzz in media circles.
KURTZ: Right.
BELLONI: And that maybe a key distinction.
KURTZ: Well, interesting point -- go ahead Lynn.
SHERRER: But it wouldn't have been just buzz in media circles if somebody 
 had set up an atmosphere where these women could have come forward sooner. 
 I really think that's part of what we're dealing with here. You need to be 
 proactive in these cases. The pain that these women have gone through. 
And you know, by the way, Howie, I worked for a guy, Ed Joyce at Channel 2 
 News WCBS TV in New York who had one of those buttons that shut the door. 
 It didn't lock it. It shut it. It's the creepiest thing in the world. And 
 this is about power and privilege. The bar you're (INAUDIBLE) works here.
KURTZ: Yes, and especially with a $25 million a year anchor as opposed to 
 maybe some mid-level staffer, but Lynn, this business of open secrets, so 
 Mika Brzezinski said on the air she had heard all these rumors about Matt 
 Lauer. She was sort of scolding herself for not doing more, but Joe 
 Scarborough said, well, that was just about philandering not something far 
 worse, you know, you've been in positions -- ABC Marc Halperin, where you 
 hear things or you things after the fact? 
SHERRER: Absolutely. And there is a difference. The point here is not to 
 say there will never be romance and sex in the workplace I mean unless like 
 the vice president that you're going to or a married man always has his 
 wife with him, of course things are going to happen. It's ridiculous to 
 pretend it won't.
The difference is what's appropriate, what's inappropriate and what's 
 repeated and what is not reciprocated. Reciprocal is a very big word here 
 and you know, Howie, the law hasn't changed much. Sexual harassment has 
 been against the law since the 1970s. The only thing that's changed is our 
 willingness to tolerate this behavior. 
KURTZ: Yes. I guess that's why you wrote a piece that was titled "All Men 
 Are Not Pigs" and all men are not guilty of sexual assault but certainly 
 we've seen a lot of high profile cases now. And Matt Belloni, last point 
 here. We now have had two of the three network morning shows fire their 
 star anchors for sexual misconduct. 
Jonah Goldberg had an interesting piece in the National Review saying 
 when this all happened at Fox, the reaction of much in the mainstream media 
 was it's all about the Fox culture, Fox is terrible. And now that it's 
 happened at ABC, CBS, NBC and elsewhere, it's being described as a societal 
 problem or male problem. Do you think there is some validity on it? 
BELLONI: Perhaps, but I think the culture itself has changed over the past 
 few months in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and so many other 
 scandals and so many different industries. I mean, this is a complete re-
 alignment of the morning news programs. But it's coming at a time when 
 there is upheaval everywhere. 
Fox News was out on its own, and let's be honest, there was a culture that 
 Roger Ailes created that permeated a lot and no one is saying that Andy 
 Lack at NBC is perpetuating some kind of a culture there. 
KURTZ: Wait a second, let me just get Lynn on this last point. I mean, 
 couldn't it be said that NBC did have a culture of looking the other way or 
 tolerance given what went on over two decades.
SHERRER: And Howie, not just NBC. As you know, I worked at ABC News for a 
 lon time. I worked at the Associated Press. I've worked at a few places. 
 The number of e-mails I have gotten over the past few weeks from women 
 saying, oh, imagine the sigh of relief that some of the guys we worked with 
 are having now that they are retired. 
KURTZ: Fascinating point. Let me just quickly mention that other media 
 icons falling, Minnesota Public Radio firing Garrison Keillor, a radio 
 legend over what he says was just touching a woman's back and ended up 
 touching her bare skin. He apologized for that. 
And entertainment mogul Russell Simmons after a piece, Matt Belloni, in the 
 "Hollywood Reporter" by screen writer Jenny Lumet saying he raped her in 
 1991, stepping down from his companies. Thanks a lot. Great to see you 
 both. Appreciate it.
BELLONI: Thank you.
SHERRER: Thanks Howie
KURTZ: Coming up, how the Washington Post exposed a scam involving 
 utterly false charges of rape and abortion against Roy Moore. And later, 
 the mainstream media still fighting the Trump tax cut.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KURTZ: The Washington Post was approached by a woman named Jamie Phillips 
 who made inflammatory charges against Roy Moore saying the Alabama senate 
 candidate impregnated her when she was 15 and drove her to have an 
 abortion. But the paper started digging and suspected it was sting 
 especially after seeing a GoFundMe page and Ms. Phillips talked about 
 taking a new job. Post reporter Stephanie McCrummen confronted her.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STEPHANIE MCCRUMMEN, WASHINTON POST REPORTER: It says that you're moving 
 to New York and that you've accepted a job to work in the conservative 
 media movement to combat the lies and deceit of the liberal MSN.
JAMIE PHILLIPS, ROY MOORE'S ACCUSER: I was looking to take a job last 
 summer in New York but it fell through.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: That wasn't true. A Post reporter later saw Phillips going into the 
 offices of Project Veritas run by conservative activist James O'Keefe who 
 specializes in stings designed to embarrass mainstream news outlets.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES O' KEEFE, PRESIDDENT, PROJECT VERITAS: I have to run to this meeting 
 right now.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Did Jamie Phillips work for Project Veritas? Did 
 you guys send her to speak to -- pose as a victim of Roy Moore to the 
 Washington Post?
KEEFE: I'm 14 minutes late.
(END OF VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: They did later speak. Joining us now from New York, Noah Rothman, 
 associate editor of "Commentary" magazine. So, how did the "Washington 
 Post" in your view handle these explosive and fake allegations from an 
 undercover conservative activist who is trying to trap the "Post" reporters 
 into saying incriminating things about Roy Moore that could be captured on 
 videotape?
NOAH ROTHMAN, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, COMMENTARY: They handled it very well. 
 They have been transparent about the process that they used to uncover this 
 individual. It's kind of a sloppy operation to begin with but they 
 demonstrated how they uncovered her identity and how they pursued this 
 story and had a bunch of other reporters on and not just the interviewer 
 but a variety of other print reporters. 
And then when Mr. O'Keefe is exposed, he put out these videos of other 
 Post reporters in candid settings describing being very professional, not 
 getting ahead of the Russia investigation for example and being a little 
 critical of their editorials side for being overly critical of the 
 president. If this was an attempt to show bias on the part of the 
 "Washington Post," it backfired spectacularly. 
KURTZ: Yes. Let me just mention that because he thought it was a great got 
 you. National Security reporter Dan Lamothe said the news side is trying to 
 critically call bull when there is some bull of only Donald Trump and also 
 give him credit when there is credit, which sounds like a good approach to 
 me. 
You say that James O'Keefe, controversial guy, he's got one criminal 
 conviction for this sort of thing, based this whole undercover sting on an 
 assumption -- you call it an ignorant assumption of how the mainstream 
 media work and whether a paper like "The Post" would rush into print with 
 this half-baked allegation. 
ROTHMAN: Yes. I can only imagine that the assumption of ignorance and 
 malice on the part of Mr. O'Keefe and his colleagues drove them to send 
 this compromised actress to play a role for which they advertised online to 
 a bunch of professional back-checkers and assumed that it would get 
 through. You can only assume that that would work based on your notion that 
 these people are acting in very bad faith. 
Similarly, these face saving efforts, these videos of "The Post" reporters 
 undercover were only on the assumption of ignorance in the part of the 
 audience because an audience might not know that reporters and editorial 
 side of a newspaper have a kind of a conflicting relationship at times. 
And it's sort of your job to explain to an audience that there's a 
 distinction between a reporters and an editorial side of a newspaper. 
KURTZ: Yes. I know a lot of people is skeptical about that but I can tell 
 you that that is true. Now, this was an effort obviously to use lies and 
 deception. Jamie Phillips had a phony name, phony job, trying to really 
 help the Moore campaign if it had been successful. And it was originally 
 off the record but executive editor of the Post, Marty Baron said, you 
 know, if you lie to us, if you deceive, then the off-the-record agreement 
 goes out the window.
You wrote something in"Commentary that really caught my eye. You said 
 that tragically, conservative media activists are becoming the debased 
 partisan creatures they once resolve to combat. What did you mean?
ROTHMAN: It was the assumption on the part of many who got into this 
 business including myself, that your effort is to make -- create a more 
 literate media consuming audience, an audience of media consumers who 
 cannot be fooled by omissions and bias on the part of mainstream outlets. 
When activists operate like Mr. O'Keefe did in a way to exploit ignorance, 
 not educating the audience about what the difference is between editorial 
 side or reporting side. When you are actively trying to court that 
 ignorance in order to advance an agenda, you become the partisan creature 
 you once resolved to combat and that's corrupt. 
KURTZ: And you're saying this obviously as a conservative. And look, I'm 
 not saying that it made it through media arm bias or that the coverage is 
 always fair or perfect or not sensationalized, but in this case the "Post" 
 did the right thing, looked into it and found out that it just wasn't true. 
Noah Rothman, thanks very much for joining us from New York this morning. 
 Great to see you. 
ROTHMAN: Thank you.
KURTZ: Appreciate it. After the break, a big victory for the Republicans 
 as the Senate passes a huge tax cut bill and the president accuses the "New 
 York Times" of out and out lobbying against it. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is going to cost me a 
 fortune this thing, believe me. This is not good for me.
CHUCK TODD, HOST, MSNBC MTP DAILY: No matter how you slice this thing, the 
 GOP tax plan is going to be a big boom for the wealthy and specifically the 
 Trump family.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: As the Senate was moving toward passing that major tax cut, a big 
 victory for the president -- Donald Trump tweeted this, "The failing New 
 York Times, the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual 
 lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill." And we're back 
 with the "Wall Street Journal" Shelby Holliday. 
So, a 51-49 vote, passed at 2:00 in the morning, which is one of the 
 reasons it's been kind of overshadowed, but "New York Times" and 
 "Washington Post," I mean a whole bunch of news stories say this tax cut is 
 tilted towards the wealthy and corporations. Some middle class families 
 will pay more. Do you see that as reporting based on experts and CBO or is 
 there an underlying feeling of opposition to the contours of this bill? 
SHELBY HOLLIDAY, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNBAL: Well, reporting is 
 obviously different from editorial boards but the editorial board at the 
 New York Times did oppose this tax bill and has a matter of fact tweeted 
 out the numbers of senators so people could call them and oppose the tax 
 bill. 
KURTZ: Right. And that's what prompted the president's tweet, let me just 
 jump in --
HOLLIDAY: Exactly.
KURTZ: -- because editorial, you know, it's the opinion side. They can 
 oppose the tax bill all they want. But basically coming -- suggesting call 
 your senator, you know, they take positions on everything but it's a little 
 unseemly isn't it?
HOLLIDAY: And this happened too before there was a final bill before this 
 mad dash to pass it. And now the bills have to be reconciled. So it is a 
 little too early to say how exactly this stands out.
KURTZ: With conference committes…, but talk about the news 
 coverage because here has been -- I've read every one of these stories, a 
 pretty steady drum beat that this either doesn't help the middle class or 
 increase taxes on some middle class people, which is at odds with the 
 administration's argument that --
HOLLIDAY: That it does. 
KURTZ: -- that it does. 
HOLLIDAY: Right. And I do think there is an argument to say that it does 
 help the middle class. But it also helps wealthier Americans. There was 
 favorable treatment of pass through taxes that usually benefits wealthier 
 Americans --
KURTZ: And small business owners.
HOLLIDAY: Corporations, yes. So, there are a number of arguments to be 
 made and again, it's too early. We don't have the final bill reconciled by 
 both the House and Senate. 
KURTZ: The problem is nobody has the bill. 500-page bill until a few 
 hours before the Senate voted, but is the reporting on, you know, 
 legitimate reporting of raising questions about who benefits and who 
 doesn't, which always happens with this big messy tax bills, as if 
 imbalanced by a look at what the positive economic impact might be of 
 cutting taxes for individuals and for big companies? 
HOLLIDAY: There is not much positive news coverage, but that tends to be 
 the case with huge bills. We saw this with health care as well. There was a 
 lot of negative coverage, a lot of discussing how things would be changed 
 negatively. I mean of course people reading news want to know how these 
 bills impact to them. 
I would say Wall Street Journal has covered it fairly. People should read 
 mu colleague's article but back to the editorial board page, this did cause 
 a lot of uproar because -- and I'll also give both sides. It's up to the 
 viewer to decide if it was appropriate. But when the "New York Times" 
 started tweeting out the phone numbers of senators, a lot of people said 
 hey, that you're moving into the realm of activism and to the realm of 
 lobbying. 
As the president noted, they're effectively lobbying people to oppose the 
 bill, and that's different from what most of editorial boards do. The 
 editorial board did say the job of the editorial board is to advocate for 
 policies we agree with and against proposals we don't. 
KURTZ: Right.
HOLLIDAY: The "Times" also said they were trying out this new type if 
 social media and that is what a lot of companies are doing these days. 
KURTZ: Right. I do think it's fair to raise questions about how this adds 
 a $1 trillion to the debt. It wasn't as much focused on that during the 
 Obama administration which doubled the nation's debt. And too much focus on 
 whether this helps Donald Trump. He's a rich businessman. If he cut taxes, 
 he's going to benefit. I don't think that's the main point. Shelby 
 Holliday, great to see you. Thanks for coming down --
HOLLIDAY: Thanks for having me. Super fun to be here. 
KURTZ: Glad you feel that way. Still to come, Sean Hannity makes the cover 
 of the "New York Times" magazine but not exactly in the way he wanted. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KURTZ: Sean Hannity is on the cover of today's "New York Times" magazine, 
 which is kind of amazing, but well, he was less than pleased with the cover 
 shot after a 3-hour photo shoot. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, HOST, FOX NEWS HANNITY: Here is what the New York Times 
 magazine chose as a profile cover of me. How far will Sean Hannity go? It 
 doesn't end there. Look at that. I mean, could you pick a worse picture? At 
 the very top of the article's online version, here are three of the images. 
 They all suck. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KURTZ: I actually thought the article was pretty fair, but come on, look 
 at that. Those unflattering photos give ammunition to those who say a left-
 leaning newspaper wants to create a caricature of a Fox News conservative. 
I think it works for me. Maybe Hannity can pull it off. That's it for this 
 edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. Thanks for watching. We 
 appreciate it. I hope you like our Facebook page. I post my daily columns 
 every week, original videos that we make. I try to respond to your 
 comments. Try to do the same thing on @HowardKurtz on Twitter. I you want 
 to write to us, mediabuzz@foxnews.com. We keep the conversation going. 
We like to hear from you even to those of you who kind of raise your 
 voices. And don't forget, we are back here next Sunday, 11:00 eastern. See 
 you then with the latest buzz.
