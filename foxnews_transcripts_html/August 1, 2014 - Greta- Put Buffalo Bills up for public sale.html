'Off the Record,' 8/1/14: Instead of a billionaire buying the Buffalo Bills, why not let the public have a chance to own a piece of the NFL team?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Have you heard? The Buffalo Bills are for sale. Yes, I know, Donald Trump has a bid in. But rather than selling the Bills to Donald Trump or some other billionaire, how about selling it to the fans?
Give them a chance to match a Trump offer. Just put the Buffalo Bills on eBay or something. Then, you can be an owner, you can buy a share. Won't cause you much, and you get the fun of bragging you're an owner. It's fun. That's how the Green Bay Packers are owned, owned by a lot and lot and lots of fun. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In fact, our "On the Record" executive producer, Meade Cooper, even she owns a share. And of course, so do I. The cost, up $200 a share. That means though, when I cheer for the Packers, I cheer for my own team, one that I own. Not someone else's team. And I bet if the Buffalo Bills are put up for sale to the public, to the fans, the shares would sell in less than 48 hours. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What do you think about my idea? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
