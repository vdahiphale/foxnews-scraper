Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. This should bother you ... hear me out. The D.C. government recently paid a Chicago consultant firm $89,995 for one day at most -- one day of working an education conference. That's a lot for one day. Why should you care? You don't live here, right?
Keeping listening. The $90,000 was spent on 30-minute keynote speech, three 45-minute parent workshops and books. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Are you ready for this? Many of the speakers, including the keynote speaker, all volunteered. So, none of the $90,000 went to any of them. Someone pocketed a big payday, but it gets worse. The D.C. agency who spent the $90,000 for this one day hired a non-D.C. firm without soliciting bids for the lowest price. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now how did the non-D.C. firm get the cushy contract for one day? Well, one of the D.C. agency's top officials knew the founder of the Chicago firm. It sounds a bit fishy, doesn't it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, you might be sitting there thinking, Tough luck, Greta, that's your local tax money, not mine because I don't live in D.C.. Well, not so fast. The District of Columbia receives about $4.1 billion from you federal taxpayers each year. It's true. That your $4.1 billion that did not go directly to this one day conference, but it probably is the reason D.C. thought they had enough money to squander $90,000 for one day. They are feeling pretty rich, courtesy of your big fat paycheck each year.
Now you get it? Why you should care? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
