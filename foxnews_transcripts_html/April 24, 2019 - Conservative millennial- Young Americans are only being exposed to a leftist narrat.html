TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” There is a war on speech going on in America. You're right to say what you think as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.
On one side is the entire tech establishment and big business, the HR Department down the hall from you, academia; on the other side is Adam Carolla and a few other people. Luckily, Adam Carolla can hold his own. We spoke to him the other day in Los Angeles. We've got that interview after the break. Worth staying for. Very good and interesting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first tonight, put yourself in this position. Imagine being a Democratic presidential candidate right now. It's pretty hard to stand out in the field. There seem to be dozens of Democratic candidates, maybe thousands of them. It's a huge group, but weirdly, they don't disagree on much. They're not allowed to disagree. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Like all fundamentalist religious sects, the Democratic Party does not tolerate dissent. Everyone believes the same things. The Amish have more intellectual diversity than the Democratic field. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So as a Democrat the only way to the nomination is by winning gold in the victimhood Olympics. You've got to convince voters that you have suffered more than anyone else. That's not always easy for some of the candidates.
Cory Booker for example hasn't suffered much at all. He grew up in an all- white neighborhood, the son of two IBM executives. He went to Stanford and then Oxford and then Yale Law School, and yet with a straight face there's Cory Booker telling you all about his triumph over racism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kirsten Gillibrand also came from privilege. She went to Dartmouth. She was literally handed a U.S. Senate seat, just, "Here's a Senate seat." She took it. She doesn't mention any of that now, instead she talks about sexism and the harassment she supposedly faced. You see the point.
In 2019, whining is power. Pete Buttigieg understands that. Buttigieg may be the least oppressed person ever to run for President. Both of his parents were college professors. Buttigieg went to Harvard and then to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. After that, he spent three years at McKinsey, that's where ruling class drones are taught the finer points of sucking up to corporate America. Buttigieg got an A in that class. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Our system has been extremely good to Pete Buttigieg. If he is a victim, then nobody's a victim. The term has no meaning. So how does Pete Buttigieg win his party's victimhood Olympics. Simple -- with the Mike Pence story. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Pence you'll remember was the Governor of Indiana back when Buttigieg became Mayor of South Bend. As Buttigieg has suggested recently, this set the two of them on a collision course. Pete Buttigieg is gay. Pence is a traditional Christian, meaning that he pines for the social structure of the 12th Century and above all, hates gay people passionately.
How much does Pence hate gay people? Watch this explosive exchange from 2015. Pence was asked directly about Pete Buttigieg. You can see the rage in his eyes, the venom that flecks his lips. Mike Pence looks dangerous. Brace yourself for this.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard and we have a great working relationship and I see him as a as a dedicated public servant and a patriot.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Whoa. Could you feel the hate radiating from that man? "Highest personal regard," in other words, "Away from me, sinner. You are filthy and repulsive." "Great working relationship," says Mike Pence. Sure. Among evangelicals, that's well known code for, "Once I establish my theocracy, I will throw you in my dungeon and let you rot for eternity." "Dedicated public servant. Patriots." Oh, please. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Pence might as well have spit in Buttigieg's face and called him a reprobate. It's the same thing. It's gay bashing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Buttigieg responded to attacks like these as you'd expect. He warmly gave Governor Pence an "I love South Bend" t-shirt and joined him on a fitness walk. Buttigieg wrote about the whole thing on Facebook if you want to read the unnerving details sometimes.
To this day, he seems traumatized by his experiences with Mike Pence, Buttigieg recently told the crowd in Austin to quote, "Not judge my state by our former Governor. He accused Mike Pence of social extremism." He called him a cheer leader of the porn star presidency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On CNN, Buttigieg even suggested that God himself disapproves of Mike Pence.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IN, MAYOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My marriage to chasten has made me a better man, and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pence's of the world would understand that if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my Creator.

        }
      
CARLSON: I don't think that was written by consultants at all. Well, you can imagine how Mike Pence responded to an attack like that. When you call out a man as hateful as Mike Pence, what do you get in return? I hate tsunami. And that's exactly what Mike Pence delivered. Watch this.

PENCE: I've known Mayor Pete for many years. We've worked very closely together when I was Governor and I considered him a friend and he knows I don't have a problem with him.

        }
      
CARLSON: Damn those evangelicals. When are they going to learn to love their enemies as the Bible commands? Pete Buttigieg by contrast is an Episcopalian, so he expresses his Christian faith by defending late term abortion and relentlessly attacking people who have been kind to him. It's more effective than talking about the city he leads. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In 2015, South Bend's murder rate was almost the same as Chicago's. Aggravated assaults more than tripled since Buttigieg became mayor. Rapes have nearly doubled. But Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to talk about any of that. He wants to talk about the real victim here -- himself.
Chadwick Moore is a journalist in New York and he joins us tonight. Chadwick, I guess what frustrates me is that Pete Buttigieg is exactly what our system produces at the top end. In other words, he is the greatest success you can be in our society. He went to Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar. He worked at McKinsey and now he's running for President at a young age. How in the world can he be a victim? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CHADWICK MOORE, CONSERVATIVE JOURNALIST: Yes, the way he speaks about -- the way he speaks about the Vice President, you think that the Sultan of Brunei was holding the office. Of course, he won't acknowledge the true enemies of gay people in this world. Unlike the President --
CARLSON: That's a good point. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MOORE: Unlike the present administration, which I might add, as you know, the administration has announced an effort to work to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe. Vice President Pence is behind this. He has stood behind this, and it spearheaded by Ambassador Rick Grenell who has been out of the closet for decades, who has dedicated his entire life to gay rights and Pete Buttigieg has done nothing for gay people except for perhaps marry one of them. After all, he's only been out of the closet for about four years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So it's interesting that as you pointed out, these two had a working relationship for years in South Bend or in Indiana and while not during 2015, 2016, 2017 -- all of those years, Pete Buttigieg never once was offended by Mike Pence. Never has called him a bigot. Never called him a hate monger. And then suddenly in the last two weeks, it's all he can talk about. What could possibly be going on? Oh well its fundraising season.
So he has to push this hate hoax about Mike Pence being a bigot which he does not believe himself. He does not believe that Pence is a bigot. He is not offended by Mike Pence, but he has got to pay his woke penance. He has got to sell himself as being woke and appease himself to journalists and the most unhinged activists on his side. It's really one of the most gross things that politicians do --
CARLSON: Well, it diminishes everybody including the person doing it, so if you want to be President, tell me how you're going to improve my life. Stop whining. Privileged guy, by the way, again, how disgusting is it to watch the most privileged people talk about how they're oppressed. I mean, it's actually stomach-turning to me, but this is the whole game in left- wing politics right now, is it not? You used to be a liberal, you tell me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MOORE: It completely is and I can't believe that they still believe this works. You know, imagine for one second if Pete Buttigieg had said -- you know what, if he stood up and was courageous and said, "Let me be honest about Mike Pence, people are lying to you about him and we just simply have a disagreement." He would stand out as courageous and a free thinker. The same thing that made Donald Trump stand out in 2016. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: Exactly.
MOORE: He went against the grain. But these people do not -- are so out of touch. They don't understand why. They still don't understand why President Trump won, which is why they deluded themselves with the Russia probe and it was one of those reasons. He was honest, a straight talker and people knew they weren't being led astray. They knew he wouldn't say something that he didn't believe in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
With Pete Buttigieg, it's just more of the same. It's incredible that he thinks this is a good idea and just going with the herd. They have learned absolutely nothing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: If he had done that, if he had come out and said, "Look, I disagree with pence on all kinds of things, but I'm from Indiana I know the guy," and I think anyone who's ever met Pence or knows him can vouch whatever you think of Pence, you could despise Pence's views, he is certainly not seething with hate. He is just the opposite. Actually, he is very kind of a gentle, meek character.
If he'd said that, like what would be the downside? He'd probably win the nomination, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MOORE: Well, yes, he could actually. I mean, that's -- I think you're right that he could win the nomination if you had done that, but that's -- they have to invent these villains because the truth especially about this issue, the truth about evangelicals and homosexuality is so boring.
The argument is so boring. It's so tame and so reasonable they have to turn it into something full of fear and sensationalism. You know, the truth being essentially as nine out of ten Christians in this country who are against gay marriage and they would tell you, "No, I think the couple should have the same civil rights." We just don't like the word "marriage" being used because of what our faith says.

CARLSON: But why is it -- why is it Christians though? I mean, Christianity is not the only world's religion, not even the only Abrahamic faiths with these positions on sexual ethics including gay rights. I mean, you have at least two others that have very similar positions, but it's only the Christians who are ever called out on this. Why is that, I wonder?
MOORE: I think, they despise Christianity because America is founded on Christian values. It's a Christian nation. These kind of lefties don't like any kind of religion, but they choose Islam because a friend of their -- the enemy of their friend is their friends, so they'll stand up for the most hateful intolerant -- in places of the world, obviously, not all Muslims, but the most hateful intolerant religion on earth where, you know, every single nation where gays are murdered. There's seven of them. It ain't Indiana Christians who are running those nations.
CARLSON: Of course not.

CARLSON: Well, you just heard Pete Buttigieg competing to become the country's victim in chief, but they don't seem to care quite as much about the millions of people victimized by our wide-open border with Mexico and why would they care? Simply noticing the crisis gets you called a bigot by CNN, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't make the problem any less real. It is real.

Newly released surveillance photos from the border show a Guatemalan migrant and her son being brought across the border by a gang of men with high-powered rifles in tactical gear. Armored men crossing your border used to be called an invasion, it's now the status quo on our border. Nobody cares. Here's another part of the status quo, massive caravans.
A new caravan, this one of about 10,000 people is heading north from Central America tonight. The caravan is expected in Mexico City any day and could grow to as many as 20,000 people or bigger, we don't know. Even Mexico's Interior Minister calls it quote, "The mother of all caravans." We will be following its progress right here on Fox because we cover the news unlike the other channels which distort it.

But even the mother of all caravans doesn't mean that much. Eventually, there will be another even bigger caravan and then another, and another because the word is out. Just bring a child or say you're a child, say you fear for your life and the U.S. government will let you in the country. The odds are you'll never be deported. You will get free education, free food, housing vouchers, free medical care.

Well, California once had the biggest middle class in the United States. People who live there were really proud of that. It was the land of opportunity with the Golden State. Now, sadly in many places, it's a land of garbage, needles and despair. Our ongoing investigation of California's collapse continues.

CARLSON: More tonight on our ongoing look at the sad, but continuous disintegration of the State of California. Last night, we showed you the map of human waste on the streets of San Francisco. Tonight, we have another map for you.
Openthebooks.com has assembled every case of hypodermic needles found on the streets of San Francisco since 2011. Take a look at that. Believe it or not, things can get even worse. In 2018, there were 9,520 reported needles on the street -- that's used needles on the street. The number is more than double the number from 2016 and 33 times as many as were reported in 2011.
San Francisco is literally becoming unlivable by the day, even by the hour. Do California lawmakers care? No, they really don't. Where is Nancy Pelosi in this? She lives in Pacific Heights, right in the middle of San Francisco. You wouldn't know it. She never mentions any of these things.

On Monday, we showed you exclusive footage of downtown Los Angeles. One of our producers shot at it. We were there last week. That part of the city has been transformed into an immense and repulsive homeless encampment.
Karen Hix has been in Los Angeles for a long time. Her family has run a business there for more than a hundred years and they say the city is becoming unlivable. Karen Hix joins us tonight.
Karen, thanks very much for coming on tonight. We're going to put as we speak pictures on the screen, I think that you took from around your business of what it actually looks like, so your family has a business basically in downtown Los Angeles?

KAREN HIX, LIFELONG LOS ANGELES RESIDENT: Yes, it's been in the same location for over 102 years and yes, these are our pictures of what is going on right around our neighborhood.
CARLSON: So we're seeing -- I mean, some of these pictures are almost too disgusting to put on the screen, but we have a number of them of RVs.
HIX: Yes.

HIX: Yes, people are living in them full time. You'll notice there is raw sewage that is coming out. This raw sewage it, ends up in one place, in our gutters, which goes down to our oceans.
It is more than an environmental crisis, it is a health crisis down in this area. I have reached out to our councilperson, Councilman Price. I've reached out to Mayor Garcetti and as of today, you know, they have not contacted me.
CARLSON: Now, we got in contact with you because you copied us on an e- mail to lawmakers in your city. It just happened. I just saw it in the inbox and was so shocked by these pictures and you were nice enough to come on and tell us. What does it say about your lawmakers that they don't even respond to you?
HIX: You know, it's so disheartening to know that we're kind of at the bottom of the totem pole. We have a very good relationship with our senior lead officer in our area and he is the only one, if anything positive does happen, it's only because of him personally. My calls to the city just they go unanswered or it goes from one to the other.

CARLSON: Do they not know? I mean, so Garcetti, your mayor lives there and the city is falling apart and as we are showing again on the screen, raw sewage in the street, I mean what's their explanation for this?
HIX: Well, I would love to hear it, but like I said, they will not contact me and you know, I would love to have a discussion about -- you have invited them here to live on our streets and our sidewalks by disregarding the laws that are actually in place and not letting our law enforcement actually enforce these laws, so now you need to deal with what this has brought. That's what I would love to say to them, but I haven't had the opportunity except right now.
CARLSON: So your family has been there for over a hundred years providing jobs and paying taxes.

CARLSON: You're in for the long haul.
HIX: Absolutely.
CARLSON: You own all of this infrastructure in the middle of Los Angeles and yet you're the one they're ignoring and they're catering to people who aren't even from there who are relieving themselves in the streets. I mean, how insulted do you feel?
HIX: Our voice is not heard extremely and I think when I sent that e-mail, I was at the end of our rope, and angry and hence, talked to you.
CARLSON: Well, you know what, I'm glad you did. You have every reason to be angry and I hope that you will come back with an update on this. If they don't listen to you, let's get louder because this is totally -- this is when civilization collapses and you have every right to be heard by them. So I hope you'll keep in touch with us. Karen HIx, thank you very much.

CARLSON: Well, over in Canada, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may talk a tough game, but is he ready for a war? Yes, it could come to that. For years, Trudeau has bolstered his green credentials by taking household garbage from Canada and just shipping it to the Philippines, and then refusing to take it back when it turned out to be not recyclable.
The Philippines is getting pretty annoyed by this. President Rodrigo Duterte just told Trudeau that he has one week to stop sending garbage to the Philippines or it's war -- literally.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RODRIGO DUTERTE, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES: I'll give a warning to Canada may be next week that they better pull that thing out or I will set sail. We will declare war against them.

CARLSON: OK, this could turn out to be a war -- the great garbage war of 2019. How will it end up? Stephen LeDrew is a former President of the Liberal Party of Canada and he joins us tonight.
Mr. LeDrew, thanks very much for coming on.
STEPHEN LEDREW, PRESIDENT, LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA: Tucker, good to be with you.
CARLSON: So let me just make the obvious point. Justin Trudeau, woke, sensitive Justin Trudeau is sending garbage to the Philippines. How racist is that?
LEDREW: Well, it's not racist at all. I mean, it's out of sight out of mind.
CARLSON: Really?
LEDREW: We send garbage to Michigan all the time. We have for years and years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON: Again racist. Yes.
LEDREW: Well, I don't think that's racist sent to Michigan. Obviously, somebody in the Philippines said when they were receiving it, we will take this garbage. You're going to pay us to take it and they're doing so.
CARLSON: Just to clarify. Just to clarify, in the United States --
LEDREW: Yes.
CARLSON: When we don't like something, we just call it racist. It doesn't have to be actually racist, but that's just so you know how we talk now. So it's just -- that's racist, it means, I don't like it.
LEDREW: Well, Tucker. Okay, but Tucker, we aren't worried at all about war because we live next to you. I'm certain that President Trump is going to help us out if they declare war on us and we have an early warning system. It's going to be a long time to get those ships from the Philippines to the West Coast. It may bypass the West Coast in LA.
CARLSON: I wouldn't be so cocky -- I wouldn't be so cocky. Hold on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEDREW: I'm not cocky.
CARLSON: No, the Philippines first of all has a population -- they're actually -- the population of military-aged men in the Philippines is equal to the entire population of Canada. Canada is 22 percent French. You know what percent French the Philippines is? Zero.
LEDREW: Zero.
CARLSON: Huge zero, right, that's a massive advantage. No French people, that's an advantage in war. The obesity rate in Canada is sky high. There's no obesity in the Philippines, like they could actually beat you. At that point, how would you feel?
LEDREW: No, they can't, first of all -- we have so many Filipinos in Canada. First of all, he is not going to shoot on his own people. So that's --
CARLSON: This is President Duterte. He executes drug dealers in the streets of Manila himself. So like, yes, he would.
LEDREW: But there aren't drug dealers in Canada. They're nice people. They come to Canada and they fit into our society and they work hard and they build a future, so it's nothing to do with drug dealers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think this is a problem that Trudeau is going to say, "It wasn't me. It was the earlier government. It was those bad guys who were empowered before me," because as you know, Tucker, he is under a lot of strain these days. He hasn't been successful and he doesn't want another failure.
CARLSON: No, well, I've got to ask you. I mean, so from our point of view and our President takes a lot of heat internationally and some of it he brings on himself whatever, but Justin Trudeau really is a buffoon. That's our perspective, anyway. He seems totally callow and just sort of fraudulent. Is that the perception in Canada?
LEDREW: Well, it is becoming the perception, unfortunately. He himself said that his role is largely ceremonial. In fact he is the most powerful person in the country, but he says it is ceremonial and in fact on one of our national news magazines last week, they had a picture of Trudeau "imposter" across it. So that's something that wouldn't have happened in normal times.
It all started when he played Mr. Dress up and went to India and the whole world was laughing at him. You remember that.
CARLSON: I remember very well, and that's why I was shocked that he would send his garbage to the Philippines, a struggling third world country needs more Canadian garbage? I mean, it just seems so insensitive and that seemed like -- I don't know, it seemed like a form of colonialism. Garbage colonialism.
LEDREW: I don't think it's a question of insensitivity. You know, Tucker, our Prime Minister is very, very sensitive.
CARLSON: So why is he sending his hair gel bottles to Manila? It just seems like white privilege to me. I'm just throwing that out there. Stephen, great to see you tonight. Thank you.

CARLSON: It's racism. Good to see you, man. Actor and celebrity Lori Loughlin and her husband have a new plan to escape prison time in the college bribery scandal. We will tell you what it is in just a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband face up to 20 years in prison for their role in the Varsity Blues college bribery scandal. Despite that, they refused to take any kind of plea deal and now, we know more about their likely defense strategy. Trace Gallagher has been on it for us since day one. He joins us now. Hey, Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: And Tucker, we should note at last check, 19 year-old Olivia Jade Giannulli was furious with her parents for allegedly bribing her into the University of Southern California and quote, "ruining her life." Now "Us Weekly" says Olivia Jade and her mom, Lori Loughlin have made amends with sources saying the daughters now realize their parents were just trying to do what's best for them.
Of course legal experts point out the family could use a unified front because they might all eventually face charges. As for Lori Loughlin and Giannulli's defense it appears to be the old, "I didn't realize I was giving bribe money" claim with sources saying Loughlin had no idea how the $500,000.00 would be used and certainly did not think it would grease the hand of the women's soccer coach, Laura Janke.
Except the criminal complaint says Massimo Giannulli sent at least $100,000.00 directly to the USC assistant athletic director and we should note, the former women's soccer coach struck a plea deal and is now cooperating which could undermine Loughlin's story.

MARTHA STEWART, TELEVISION PERSONALITY: I just feel sorry for them. They might have made a bad mistake.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Stewart served five months in a minimum-security prison and called it awful -- Tucker.
CARLSON: I bet it was. Trace Gallagher, great to see you. Well, here's something you already knew. Young people in America are left-wing -- really left-wing. Every poll confirms that. They are radical on race issues. They don't care a lot about free speech. They don't know it's in the Constitution. They're giving up on America's economic system.

Alyssa Ahlgren is a young person, officially, but unlike most of her peers, she is not left-wing. She is a contributor to Alpha News and she joins us tonight. Thanks so much for coming on tonight.
So just occasionally, it's nice to talk to people who are you know under 40 to get a sense of what's going on. So you are under 40, far under 40. You disagree with most people your age.
ALYSSA AHLGREN, CONTRIBUTOR, ALPHA NEWS: I am.
CARLSON: Or do you? Most people your age -- are they represented by the lunatics you see on CNN or no?
AHLGREN: Absolutely not. A majority of my age looks at socialism favorably. I am the minority voice. It was very prevalent when I went to college. I was probably one of three conservatives in my classes or that spoke up to be conservative at all.
My representation of an ideology is not seen in Hollywood. It's not seen in the media and it's not seen in the university system.
CARLSON: So I wonder, is that -- do you think the problem the young people don't ever meet anyone who disagrees with the left-wing view? I mean, are there any professors? Is there anybody in high school or college who isn't left-wing who's teaching kids?
AHLGREN: Well, if you look at that study that was done just recently -- the name escapes me -- where they looked at the 66 top-ranked Liberal Arts school in the country and they saw that their ratio in some of these departments were 108 Democrats to zero Republican Professors. It leans heavily Democrat.
The reason young people are thinking the way they're thinking is that because the same views are being mirrored by their professors, are being mirrored by the media and they're all left-wing progressive narratives that if you think otherwise you will be condemned, you will be labeled a bigot.
CARLSON: It's remarkable how many people take their Professor's word for things. What do you think the actual percentage of people who agree? I mean, do you think there are people who agree with you, but are afraid to say so?
AHLGREN: Absolutely. It's funny because just today, I had a co-worker IM'ed me on my computer and tell me, "Hey, I saw your article. I really liked it. Don't worry you're not alone." And I have my sister, I have her co-workers coming up to her quietly saying, "Hey, you know we loved your sister's article. We agree, but you just can't say it." There are closeted conservatives everywhere and there's this massive push to silence them.
You're seeing it on campus with conservative speakers being harassed and silenced and put into halls where barely anyone can attend and it's an epidemic.
CARLSON: That's interesting. The small group of non-liberals on your college campus who spoke up, how were they treated?
AHLGREN: Well, when I -- so when I was in college, it was 2011. It wasn't as bad. It was the end of -- or the beginning of Obama's second term.
CARLSON: Right.
AHLGREN: I had a little bit of trouble with it. My history classes definitely, we had to learn about all of America's shortfalls, what we did wrong. We had debates on whether or not America should have intervened in World War I. We would have debates about, "Okay, this is, you know America is built on genocide. This is why."
When you speak up and you are the minority voice, it's troubling because you're usually met with such disrespect because you are labeled a Nazi, you're labeled racist, bigot. It's easy, you know what they say, it's okay to punch Nazis. Well, conservatives are Nazis.
CARLSON: Yes, I got that.
AHLGREN: And that mentality -- yes.
CARLSON: I can see where we're going here. It's pretty obvious.
AHLGREN: I know.
CARLSON: From day one.
AHLGREN: Yes.
CARLSON: Right. I guess it all hinges on who is a Nazi. Well you are not and you're a brave person to come and talk to us tonight.
AHLGREN: Thank you.
CARLSON: I hope you face no repercussions for that. I appreciate it. Good to see you.
AHLGREN: I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
CARLSON: Thank you. Well, college as you just heard is increasingly intolerant of free speech, so why does an aggressively racist professor at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut still have his job? What about the kids in his classes? Is he discriminating against them? The college doesn't even want to know. We'll tell you a lot more about what he recently said and you can make up your own mind about whether that's okay.
Plus our conversation with Adam Carolla, just ahead. Here's a preview of it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ADAM CAROLLA, AMERICAN HOST AND COMEDIAN: so I'm starting to wonder if it's swinging back. I think the insanity of the woke folks out there have forced sane people to push back and we may be going from that hair band to the grunge movement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: I often hear people call college campuses liberal, but is that really true? Test it. Oppose segregation on a college campus and see what happens. Say out loud that there are only two genders. The liberals might riot. You might get fired. There's nothing liberal about that.
On the other hand, fomenting race hatred on campus is perfectly fine. Here's a case and point, two years ago, Trinity College in Hartford, Sociology Professor Johnny Eric Williams left the college briefly on a leave of absence, paid by the way, after he shared a blog post that argued that Congressman Steve Scalise should have been left to die when he was shot by a gunman.
The post said that everybody who looks like Steve Scalise, of the same race as Steve Scalise, deserved to die. "Let them effing die." In red. Now Professor Williams who is not a scholar or a good professor or impressive in any way is back on Facebook.
Two weeks ago, Williams denounced Barack and Michelle Obama as quote "white Negroes who really need a lot of therapy and a good old ass-kicking." On Easter Sunday, Williams tweeted this, "Whiteness is terrorism." And then said, "All self-identified white people (no exceptions) are invested in and collude with a systemic white racism and white supremacy," end quote.
If you're white, you're racist and evil. No exceptions -- in the view of Johnny E. Williams, Professor at Trinity College. Why would you send your kids to a place like that? Well, people aren't because of people like that, because there are no consequences for saying something that's like transparently insane and by the way racist.
James Damore lost his job at Google for saying nothing like that. Alex Jones has never said anything like that and he has been completely deplatformed, kicked off PayPal, but Johnny Williams is completely fine. Safe in the tender bosom of Trinity College's bureaucracy. They don't oppose hatred. They are encouraging hatred. Obviously. Let's stop lying about that.
Well, comedian and podcast host, Adam Carolla is one of the most stalwart defenders of actual free speech left in America. Carolla is not only a famous host. He is an amazing car racing fan and participant. We were just in LA last week and we decided to go over to his race car garage and talk to him because we couldn't resist because it's amazing. Here's part of the conversation that resulted.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CARLSON: Adam Carolla, you've been on the road for the past several months talking about free speech. I know your views on it. Have you been able to convince the audience especially young people that free speech matters? Are they on your side, do you think?
CAROLLA: I've been able to convince my audience who already thought free speech mattered. I think people -- I think the pendulum is starting to swing back a little bit, you know, we've hit a saturation level.
I sort of believe as human beings we work this way, like I believe that in that late 80s, there were hair bands and big guys wearing bouffant and spandex and Aquanet and eyeliner and everything else and then that gave way to grunge music.
CARLSON: Yes.
CAROLLA: Kurt Cobain, tattered shirts, nobody cared, right? So it's like what could be further away from hair bands, grunge music and that's what came next. So I'm starting to wonder if it's swinging back. I think the insanity of the woke folks out there have forced sane people to push back and we may be going from that hair band to the grunge movement.
CARLSON: Have the woke people pushed back against you?
CAROLLA: Yes, the woke people are -- they'll push back against anybody anytime.
CARLSON: But you don't seem bothered. You're like the one person I know who seems totally uninterested in what the woke people say and totally unbothered by their attacks.
CAROLLA: Well, I know what's in my heart and I hate that statement, but I know who I am. You can't convince me I hate a group, hate a sexual proclivity, hate a person. You couldn't convince me I hated a neighbor or friend or Hispanics, blacks, gays -- whatever. You can't bestow that upon me. That's something that's inside me and I'm aware of it and I know I don't. So you can't convince me of that.
CARLSON: So you're not afraid because you know what they're saying is a lie.
CAROLLA: Yes, I'm an atheist, like I really don't care. Like, at the end of the day, I want to go race one of these cars and wrench on something and build something and eat dinner with my kids and wife. There is a sort of freedom in not caring. There's a real freedom in not caring.
CARLSON: Why don't want people feel that way?
CAROLLA: I think there's a vanity and I and I think that everybody is wired to be a little bit narcissistic and no one wants to go online and read bad things about themselves and nobody wants to read untruths or inaccurate things about themselves and so we are wired to alleviate so I've never thought about it this way, but here you go.
When your ankle is sore, you're wired to stay off your ankle, like less weight, hop, lean this way. You go on Twitter, you read a bunch of horrible things about yourself, you're wired to alleviate. You're not wired to put weight on a rolled ankle. You're wired to go, "Oh people are saying X, Y and Z about me on Twitter. Let's fix that." And the fix is apologizing and walking statements back to get it to go away. I want to alleviate.
I'm not interested in the truth. I'm not interested in what the history books say. My ankle hurts. I want to get the weight off it, immediately. So you walking this stuff back, you apologizing, you kowtowing to these people is a way to get the weight. It's like a crutch and I can get the weight off this and it'll go away and I don't care about what the doctor or the orthopedic surgeon says.
CARLSON: It doesn't matter. It just hurts, make the pain stop.
CAROLLA: Right now, it hurts. I want it to go away.
CARLSON: But you don't play that game and therefore, they don't bother you and it just seems like that's a model for the rest of us, that if everybody had that attitude, like "I don't care. I just want to wrench on my cars and have dinner with my kids." They won't have no power.
CAROLLA: They're not in the business of banging their head against the wall. They're in the business of mowing you down and moving on to their next subject. You know what I mean? They are an immediate gratification group. Let's remember, these were kids who got everything they wanted immediately.
So if you don't give them immediate gratification, they're off you in like two days.
CARLSON: Yes.
CAROLLA: This is not a long slog that's going to take place over months and years. This is "You give me what I want right now," which is an apology or you either get fired from your job or whatever that is, you are going to be humiliated and you have to be contrite and if you don't give in almost immediately, they immediately move on to the next thing.
CARLSON: But then, you have to be a moron to give in immediately to unreasonable demands, wouldn't you?
CAROLLA: I think so, but you know, you think about all the politicians and all the newscasters and voices out there, you think about the ones that just sort of weathered the storm and just put their head down and said "no apology," they immediately pack up and go find another victim or somebody to turn into a victim and if it's clear that there's nothing here for you, if they wring you like a bar rag and no tears come out, they move on because they want a bucket of tears. They want a bucket of your tears and they wring and they wring and you just go, "Don't let it drop fall," and if the drop doesn't hit that pail, they pick up the pail and they go let's go find some more tears.
CARLSON: Perfect. Perfect. Thank you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CARLSON: Well, here's a story that didn't get enough attention. The U.S. Navy has enacted new rules for reporting UFOs. Many of its pilots see things they can't explain. Why the change? We'll ask an expert, after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Something unexplained is happening in the skies above the United States. Even the U.S. Navy isn't certain what is going on. The Navy did just confirm that it is drafting new guidelines for personnel to report encounters with quote, "unidentified aircraft." The goal is to destigmatize the settings of advanced very high speed aircraft that have been seen quite frequently approaching Navy ships and facilities without explanation.
The Navy issued a statement that said in part this, quote, "There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military control ranges and designated airspace in recent years. For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the U.S. Air Force take these reports very seriously and investigate each and every report. As part of this effort, the Navy is updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities," unquote.
Chris Mellon is a former Pentagon intelligence officially. He is closely involved in the History Channel's upcoming six-part series "Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation," and he joins us tonight. Chris, thanks very much for coming on. So we've gone in a pretty short period of time from the U.S. military not really acknowledging that there is such a thing, to them acknowledging that these sightings are so frequent they need a formal process for reporting them. What's changed?
CHRIS MELLON, FORMER PENTAGON INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL: Yes, thank you, Tucker. It is an extraordinary turnaround and it's really the result of an interaction between Congress and the Navy and the fact that this has gotten on Congress's radar began some discussions which elevated an issue that before this time had been smothered and kept at low levels of the bureaucracy.
So now you have more senior policymaking officials hearing in some cases firsthand from the aviators involved and other personnel, they're learning the reality of the issue and they're asking some direct and sometimes tough questions and so this has elevated this entire issue within the department and kudos to both for engaging.
CARLSON: Yes.
MELLON: And really listening to our men and women in uniform who have been squelched in the past, who've really been treated with disdain sometimes for reporting what's happening.
CARLSON: Well, I mean and pilots of course are trained to discern between aircraft and weather balloons, so like if there's one group you should listen to, it is pilots. How often are these sightings reported? Do we know?
MELLON: We don't know. We believe that probably eight or nine times out of ten, they are not reported when there's an encounter. We know from numerous debriefings and interviews that individuals and squadrons when they when they bring a story forward, the only individual in their squadron usually is willing to do so or have that discussion. We see the same thing among commercial airline pilots.
It's not career enhancing to say the least. We know these individuals are often ridiculed and were in the past, which is probably why this is such an important development. They're saying it's a legitimate issue now, you can talk about it.
CARLSON: I mean, I was just reading this morning, some of these sightings again by military pilots who know the difference estimate that these are objects moving at 15,000 miles per hour, for example. That's so much faster than any object -- human-made object -- has ever travelled that we're aware of, so what do they think that is? What's the going theory on this?
MELLON: Yes, this is a tough terrain. There are three hypotheses that people have put forward and none of them are very comfortable. One is that one of our adversaries has leapfrogged us technologically -- China or Russia. Putin has been making some extraordinary claims about Russian technology.
Another theory is that these are some test aircraft of the U.S. I think we can discard that now with the Navy itself acknowledging these are not American.
CARLSON: That's right.
MELLON: And third the popular theory of course is that these may be from some civilization elsewhere beyond our solar system and none of these theories are very comfortable to contemplate, but we have to look at facts and derive theories from facts, not start with theories and dis-rule or rule out facts.
CARLSON: I mean, I hope that this will get us a lot closer doing this. Just very quickly, are the results of these surveys going to be made public at any point?
MELLON: At To The Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, my colleagues and I, we have drafted some proposed legislation for Congress to consider and simply asked for a report on this. It wouldn't cost any money. Right now --
CARLSON: Let's demand one, shall we.
MELLON: One of the problems is --
CARLSON: I bet that would be good -- yes, really quick.
MELLON: One of the problem is nobody is in charge and these organizations don't share information, so the information isn't pooled or analyzed.
CARLSON: Well, that's always. That's the story of the government.
Chris, thanks so much. Great to see you.
Back 8:00 p.m., sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.
Guess who's next? Sean Hannity right now.
