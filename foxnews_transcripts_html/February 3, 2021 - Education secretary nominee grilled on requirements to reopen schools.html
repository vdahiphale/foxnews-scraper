BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Greg, thanks.President Biden's goal to put students back in the classroom in 100 days isrunning into some headwinds. Slain Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick ishonored in the U.S. Capitol and Democrats begin the push to put judges inopen court positions and possibly create more seats to fill. This isSPECIAL REPORT. Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier.Across the country, pressure is building on school systems to reopenclassrooms to students after almost a year of online learning. In Chicago,teachers are considering a strike tonight to stay put -- to stay out of theclassroom. In Cincinnati, a judge threw out a teacher's union lawsuit oversafety concerns. And here in our nation's capital, the politics and healthexperts seem to be at odds on some items.We have Fox team coverage tonight. Correspondent Dan Springer is in thePacific Northwest where a pair of states are putting teachers near thefront of the line or at the front of the line for vaccines. We begintonight though with Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel and theconfirmation hearing for the nominee to lead the Department of Education.Good evening, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Bret, good evening. President Biden set a goal of schoolsreopening for in person learning in his first 100 days but so far, unionsare not budging.Today, his nominee for Education Secretary Miguel Cardona emphasizedfollowing the science, which is still up for interpretation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIGUEL CARDONA, EDUCATION SECRETARY NOMINEE: We all want to make sure wecan get our students back into school safely.EMANUEL (voice over): Cardona sidestepped a question about a demand fromthe teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, that all teachers andstudents must be vaccinated before returning to the classroom.SEN. RICHARD BURR (R-NC): It doesn't require that 100 percent of theparticipants should be vaccinated to accomplish that.CARDONA: We have great examples throughout our country of schools that areable to reopen safely and do so while following mitigation strategies.EMANUEL: Today, the CDC director shredded a shots first prerequisite.ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CDC: Safe reopening does not suggest thatteachers need to be vaccinated in order to reopen safely.EMANUEL: The White House press secretary walked that back several hourslater.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: They have not released theirofficial guidance yet from the CDC on the vaccination of teachers and whatwould be needed to ensure the safe reopening of schools.EMANUEL: Top Democrats are including reopening schools as an issue in theirargument for President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief package.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): This rescue package will include resources forschools to make that happen quicker.EMANUEL: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell counter states and schooldistricts have only spent about $4 billion of the roughly $68 billion setaside for K-12 schools. McConnell says it's really a lack of willpower fromteachers' unions.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): No more goalposts moving. States and districtshave got to follow the science and get American education back on track.EMANUEL: Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney says the union's always wantmore money.SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): The funding that we're describing is somethingwhich the teachers' union is very happy to receive, but which will notresult in actual improvement in the scores and the performance of our youngpeople.EMANUEL: And while the fight goes on in Washington around the nation, manykids are being impacted, some to their breaking point.CHRIS BUCKNER, HIGH SCHOOL SON DIED OF SUICIDE: There's no doubt in ourminds that the stress he was feeling as a result of school closures, notbeing able to be with his friends, not getting to play football, absolutelycontributed to his death.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): Press Secretary Psaki notes it's up to states todetermine prioritization for vaccinations but she says moving teachers upis important to President Biden.Axios reports some White House political advisors fear if they push schoolsto reopen, and new variants of COVID spread, they could be forced to shutdown schools again, like what happened in Europe, Bret.BAIER: All right, Mike. Thank you.Press Secretary Jen Psaki noting it's up to the states, some states areputting teachers near the front or at the front of the line to get vaccineshoping to get students back in the classroom.But getting vaccinated does not mean schools will be back to full capacity.Correspondent Dan Springer reports has our report right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: (voice over): These studentsin Hood River, Oregon are among the select few, just 30 percent of all K-12students in the state had been inside a classroom since last March.But that's expected to change soon as Governor Kate Brown put teachers atthe front of the COVID vaccination line.GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): For every teacher who's back in the classroom, theyhelp 20, 30, 35 students get their life back on track.SPRINGER: According to Education Week, 27 states are currently vaccinatingat least some teachers, but only Oregon and Idaho have bumped them allahead of seniors not living in group settings.With 80 percent of all COVID deaths in the U.S. being those over 65 yearsold, many retirees say holding them back will cost lives.JIM DAVIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OREGON COUNCIL OF RETIRED CITIZENS: Whenseniors are affected by this, they have a lot of underlying conditions andthey're more prone to dying. So, I think that's the concern.SPRINGER: Nationally, some 20 million students have done nothing butdistance learning the last 10 months. Studies from NWEA which doeseducation research, and McKinsey show they have significant learning lossand suffer anxiety and depression.DAN REIDENBERG, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SUICIDEPREVENTION:We're seeing a range somewhere between 30 and 60 percent increase indistress over the pandemic for young kids.SPRINGER: Teachers unions have largely fought reopening schools untileducators can get vaccinated even though the CDC says school transmissionrates are lower than in the community.And in Oregon, there's no guarantee all teachers will be going back to theclassroom, even after jumping the vaccination line.JOHN LARSON, PRESIDENT, OREGON EDUCATION ASSOCIATION: We certainly havestudents that won't have been vaccinated, right? And so, they are a risk toeach other. And the vaccinations aren't 100 percent effective.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPRINGER (on camera): And another hurdle, Oregon Health Departmentguidelines could make it impossible to open big high schools due tocrowding concerns. But if they remain closed even after teachers werepushed ahead of more vulnerable senior citizens, there will be a backlashfrom the elderly, parents and students who are all suffering theconsequences, Bret.BAIER: Dan Springer live in Seattle. Dan, thanks.Breaking tonight, the House Rules Committee met this afternoon to debate ameasure to remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's committeeassignments over comments she's made in the past and conspiracies she'stouted. The Democratic chairman of the committee says Greene encouragedviolence against fellow members.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy says he condemns the statements onschool shootings, political violence and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,but does not -- does not back the effort to remove her committeeassignments. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich is following the story live onCapitol Hill. Good evening, Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. Most of the 211 House Republicans huddled together to decide the fateof that freshman congresswoman who drew ire from all sides embracingconspiracy theories in her past and they are still hashing it out rightnow.Republicans are leery of caving to Democrat demands and setting aprecedent.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): When you start having people in Washington dictatewhat happens to two members of Congress and what committees they can serve,on what they can do and not leave that decision to the voters in thedistrict to the American people. That is a dangerous road to head down.HEINRICH (voice over): That's where a small faction of Republicans staged acounter effort against Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar demanding she bestripped of her committee assignments over what critics called anti-Semiticstatements she made and apologized for back in 2019.McCarthy gave Greene some choices in an hours long meeting last night,denounce QAnon, voluntarily step down from her assignment, or Democratswill do it for her through a vote.Greene did not back down and told the Washington Examiner tonight: Theydon't even realize they're helping me. I'm pretty amazed at how dumb theyare.McCarthy condemned Greene's past rhetoric tonight but shifted blame toDemocrats saying: I understand that Marjorie's comments have caused deepwounds to many and as a result, I offer Majority Leader Hoyer a path tolower the temperature and address these concerns.Instead of coming together to do that, the Democrats are choosing to raisethe temperature referring to tomorrow's vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera): It will force members of his party to publicly backor rebuke Greene. And whatever happens with Greene, she is making money offof it and last update, more than $160,000.Meantime, it's less clear how McCarthy will deal with Congresswoman LizCheney after more than a hundred members within the party are pushing toremove her from her leadership spot after she voted to impeach PresidentTrump last month.Tonight, she refused to apologize, and one source says she wants herleadership position to go to a vote. Sources also tell Fox, McCarthy isbacking her to remain in her position, Bret.BAIER: More on this with the panel. Jacqui, thank you.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says the Biden administration fullysupports the Space Force created during President Trump's term. Thatstatement comes the day after Psaki gave an answer in her briefing thatseveral lawmakers saw is dismissive, at least, one Republican called itdisgraceful.White House Correspondent Kristin Fisher is following the story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Just sevenweeks ago, the Russians tested an anti-satellite weapon capable ofpotentially taking out U.S. spy and communication satellites. It's the verykind of threat that the U.S. Space Force was created for during the Trumpadministration.But when asked about this newest branch of the U.S. military in theBriefing Room, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki Said:PSAKI: Wow, Space Force. It's the plane of today.FISHER: A nod to an earlier question about the paint color of Air ForceOne. That response fed concerns within the force. According to two currentservice members, that the Biden administration is not taking threats inspace seriously enough.The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee said Psaki"Blatantly diminished an entire branch of our military as the punchline ofa joke, which I'm sure China would find funny."And he asked her to apologize. And given the chance to do so today, Psakideclined, but she did offer the White House's first full throated defenseof the force.Does the Space Force have the full support of the Biden administration? Oris the president at some point perhaps wanting to try to get rid of it orin some way diminish it?PSAKI: They absolutely have the full support of the Biden administration.And we are not revisiting the decision to establish the Space Force.FISHER: After her initial remarks Saki took to Twitter to address thecriticism and invited members of the Space Force to the White House. Today,the force's top general said he would welcome the opportunity.But the White House's top concern continues to be back on planet Earth,getting the coronavirus under control and a massive relief bill throughCongress.Today, President Biden met with Senate Democrats in the Oval Office.SCHUMER: There's agreement, universal agreement, we must go big and bold.FISHER: The president is still holding out hope for bipartisan support.Republican Senator Mitt Romney says it's possible but not without loweringthat price tag.ROMNEY: If it goes forward without any changes from what was originallyproposed, I would predict that not a single Republican will support the$1.9 trillion plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): Now, one potential point of compromise are those $1,400stimulus checks that President Biden is asking for. Psaki says that theamount of those checks is not up for debate, but the number of Americanswho qualify or would qualify for those checks is on the negotiating table,Bret.BAIER: Not 2,000 but 1,400. Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin,thanks.Mix day on Wall Street today. The Dow gaining 36, the S&P 500 rose four,the NASDAQ lost two.Also breaking tonight, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has directed aservice wide stand down to take place sometime in the next 60 days to have"Needed discussions on extremism in the ranks."The decision to call a meeting with all the military service chiefs andsecretaries follows the January 6th attack on the Capitol and revelationsthat some active duty and a large number of military veterans participatedin that riot.In 2020, The FBI opened 143 investigations involving past and presentmembers of the U.S. military. 68 had to do with domestic extremism.The remains of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick were buried atArlington National Cemetery today after he was honored at the U.S. Capitol.The officer was injured during the January 6th attack on the Capitol, diedthe next day.Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram looks at the sober Memorial.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):Officer Brian Sicknick saluted by American leaders. His remains lying inhonor in the most sacred temple of American democracy, the U.S. Capitolrotunda.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It is my official and sad honor to welcomeOfficer Brian Sicknick and many who loved, respected and were protected byhim to United States Capitol rotunda.PERGRAM: A somber ceremony conducted pandemic style. Mourners fanned outsix feet apart.SCHUMER: He was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and ended on aday when peace was shattered.PERGRAM: Lying in honor is similar to lying in state. Only five Americanshave laid in honor, three of whom were U.S. Capitol Police officers.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer went to the same high school asSicknick's mother Gladys, and spoke about how tough this was for everyone.SCHUMER: That Brian and his family were made to pay such a high price forhis devoted service in the Capitol was a senseless tragedy, one that we arestill grappling with.PERGRAM: Capitol Police escorted Sicknick's remains to the Capitol Tuesdaynight. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden among the first to paytheir respects. The President tweeting no words condole the pain of thismoment. An honor guard stood vigil over Sicknick's remains overnight.Brian Sicknick joined the Capitol Police in 2008 and served twice overseasin Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan with the New Jersey Air National Guard.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman MarkMilley paying tribute before Sicknick was interred at Arlington NationalCemetery.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM (on camera): Sicknick served in the Capitol police's firstresponder unit. He was hit in the head with the fire extinguisher duringthe brawl on the 6th of January. Sicknick later collapsed and died the nextday. Police are treating Sicknick's death as a homicide, but they have yetto charge any of the rioters. Bret.BAIER: Thank you, Chad. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said today,"Four weeks ago, the rotunda was strewn with the debris of aninsurrectionist mob. Today, it is adorned in solemn thanksgiving for thesacrifice of a hero. Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick was 42-years-old.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Ahead of this Sunday's Super Bowl, Homeland Security officials incoordination with the National Football League say they have confiscatedtens of millions worth of counterfeit NFL items over the past year.That effort known as Operation Team Player intercepted more than 150,000items everything from fake super bowl rings to masks.We're learning new information tonight about the circumstances that led totwo FBI agents being killed when they arrived to search an apartment,including, we're learning who the shooter was.Correspondent Steve Harrigan is following the case in Sunrise, Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Aninvestigation is now underway into what exactly happened. Unnamed lawenforcement officials tell Fox News that suspect, who the FBI hasidentified as David Lee Huber, watch the approach of the agents through adoorbell camera, then used an assault rifle to shoot them through a closeddoor.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One time shot to the shoulder of the FBI agent.HARRIGAN: Five agents shot, two dead. Two, hospitalized with multiplegunshot wounds, one of which was released today. The fifth, treated on thescene.FBI Director Wray visited the crime scene and met privately with thefamilies of the slain agents. Officials say, they meticulously planned forall operations.GEORGE PIRO, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION,MIAMI: The vast majority of these warrants occur without incident.HARRIGAN: Now, this ordinary Florida gated community is the crime scene ofone of the deadliest events in FBI history.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My neighbor down the street said he heard like machinegun fire about 6:00 in the morning.HARRIGAN: In expressing his condolences to the fallen families, PresidentBiden spoke about those who wear the badge.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As the vast, vast majority ofthese men and women are decent, honorable people who put themselves on theline. We owe them.HARRIGAN: Biden's qualified praise of law enforcement drew questions fromthe media.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why did he think it was important to stress that thevast majority are?PSAKI: Because I think he believes that the men and women who have beenserving our country in a variety of capacities have been criticized and hewanted to reiterate his support for the important work they do.HARRIGAN: Special Agent Daniel Alfin and Special Agent LauraSchwartzenberger were veterans of multiple child pornographyinvestigations, often pursuing cases where violent acts against childrenwere committed.(END VIDEO CLIP)HARRIGAN (on camera): Both agents leave behind spouses and children oftheir own. Bret.BAIER: Steve Harrigan, live in Sunrise, Florida. Steve, thank you.Up next, why herd immunity may not happen anytime soon? And some more mixedmessaging on double masking. We'll bring you that story.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 11 in Los Angeles for an explosion at an industrialpark injured four people, three of them critically.The blast was caused by commercial pyrotechnics, and then, a brush firestarted right after that it was quickly contained, however.Fox 35 in Orlando, where Florida governor, Ron DeSantis announced newproposals aimed at reining in social media platforms, and what theRepublican calls the squelching of the free speech of conservatives.The proposals include possible fines for suspending accounts of politicalcandidates and allowing lawsuits for anti-competitive behavior. It isuncertain legally if the state has the authority to act on the techcompanies.And this is a live look at Milwaukee from our affiliate Fox 6. The bigstory there tonight. Areas of the Midwest that received around a foot ofsnow over the weekend, yes, they're preparing for another blast of winterweather.Blizzard warnings are now in effect in Iowa and the storm is expected tomove to the upper Great Lakes region tomorrow.That is tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT.We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The federal government is opening two coronavirus vaccination sitesin Oakland and Los Angeles, two of the hardest-hit communities out there.The White House COVID-19 coordinator says the two sites are just thebeginning of the push to speed up vaccinations. But supply is not the onlyconcern. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is following the vaccine push fromAtlanta.JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As federalhealth officials try to get shots to as many Americans as possible, vaccinehesitancy may be the biggest obstacle to reaching herd immunity. A reportpublished by the CDC shows, while 78 percent of nursing home residents getthe vaccine when offered, only 38 percent of the staff do.And according to a Monmouth University poll, only 50 percent of Americansplan to get vaccinated as soon as it's their turn with 19 percentpreferring to wait, and 24 percent unlikely to get vaccinated at all. Butfederal health officials say they're nowhere near mandatory inoculations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ANDPREVENTION: We can't sort of be in a place where we're thinking aboutmaking requirements for vaccination until we certainly have enough for theentire country.SERRIE: Today, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline announced it's working with aGerman company to develop vaccines against new variants of the coronavirus,while also pledging to produce up to 100 million doses of its existingvaccine this year.A study from Mount Sinai Hospital suggests people previously infected withCOVID-19 may only require one vaccine dose to maintain their protection.And while the CDC recommends wearing a mask with at least two layers ofwashable fabric, federal researchers are investigating whether doublemasking offers additional protection against more infectious mutations.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: There's nothing wrong with people wearing two masks. I oftenmyself wear two masks. Can we make a general recommendation that doesn'thave scientific basis yet? No.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE (on camera): Contact tracers have found that many of these varyingcases are actually spreading among people wearing no masks and practicingno social distancing. So, just wearing a mask, period, is a good place tostart. Bret.BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you.Parler has terminated CEO John Matze. According to a memo obtained by FoxNews, a memo to staff. The Parler board making that decision today withoutthe input of the now-former CEO.When Republicans had control in the Senate, the party sought to fill thejudicial benches with their picks and do it quickly. Now the Democrats arein charge, they are seeking to do the same and maybe more and fast.Correspondent David Spunt has our report.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I, Joseph Robinette BidenJr., do solemnly swear.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The new president is already workingwith the Senate majority to transform the federal courts.CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  There will be lots ofvacancies that come up.SPUNT:  And Democrats are chomping at the bit to fill them, hoping to be asaggressive as the previous administration.DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  By the end of thefirst term we'll have close to 300 federal judges.SPUNT:  Not quite 300, but President Trump in just a single term in officeappointed 245 federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices.Though there's no indication any justices are ready to retire, there are 50other vacancies to fill. Three on the high-profile Circuit Courts ofAppeal.JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  Thank you both for givingme opportunity to serve.SPUNT:  That's where Judge Merrick Garland sits. But he's on his way tobecoming the next attorney general. Sources familiar with the selectionprocess tell FOX News a possible Garland replace is Judge Ketanji BrownJackson, a district court judge in Washington, D.C. Progressives want more,flirting with court expansion.SCHUMER:  I have in the city of Buffalo a huge -- they don't have enoughjudges. There's this long line before you can get to court because theydon't have enough. So we could expand those.SPUNT:  But expanding the amount of judges, also known as court packing,takes time, and time is at a premium.PAUL SMITH, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER:  The difficulty that Mr.Schumer faces is that he's got a lot on his plate. He's trying to do COVIDrelief and infrastructure and democracy reform and immigration. They have avery, very full agenda.(END VIDEO TAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  Another popular Democrat idea, expanding the SupremeCourt with up to 10 more justices and ending their life tenure. A WhiteHouse official tells me the president will press forward with a study oncourt reforms. Bret?BAIER:  David Spunt in the White House Briefing Room. David, thanks.Up next, the clock is ticking on President Biden's goal of putting studentsback in the classroom in his first 100 days in office.First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. Syria state TV media says suspectedIsraeli strikes prompted a response from Syrian air defenses. The Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the air strikes targeted amilitary post for government troops and allied Iranian militias in southernSyria on the edge of the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.Police levelled the first charge against Burma's ousted leader Aung San SuuKyi, giving military authorities who staged a coup a legal reason to detainher. The charge of being in possession of illegally imported walkie-talkiescame to light two days after the leader was placed under house arrest. Thecharge carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. The U.S. hascondemned the coup.Russian authorities rejected western criticism as hysterics as activistsreported more than 1,400 new arrests in the crackdown on protestersrallying against the jailing of top Kremlin foe Alexey Navalny. Moscowcourt has sentenced Navalny to more than two years in prison for violatingthe terms of his probation while recuperating in Germany from a nerve agentpoisoning.Just some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be rightback.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CDC:  Vaccination of teachers is not aprerequisite for safe reopening of schools.RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS:  Educators have a rightto express their fears. Like everyone else in this country, they have seenthe ravages of COVID.SEN. RICHARD BURR, (R-NC) SENATE HEALTH AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE:  Itdoesn't require that 100 percent of the participants be vaccinated toaccomplish that.MIGUEL CARDONA, EDUCATION SECRETARY:  We have great examples throughout ourcountry of schools that are able to reopen safely and do so while followingmitigation strategies.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The nominee for secretary of education there talking up on CapitolHill. This as the "Wall Street Journal" reports that so far K through 12schools have been allocated $67.2 billion in funding, and according to the"Wall Street Journal" and their stats, $4.4 billion of that has been spentso far.Where are we on this opening of school issue? And we'll talk about COVIDplans as well. Let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former TennesseeCongressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, Katie Pavlich, newseditor at Townhall.com, and Byron York, chief political correspondent ofthe "Washington Examiner."There's a lot of back and forth, Byron. We keep on coming back to this, inpart because it's very emotional for parents who, one, want to have theirkids back in school, and, two, want to have their kids back in school.(LAUGHTER)BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Yes. Theproblem here for the president is that he is stuck between two conflictingpositions. One is his often-stated commitment to listening to the science.Problem being, of course, that the science says that with precautions, it'sOK. It's safe for children to go to school. The other conflicting positionis the Democratic Party's loyalty to the teachers' unions who in a lot ofplaces simply do not want to go back to school.And so far, it appears that the teachers' unions have the upper hand. Ahundred days can end pretty quickly, May 1st not that far away. And thesituation is really a mess in a number of places. Certainly in Chicago it'sa terrible mess. And in San Francisco, you have the city council going towar, the city government going to war with the school board, which wouldrather spend its time stripping the names of George Washington from schoolsthan actually coming up with a plan to reopen.BAIER:  Here's the president and the Senate leaders on schools andstimulus, Katie.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we'll get someRepublicans.MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  No more goalpost moving.States and districts have got to follow the science and get Americaneducation back on track.CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  For parents, I have spokento so many who are desperate for the day they can send their children backto school safely. This rescue package will include resources for schools tomake that happen quicker.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So that's the question. Where are the resources that have beenallocated already?KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Well, and I would say the biggerquestion is what's to say that these teachers' unions will agree to goingback to school after they would receive this $1.9 trillion COVID reliefpackage. They've received $65 billion plus in previous packages. You havethe mayor of Chicago saying we've allocated hundreds of millions of dollarsto ventilation and safety measures for teachers, and yet they still aren'twilling to come to some agreement about getting back in the classroom.So we've gone from follow the science to we're going to extort the federalgovernment for more money with no guarantee that we're actually going toget back in the classroom to do our jobs when there are schools all over ifcountry, private and public, that have found ways to use the funding thatthey've been able to get from the federal government in previous reliefpackages and also from their local districts to reopen safely.And the White House keeps changing on this. We have the CDC director todaysaying that it's not a prerequisite for teachers to get vaccinated, andthen you have the White House walking it back at the press briefing, sayingthey haven't released their guidance for that. And we know that there areteachers all over the country in the classroom without vaccinations.BAIER:  Harold, we go back and forth about where this vote is and where themoney is. We had Senator Manchin on from West Virginia last night. He hashad concerns about how it's all packaged together. It seems, though, as wego along here that Democrats are planning to go it alone. Here's oneelement of it, the $1,400 checks that used to be back in the Georgiarunoff, $2,000. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Their election will put anend to the block in Washington and that $2,000 stimulus check, that moneythat will go out the door immediately.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  There were $600 payments, as youknow, in the $900 billion package that passed in December. This is $1,400.Together that's $2,000, so it would be delivering on the promise he made,and it's something that he is firmly sticking by.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  They just wanted to do the math there. When he walking $2,000 inGeorgia, included the $600 from the Trump administration in the lastpackage. But where do you think we are on all this?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  Thanks for having meon again. I think that what we're saying is that Joe Biden has a biggervision and a different vision than some Democrats and most Republicans doin the House and the Senate with regard to what a relief package shouldlook like.I would agree, and I resemble the comments, my position resembles that ofboth Katie and Byron regarding the science in our schools. But I do believewe should have a V and V plan for the schools, vaccines and ventilation. Ifwe are able to provide that in school systems across the country, publicand even private alike, any teacher that chooses not to go should be heldaccountable by that school system. And I think you would find a lot ofDemocrats, including myself, taking a position towards unions that wouldprevent that.Three, I find it really curious why some of my old Republican friends inCongress seem reluctant to want to provide money to state and localities.There was no money in the Republican package that some of my Republicanfriends talked with President Biden about the other night in the WhiteHouse. Now, President Trump used to often say we're not going to give bluestate governors and mayors monies for them to waste it. When we have anatural disaster, presidents don't prioritize and send more money to statesand local areas where there are Democrats and Republicans and where theirparty is overrepresented. This is an American challenge. So let us supportcities and states and schools to get out of this mess. And if people areable to vaccinate, teachers, that is, and we're able to provide properventilation in our schools, any teacher that chooses not to go back intoschool should lose his or her job, period.BAIER:  Yes, but I think Senator Manchin said last night, it's not that hehas a problem with funding cities and states. He has a problem with $350billion being the number to do that.I want to turn, Byron, finally, to the Space Force and what Jen Psaki saidTuesday, and then the redirect today. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Wow, Space Force. It's the planeof today. It is an interesting question. I am happy to check with our SpaceForce point of contact. I'm not sure who that is. I will find out and seeif we have any update on that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Big picture here, does the Space Force have the fullsupport of the Biden administration, or is the president at some pointperhaps going to try to get rid of it or in some way diminish it?PSAKI:  They absolutely have the full support of the Biden administration,and we are not revisiting the decision to establish the Space Force.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  That seemed like a cleanup on aisle four there, Byron.YORK:  Big time. She really locked it in that first exchange, mocked theSpace Force. And remember, Joe Biden has come into office pledging to undoall sorts of things that President Trump did during his term in office. Asa matter of fact, the first weeks of the Biden presidency seemed to beexclusively devoted to undoing President Trump's accomplishments.But the Space Force is not one of the things that President Biden istargeting. At the time, everybody thought there's a huge future for themilitary in space. Something like this was needed at the Pentagon. It is anew branch of the military, and you shouldn't have the spokeswoman for thecommander in chief making fun of it like she did the other day.BAIER:  Next up, the House considers removing Congresswoman Greene from hercommittees over her controversial past comments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  This grave sin that I am beingcrucified for in the public square is for reading about things, postingabout them, and asking questions on Facebook in 2018. People can call NancyPelosi and tell her at her office that when we do take the majority, if wedo take it back, that the same thing that she's pulling on me, that wewon't forget, and that we'll do the same thing to their radical members.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, that is after the decisionsby the Republican caucus to fight for her to keep her committeeassignments, and as the House gets ready to vote on yanking those away fromher for conspiracy theories and also threats that have been linked to herFacebook page, whether she liked them or said them. We said earlier in theshow that she was making money on this, obviously meant fundraising for acampaign in the future on this issue. So are Democrats, on the QAnon issue,labeling all Republicans as QAnon.Meantime, at this hour Republicans are meeting about the fate of LizCheney, whether she stays in House leadership after voting for impeachmentagainst President Trump.We're back with the panel. Katie, your thoughts on this, all elements ofit?PAVLICH:  Well, we have to remember that on October 2nd of 2020, there wasa resolution brought to the house floor to condemn and to reject QAnon. And146 Republicans voted for it. Now, the DCCC is now putting in $500,000 togo after a number of Republican House members, and as you just said, tyingthem to QAnon, and saying that they're part of QAnon. But every singlemember that they are going after has condemned the group, and many votedfor that resolution to condemn them on the House floor.Further, if you look at the districts that they're targeting, for example,Young Kim in California, Mike Garcia in California, these districts thatthey did think that they were going to lose in 2020 that they want to takeback in 2022. So this idea that the Republican Party is somehow beingdefined by QAnon, it just isn't true, and there's a number of Republicanson the record rejecting it.BAIER:  Harold, you were once a congressman. This is one Congresswoman outof 435, and yet she is not receiving the same punishment, if you will, inthe Republican caucus that Steve King from Iowa received for his commentsthat he made about white nationalism. Your thoughts on this?FORD:  Not only that, I think it's a sad day we are even having to talkabout these things. I can't imagine anyone on this panel tonight supportsthe hateful and incendiary things that this Congresswoman has said. But toput it in perspective, to add a little more silliness to the craziness, theRepublican House Caucus may be on the verge this evening of taking astronger stance against Liz Cheney for a vote of conscience she took thanthey are against this Congresswoman for some of the hateful and conspiracy-fueled views that she has spread. It's a sad day in Congress if that's thecase.BAIER:  McCarthy is saying tonight that he stands by Liz Cheney and keepingher in a leadership position. She is calling for a vote in the caucus.They're still talking about it at this hour.Byron, what about this? Obviously, everybody on this panel denounces fullythose statements and anything that resembles threats, and a lot of peoplehave spoken out about it, including Karl Rove, saying that they shouldreally look at this. However, it is the voters in Georgia who decidewhether she stays in Congress, what about committees?YORK:  Well, certainly it's up to the voters whether she stays in Congress.Look, her statements are indefensible. Republicans should not try to defendthem. On the other hand, this is a political maneuver by Democrats tryingto corner Republicans and embarrass them. But on the other hand, look, theyhave removed Republicans, or Congressmen from committees before. It hashappened. They had a Democrat, Katie Hill, who had to leave Congress afterracy pictures and having a relationship with a staffer. So this happens,and sometimes members leave.BAIER:  We will see what it looks like after this meeting tonight and thevote tomorrow. Panel, stand by. When we come back, we look at tomorrow'sheadlines tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines tonight. Katie,first to you.PAVLICH:  All right, President Biden is going to invoke the DefenseProduction Act to produce more COVID tests for immigrants and unaccompaniedminors at the border to deal with the upcoming and ongoing surge.BAIER:  All right, Byron?YORK:  This is a hopeful headline. For a second time, Biden raises dailyvaccine goal. Remember he started out with a goal of 1 million a day. Wewere already there, had to raise it to 1.5 million. Now we're over 1.3.Hopefully, he'll have to raise it again soon.BAIER:  OK, Harold, tomorrow's headline tonight.FORD:  In memory and honor of the fallen Capitol police officer and FBIagents in Florida, my headline is not a day goes by that law enforcementdoesn't risk it all to protect us. My prayers go out to the Sicknick familythis evening.BAIER:  Thank you very much. That was quite a memorial service today, lastnight and today, up on Capitol Hill.And just a reminder, panel. One year ago today, Bernie Sanders won the mostvotes in the Iowa caucus. It took them three days because of the votingsnafus to declare victory, and he didn't win any more after the nomination.All right, thanks a lot. Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight.That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.Have you seen the show, "FOX NEWS PRIMETIME," this week hosted by TreyGowdy? It's his fourth night of doing it. And I'm going to give him 14extra seconds to fill his show.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
