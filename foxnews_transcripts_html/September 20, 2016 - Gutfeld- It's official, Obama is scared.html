It's official: President Obama is scared.

How do you know? He's getting desperate. On Sunday, he said sexism is hurting Hillary's White House bid. Yes, sexism, because she's a woman. This is from no-named guy who stole a woman's job eight years ago. Remember that? Everyone knew Hillary, no one knew him. Yet, he just cut in front of her. Why? Sexism, obviously. And back then being the first black trumped being the first female. Lucky for them no transgender Native American was running or both of their clocks would have been cleaned.
But whining about sexism reveals Obama knows Hillary's in trouble. When all else fails, blame patriarchy. Still, it's weird that you're sexist for not voting for Hillary because she's a woman, but it's okay to vote for Hillary… because she's a woman.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

But Obama is grasping at more straws than Michael Moore at a milkshake factory. Which is why the president made this plea on Saturday: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: After we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote!

If only he took terror this personally.
Maybe he's panicked. It's like he just woke up, realized he's late for a final for a class he blew off all semester. Because Hillary, frankly, could blow this thing. Trump has momentum because Hillary has no-mentum -- a word that I just invented. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

It's a gradual drop that didn't stop on that curb in New York. And Obama's worried if it ever will.  </pre>
