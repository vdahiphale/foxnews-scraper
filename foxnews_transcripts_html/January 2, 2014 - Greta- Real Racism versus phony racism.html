Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. First, let me say loudly and clearly, racism is real. It's hateful, horrible, cruel, and it exists. It's real.
But let me likewise say loudly and clearly, not every slight is racism. And people who wrongfully shout racism for every ill do an enormous disservice to all Americans, and especially those who are the recipients of real racism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now take a look at just the last few days. MSNBC anchor Melissa Harris-Perry and her panel of guests poking fun at the Romney family. Joking about Governor Romney's adopted African-American child. Racism? You decide. But one thing is for clear. Their comments hurt an innocent child. The anchor has now apologized, but on Twitter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And how about law professor, Gloria Brown Marshall? She just wrote, "Southern white radicals vowed to stop implementation of the ObamaCare law, leading one to wonder if Tea Party members would oppose health care if not from a non-black president." Is that why ObamaCare had a flawed launch? Because of racism towards the president, or was it a lousy website that just didn't work? You decide. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then there is New York City's Sanitation Department chaplain, the Rev. Fred Lucas Jr., comparing New York City to a plantation. A plantation. You know what that's code for.
So in a few days, a news anchor, a law professor and a chaplain all stirring up the pot, working to divide the nation, not heal it. What's with that? Imagine, with their three powerful positions -- anchor, law professor, and chaplain -- if each just gave it a rest, stop with their gratuitous insults, and instead worked on real solutions, solutions to address real instances of racism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
