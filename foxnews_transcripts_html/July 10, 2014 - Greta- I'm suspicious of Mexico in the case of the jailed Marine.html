Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I do not want to be disrespectful to Mexico, but this is dumb.
Mexico says its court's proceedings are open, including open to the media, but then holds the proceedings in a room that they say is not big enough to accommodate the media. So they don't let the media in to watch and report. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Unlike Mexico, I don't call that open. I call that closed. And that is what happened yesterday in Tijuana for our Marine, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi. If Mexico wants to convince us that it is justified in holding our Marine -- and I want to hear their evidence to see if they can possibly change my mind -- they should at least let us in. And if they don't have room for everybody in the media, here is a tip, let us send in one pool reporter. We do that all the time all around the world. So it's hard not to be suspicious. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
First, the prison would not let us in to see the Marine even though we waited two days outside the prison and Sergeant Tahmooressi gave us permission to talk to him. Now we can't cover his hearing because they say the room is too small. Go figure, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't know about you, but I get very suspicious with our country and other countries when they give silly excuses or the run around. I suspect they are hiding stuff. Do you agree?
