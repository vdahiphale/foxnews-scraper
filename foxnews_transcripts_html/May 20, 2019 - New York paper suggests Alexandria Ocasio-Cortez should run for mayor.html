DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Brian Kilmeade. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
All right, President Trump and Joe Biden battling in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump is headed there tonight as he gets ready to officially launch his reelection campaign. But before he rallies, supporters -- Trump -- firing shots at the former vice president on twitter, quote, looks like Bernie Sanders is history. Sleepy Joe Biden is pulling ahead. And think about it, I'm only here because of Sleepy Joe.  And the man who took him off the one percent trash heap, President O.  China wants Sleepy Joe badly.

And Biden in Philadelphia this weekend knocking Trump and claiming the Obama administration deserves credit for the booming economy.

JOE BIDEN, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I know President Trump likes to take credit for the economy and the economic growth and the low unemployment numbers, but just look at the facts. Not the alternative facts. President Trump inherited an economy from Obama-Biden administration that was given to him just like he inherited everything else in his life.

PERINO: All right. So, Juan, Biden rebranding the Obama administration to the Obama-Biden administration. I'm going to say all as one word now.
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I think it helps him. Especially helps him with black voters, minority voters. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WILLIAMS: I think what struck me, though, is that he is really intent on the idea of saying, you know what? We're not angry. Despite all the talk about Democrats wants to impeach Trump, Democrats are so angry, that defines the Democratic base. Nope, he's saying, you know what? People like the idea that we would return to stability and civil discourse and civil debate. And I think that's a winning ticket.
That's not only, I might add, a rebuttal to Trump, I think it's a rebuttal to other Democrats.
PERINO: Maybe. But, Jesse, do you think that Biden -- you can't go for 16 months and not counter punch.

JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah. I mean, he's running on unity. He can't even unify his own party. I think he misreads the American people, this is a rambunctious country. We want entertainment. We're thirsty.  We're hungry. We want action. Restoring the Obama years is not a selling point. One of the reasons Trump was elected is because of Obama-Biden.  You know that whole system didn't work for the forgotten men and women of this country.
And that's why Trump came in to shake things up. If you look at -- Biden has been here for 30 years. And now he's going to come around and say, oh, yeah, Trump broke everything in two. I mean, Biden gave us NAFTA. Biden gave us China and the WTO. Biden gave us an economy that wasn't working for people in manufacturing jobs. So I don't think that's going to stick.
WILLIAMS: And Trump has given us what? Tariffs? Oh --

PERINO: The interesting dichotomy of both groups, the Democrats and Republicans, fighting over the economy, both sides seem to think that it's very clear to them, if you're a Democrat, you're like, obviously, this great economy is because of all the things Obama did over the years to pull us out of the great recession.
And the Trump people are like, well, no, you had eight years to do that, and it took President Trump doing deregulation and tax reform in order to juice the economy.

KILMEADE: Those are the days of decorum and everyone was nice to each other. And then when President Trump takes over he's now doing this for two and a half years, he takes full credit for that. So I'm astounded on what's going on. I do think, Juan, the thing that -- I do like Biden's lines. I think it's well written. It's a nice twist. Even though he says he's coming out unifying and he wants to -- he's not angry. He sounds angry. Every time I hear him deliver, he sounds -- directly he sounds angry. He's sounds ticked off.
PERINO: Can I play it for people?
KILMEADE: Yeah, if you have the VCR.

BIDEN: Some really smart folks say Democrats don't want to hear about unity. They say Democrats are so angry that the anger candidate can be the better chance here. She has to win the Democratic nomination. Well, I don't believe it. I really don't. If Democrats -- I believe Democrats wants to unify this nation. That's what our party has always been about.  That's what it's always been about, unity.

KILMEADE: See, that was kind of mellow. The beginning was a little bit harsh. I don't know the answer to this. But Joe Biden came out and flew in the face of every expert who said that once he gets out there, he was going to drop a steady rose. And he did it by not apologizing. He didn't apologize for the crime bill, didn't really apologize for Anita Hill. The touching, he didn't apologize for that. Reparations -- I'm bringing that up. Medicare for all, that won't work. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
So he flew in the face on everything the Democrats said that they needed to be successful and he rose five points. I don't know the answer to that.  Something is going on. I know we haven't really started yet, but there's something going on. The experts don't really know.

WILLIAMS: I think it's pretty clear. But I want Emily to pop --
EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST: I think what's going to be interesting is Pennsylvania, specifically, right, where the president is holding his rally tonight. He won that county by almost 23,000 votes in 2016, which is a lot considering that he won the state but less than 70,000. And he's doubling down on his 2016 strategy, right? We learned today that I think the focus of this campaign is gonna be the economy and also immigration.
And in that county, specifically, there's a heavy manufacturing presence, and it's also really rural. And so his China and tariffs emphasis will likely really resonate especially with those people with which MAGA resonated in 2016 who felt forgotten. And so it will be interesting to see if Biden kind of, a, flying in the face of what you just said, and then also that almost kind of archaic out of touchness. How that will compete with Trump's strategy --

KILMEADE: It's a new era.
PERINO: And, Juan, I'll mention this to you and then we'll get to Mayor Pete in just a moment. So this is Biden on the Hyde Amendment. Now the Hyde Amendment basically says no taxpayer dollars can go to publicly funded abortions, OK? He is now saying that he would change that. The question was -- I'm glad you said you would commit to abolishing the Hyde Amendment, and Biden says right now it has to be -- it can't stay. That's a pretty big change.

WILLIAMS: It is a big change. But, again, I think that -- in a moment when you see the pro-life people on the offensive, believing that the changes of the Supreme Court and Trump in the White House is a moment to ban abortion in the country, and you have Alabama passing a bill that even, you know, Pat Robertson and -- by the way, Donald Trump say is -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

PERINO: Too much.

        }
      
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: But right now in the polls, he's lagging even with non-college educated white women. And this issue is about women. So you have now Biden coming out and saying, listen, in fact, I believe that the government should help women in terms of family planning, emergency situations. You know, we're not talking about infanticide and late term abortions.

WATTERS: Yeah, the party is going far left on abortion, and that's going to be Biden's problem. He's going to be dragged further to the left on all these issues. And I think it's going to hurt him in the general if he even survives the primary.
PERINO: It's 16 -- 16 months is a long time to be the frontrunner, Brian.
KILMEADE: Right. And I guess what Donald Trump is doing. It turns out he wants to run for reelection. He's going to fired up next month. And then it's going to be really difficult. I laughed when Mayor Pete came out and said, I don't really like the tweets. I'm going to ignore the tweets.  Nice try. There's a lot of people ignore the tweets. You can't ignore the tweets. When they come at you and the press asks you about them, you can't ignore it --

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Kamala Harris pitching a new plan that punishes large companies in order to close the gender wage gap. The 2020 Democrat says she'll fine employers if they don't pay men and women the same salaries. Companies could be forced to give up 1 percent of their profits for every 1 percent in wage gap. Harris explaining more about her plan earlier, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: What I am proposing is we shift the burden. It should not be on that working woman to prove it. It should instead be on that large corporation to prove they're paying people for equal work equally. It's that simple. So it is my intention to correct what has been wrong about the way we have designed the system.

        }
      
COMPAGNO: So this is Kamala's third major policy proposal, by the way.  And Elizabeth Warren has submitted almost double that. And they're both in single digits, so interestingly for as many Democrats may support these kinds of policies, it's failing to build momentum in that way. And, Dana, I want to start with you, do you think that holding companies hostage in this way is effective policy? Will it resonate potentially with Democrats?
PERINO: Remember, so she's -- with this policy proposal, she is not trying to win a general election, she's trying to win the Democratic primary, or at least trying to climb up a little bit more so that she can remain -- sort of a upper tier contention, even though right now she is down in a single digit.
So this poll is very well. I wouldn't say just for Democrats. Like, people like fairness, equality, things like that. But as a conservative, Republicans would say, well, wait. Well, why is the government going to know what I'm paying anybody anyway? So she would set up a commission. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Like, I'm not for the government getting into everybody's business on this.  Now the question would be like as woman continue to do better in law schools, in medical schools, et cetera, would the same be true if the reverse happened? Like, what if women were being paid more than men in certain cases? Would the fine and the penalty also be put in place? She doesn't address that.
COMPAGNO: Great point. Juan, in California where Kamala represents, is from, it has the narrowest wage -- gender wage gap in the country. It's 89 cents to the dollar without that policy. So why do we need that policy now?
WILLIAMS: Well, you just said it. It's 89 cents to a dollar. Why wouldn't you want to be paid equally if you're equally prepared, equally --
COMPAGNO: It's continuing to close. Like it's -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, yeah. I think it is continuing to close. And I mean it's like, you know, the work force now, I think, is predominantly female for the first time in American history. I'm sorry.
PERINO: I think -- so the market and pressure from people talking about this is actually working.
WILLIAMS: Well, it's not just market. I mean, we have things like the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Act. We have other kind of equal pay incentives that have put in place because you hear large complaints. But, again, in terms of the politics, this comes back to the fact that in 2016, I think it was 52 percent of the voters were females. And right now you see people like Kamala Harris saying I want to be the candidate for women in America.
She's already proposed, one of the three proposals Emily mentioned, raising pay for teachers. Lot of teacher strikes around the country, predominantly female work force and they feel ignored.

COMPAGNO: Jesse, isn't this just political pandering? 
WATTERS: Yeah. I think it's headline porn. There's no way this will ever happen and she knows it. She's just trying to get attention and reboot the campaign because she's slipped. I find it funny that the Democrats on abortion say they don't want the government involved in people's private live, but now they want the government involved in people's private business.
If you have Jim, OK, the company. Jim is on a sales team, a sales associate, let's call him. That's the title. And he has an MBA. He's been in the business for ten years and he has 50 clients. And then you have Teresa. Now, Teresa has been in the business five years. She doesn't have an MBA and she has 25 clients. Under Kamala's bill, you'd have to pay them the same --

(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: We need to bring this up again.
WATTERS: Let's level the playing field.
KILMEADE: Yeah. I just want to point out in the break, we were kind of -- I was sounding out this talking point --
WATTERS: Yeah, we were saying don't say it on air.

(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: That Emily has gotten to me last.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
KILMEADE: So this is what I would say. I would say a couple of things.  In our business system there's hypocrisy. I mean, for the most part, Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters, they were the big stars, they got paid more than a guy who might not have a big name. Because if you're bringing ratings, you're bringing advertising, I, to me, I always thought you're growing to get paid. I don't know if it was Katie Couric, or Matt Lauer, the one that's the heavyweight gets paid regardless of gender.
Right now they say women get 80 cents on the dollar. Black women get 69 cents on the dollar. Latinos get 62 cents on the dollar. I'd like to see that gap narrow. But I don't know how you find out because these salaries are secret, number one. And number two is, now the situation is they believe -- they're actually trying to find people in noncompliance. They want to raise $180 billion in ten years for companies who aren't in compliance. That's --
PERINO: So they actually really don't want to solve the problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

KILMEADE: They wanted to be bad.
WATTERS: Good job, Brian.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: You did a good job there.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But here's the thing, so I was reading this week something Elizabeth through a journalist in D.C. And she was talking about how when she was at a good publication with men, the men all got jobs at the New York Times, the Washington Post, and that's where the salaries boom. She never was able to get into that group.
And if you talked to people, Barbara Walters included, about their experiences, Brian -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KILMEADE: Seventies.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. They say, hey, listen, you know to be a woman in TV -- oh, especially as you got older, you didn't get paid more. You got the boot.
WATTERS: Right.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: It's a different time. But you talked about women at the top of their career, the big names, right? You're not talking about people who are entry or trying to move up. And I think there is a disparity.
COMPAGNO: There's a lot -- I think there's a lot of reasons and factors that go into that disparity that you have to account for from an investment standpoint. So for example, you're not going to have more female attorneys than men until you go back to school and law schools and whatnot. There's an investment that needs to happen in different ways. And I think hamstringing companies is not the right way to account for whatever the back flow is, and especially those qualities that you can't qualify.
PERINO: And also -- from a free market perspective, competition really does matter, like we're in very a tight job market. Remember was it salesforce.com did that big audit of their own books? And they found out, oh, my gosh, we're not paying women as much. So they worked to make it up to them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Other companies started the say audit. There was a similar company, they actually found out they were paying women more than the men, so then they have to increase those salaries. I do think that the peer pressure from your competitors does help this issue.
WATTERS: And I would like to see Kamala Harris' senate staff salaries numbers to see if she actually is --
KILMEADE: Right.
WATTERS: -- her men more or less than the women. I know Hillary Clinton when she made a big deal about the gender wage gap actually paid females less than men.
COMPAGNO: All right you guys. We have to go. But is Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez next in line to run America's biggest city? The details next.

(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: It was jarring. Hey, Bill de Blasio is only five days into his pipe dream quest for the White House, but speculation is already swirling about who should succeed the disastrous Democrat as New York City mayor.  The paper floating this, this is the New York Sun, the idea of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as being the perfect candidate who were to run for the top job in the city.
I'll bring you a quote out of the article and I just rip it on the edges.  I couldn't find a knife. One could imagine that the prospect of mayoral race would look attractive to the young fire brand with a, we don't mind saying, quick wit and taste for lime light. What kind of mayor would AOC be? What do you think, Dana?
PERINO: Well, one, I think that this shows an obvious lack of imagination, or total laziness, or they really don't want her to be in the Congress, right?
KILMEADE: So they wanted her --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Like, get her off the stage because she is now the -- besides President Trump, the most popular politician -- no offense to the Biden team. Like, the mayor's office, you have to have executive decision -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KILMEADE: Yes.
PERINO: She's been in Congress for about six months. So I -- like her executive decision making makes Bill de Blasio look like Mike Bloomberg.  And that is why -- I think she should just stay where she is. She's in -- she's in that poll position to -- she could be a king maker.
KILMEADE: Right. I find her decisive, confident, charismatic and hard working. Jesse, can you fault me on any of those four qualities I pointed out?
WATTERS: You just want her to run for mayor so you can cover her on Fox & Friends every single day. You know the New York Post would love AOC as mayor.
KILMEADE: And all four things I've said were 100 percent right.
WATTERS: It's true.

        }
      
PERINO: You're right.
WATTERS: And she's got everything that you've said. But like Dana said, she does not have the technical acumen, the managerial experience to run the city, because the city needs to be run. You can't just tweet about the price of croissants or talk about socialism in theory, because in practice --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: -- the city has to run smoothly. And in a way, it might be good for her to be mayor because she would run the city so fast into the ground, you definitely get a Republican after the first term.
KILMEADE: We were on automatic pilot right now, Emily. We have a mayor that works out --
WATTERS: The show or the --

(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: Were we live? At 10 o'clock he works out. At 12 o'clock, he gets to the office. According to the New York Post, lays down in his office with the door open with the newspaper on his head and the city is still running. Why AOC has nothing about a workaholic. She'd be great.
COMPAGNO: I hear what you're saying. He's definitely is just like rock bottom. And that's why he has a 18 percent approval rate in the city.  You're right that there's no worse that she can do, especially given the energy bill that the major just passed, which all the buildings have to be like made of seaweed or whatever.
Definitely option C. I think it's wishful thinking on the part of the Democrats to remove her from the national stage because she is driving policy and conversation. You guys look at America is, it's the Khloe Kardashian genes line. Bear with me for a second. Basically I get their emails, whatever. And it said --
WATTERS: No, I did not know that.
PERINO: I'm listening.
COMPAGNO: It says -- it was like just like hoops and red lipstick go together on AOC, so too does our looks. So basically in all facets of kind of normal life outside of a political sphere, people are referencing her.  She is a goddess to them.
And so you're right that it needs to be harnessed in some way, think the Democrats, but they want to contain her. And they're raising, by the way, of saying, oh, she'll probably be fatigued if the Republicans take back over the House in 2020, I think is really infantilizing and kind of lame.
KILMEADE: Would your wear those jeans, Juan?
WILLIAMS: You know, if I could fit in --
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: You know, gee, mom jeans for me. But I must say, I think that Dana is on point. I think the rest of you missed it here.
COMPAGNO: I agreed with her.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Let me tell you, Dana is on point. And first, this is a conversation among Republicans in the Sun, people at a dinner party, Upper East Side types, having a conversation, this is not the same electorate.  And the second thing is, guess what? They are thinking, oh, de Blasio hit rock bottom. Then you say, oh, she's going to take us further down.  That's craziness.
COMPAGNO: Well, she killed the Amazon deal.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: I bet she should be better.
WILLIAMS: I think Mike Bloomberg thought that this was great training. I think Rudy Giuliani thought it was great training. You're dealing with national security. You're dealing with a big school system. You're dealing with a large police force. All these issues are there.
The question is, does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez get kicked out, do Republicans regain the House next time around? Does she decide, oh, maybe I should challenge Charles Schumer in New York for the senate seat.
WATTERS: Juan, I know America's mayor and AOC is no America's mayor.
WILLIAMS: Yeah, thank God.
(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: Oh, Rudy -- he paved the roads. We stopped shop lifters, pick pockets --
WILLIAMS: Yeah.
KILMEADE: -- PG boys.
WATTERS: Show me the pick-pocketer.
WILLIAMS: You know what I'm going to use one of Jesse's lines. He opened the door for de Blasio. His policies.
WATTERS: Bloomberg.
WILLIAMS: I'm saying that those kinds of harsh policies. Giuliani time in the like. Boy, I tell you it changed the attitude.
WATTERS: I think those are the things that clean this.
WILLIAMS: Oh! I see. Very good.
KILMEADE: Hey listen. I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for bringing in this block and taking us out. You guys stand back. I have to look straight ahead.

WILLIAMS: Wow. Smith's generous gift to pay off the student loan debt for nearly 400 graduates may be worth a whopping $40 million, but it raises a bigger question, is the student loan debt crisis so bad that we need to rely on people like Smith. Jesse, what do you say?
WATTERS: I just like watching the guy's face in the corner when he heard he got his debt cleared. That was pretty good. I think it summed it up. It's funny to hear people like politicians that have driven this country into 22 trillion in debt. Lecture everybody else about now they have to solve the problem of debt. Usually, the government creates the problem and then they have to come in and solve it. Also, the press, all these journalists, they're up to their ears in credit card debt and they've been saying it's not a crisis at the border, but we have a President crisis, please. Why don't we just get a bunch of billionaires you know like Bezos, Bill Gates.
WILLIAMS: Warren Buffet.
WATTERS: Warren Buffett. Maybe they can pony up a few billion to clear the student loan debt. Or how about these universities, they have tons of endowment money. They can do the same thing. Top 10 percent in your class graduates. They can get their student debt cleared or all these great companies. Amazon, great company. Jeff Bezos. He could pony up a few dollars to help.
KILMEADE: But why should he have to though. That's the whole thing. Should he have to.
WATTERS: It's for a tax write-off.
KILMEADE: So, we want to go to Michigan or out of state and it's a goal of a lifetime to go to Michigan, it's $72,000. My parents really can't afford it, so I take out a loan as a parent and then the kid takes out a loan and they have a great time and they look around and they get, their first jobs $50,000 and next you know their payments $500, $550 a month and that's after you've already paid your taxes. So, if you make 50,000, you probably take it on 32,000 and then you're paying that much. It's hard to pay for rent, utilities, phone. So maybe it's an impossible equation. That'd be some pushback, so we don't need the billionaire commencement speakers.
WILLIAMS: Emily, I think Brian reflects something I see which is it's harder for young people these days to go to graduate school, because they say you know I've got to start paying back the debt and I want to take out more money to go to graduate school. It's harder for them than to buy a house and move out of the parent's house slows down a decision to get - it really interferes with growth, I think.
COMPAGNO: well, the saddest part about having to make that determination you know do I have a house and stability or a graduate degree. If that's the decision is the fact that it is put in place from pensions and from the bankrupt debacles that every state engages in, the recent tuition is so high is because it is accounting for the pensions of the employees and it's a totally desperate situation.
It's not because the value of the education is such and I think what the situation illustrates to me is A, capitalism works. This is a self-made billionaire who is choosing what to do with his 4 billion. He's choosing to extend $40 million in that way in a charitable endeavor and charges those graduates with doing the same with basically saying here you too encompass tenacity and then give back to your community.
And if the government were to do it by the way then that's our money. So, for me, I'm like he can do what he wants. That's amazing. But it's an illustration why it should absolutely not be the government that forgives debt and does that.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana aren't they lucky they didn't invite me to give that commencement?
PERINO: That'd be lesson. You can imagine no journalist in the nation and every alumni association probably called their friends.
WILLIAMS: Yes. Wow.
PERINO: Did you see what--
WILLIAMS: Robert Smith did.
PERINO: And in some ways, you know that again talking about that peer pressure and the competition it somewhat works. You remember when Langone paid for all that medical school tuition at NYU. What happened next? John Hopkins figured out a way to do that and it could be the same thing here, which is you know like you think of Bill and Melinda Gates that have done and Warren Buffett, they've done the billionaire challenge like how much will you give away and you make a commitment and you do that. But the thing is Jesse even if there is $1.56 trillion.
WATTERS: It's not even close.
PERINO: In Student loans. So, there is not enough. And the other problem is the creditors have to be paid. You can't just wipe it out.
KILMEADE: Warren wants to just wipe it out.
PERINO: Right. Elizabeth Warren would just say, OK well screw the creditors, like we'll just go ahead and pay this up. I understand. I don't want young people to feel this burden. But you also have the moral hazard. You took out the loan, you should have to pay for it. I do think this is where innovation makes the most sense in two ways, one if you look at Purdue University, where former Governor Mitch Daniels is the President there. He's figured out a way to work with employers in the area that want to hire good people. So, they put him in the pipeline. OK, what you want to hire Emily. She's going to graduate in two years. You're going to put forward 60 percent of her tuition for the next two years, great. You signed a contract. Emily you had to go work there for two years. That might be a good relationship going forward.
And then there's also the other thing is companies that are willing to pay for your student loan. Again, type job market. How do you want to attract employees? Are you willing to take on their student loan?
WATTERS: Don't major in women's studies or--
PERINO: I agree with that too.
WATTERS: Or architecture or you know--
PERINO: Architecture is good.
WATTERS: Like art history. That's what I mean. Don't major in something you're not going to get a bang--
PERINO: But I don't know, our history. Like, remember what we say last week.
WILLIAMS: Jeff Coon.
PERINO: $92 million for the Monet that sold the other--
WILLIAMS: I'm so glad - excuse me, Mr. Liberal Arts. What did you major?
WATTERS: History.
WILLIAMS: Your parents must have been so upset. They said, how will Jesse ever earn?
WATTERS: I didn't major in women's studies.
KILMEADE: I have a hypothetical.
WILLIAMS: What?
KILMEADE: Jesse Watters, a sophomore in college. Fox gets wind in this talented sophomore.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
KILMEADE: Would they have paid for Jesse's last two years of college.
WILLIAMS: I doubt it.
KILMEADE: As long as you guaranteed to go work for Fox. Would that have happened, Jesse? And that's the Mitch scenario.
WATTERS: No one recruited me out of college. Let's put it that way.
KILMEADE: Really?
WILLIAMS: No, for good looks, we would have picked your number one.
WATTERS: Thank you, Juan.
WILLIAMS: But I must say at one critical point here. I noticed the Republicans aren't talking about this issue. The Democrats are talking about it. Somebody should talk about it.
KILMEADE: It's a hot issue.
WILLIAMS: It is a hot issue.
KILMEADE: Absolutely.
WILLIAMS: All right, coming up, a shocking video of Arnold Schwarzenegger getting kicked in the back. The crackdown meanwhile on texting while walking, I'm all for that and the kiss diss at the PGA Championship. It's gone viral. Next in the Fastest 7 with our number one pick, Jesse Waters.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest 7. It's never a good idea to take on the Terminator. Check out this crazy video of Arnold Schwarzenegger getting drop kicked from behind and he barely flinches. Arnold said, he didn't even realize he was kicked until he saw the video and added that he's just glad that the "idiot didn't interrupt his Snapchat". Luckily for the guy the Governator isn't pressing charges. Brian, it's like such a power move to say, I didn't even feel anything.
KILMEADE: But he's got these muscle guys behind him. Huge security guys in - with doing this thing in South Africa and they wouldn't beat the hell out of him. He said I didn't turn around I don't want to get - didn't want to have to get revenge on him. No kidding. That's why you get the muscle guys beating up on him or those--
WATTERS: I mean he really barely moved after he got kicked right there.
PERINO: Well, how gracious to say that he's not going to press charges, right. That's pretty impressive.
WILLIAMS: Well, how stupid is the kid. I guess I'm just trying to get in the kids--
KILMEADE: He's trying to get famous.
WILLIAMS: Or is he thinking this is Mr. Muscles. This is the terminator and I'm going to knock him over and in my mind I'm a fantasy hero.
WATTERS: Yes.
KILMEADE: And that's why I just want to mention his name or sue him or put him in the lock up.
WATTERS: And he didn't even knock him over, which was pretty bad.
WILLIAMS: You know what, I don't want people doing that to me.
WATTERS: Don't drop kick Juan.
WILLIAMS: Please.
WATTERS: Leave that to me.
COMPAGNO: I just thought he had the perfect response which was with humor and then directing attention to his cause which is Arnold Sports Athletes and he basically said look, don't share that video, show this video.
WATTERS: Up next, we've all seen what can happen if you're texting while walking like this woman falling into a fountain at a mall. Well, here in New York lawmakers want to make it illegal to look at your phone while crossing the street and find people up to $250. If the bill passes, New York would become the first state to put in place that kind of ban. Do we like this or not?
KILMEADE: Well, put it this way since 2009, 46 - pedestrian deaths have gone up 46 percent. Two reasons. Pot and texting.
WATTERS: You know that--
KILMEADE: And people are high--
WATTERS: People are high and texting, one or the other. Maybe at the same time.
KILMEADE: Exactly. I'm just telling you it's not a coincidence. And I just don't think - you're going to find people for everything these days, but they're trying to do in six other states. They tried it in Honolulu, and they said that things didn't change.
WATTERS: Yes. I don't know if this type of fine is going to change behavior. Do you agree?
PERINO: I don't know, I don't like to be hyper regulated. However, I did almost see somebody die this way and luckily, she was doing this, and she had her headphones in.
KILMEADE: Is that you right there.
WATTERS: That was you.
PERINO: So, she had her headphones in, and she didn't - she was just stepped right out, and this guy grabbed her by the back of the jacket and yanked her back just in time. And I also, eight years ago when I first moved here, walking and doing the same thing and I almost fell down the steps of a subway entrance and learned my lesson and I don't do it anymore.
KILMEADE: That's the first time you took the subway.
WATTERS: We kind of do like people texting while walking, because it gives us this great video clips, Juan don't you agree?
WILLIAMS: No, I'm stunned. In fact, last week, I think I mentioned you guys that I'm walking down the street and I started counting how many people are actually walking versus either talking on the phone or texting on the phone. Some of them may be just reading the phone, but it's the clear majority walking down in New York City street. It's crazy and then you come to the intersection. Now my problem is what was cited earlier, I don't think this is the role for the government. I don't want him telling people what they can do and can't do. I think we're in the midst of a cultural shift. Parents should say something to the young people. I think schools have to educate people in terms of how they deal with social media. But right now, people don't know how to handle it.
WATTERS: Yes, because I used to walk down the street and people used to just get out of my way.
KILMEADE: Not anymore.
WATTERS: Now, they don't see me, they're walking right into me.
COMPAGNO: Yes, I think honestly walking on the streets it's like mad mean trying to - and it makes you who is paying attention have to do the like and left and right and whatever because the person on their phone is just not carrying.
WATTERS: Yes, it upsets the social hierarchy when people don't know who to get out of the way for. It messes with everyone.
COMPAGNO: By the way, those cities that tried to do before, Honolulu's fine is a tiered fine system. It just started at $15, so I think that's partly why the deterrence didn't work. But in Montclair in California, the first offense was $100. So, I also think that the level of fine that you would have--
PERINO: I think that also you find people because it's actually - it's - if you get hit by some - you don't want individuals to get hurt but also, I don't want to hit you.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: And then is my problem.
COMPAGNO: Yes, exactly.
PERINO: I don't want that.
WATTERS: OK.
PERINO: That's why I would find them.
WATTERS: Finally Brooks (ph) doesn't kiss and then play golf. He apparently was so laser focused that he ignored his girlfriend's attempts to give him a good luck kiss before the final round of the PGA Championships. Don't worry though, he later made up for the diss after winning the tournament. Brian--
KILMEADE: Totally get it. It's before the tournament. The guy's got a lock down the PGA Championship, you can't be making out with people.
WATTERS: It's not a make out, maybe just receiving a peck.
KILMEADE: It could escalate.
WATTERS: It could have escalated like a full on make out session on the way to the tournament.
KILMEADE: He would have put back to her.
WATTERS: I wouldn't blame the kiss, right.
PERINO: He didn't look happy.
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: After the diss.
WATTERS: It was funny how she tried to play it off Juan like it never happened.
WILLIAMS: I don't know. You know to me I think public displays of affection; I don't think that was the place for it. And clearly, she didn't get it. You know he's focused.
WATTERS: I blame her for trying to go for the kiss.
PERINO: Always blaming women.
WATTERS: I'm saying, don't kiss her before I come on set of THE FIVE.
WILLIAMS: That's right.
COMPAGNO: I agree with that though. Like no role. It is not about you and I feel like she keeps thinking it is, which is probably why that photo after with a trophy like that is all for her Insta. If you are the pro-athlete and you're 30 seconds before game time like you sit, do not even talk to him. I feel like that.
WATTERS: At least she didn't text and then just walk into him and trip him. Or high.
KILMEADE: Maybe she was.
WATTERS: All right. Up next, One More Thing.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Time now for One More Thing. Listen up Massachusetts, a 3-year-old former police dog in your state is looking for a loving new home after losing one of his legs to cancer. He forced his retirement from the force. His name is Blue. He's a former canine bloodhound. He was a prize member of the Billerica Police Department for over two years. So, he's diagnosed last month because they felt this little troublesome growth and it turned out it was a soft tissue tumor. Blue was taken in by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals where he's already as you can see making some big strides, but he's waiting to find his forever home. So, you can check our Facebook page. We'll have more on that.
And also, in the spirit of recovery and giving back, I wanted to mention Mercy Ships. That's an organization of course I talk about it a lot. They are looking for some volunteers and if you want a life-changing experience, they need all sorts of people, go to their website. mercyships.org and in media relations, they need a captain, they're looking for engineers as well as nursing staff. Jesse?
WATTERS: Jesse's taxi tales, are you guys ready for this one.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
WATTERS: OK. Sometimes taxi drivers graphic - I'm not driving the taxi.
KILMEADE: You're not even in the front or the wind shield.
WATTERS: All right. That's crazy. So, I lost my wallet and my phone in the backseat of a taxi and I called the phone an hour later. Guy picks, he's all the way in Queens. They drive the taxi all the way back to Manhattan and deliver me my phone.
PERINO: Did you tip him well?
WATTERS: Well, they charge me for the trip, but I mean I did throw a really fat tip. Can you believe that? I mean these guys are so honest and so nice. I Uber New York City taxi. It's a tossup.
PERINO: I'm going for the taxi.
WATTERS: I'm going for taxis. These guys are great.
PERINO: All right, Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right, grab your hat Auntie Em. Another tornado's coming folks. It's peak tornado season in the Midwest. So, take a look will you at this video. That video was done by AccuWeather storm chaser Reed Timmer. He shot the storm in Cook County, Nebraska Saturday. Since Friday at least 38 tornadoes have been reported in Kansas, Nebraska and Texas, Saturday. 11 tornadoes alone. Severe weather remains a threat for at least 48 million according to the National Weather Service. By the way, the Mississippi River has been over flood stage for 131 days a record. And Reed Timmer just so you know he was not hurt despite being unable to see his hand as the tornado swallowed him up.
That intense weather reminds me of a quote from The Wizard of Oz. We're not in Kansas anymore.
PERINO: Yes. And actually, severe weather apparently is still ongoing so make sure you're checking in with your local authorities and doing what you need to do. Brian.
KILMEADE: All right, Dana. This is for the history major, Jesse Watters. If you want to see if you like the series The FOX Nation series What Made America Great, I'm bringing it to the stage, it's going to be in Bonita, Springs; Orlando, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama. So, I'm able to take what we did on Fox Nation the 10 and then also have a chance to talk about George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson Tripoli Pirates, Andrew Jackson miracle of New Orleans and the soon to be published if I'm done within the next two and a half weeks. Sam Houston and the Alamo Avengers and I get a chance to interact with everyone, so it's probably the most fun I'll ever have.
PERINO: And do you make fun of Greg Gutfeld on stage?
KILMEADE: I will not do that.
PERINO: Because he would do that about you.
KILMEADE: I think he is doing it about me according to many sources. Slash tour.
PERINO: Check it out. Emily.
COMPAGNO: All right, you guys, you all know that I love my 1972 Mach 1. Well, she has recently undergone an overhaul so that's her before, this is her after.
PERINO: Wow.
COMPAGNO: She's already for the 2019 Hot Rod Power Tour, which Fox will be covering. So, you will be able to come along with me and I'm racing in this - I'm participating in that event along to celebrate the debut of this amazing charity, it's called 4vrRIP. It's launching during the Power Tour and it restores the classic cars left behind by those service members and first responders killed in action. So, stay tuned, because I'm going to be burning rubber for a great cause. We'll have drag racing. We're going through five different states. It'll be a really great time.
WATTERS: You're going to be behind the wheel?
COMPAGNO: Yes, that's my car.
WATTERS: Wow.
KILMEADE: Fantastic.
WILLIAMS: Does that comes from your dad or your mom?
COMPAGNO: My dad is like super Italian, so he loved cars, but not muscle cars like that. So, I grew up going to car shows with him and whatnot. He had kind of like a different appreciation, different style. And then for some reason I just like love--
PERINO: You just love it. And you're doing it for a really good cause too.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
PERINO: All right, great show. Good way to start the week. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of "The Five."
