BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. 
Breaking tonight, a former lawyer with the FBI will plead guilty to making a false statement in the investigation into the origins of the Russia collusion probe. It is the first criminal case ahead of a report President Trump has predicted will expose illegal surveillance of his campaign under the Obama administration. The long-awaited investigation by prosecutor John Durham.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have Fox team coverage tonight. John Roberts at the White House as the president's reaction to this news. Correspondent David Spunt though starts us off tonight from Bridgewater, New Jersey, the details of the case. Good evening, David.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. This is the first tangible result of the John Durham investigation. We've been hearing about it for more than a year right now. Finally, the results are starting to show in this investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You mentioned that former FBI attorney, his name is Kevin Clinesmith. He will plead guilty to falsifying a document. This all just breaking a few hours ago. 
Now, the document is part of a larger document collection used to issue a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Mr. Clinesmith worked in the FBI General Counsel Office and altered an e-mail to say that Page was not a source for the CIA but he indeed was at some point in time.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The FBI never disclosed the CIA paid relationship because Clinesmith changed the wording. Clinesmith's attorney in a statement to Fox News wrote that Kevin deeply regrets having altered the e-mail. It was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility. 
That brought the Durham investigation name for U.S. Attorney John Durham appointed by Attorney General Bill Barr. Bill Barr finding himself under increasing criticism for a probe that yielding results right now so close to the November election.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: We're not going to do anything inappropriate before the election, but we're not being dictated to by the schedule. What's dictating the timing of this are developments in the case.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

SPUNT: The FBI rarely comments on an active investigation, today's an exception. In a statement to Fox News, an FBI spokesperson wrote, under Director Wray's leadership, the FBI has been, and will continue to be, fully cooperative with Mr. Durham's review. This includes providing documents and assigning personnel to assist his team. 
Now, John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut Bret, as you know and as we've said, he can criminally charge if he wants to, it's possible. There could be indictments over the next few months. The DOJ official tells me that Durham probe expected to be wrapped up. But I do use a word expected to be wrapped up sometime in the next month, Bret.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BAIER: We'll see. David Spunt, thank you. 
President Trump says he expects this to be the first of many developments resulting from the Durham investigation. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts has that part of the story from the North Lawn tonight. Good evening, John. 
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. For two years, President Trump fumed as the special counsel Robert Mueller put his campaign and his White House under a microscope and said several of the president's former associates off to prison.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
So, it was with some degree of satisfaction that the president today watched what may be the first of many shoes to drop on the other side.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

ROBERTS: President Trump today found another reason to feel vindicated in the Russia probe with the announcement that former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will plead guilty for falsifying an application for a FISA surveillance warrant.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, that's just the beginning, I would imagine because what happened should never happen again. They spied on my campaign and they got caught. 
ROBERTS: The president today also keeping up the pressure on Democrats to come back to the table for another coronavirus relief bill.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

In a series of tweets saying, he is ready to send direct payments $3,400 for a family of four to all Americans. Send additional PPP payments to small businesses and send more money to states and local governments to save jobs for police, firefighters, first responders and teachers. But that Democrats are holding this up.

        }
      
One of the sticking points in a possible deal has been money Democrats want for the post office, including $3.5 billion to handle mass mail-in voting. 
President Trump has been highly critical of that demand but today indicated, if Democrats agree to what he is asking for, he'd be willing to deal on the post office.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

ROBERTS: So, if they were to give you that, would you sign off for the money for the Postal Service? 
TRUMP: Yes, but they're not giving it to me, they're giving it to the American people. I mean, giving it -- 
ROBERTS: But if they were to agree with that.

        }
      
ROBERTS: The apparent willingness to compromise was lost on Democrats who simply kept hammering the president over the effects of new cost cutting measures at the post office. 
In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer saying, the president made plain that he will manipulate the operations of the post office to deny eligible voters the ballot in pursuit of his own reelection.

SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): That's what real leadership looks like. 
ROBERTS: President Trump also defended his assessment of Joe Biden's newly minted running mate. Insisting, he wasn't being blunt when he described Kamala Harris as being extraordinarily nasty and mean.

Very quickly, the U.S. Postal Service's inspector general, we're being told right now, breaking, that is reviewing the policy changes implemented by the new Postmaster General and looking into all of this as John mentioned. There's that continue -- that story continues. 
A federal appeals court meantime has overturned an order requiring Hillary Clinton and her former chief of staff to sit for a private deposition about her use of a private e-mail server for government work when she served as secretary of state.

Let's bring in our panel early tonight. Josh Kraushaar, politics editor for National Journal. Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and Bill McGurn, columnist for the Wall Street journal. 
Mollie, let me start with you. This isn't getting a ton of coverage as you can imagine this development today. But it is a big development as you -- we heard from the attorney general on "SEAN HANNITY SHOW" last night that he kind of forecast that something was going to happen.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Well, for years, there were a group of opponents of President Trump who worked together to spread a false and damaging conspiracy theory that Trump and his campaign were Russian operatives who had stolen the election. 
This was something that was spread day after day for years. It was weaponized by the federal government and its law enforcement and intelligence agencies; it was spread in part through the Democratic Party in the Never Trump movement. 
And then, it was enabled through co-conspirators in the media who willfully took anonymous leaks to spread this false and dangerous theory.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At the end of the day, not a single American was found to have colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But now, we have the first indication of some measure of accountability for the people who perpetrated this false theory that did so much damage to the Republican president and his voters. 
BAIER: Here's the attorney general kind of foreshadowing this last night with Sean.

BAIER: Josh, the attorney general said that this is not going to be dictated by the election calendar but also said, he expected it to be wrapped up in coming weeks. It obviously does factor in to the political calendar. 
JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICS EDITOR, NATIONAL JOURNAL: Yes, any indictments or any conclusions right in that window for over the next couple months, it's going to create a partisan (INAUDIBLE) people are going to interpret it in partisan ways, so I think there's some risk.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I -- you know, the some risk is this is going to be viewed in a partisan way. And I think, as serious as these -- as the guilty plea is for Clinesmith, from the political perspective, we knew about Clinesmith's involvement from the -- from the I.G. report, the Horowitz report earlier in the year.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think on the issue of how people view Trump and Russia, a lot of the voters who are paying attention are already have their views baked in.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, as far as the politics of any new indictments, any new information, yes, it could move the political needle a little bit but this is an issue where people have made up their minds and they're not probably going to be persuaded -- 
BAIER: I guess the thought process here is he made a plea and usually plea comes with a deal and you don't know what the other side of the deal is in this investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I do, Bill, want to play some of the Democrats assessment of -- when the Durham investigation was getting going and how they looked at this through there, the prison. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have some real concerns about why an independent and separate investigation in addition to the inspector general's investigation was called for. 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): You can assign good people to do an illegitimate investigation. You can assign good people to investigate the president's political rivals. It doesn't mean that the investigation is any less tainted. This is tainted, because of the motivation which is a political one to serve the president's political interests.

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And now, they have an investigation of the investigators were investigating whether or not Vladimir Putin and the Russians engaged in trying to affect our election, give me a break. Gosh almighty.

(END VIDEO CLIP) 
BAIER: Don't Bill Democrats kind of turn this and blow it off, is that a risk? 
BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, look, they talk about this because they don't want to talk about the basic facts. The facts is, this guy was caught red handed. He's an FBI lawyer who altered a document to make Carter Page look guilty and which was then submitted to the FISA court.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, no one's reporting also these other statements that he made. You know, when Trump was elected, viva la resistance and then he was worried that his name was all over the documents investigating President Trump. 
Now, what he's -- what's interesting about this is three things. First, the attorney general last night said this would be a development but a modest one, which it was. 
Second, they implies that there might be bigger developments to come with this. 
Third, it shows that -- you know, when he's making charges, it's not based on novel interpretations of the law, it's based on a pretty black and white case. You know, real meat and potatoes violation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think the big thing that no one's talking about, if you have a deal as you say, there's usually a quid pro quo. It probably means that Clinesmith blabbed. And all the other parties in this have to be wondering what did Clinesmith tell them about me. And it may be a signal also for others. They might want to cut their own deals. 
BAIER: Yes, and we're going to follow all the developments. Well, I want to turn quickly to this, the focus on the post office. We reported that we're getting word that the post office inspector general is looking into the actions of the Postmaster General who knew I didn't have all my bingo card that the post office who was going to be the election topic of August before the conventions. But it is, and the charges that the president is somehow holding back in order to stop mail-in voting, your thoughts on -- 
HEMINGWAY: Well, it does seem all the more important that people really do focus on the integrity of our November election. It was just a few days and weeks ago when people were acting like President Trump was insane to say that there might be problems with mail-in balloting. That messaging has spawned dramatically differently now where they're now claiming that Trump is somehow causing problems for mail-in balloting, thereby conceding that mail-in balloting is something that is fraught with risk. It is important particularly given what we now know about coronavirus and its risks that people work to ensure the integrity of voting in person at our November elections. 
BAIER: Josh, what the president has said publicly raised eyebrows and now they're in this negotiation that has stalled. He has said as late as today, that he wouldn't agree to a deal for funding for the post office and for mail-in ballots if the Democrats came to the table with what the administration wanted.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRAUSHAAR: Yes, there's still room for a compromise to get funding for election administration. And I think Democrats make a mistake by making this a partisan issue because, you know, as Mollie was alluding to, even if there -- everything was going perfectly with the post office -- you know, a significant amount of mail does get lost, it does get misplaced. 
Probably, casting ballots by mail especially in states that don't have a lot of experience with mail-in balloting is a surefire way to lose a whole lot of ballots even in a -- in a good scenario. 
BAIER: Yes, Bill --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KRAUSHAAR: So, Democrats, are making a mistake by having them one send their ballots through the mail instead of doing it early voting or voting in person at some of these polling places. 
BAIER: Bill. 
MCGURN: Yes, I agree. I also think -- look, the president did conflate the two issues. One is just how bad the post office operates today, it's such a dinosaur, it's a monopoly. We have a lot of problems with that, it hemorrhages money. 
And whether they can carry out the election burden of mail-in ballots, but I think the latter is a very legitimate question, people want to know. It's just amazing to me that the more advanced in technology we become, the more doubtful of our election outcomes. 
I do think people have a right to get them quickly and we used to do it a hundred years ago without all this technology and it's ridiculous that we can't do it today. 
BAIER: We're preparing for election night or nights or weeks, either way, we'll be here and have it all covered. Thank you all. See you later in the show.

BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She is someone who I think will be able to share the stage with Mike Pence, or whoever body else, and dissect some of the terrible decisions that have been made over the last four years. 
HEINRICH: The Biden campaign is focusing on showing voters how their administration would address coronavirus differently than President Trump. Yesterday, calling on governors to enact nationwide mass mandates for the next three months, with an unexpected none of agreement from White House epidemiologist Dr. Anthony Fauci. 
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: From myself, personally, I would say everybody should have to use it. 
HEINRICH: The campaign echoing coronavirus criticism in new ads in battleground states.

BAIER: Jacqui, thank you. 
A huge win tonight for gun rights advocates. A federal appeals court has overturned California's ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. The panel's majority ruled the law prohibiting magazines holding more than 10 bullets violates the constitutional right to bear firearms. Gun-control supporters say this ruling is dangerous.

Harris once said on the U.S. Senate floor that people and communities of color are less likely to call police than other people. 
Judge Kenneth Lee, notes, those communities often needed non-law enforcement methods of self-defense, specifically citing attacks by the KKK.

State Department correspondent Rich Edson has details tonight. Good evening, Rich. 
RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. And the State Department has just announced that the U.N. Security Council has rejected an American resolution that would have extended this arms embargo against Iran. Secretary of State, says the U.N. Security Council vote is inexcusable. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: It makes no sense to permit the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to purchase and sell weapon systems. It doesn't make sense for the European people either. 
EDSON: Without United Nation Security Council support, Iran can legally buy conventional weapons starting October 18th, when an international weapons embargo expires. 
POMPEO: We're going to do everything that we can within our diplomatic toolset to ensure that, that arms embargo doesn't expire. 
EDSON: The next diplomatic tool on the administration's list, a controversial maneuver to restore sanctions against Iran, known as snapback, the Trump administration argues it could automatically impose international sanctions against Iran that the 2015 nuclear agreement lifted.

Opponents contend the U.S. surrendered the power to restore those sanctions when it left the Iran deal in 2018. 
In a statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin, writes, "No one should resort to blackmail or dictate in this region as well as anywhere else in the world. Putin, says he wants to host an international summit with the U.S., France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and Iran. President Trump's response to the invitation -- 
TRUMP: I haven't been told of it yet. 
EDSON: U.S. officials, say China and Russia are mostly interested in selling weapons to Iran when or if the arms embargo expires. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
EDSON: The next step is to try to get those sanctions, those automatic snapback sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council. Something that a U.S. official says will be moved forward with a process that will begin likely next week at the Security Council. Bret?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
BAIER: A challenge tonight to the president's appointment of his two top Homeland Security officials, the Government Accountability Office says the hirings of acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf and Deputy Ken Cuccinelli were improper. If challenged in court, it could bring into question the policy actions taken since both men have taken over those jobs. The Homeland Security Department, says the GAO's report though, is baseless. 
Oregon state police are leaving Portland after a two-week assignment to help protect a federal courthouse under attack by protesters. A state police official says forces are moving, "back to counties where prosecution of criminal conduct is still a priority." 
Earlier this week, the county district attorney there, said he will not prosecute people arrested for nonviolent misdemeanors. Since those protests began, more than 500 people have been arrested coming up on 80 days of protests that sometimes have turned into riots and violence. So far, fewer than 50 people are being prosecuted.

BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In its 100-year history, Brandon Transfer and Storage Company in West Palm Beach, Florida has never had a year like this. 
HARZ: Our increase in storage and transit business coming from the north is up 50 percent right now. 
LLENAS: A record, 180 thousand pounds of household items is now sitting in their warehouses sent from people living in cities primarily in the northeast, who are now looking to live in Florida. 
HARZ: We do a lot from Chicago, we're doing a lot of Connecticut, New York, -- North Jersey. 
LLENAS: Dozens and dozens of wooden vaults are stacked floor to ceiling holding sofas, beds, clothes, garden rakes, you name it. 
HARZ: Our increase started about April, but it is steadily increasing, and you know, usually our season ends about the end of September, but we don't see that happening, we see moves booked out into October and November already coming from other parts of the country. 
LLENAS: Amid a pandemic and surging urban violence, people are shipping their stuff away from crowded cities and having it stored as they look for property in Florida's suburbs. And despite being a coronavirus hot spot, Florida's real estate market is highly competitive. 
PETER ANCONA, REALTOR: Pre-pandemic, you know, about 12 months prior to pandemic, we were always seeing an uptick in the northeast buyer coming here. And then, when the pandemic hit, we started getting a lot of different calls where was shocking to us. 
LLENAS: The result as rents drop in cities like New York, single-family home prices in Florida are up nearly five percent, and even condo prices are up, six percent. 
ANCONA: They're not coming to shop or, you know, on vacation. They're coming with a specific agenda to execute, purchase, and (INAUDIBLE).
