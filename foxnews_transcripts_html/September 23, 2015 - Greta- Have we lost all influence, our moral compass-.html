Let's all go "Off the Record." The New York Times reporting our Afghan military allies - not our enemies, but our allies - are routinely abusing young Afghan boys. Not a one-time deal, but a routine called "boy play."
The father of Lance Corporal Gregory Buckley Jr. says his son told him about a disturbing discovery he and his fellow marines made in the barrack of Afghan police commander. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });

GREGORY BUCKLEY, SR, FATHER OF U.S. MARINE KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN: The little boys -- you know, ages from 8 to 13, 14, were underneath the covers, and they were crying, they weren't happy of course being abused by four other older men. And then they were told by their superiors, another soldier and marine to back out of the barracks and leave them alone. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Mr. Buckley says his son was told by U.S. military superiors to ignore the abuse he saw. Now the Pentagon denies having a policy that directs any members of our military members of our military to ignore human rights abuses. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
While there might not be an official policy, if it's a nod and wink from our military leaders to look the other way because it is our allies committing this abuse, that's just as bad. Our military leaders should speak out about human rights violations, especially when committed by our allies. Sticking hands in the sand is not moral courage, and it sends a terrible message to our young troops and to the world.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
