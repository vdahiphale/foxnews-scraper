HARRIS FAULKNER, HOST: Thank you very much. Great to see you, have a good weekend. And we begin tonight with breaking news. We may never have an answer for this.
Today, police issued the final investigative report on that October massacre in Las Vegas. Saying the case is now closed with this frustrating and mystifying results.

JOE LOMBARDO, SHERIFF, CLARK COUNTY: Well, we have not been able to a definitively answer is the why Stephen Paddock committed this act. Without a manifesto or even a note to answer questions, the totality of the information that has been gathered leaves us to only make an educated guess as to the motives of Stephen Paddock.

FAULKNER: No more suspects, no more arrests, and no answers. In primetime, I'm Harris Faulkner in for Martha McCallum. 10 months after the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, Las Vegas police say they will never know exactly why 58 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Four days, the gunman Stephen Paddock, methodically stockpiled his room. On the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino with more than a dozen guns, some modified to fire in rapid succession. Some loaded with tracer bullets, so the killer could see exactly where his shot landed in the darkness.
In October one, the reclusive high-stakes gambler opened fire on the popular outdoor music festival from the 32nd floor of that resort. 58 people killed, injuring hundreds. The festival was attended by 22,000 people.

Lisa Fine was one of them, and she watched that news conference from Las Vegas, the sheriff today. She says one particular moment left her and her fellow survivors outraged and upset. She'll tell us why moments from now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
First though, let's go to our correspondent Jonathan Hunt, who's in our West Coast newsroom with the details of this report. Jonathan?
JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Harris. For those who lost loved ones or who survived that terrible traumatic night, it is a disappointing end to a 10-month investigation that has left us no closer to uncovering a motivation for the massacre.
Paddock opened fire as you said, from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 58 people attending that concert. He had spent several days bringing in an arsenal of weapons and ammunition to the hotel. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But as seen on this security camera footage, nothing about his luggage caused alarm among hotel employees. And while he had complained to friends about feeling constantly in pain or fatigue, and his doctor described him as "odd and possibly bipolar", nothing about his behavior raised any red flags.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LOMBARDO: By all accounts, Steven Paddock was an unremarkable man, whose movements leading up to October first, didn't raise any suspicion. An interview with his doctor indicate the signs of a troubled mind. But no troubling behavior that would trigger a call to law enforcement. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HUNT: Paddock was a high-stakes gambler whose bank balance had dropped from $2 million in 2015 to half a million by September 2017. He had paid $600,000 to casinos, $170,000 to credit card companies, and had spent $95,000 on weapons and ammunition.
The report found Paddock acted alone. No suicide note or manifesto was found, there was no evidence of radicalization or links to any terrorist organization. The sheriff, by the way, also said today it was hard for him to even say the shooter's name during the press conference and he does not intend to do so again. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

LOMBARDO: I don't want to remember this individual. I will remember the act and the victims, but I will not remember the suspect. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HUNT: The families of those who died and the survivors will likely also try to forget the killer while always remembering that 58 people whose lives he so brutally took that night. Harris?
FAULKNER: Jonathan, thank you very much. Let's bring in now, one of the survivors of that shooting, Lisa Fine. She's also the co-founder of Route 91 Strong, a nonprofit organization set up to help raise awareness and gather resources -- I know Lisa, to support victim survivors and loved ones impacted by the horror that night. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know, we talk often about that particular night in surviving. But I understand from today, you felt a different kind of pain and outrage, why? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LISA FINE, CO-FOUNDER, ROUTE 91 STRONG: Yes, completely. The last couple weeks have been unbelievable. And many of us are completely outraged because, in the beginning of the week, we found out that MGM is suing the victims and survivors. Even dead victims from this tragic horrific event.
And now, we've got a potential of guns that are printed by 3D where they go undetected by -- you know, radar metal detectors. And now, we've got -- we're never going to know what happened. It would be nice to have some answers. It was a war zone, most horrific, tragic event of my life.
And 22,000 people were had bullets raining down upon us. And now we have no idea, why. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FAULKNER: I want just to step back for a second, because our audience may not know every detail of this every moment. And just remind everybody why this lawsuit is happening by the owners of Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, MGM, as you said it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They are trying to indemnify themselves against lawsuits by saying that A, this was a terror act, and B, it's just too many people who are coming forth to sue. And so, the legal mind says, we'll, do you preempt all of that just by suing first.
So, just to get that out there, I know you're very angry. I know the victims don't understand this. It's a legal ploy. But let me ask you this about what you learned today. Was there any closure in knowing more about this man, Stephen Paddock? They described him as someone who had -- you know, a damaged mind. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FINE: Clearly, he had a damaged mind. I have -- you know, none of us know where that came from, but I really was counting on some answers more than what we have gotten. And everybody is outraged.
I have survivors contacting us left and right. We have thousands of survivors that are in support groups that we are in contact with. And our main focus is to raise funds for these survivors that are literally in the darkest days of their lives. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But now, there is no answers and it is something very unsettling. I mean, I have a lot of questions. I'd like to know what happened for 51 minutes before they got to him. Why, why, was he not taken down immediately? You take a chip off of one of those tables and somebody is on the ground. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The fact that he carried 26 bags of weapons into that hotel will forever haunt me because I had bullets 6 inches from my head while I listened and watched people in horror and agony being murdered in front of my face.
FAULKNER: Yes. You know what --

FAULKNER: You know, Lisa, as we try to get answers, I'm taking notes on what you're saying too, because legal experts aren't finished yet, either. I'm about to interview one of them, and it's helpful to know what some of your questions are. And from your perspective, I know with that many people in a crime scene, it has taken some time. 
But there was a little bit of surprise that it hasn't even been a year yet and sometimes with shootings like this, and -- you know, I know each one is individual sometimes they'll tell us, so, it'll be years before we ever know. So that's one of my questions how did they get here this quickly.

FAULKNER: God bless you, and the survivors, and all the families of those who are missing loved ones. Because one monster decided to open fire high into the sky and rain bullets down on you. I'm so sorry.
FINE: Yes. Well, and it happened three years prior that I know about and it was sorted by a maid that went into the room. So, they were aware that this could happen. And why, why are they suing the survivors instead of maybe helping survivors.

There are people that contact me, they say they will never ever use MGM hotels again. They will never have anything to do with MGM after what they have done. For humanity's sake, I don't know who suggested that they go after survivors like this.
FAULKNER: Yes.

Let's bring in Mark Fuhrman, former L.A. homicide detective, and now a Fox News contributor. So, Mark, you heard some of those questions, let me just ask them again. I think they're compelling what happened for the 51 minutes that it took reportedly for authorities to reach the room where this guy was firing? What are your thoughts about this report?

MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Harris, in -- Well, first, the report wasn't very surprising. I think everything including corroborating his mental defect was going to be pretty obvious, and there was never any evidence of a second shooter.
He acted and all the evidence pointed to him acting alone. That didn't seem surprising at all in the report. And it was very complete, very extensive, and I think, to answer your question about why so much so soon as they made it a priority and they put a task force on it, and they got it done, specifically, to get the information out.
But when you talk about the 51 minutes, we have to say first, we keep repeating the 32nd floor. You don't know exactly where the shooting is coming from, exactly. You may see an open window, you may see fire from that window, but you don't know how many shooters you're dealing with and you have to tactically approach that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You have to get the right people and the right equipment to breach doors and to actually get to the location. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Actually, 51 minutes from the time the first shot was fired is probably pretty reasonable, considering the tactical situation that was there. Once they knew where he was, I think we're talking about less than 20 minutes before they actually closed in the location. So, I'm not surprised by that.
FAULKNER: You know, having you revisit that, I don't know that it will help the victims like Lisa Fine, those survivors if you will, but reminding us of the task at hand from a detective's perspective, I think is very helpful.

LOMBARDO: Well that depends on the definition. If you look at the state definition, it would fall within that aspect. If you look at the federal definition, no. I would personally call it a terrorist act that had an influence on a certain demographic of people, intended to cause harm.

        }
      
And we don't have to get into the legalities of it, but this back and forth about terrorism, isn't there just the definition?
FUHRMAN: Well, there's a definition, Harris, but we seem to -- if we can associate a foreign-born or a foreign immigrant to this country to a religious radicalization, and then, the same act, then, it is automatically terrorism. And we don't even question the motive.
But when it is an American-born, non-religious associated person acting alone, we somehow do not see this as terrorism. This is clearly a terrorist act as is any gang member that opens up on a crowd, that's a terrorist act. But to actually split hairs and not call this the terror -- terror's act is kind of foolish.
It is probably one of the most ultimate terrorist acts that you can actually prey on people at a concert such as this.

FAULKNER: Iowa investigators are remaining largely tight-lipped on the search for missing Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts believing that gives them the best chance perhaps to solve her case. They're combing fields looking for clues. We've been reporting on this on Fox News. Mollie was last seen more than two weeks ago. Police now say they believe they have a solid timeline in her disappearance but are refusing to answer questions about any physical evidence that may have been found at this point. Some 30 to
 40 investigators are working on the case daily. That's what we've learned today. Meanwhile, the reward for information that brings Mollie home has reached $220,000. Ted Williams is a former Homicide Detective Attorney and Fox News Contributor. He was at the news conference in Iowa. And Ted, I've been listening to your questions the last couple of days, you have a very distinctive voice so I hear you in the crowd of questioners. Is there anything at this point that doesn't ring true in all of your experience about this case?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's absolutely really nothing that does not ring true Harris but I can tell you the community itself is very engaged, every man woman and child that I've run into and bringing Mollie home. And when you go to a press conference like we went to today, the community is listening and they are hoping that they would have been given more information. And I've talked to numerous people out here and there is that kind of frustration here on the ground that law enforcement was not able to give more information today. 
FAULKNER: Well, you know, when you look at this town, the last census, they had fewer than 1,500 people. I mean this is the kind of town that you actually could say people know each other. And so when I ask you about certain things not ringing true, I watch these news conferences. I watch the frustration but I also see a certain calm does that indicate that they know who they looking for? What is -- what is the mood like on the ground? 
WILLIAMS: Well, Harris, I think you're right on the mark about what law enforcement may know. The mood on the ground here is that you've got these law enforcement officers who are working 24 hours a day to try to bring Mollie home. And what is happening is you've got two state local and federal agents working out here and they put together a psychological profile. They know a great deal more than we do and what I'm sure their answer in the public is just remain calm, let us do our job -- our job. We can bring all the Mollie home or we can certainly find out what has happened to Mollie. 
FAULKNER: You know, we heard law-enforcement say that they take every lead serious. That's tough to do. It's been more than two weeks. This is not a child that they are looking for. This is a grown woman, a 20-year-old. What sorts of things complicate the search when you're looking at an adult that's gone missing? 
WILLIAMS: Well, what complicates it more than anything else is the word cooperation or you have individuals who will and will not cooperate doing this. They have from what we've been told, went to a hog farm here. I've even had the opportunity to speak to the owner of that hog farm who informed me that the authorities asked him to take a polygraph exam and that person said that he would not. And those are the kind of things that is frustrating to authorities.
FAULKNER: Well, and we hear authorities calling on the public look, you called in but you didn't give enough information. This was at the news conference yesterday I believe, called back so you can have you know access to the reward money. That's really been over and overstated can you cooperate. Ted Williams on the ground in Iowa where Mollie Tibbetts is missing. Thank You, Ted.

Everybody should stop having reporters penned up like veal in the back of those things for the president to use as a prop and then some of the reporters then exploit that for their own personal benefit.

FAULKNER: Wow. So no more cameras, no more televised press briefings and no more cameras and reporters at Trump rallies. Direct from their own D.C. studio guy Benson and Marie Harf, co-hosts of the Fox News radio program "Benson and Harf." Guy, I'll come to you first. Do you agree or disagree with the Stire who was on fire today? 
GUY BENSON, HOST, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first of all, happy Friday to you, Harris. Thanks for having us. I'm going to have to disagree with the distinguished colleague from West Virginia on this one. And here's the reason why I get where Chris is coming from. Sometimes the White House press briefings feel like pure theater where the White House has its agenda, certain reporters have their own agenda, and we don't actually get much quality information out of it but that is still an opportunity for the American people to see journalists putting questions to the White House on camera. I think there is something inherently valuable about that. 
And as for these rallies, sometimes it does feel like there's not a ton of new news being broke and maybe you don't need every single journalist there but journalists have an absolute right to be at a public event hosted by the President of the United States and to say that we should pull them out because they are mere props, I don't agree. 
MARIE HARF, HOST, FOX NEWS RADIO: Yes. 
FAULKNER: Marie?
HARF: Yes, Guy and I actually agree on a lot of that. And I would actually put more of the onus at these rallies on President Trump. He likes to get the crowd whipped up into a frenzy, he knows that -- 
FAULKNER: All right, I want to go back to the press briefing if we can because we're getting down far afield. And the fact of the matter is it's the President of the United States and I think there'd be a lot of journalistic hands in the air to go cover that. But the press briefing, Marie, I'm particularly curious to get your point of view on this because you were with a former administration and you too do you know what it's like to be in that seat. We ask questions of you when you were at state.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: Absolutely and I agree with Guy that there is something inherently good about people getting to ask questions of their government on camera every single day or almost every day. So I think that it is an important thing to do. I think Sarah Sanders should probably maybe get into a little more substance and reporters should push her on more substance in these briefings. They are not perfect that is for sure but they're really important and the answer is not doing away with them just like the answer isn't pulling the press out of rallies because the president likes to attack them. I think the president quite frankly Harris should set a better tone. I know he's frustrated with the coverage but you can criticize the coverage without making it personal and hostile and he should do that. 
FAULKNER: One thing I would say and I don't know if people drill down enough on this but Sarah Sanders said as Jim Acosta was going after her, I share your passion on this issue when he asked whether or not she believed the media are the enemy. She said but my job today is to stand up here and tell you the perspective from the president in the White House and we know where the president stands on it. The back-and-forth really was the opposite of the great journalistic appetite that we could have fed the day before with all of the leaders in the intelligence community telling us how they will protect us in November. 
I agree with you, guy, it is necessary for us to have that access and be able to ask about these questions. 
HARF: Yes.
FAULKNER: I don't know how much the American public knows about what happened in Chicago but I want to talk about it for a moment. They are in double digits some weekends in death and murder there.

FAULKNER: Right.
BENSON: Look, there have been really, really terrible spades of murder and bloodshed in the streets of Chicago for a very, very long time. I understand why there is additional political upheaval over this ongoing tragedy in that city.
And it's very clear that there is a rift in Chicago politics right now between the mayor, a more establishment Democrat, more sort of a national profile, as the pastor said, and people from these communities who are fed up with what is happening and want change. 
FAULKNER: Yes, it will be interesting to see if there is any room for anybody across any political aisle to step in and write to the ship. Marie, forgive me, we will bring you back in another time to get your response as well. Guy and Marie, thank you. I know you are about out of a commercial break. So go back to your show.

BYRD: Yes. This is material that is typical of what we find on battlefield sites in both North and South Korea where we've worked in the past. And these are military issue items, such as boots, gloves, canteens, muskets, you see behind me a steel pot helmet that was typical of what was used during the Korean War. 
Part of a mess kit, a scabbard from a bayonet, and a damaged canteen. And behind that is a canteen that is still and actually pretty good condition. 
FAULKNER: Wow.
BYRD: So these are typical of the kinds of things that we find on the battlefields. 
FAULKNER: So we would call that kind of, you know, extra evidence, if you will. But what you drill down on as a forensic scientist could take months, could take years to identify the separate sets of remains. What leads you to believe, outside of what's behind you, but what you've looked at so far, that this is our military personnel predominantly? 
BYRD: Well, when we look at the remains themselves, we, as anthropologists, and we have four forensic anthropologists, going to Wonsan to receive the remains from the North Koreans, and then we had additional forensic anthropologists from South Korea join us at Osan afterwards to do a forensic review of the remains.
And what we look at are the size and shapes of the bones, which give us indications about ancestry. 
And so when we see bones that are, for example, larger and of certain shapes, then we might recognize them as being more likely of European or African ancestry. And when we see bones that look like they are European or African ancestry that gives you a good clue that they are more likely American than anything else. 
FAULKNER: How is it that they've been preserved at all? I mean, I've had people come up and say, if you get to talk to any of the forensic anthropologist, can you ask them how it's even possible short of a miracle. 
 What is the science of that? 
BYRD: Well, the hardest tissues in the body are the bones and teeth. And bone is actually pretty durable. Teeth, even more so. 
And so if you are in an environment that's conducive to preservation, and the Korean peninsula is actually not a bad environment for preservation, generally speaking, than we do expect to find bones and teeth still in existence on the battlefield sites where recovery wasn't done back during the war era. 
If you go to other parts of the world, say, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, the preservation is far worse there. Those conditions are more severe and really, really difficult for preservation. 
But the Korean peninsula, particularly North Korea, has actually been pretty good for preservation over the years. One of the primary reasons, as they have a very cold winter there.
FAULKNER: Yes.
BYRD: A long, cold winter is good for preservation. 
FAULKNER: And I hear the comparison with Vietnam such a wet, hot climates. So we understand that. I'm just curious now about what the journey ahead is for you to figure out who is who and to add closure to so many families across the country. 
Fifty five sets of remains, some 7,000 plus were hopeful to get that we know of the missing and the prisoners of war. What is the journey ahead like and how long do you think it will take? 
BYRD: Well, we have really a better way to put this, we have 55 boxes that have remains in them. We're not sure yet how many individuals this will turn out to be. 
And in the past, we have received large numbers of boxes of remains from North Korea, stretched over many years, and what we do is we use an extensive DNA sampling, where we have teeth, we have systematic ways of doing searches of all the dental records of the missing from the Korean War. 
Another approach we have is we have induction chest x-rays for many of the soldiers, about three quarters of the missing from the Korean War. And we can do comparisons with the chest bones to these induction chest x-rays. 
FAULKNER: Wow.
BYRD: And do identifications that way as well. When you think of the identification process, you have to think of it as being multifaceted. You know, one of the biggest problems is simply separating out individuals that are co-mingled with one another. 
FAULKNER: Yes. Well, the way you put it I--
BYRD: Another big problem-- 
FAULKNER: Yes. We understand when you say 55 boxes of remains, you are saying, well they might not even all be separate. I can't even imagine the emotional toll, too. You are a part of American history and a journey of closure for so many families. 
Thank you for what you are doing. Thank you for your exclusive time this evening on a big day for the Pentagon as you lay out all those artifacts for us to see what you are working with and for you to explain it to us. Dr. John Byrd, thank you. 
BYRD: Thank you. 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
FAULKNER: Such an amazing opportunity to talk with him. Up next, new report suggests socialism is on the rise across the United States. Thanks to the big primary win by the woman you see here, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But will it actually affects the midterm elections? Will it boost Democrats? We've got numbers for you. 
Plus, wait until you hear what the Statue of Liberty climber has to say about putting her life on the line to protest President Trump. Our Friday friends, Lisa Boothe, Jessica Tarlov, and Carley Shimkus to tackle that and more. Hi, Friday friends!
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
PATRICIA OKOUMOU, PROTESTER: I said one more time, America, you (muted), you drug addicts, you KKK, you fascist USA!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: The only way that we're going to stop this, is essentially we're all going to have to put our bodies on the line. You are going to have to be willing to do this. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: Wow. Michael Moore calling on his fellow activists to, quote, "put their bodies on the line." And on July 4th, an anti-Trump protester did just that. Theresa Patricia Okoumou, an immigrant from the Congo triggered an emergency evacuation after climbing the Statue of Liberty on the most patriotic day of the year. 
She now faces trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. And had this un- American message to share after an appearance in federal court. Language! 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OKOUMOU: This administration is an abomination! I made a song. If it fits, go sing. If it doesn't -- America, you (muted), you drug addicts, you KKK, you fascist USA! America you (muted), you drug addicts, you KKK, you fascist USA! 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: Wow. Friday friends, Lisa Boothe, Jessica Tarlov, both are Fox News contributors, and Carley Shimkus, reporter from Fox News headlines 24/7 on Sirius XM demand it. 
LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: She doesn't seem very friendly by the way. 
FAULKNER: I do. So what do you think about her? 
BOOTHE: Well, a lot of things that are probably can't say on air. But she doesn't seem like a very friendly person. Well, the first mistake -- her first mistake is following anything that Michael Moore said. That was her first mistake. 
Second mistake was doing something so idiotic and personally if I was in charge I would have just left her up there. She figured out how to get up there, you can figure out how to get down. And what really irks me is that she put so many lives at risk for her own idiocy. 
So, obviously she came to America so she wants to be here. So I just -- I really don't like this lady. 
CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS REPORTER: I think that's what President Trump said too about the net, just putting the net down, and then she could figure it out--
(CROSSTALK)
JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And let her figure it out. 
SHIMKUS: Well, I think the best way to use the freedom of speech and your freedom to protest is through peaceful action, making insightful, objective points. Climbing the Statue of Liberty, like you said, putting police officers lives on the line and then screaming that America is filled with drug addicts and KKK members-- 
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: Those are the things that we could air. 
SHIMKUS: Yes. That's the exact opposite--
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: I heard fascist.
SHIMKUS: Yes, I think that's what she did.
BOOTHE: That's what they--
SHIMKUS: Yes. She really took the focus off the cause. This became the Theresa Okoumou show. 
TARLOV: So I think that there were a lot of mistakes made here and I also felt bad especially on the Fourth of July--
BOOTHE: Well, yes.
TARLOV: -- for the families that were going to visit the Statue of Liberty because it is such a wonderful symbol--
FAULKNER: Yes.
TARLOV: -- for our country and our relationship obviously with France and what that means and how we treat immigrants in this country hopefully moving forward again. 
The expletives don't work. The Michael Moore advice, this is something that we get into as an election season ramps up, we're going to have more and more conversations about celebrities kind of sticking their nose in these things, which wasn't particularly productive for us in 2016. 
And telling people to put their body in harm's way is different than people protest.
FAULKNER: Yes.
TARLOV: Or have a conversation with someone you disagree with, which I'm fully in favor of. 
BOOTHE: Or Madonna talking about blowing up the White House and saying -- I mean, you could probably do without that. There's other ways to get your point across. 
TARLOV: I think majority will use other ways but she will I'm sure she'll show up in some attack ads, which is not ideal for Democrats, because that's not usually how we get our point across. 
FAULKNER: You don't do that, Jessica? 
TARLOV: I do on Saturdays. Watch out. That's where you can find me come on Lady Liberty's foot. 
FAULKNER: So, you know, we are looking at tonight whether or not socialism might be on the rise. Have you heard about this? 
TARLOV: You know, socialism has been mentioned to me a few times actually. 
FAULKNER: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of course, kind of putting it on the landscape, right? 
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: Well, Bernie started at. Right.
FAULKNER: I mean, I guess you could say that. She's a protege. She used to work for him. 
TARLOV: Yes.
FAULKNER: I think we have a little bit from her. But the big deal here has been the fact that the numbers don't really support whether or not this adherence to socialism are Democratic socialism, because I saw recently she tried to teach us all the difference but then actually couldn't, but it's really still older people who vote. 
TARLOV: Right.
FAULKNER: I mean, when you look at the statistics, under one out of six, that is less than one. So, basically zero. 
TARLOV: Yes. Which is a huge problem for-- 
FAULKNER: Americans under the age of 30 voted in 2014, now you see a little bump up, you know, a few years ago with President Barack Obama, because social media was kind of coming online. 
SHIMKUS: Yes.
FAULKNER: But it's got to be tough now when you look at the actual numbers who, of people who vote, and then you have this as the representative of that cause. Here she is, talking about winning on the trail. She's got Bernie Sanders right next to her. And here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Hello, everybody! So excited to be hopping on here. Senator Sanders' account. And we're in Kansas City to rally for Brent Welder. We're going to flip this seat read in November. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FAULKNER: Well, she helped you out. She's going to flip that seat red! 
BOOTHE: We'll take the endorsement. Thank you very much. 
FAULKNER: My point with this is--
(CROSSTALK) 
BOOTHE: My broader concern is the fact that you are seeing these different groups pop up on college campuses, so clearly, this is, you know, some sort of fad and it makes you question our education system, question, you know, these students' ability to really take a look at history and take a look at some of these different policies.
And all you have to do is look at Venezuela, where the Venezuelan president has said, that basically those policies are to blame for Venezuela going from being the richest country in South America to now basically being on the brink of bankruptcy and financial ruin. 
And Alexandria even herself was incapable and unable to explain how her policies would pan out into any sort of real terms financially. She couldn't even explain how they would be paid for. 
FAULKNER: So this is supposed to be a friend section but I think Jessica won't agree with that. 
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: I actually agree with a lot of that. I'm pretty down on the Dem socialist movement because I think that they--
(CROSSTALK)
FAULKNER: You're not down with that?
TARLOV: No. I think that they undercut the majority of the party too often, and because they have such a strong social media following and because Bernie Sanders is now so iconic--
BOOTHE: Yes.
TARLOV: -- it gets confused what the party stands for. There are only 42 Dems socialists running nationwide. That's not that many when you think about it. But they are very powerful. Older people do vote. And I think it was a poll that only 19 percent of Democrats were interested in being a socialist party.
FAULKNER: Right.
TARLOV: Which is it's not at all what you would think if you watched some-
 -
(CROSSTALK) 
FAULKNER: Carley, last word.
SHIMKUS: And I do think that young people are passionate about certain issues, this is obviously more young people are democratic socialists than older people. They are passionate about gun control, abortion--
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: And tuition.
SHIMKUS: -- and tuition. But registered voters in young -- they registered to vote but they might not show up to the polls and that's why this is really not going to pan out for those young people. 
FAULKNER: All right. Stick around. 
BOOTHE: All right.
FAULKNER: Up next, the great goat escape. You just have to see it. Doesn't get loose and become the new kids on the block. You can't make it up. The Story right after this. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
FAULKNER: I never do this lighthearted stuff at the end of the show but I'm going to try it tonight. Finally, have you heard (Inaudible) say about the new kids on the block? Kids - baby goats. 
Earlier today, about 120 goats escaped their enclosure and ran rampant through neighborhoods in Boise, Idaho. Witnesses say the animals were going home to home. No, eating just everything in sight. I would run. 
The goats were all rounded up and returned home within a few hours. Ladies, I had you stick around because I didn't want to--
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: Wow, you didn't want t be alone for that.
FAULKNER: I don't want to be alone. Great to see you this Friday. I'm back on Monday with "Outnumbered" noon. Here's Tucker.
