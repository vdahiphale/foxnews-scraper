Let's go "Off the Record." I got hoodwinked by the new attorney general, Loretta Lynch. What a phony!
Last week, right here on "On the Record," I praised her for her then-announced new Justice Department policy to hold individuals - not the corporations, but individuals - accountable for corporate wrongdoing. That makes sense. People, the executives, commit the crimes. Corporations don't. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I thought finally we had an attorney general standing up for you. Well, scratch that. The ink hardly dried on her new memo announcing the new policy when she sold you out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just hours ago, the DOJ cut a deal with General Motors for failing to disclose a known ignition switch flaw in its cars that killed 124 people. What's the deal? G.M. has to pay $900 million. But, get this: Not one of the corporate executives who did this, leading to 124 deaths, has been indicted. No handcuffs, no perp walk, and the U.S. attorney handling the case in what I think was just some fluff news conference says he won't rule out bringing charges against G.M. employees in the future. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Phooey. I don't buy that for a second. If the DOJ was serious, indictments would have happened like today. And it gets more disgusting. Guess who is paying that $900 million? Not the corporate executives who did this crime, but G.M. shareholders. That may be you.
The system is so rigged against you. And Madam Attorney General, wow you sold us out fast! And that's my "Off the Record" comment.  </pre>
