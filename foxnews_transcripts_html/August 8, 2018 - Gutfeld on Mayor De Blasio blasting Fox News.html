     Video  Gutfeld on Mayor De Blasio blasting Fox News 
New York City's Democratic mayor attacks free press. 
New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio spoke to The Guardian on Tuesday. The Guardian is a crazy left British newspaper, so it's basically no different than De Blasio talking to himself. Crazy stuff comes out of his mouth and people with butterfly nets make a circle because the loony bin might be the only place left for De Blasio and his make-believe politics. That was a lot. He told The Guardian if you could remove News Corp. from the last 25 years of American history, we would be a more unified country. We would not be suffering a lot of the negativity and divisiveness we're going through right now.

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

        } else {

          });
        } else {

We went to the mainstream media for comment on this blatant attack on the press.

Seltzer's head on a cricket, only on "The Five," ladies and gentlemen.
Bill De Blasio, when was the last time you gave this towering piece of politics a thought? So he thinks America would be better off without us? What he's really saying is he would be better off without us. But he's wrong. Even without America's most-watched news channel making fun of him, other progressive still shun him. He's 7 feet of political invisibility. So it should be easy to pretend De Blasio's dumb ideas don't exist, but if that were the case, millions of people would be better off. You can't beat leftism for burdening humanity and that's why Lurch hate us. We point this out while doing our best to ignore him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Anyway, over at CNN, Brian Seltzer denied the mayor's words aren't attack on the press, claiming it's not about the media at all, but a media empire, right? I guess if Trump didn't say it it's not a story and it's about Fox, who cares? We get it. Run along, Brian. Anderson's lunch is getting cold.  </pre>
