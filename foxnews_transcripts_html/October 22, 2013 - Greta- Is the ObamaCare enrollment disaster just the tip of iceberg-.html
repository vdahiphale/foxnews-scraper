'Off the Record', 10/22/13: If the Obama administration can't get an ObamaCare sign-up website off the ground, what other huge problems are in store? 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. We've all seen or heard about the dud to put it politely known as the ObamaCare enrollment website. It's really bad, so bad that the president and the website are being lambasted by many of President Obama's BFFs. Leader Nancy Pelosi, the "New York Times" and even Jon Stewart are a few examples.
You know, it's it really bad if his BFFs are giving him hell, but is the trouble with the enrollment website just the tip of the iceberg? Anyone looked any further, like below the surface? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Part of ObamaCare is an income verification requirement that determines who should get a subsidy. That's where the money is paid by the taxpayers, and we want to make sure subsidies go to the entitled, those who are really needy and need it and got get flim-flamed by those who should not get subsidies. That would be a fraud, and with the system in chaos, the amount of fraud could be absolutely massive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So how is the eligibility for subsidy determine checked? You guessed it. One of those Obama administration software programs. There is a problem: Their enrollment website, which they had had three-and-a half years to set up, is an absolute nightmare. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So ask yourself, if the Obama administration cannot get a sign up website off the ground, what makes you think they can create an honest income verification system so that we don't have massive fraud? Do you think they can or should we brace ourselves for a massive taxpayer ripoff? What do you think? Go to GretaWire.com and tell me. That is my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an issue you think I can take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
