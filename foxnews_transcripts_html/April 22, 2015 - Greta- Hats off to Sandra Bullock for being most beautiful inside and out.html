Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Do you remember "Miss Congeniality," Sandra Bullock?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To us, you will always be Gracie Lou Freebush, the nicest, sweetest, coolest girl at the pageant and this year's Miss Congeniality.

I don't know her, but apparently she was not acting. That's Sandra Bullock, Miss Congeniality. Now, People Magazine has just named her "The World's Most Beautiful Woman." Yes, she's beautiful, but there are a lot of beautiful women in the Hollywood. So why Sandra Bullock?
Well, because apparently, she also has inner beauty, and you can tell that by her very gracious remarks upon learning that People Magazine had named her"The Most Beautiful Woman in the orld." Bullock responded, "Real beauty is quiet especially in this town, meaning, Hollywood. It's just so hard to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that. No, be a good person. Be a good mom. Do a good job with the lunch. Let someone cut in front of you who looks like they are in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, that's Sandra. Yes, beautiful on the outside and also on the inside. She knows what's important. A class act. A real Miss Congeniality.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
