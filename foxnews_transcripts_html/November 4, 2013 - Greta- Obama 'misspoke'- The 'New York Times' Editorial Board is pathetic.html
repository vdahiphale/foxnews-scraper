'Off the Record', 11/4/13: The 'New York Times' insults Americans' intelligence with its explanation of president's false claim that Americans could keep their insurance if they liked it under ObamaCare 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sometimes I think the "New York Times" Editorial Board thinks we are all stupid. And guess what? Maybe they are the stupid ones.
Here is a perfect example. Yesterday, the "New York Times" Editorial Board column stated President Obama misspoke when he pledged if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. "Misspoke?" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Really? Is that what they thought that was? Now, whether you like ObamaCare or not, or whether it's good or not, is not the issue of this "Off the Record." The issue is the "New York Times" Editorial Board - they are pathetic. It is absurd to say the president misspoke when he specifically pledged, you can keep your insurance if you like it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The president made this pledge not once, not twice, but multiple times. Now, we found at least 24 instances of President Obama making this specific promise. So, if the "New York Times" Editorial Board had even looked, they would have found 24 times, too. It was an essential part of the ObamaCare talking points. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Of course, if President Obama had said it only one time, it could be misspeaking as the Editorial Board says. But he repeated it over and over and over again. And that simply is not misspeaking. That is not a slip of the tongue. It is obvious the "New York Times" Editorial Board is trying to sugarcoat it for the president. That is pathetic. That's not their job.
But at least we have a good sign; we finally found some transparency. Could anything be more transparent that the "New York Times" Editorial Board is carrying water for the White House? But there is also a tiny bit of good news tonight. Separate from the "Times" Editorial Board, "New York Times" public editor, Margaret Sullivan wrote a column just a short time ago citing my GretaWire post and admitting the editorial board's use of misspoke does suggest that one time slip of the tongue. In other words, she is calling her colleagues out. And for that, I tip my hat to her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take "Off the Record,' go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.  </pre>
