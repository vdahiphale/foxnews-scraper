JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to a very special "Justice" tonight. A look back at President Trump's year and a look forward to 2019 and beyond. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro, thanks so much for being with us and it is our first ever "Justice" with a studio audience and I couldn't be more excited, I think they are, too, I know because I spoke with them and they're going to be taking part in asking questions throughout the show. Plus if you'd like to take part at home, tweet your comments @JudgeJeanine.
Now we have a fantastic lineup of all-star guests tonight. We'll surprise you every block and you can't miss a moment of it. So let's bring out my first guest. He's fought tirelessly in Congress for the American people over the last 18 years, a big welcome for my friend and of course, yours, Congressman Darrell Issa. Good evening, Congressman.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIF.: Good evening, Judge. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: How are you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISSA: I'm doing great.
PIRRO: Good. Good to see you. All right, so, here we are almost the end of the year. You're finishing up 18 years in Congress. I have been dying to ask you this question. What can you tell us that you couldn't tell us before? What frustrated you the most? What did you have to do in order to stay in Congress that frustrated you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISSA: Those are several great questions. The one that I think listeners would not be surprised or viewers would not be surprised but that really does burn me is the difference between what people say on the campaign trail and what they do in my party.
In other words, we want to end the death tax. No, they don't. They just don't want to pay it themselves. We want to lower taxes and, no, we really just want to lower taxes on ourselves. There's a tremendous amount of self-serving there and you see it in the negotiations for principled solutions versus what actually gets negotiated. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's one of the reasons that so many of these tax deals are temporary. It's one of the things that's exciting about part of the President's tax reform, which is, it's permanent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well you know, when you talk like that I say to myself you know, we are - you know, we expect loyalty to party, right? And I understand that. I understand you have to be with your party to make sure you get your agenda done, but sometimes as I look at Paul Ryan, as I look at what 

happened with some of the committees and Paul Ryan not being willing, you know, to kind of hit the button on a lot of stuff going on with respect to Comey and you know, we saw at the end of December, you know James Comey comes and testifies at a House - before House committees.
It's way too late. Nothing can be done. I wonder if they really believe in what they're saying or if it's just theater to them.
ISSA: You know, in Congress there's always somebody who really believes it and then there's the rest of the Congress and certainly that this latest thing with bringing in Comey really is an example of too little too late. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On the other hand, there are things that are still being worked on as we get to the end of the Congress and one of them for example, it's pretty technical, but it's some of the immigration reform stuff that has broad support that actually still get done, that the President has talked about and asked for these high-tech immigrant the H1-B's and so on.
PIRRO: Right, and we'll talk about that.
ISSA: Right, those are areas where we could still get it done, but there's always sort of the people who want it to wait, "We'll do it later. We'll do it later." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: But how does it benefit them to not produce for the American people? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISSA: You know, having gone through an election where my proposed successor didn't get across the finish line because it wasn't a good year in California for Republicans, I've got to tell you, if we had done more, we'd have been better treated by the voters. There's no question at all that not living up to the President's agenda, not living up to his aspirations has cost the House of Representatives its majority.
PIRRO: Well, no question about that. We're going to talk about that, but right now, I'm going to bring out some new guests -- Congressman Issa, stay there. Our next two guests are real players responsible for helping to get Donald Trump elected. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

They're the authors of the new book "Trump's Enemies." Trump's former campaign manager, former director - deputy campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie are both here. Hi, guys.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DONALD TRUMP: Hi, Judge.

PIRRO: How are you?

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DAVID BOSSIE, AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Good to see you.
PIRRO: Great to see you. Hello. How are you? All right, so listen, guys. You've got a great new book out and I'm not going talk about it right now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
LEWANDOWSKI: Thanks, Judge. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: What I want to talk about --
ISSA: Where is it on the bestsellers list?
LEWANDOWSKI: It's on the "New York Times" bestseller list, so we're very happy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Congratulations. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEWANDOWSKI: It may be fake new, but it's our fake news.
PIRRO: Yes, I know and you know what? Now, I feel like I'm part of your club, but listen, you know, what the Congressman and I didn't have time to talk about, I want to talk to you guys about is the economy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We saw the GDP in 2018 hit record highs, but then it started to falter a little bit at the end of the year. You know, unemployment has stayed pretty good at 3.7%, but there was some volatility in the stock market that we saw you know in mid-December. What's going on and what can the President do to make sure that he can continue to deliver on the message that apparently the House couldn't deliver on, Corey?
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, I think part of it is as you know, this President has focused in American trade policy on renegotiating bad trade deals. When you look at what he's done between Canada and Mexico and the United States, getting rid of NAFTA and renegotiating that, that's a positive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But you also have to think about what he did with President Xi of China. He said, we're going to put a temporary stay on putting more tariffs on you and that was supposed to bring the market to these amazing numbers and for a period, the market was up over a three-day period, the highest it has been in six years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So the market responded, but it is very fickle, and now what we're seeing, Judge, over the last two or three or four weeks is, every time the market goes down, whether it's 10 points or 50 points, they're now blaming the President; unlike for all those times where it's at record highs, under hisadministration, they never gave him credit.
PIRRO: Yes, it was never the President.
LEWANDOWSKI: It was never him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: It was Barack Obama. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEWANDOWSKI: It was Barack Obama who build this, right? And now, all of a sudden - now it is now his fault.
PIRRO: You know, maybe I am wrong. Am I wrong? Did Barack Obama build it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOSSIE: No, Barack Obama destroyed our economy. This President has taken the last two years to build it up whether it's bringing manufacturing jobs back, whether it is the energy sector, whether it is renegotiating these bad trade deals. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the markets and I'm not an economist, but I'm a political guy and I look at the investigations that are about to beset this President and this White House.
You're going to see a White House that is going to be under siege by the Democratic controlled House here very shortly and you're going to see a White House that is naturally going to constrict in its ability to get a legislative agenda through, as well as other priorities on the economy. And that's a big deal.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Let me ask you this, Congressman, I mean, you know, the House couldn't do what it could have - it might have done. Why?
ISSA: It didn't do. Well because the House is known for passing things and then letting the Senate fail to do it. This time, there were a lot of things we didn't pass. We didn't even send them to the Senate as the 

President wanted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Yes, but the economy is so good, why didn't Republicans win and keep the House? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
ISSA: You know, the economy is an interesting and fickle thing. In a good economy, a lot of Republicans don't get really excited in turnout. Democrats looking at Donald Trump and despising him did turnout.
But you know, one of the things about the economy, some people score the economy based on 3.7% unemployment and so on, how about we score it like it was the real battle that it is between us and the Chinese.
Last quarter, Chinese 1.3% growth. Less than two months ago, I was at the World Economic Forum in China. Company after company told me about their leaving China. They're building their new factory in Vietnam or South Korea. The fact is --

PIRRO: Oh boy. Not here, I was hoping you were going to say the U.S., not.
ISSA: Well, no, there's a lot of being built in the U.S. and we see those every day, but we don't see what's moving out of China just to move out of China. What China is dealing with is - we're in this so-called war and we're winning it. Yes, we're growing at X rate, but China has decelerated from its typical over 10% to 1.3%. They are in a freefall.
PIRRO: All right, what I'm going to do right now, is I know we have a question from our audience and I believe, sir, Ernie, I'll just call you Ernie. You're Ernie, right? All right, Ernie. Ernie's question is what does the situation with China mean for the economy and could things get worse? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISSA: Well, I think I just gave you a part of that. China is in a freefall. China still has more than half a billion people. They are trying to get modern 21st Century jobs for and they don't have a way to get it and the rest of the world is starting to eat their lunch and they have an inflation problem and quite frankly, they've gone back to being a communist dictatorship. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So that's where China is. What does it mean for us? It means that we're going to have a more diverse group of vendors for the United States, our partnership with Canada, our partnership with Mexico, renegotiated under this President is going to grow.
PIRRO: All right and I think you had an additional question. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ERNIE, STUDIO AUDIENCE: Yes, and the additional question and what will that do? What will the effect be on our elections coming up in 2020?
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, look, as it relates to China, you have to think - well, they are now agreeing to open their markets or our agriculture products because of the sit down conversation that President Trump had with President Xi. They have blocked us from putting our exports there for a long time because they didn't want to compete against the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that renegotiation is - everything is witnessed at the ballot box. When people are doing well, they have to ask themselves a very simple question which was asked under the Clinton administration, in the Obama administration for a reelection effort. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Am I better off today than I was two or four years ago? And you look at economic security, you look at Homeland Security and you look at national security, every economic indicator of those issues says, "Yes, we are stronger today under the Trump administration than we were two years ago," which bodes very well for a reelection campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BOSSIE: And Judge, if I could just add one more thing --
PIRRO: Go ahead, David. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
BOSSIE: In that conversation with President Xi, President Trump asked the Chinese President to take a stand on the opioid issue, and that potentially two years from now, not today, but two years from now, he is going to be able to rein in this help us reign this tragedy in that is going on in this country and I think that the American people hopefully will see the fruits of that labor as well.
PIRRO: All right and now, I believe we have another question from the audience.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, recently I've seen a lot of headlines that the economy is just dropping. The stock market is crashing. It's been very worrying to me and I'm wondering, could we be headed for another recession?
LEWANDOWSKI: Okay, look I'm not an economist and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so I'm just going to give you my ideas. The truth is, I don't think so because every economic indicator is showing that we're still expanding, our economy is growing. It's not receding. We have to be very cautious of the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates. It's something the President has been very candid about. He's been very vocal about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
We have to understand, people are finally having more money in their pockets for the first time in literally a decade. Under the Bush and then the Obama economy, people didn't have job opportunities and not just the new jobs, but what you're seeing in our economy right now is people who have jobs, have opportunities to move to other places that didn't exist because the deregulation that this President has impacted in our environment which means more economic opportunities for everybody. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Go ahead, David.
BOSSIE: And I'd like to - I'd love to find a way to get the millennials to get into the housing market, right. That's one of the soft spots that we see in the economy coming up in in the next several quarters is that we see the - with the interest rates going up, the millennials have to understand and want to participate in that American Dream.
PIRRO: We're going to talk about that, Davidd. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BOSSIE: That we have for 200 years, it has always been a bedrock of our economy.
PIRRO: Yes, we're going to talk about millennials in just a few minutes, but Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie will both be back in a few minutes and Congressman Issa is staying to tackle our next topic.
(COMMERCIAL)
PIRRO: Welcome back to our "Justice" special. Immigration, the crisis at the southern border - a key issue for the Trump administration this year. It will certainly continue to be in 2019. Congressman Darrell Issa is still with us to weigh in, but first let's bring in our surprise guest.

Hear it for the one and only Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi.
PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi, my friend.
PIRRO: Hi, good to see you.
BONDI: Thank you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: You look fabulous.
BONDI: Thank you. Hello, Congressman.
PIRRO: All right, all right, Attorney General, my partner in crime -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISSA: I'm boxed between the law.
PIRRO: Yes, but you make the law, you write the law. Okay, for a few more weeks anyway. All right, Pam, you know we want to talk about - Madam Attorney General, for a few more weeks anyway. All right, Madam Attorney General, you know America is split on this issue of immigration and as we go into the next segment with a couple of new guests that I'm not going to mention to you, we're going to talk about young people and how they view it.
But the truth is that this President has been getting a beating on immigration and the border issue starting with the separation of kids from family members. Can you just tell our viewers in just a few sentences what required that and what has he done to change it?
BONDI: Well, initially the President never wanted to separate children from their parents. It was a security issue. That's been changed. That's all been corrected, and we all know he deeply cares about children and now more than ever in this world, securing our borders is so important. It's absolutely critical. That's why it's called Homeland Security. It's our homeland.
PIRRO: And in truth, I mean when President Obama separated parents and children, it was because the law required that he do that - that if you're going to have a child more than 20 days, you've got to, you know, you may be keeping the parents, but you let the child go into wherever they have them go, and that was something the President ended, correct?
ISSA: And of course, under both Presidents, you always had the question of just because somebody says it's their child, it doesn't mean it is and we found time and time again that separating became necessary to protect a child.
PIRRO: Interesting. All right, so where are we with the border wall, Attorney General? I mean, look you come from a law enforcement perspective. I mean, you know that 80% of the heroin, 90% of the drugs come through our southern border. Why can't we get this message out or am I missing something? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONDI: And Judge, this should be such a bipartisan issue because I've seen firsthand the drugs that have come into my state - into Florida from Mexico. I've seen that assault rifles. We've seen the gang, SUR-13. I've been to Mexico dealing, helping the good Attorneys General from Mexico training them on how to protect their country and work well with our country.
So securing our borders, it's paramount for our homeland safety and of course, helping great immigrants come to this country but in a legal way.
PIRRO: All right, how does the President in 2019 actually work with the Democrat majority? I mean, how is that going to - can he get the border wall with the Democrats? 

ISSA: Well with Mrs. Pelosi, it's pretty clear that she's going to fight him every step of the way, but the President go - doesn't go to Nancy Pelosi to get what he needs. He goes to the American people.
I expect that he'll continue making his case to the American people.
PIRRO: And I believe we have some questions from the audience, so I'm going to walk over here. All right. Thank you. All right, question?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just like to know about DACA. I don't agree with it. As an immigrant myself, I came into the U.S. legal, the legal way. We went through a process, so I just want to know if this administration is going to give to the Dreamers citizenship like their loved one easy.
PIRRO: Where are you from? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm from Colombia.
PIRRO: And what did you do to become a citizen or to become a legal immigrant or to get a green card?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well first, mama came to the United States and then we have to wait in Colombia like six years in order to come to the United States legally. We went through a process. We went through a criminal background and then we had to have an affidavit in order for us to come to the United States in order - the affidavit - the purpose for the affidavit was for us not to live free out of the government like apply for welfare ...
PIRRO: Right, that you had the ability to take care of yourself.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right, take care of ourselves.
PIRRO: So, all right, Attorney General, I mean how do you answer that or Congressman?
BONDI: Well, I think we can both take this, but first, the President came up with the four pillars plan for immigration because we're a country made up of immigrants and he understands that, most of Congress understands that, but again it has to be done in a legal way, just like you came into this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so that's - he has a plan I think we're almost 1.8 million people could become citizens.
PIRRO: And that's the DACA. Do you object to DACA, is that what you were 

saying?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I was referring to DACA. I don't agree with that.
ISSA: Let me try to get you to buy into it in a different way for a moment. Before we agreed and the numbers were very different depending upon whose bill to take those who were clearly brought here as children and had no other life; in other words, the victims of their parents or family members' misconduct before we offer to fix for that under President Trump's leadership.
The Democrats were constantly using it to claim that we didn't care. When we brought up a DACA only fix, we brought up something to take care of the victims of the ambition of their parents, we suddenly discovered that the other side wanted nothing to do with that. They wanted comprehensive or nothing.
If it does nothing else, it shows that no matter what we do, we're going to have to do it probably without the other side's help because they don't really want a fix to illegal immigration. They want open borders.
So I tell people, the reason we did it was because it was the right thing to help some of these victims. The reason we continue to push it is because it shows that the people who want sanctuary cities and open borders will settle for nothing less. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: All right and I have another question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Recently, the New Jersey Attorney General put it in force at the New Jersey local police and State Police will not participate with ICE raids or participate with any kind of ICE enforcement. Is there anything that the Federal government can do to make him cooperate with ICE?
BONDI: Well I can tell you, in the State of Florida that will never happen. We work hand-in-hand with ICE. I was with Homeland Security this week in Florida and we work hand-in-hand with them and they're great partners.
PIRRO: But Congressman, and I don't mean to interrupt, but what can - because we're running out of time, what can the Federal government do?
ISSA: Well the President has been stymied a little bit in the short run by Court decisions that made no sense. But in the long run, there's a combination of don't fund - don't provide funds that only are there if there's a quid pro quo, if there's a balance between what the state is doing and what the Federal government is doing. Write all of these programs of Federal dollars to in fact require reciprocal behavior.
As we do that, then the Court would say, "You're right. You don't have to give it if they don't cooperate." Currently, courts are ordering the President to give money even to states like California and New Jersey that are obstructing the benefit -- to the detriment of their own people.
PIRRO: All right, thanks for those questions and Attorney General Pam Bondi, thank you for all the work you do in Florida. Congressman Issa is leaving us as is the Attorney General. I want to thank you both for being here.

Much more with the audience and next, our surprise "Justice" political panel. Can you guess who they are?
(COMMERCIAL)
ANNA KOOIMAN, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, everyone and live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Anna Kooiman. President Donald Trump breaks his silence on the death of two immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border. In a pair tweets earlier today, the President placed blame on the Democrats saying it's quote "their pathetic immigration policies" arguing that they encourage migrants to make the long journey. Two young children both from Guatemala died earlier this month while in government custody. His comments came as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met with the medical staff at the border in Arizona.
Meanwhile, Russian and Turkish officials agree to coordinate ground operations in Syria. Top leaders of the two countries met in Moscow. It comes as the U.S. prepares to withdraw all 2,000 troops from the country after President Trump declared victory over ISIS. I'm Anna Kooiman, and now back to "Justice with Judge Jeanine." For all your news headlines, head to foxnews.com.
PIRRO: Welcome back. It's time for our "Justice" political panel to come out and I have a feeling, the battle will be epic. Give a big "Justice" welcome to TV host and author of "Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald Trump," NRA TV host, Dan Bongino. And Democrat strategist Ari Aramesh.
All right, gentlemen, how are you?
DAN BONGINO, NRA TV HOST: Yes, I'm good. How are you?

ARI ARAMESH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: How are you doing?
PIRRO: Each of you go to your appropriate --
BONGINO: Respective corners.
PIRRO: Yes, corners. I said appropriate, I don't watch fight set off and I am usually in them, but anyway, all right, guys. Thanks for being here. We were talking about the economy for the first few minutes of the show and the fact that it was going gangbuster, but it seems to have kind of sputtered a little bit toward the end of the month, middle end of the month. Is this good or bad news for the President?
BONGINO: Well it's never great news when the stock market stagnates, but I think this is more reflective of an over valuation of stocks. Listen, Judge, we printed money forever. People were seeking yield. They went into the market. There's just a mild correction.
But all the other signs are good -- unemployment, productivity -- it's all good. The President has been doing a great job. I don't think it's all bad.
PIRRO: Okay, so I suspect, Ari, you're going to say to me when you see headlines that say we lost all the gains of 2018, that it's even worse than what Dan is saying.

ARAMESH: No, the economy is doing great. The economy has picked up a lot of jobs and guess what? It's going to do better and I thank President Obama for having put in place a great economic recovery.
PIRRO: Obama?
ARAMESH: That is Twitter proof. You can have a President who is so destabilizing, wakes up and tweets, but the economy is so robust that it doesn't flunk out and thank you, President Barack Obama.
BONGINO: No, no, Ari, listen. I love you. You're a good man. We had a great conversation back in the green room, but you are totally, totally wrong in this. Barack Obama handed President Trump a disastrous economy.
ARAMESH: Wrong.
BONGINO: He is the first President in American history to never reach 3% GDP growth in one year. That is unbelievable - think about that. Jimmy Carter, all the horrible Presidents we've had. Barack Obama - he has the gold medal award winner of awful economic --
ARAMESH: Wrong, wrong and wrong.

        }
      
BONGINO: He is the only one. No one has --
ARAMESH: He took over an economy that was in the tanks. The global economy was going to the toilet and guess what? President Obama saved Detroit, saved the banking system, saved our financial resources and guess what? The very reason today we are sitting here, an economic system exists is because of the hard work of those men and women.
For eight years, they recovered the American economy and guess what? Donald Trump is not picking up the crumbs. Let's give him some credit, but we want to give to the economy.
PIRRO: Hey, wait a minute. I've got to say something. I am not going to let him dump it, but wait a minute, isn't President Obama, isn't he the one who said the manufacturing jobs are gone, they'll never come back to the United States, get with it.
ARAMESH: Well guess what? Those jobs that exist in the '70s and the '80s are not going to come back. Did you see what happened to GM by the way? GM --
PIRRO: No, I am not talking about '70s. Back up. I am not talking '70s 

and '80s.
ARAMESH: But your party my party - go ahead, Judge.
PIRRO: My party? But I'm talking about when Obama was the President, he said they're not coming back. Donald Trump isn't even in office. He's got Carrier and everybody else coming back.
ARAMESH: Well, there are two kinds of Presidents. Presidents who lie to get votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Presidents who don't.
PIRRO: Go ahead, Dan.
ARAMESH: But just one point, Judge, your party wanted Detroit to go bankrupt. Your party wanted Detroit to go bankrupt and President Obama didn't let that happen.
BONGINO: You're way off on that --
PIRRO: He wanted them to go bankrupt?
ARAMESH: Yes, you wanted Detroit to go dead.
PIRRO: Go ahead, Dan.
BONGINO: I really have a hard time talking about lying Presidents from the - if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, guy. So I'm going to take a hard pass on that one, but every economy, every - from the deep recessions to the - no, this is a fact. We've recovered from every single one.
Obama doesn't deserve a cookie because somehow we recovered from a recession. The numbers ought to speak for themselves. The worst recovery from a recession in modern American history based on growth rates which is what every economist uses --
ARAMESH: Not true, not true.
BONGINO: I know, what are the numbers? I know the numbers.
ARAMESH: You are talking - you've got to give context. You can't say - no, no. You can't say, oh we had this - this is again, look, the bayonet and sort of the conversation about, we had more horses and bayonets back in World War II. You've got to give context.
The President of the United States, when he took over January 21st, 2009, took over a disaster -- domestically and globally -- and he tried to fix it and he did a very, very good job.
BONGINO: And he did it worse than any other President in American history ...
ARAMESH: Secondly, about lies, you name one - you name one misinterpreted statement by President Obama?
BONGINO: No, that wasn't a misinterpretation.
ARAMESH: Trump lies day in and day out. He wakes up and lies day in and day out.
BONGINO: That was the lie of the year.
ARAMESH: Trump lies day in and day out.
BONGINO: But do you know what you have to do to get lied?
ARAMESH: And we are going to get to his lies more when this Democratic House takes over.
BONGINO: No, no ...
ARAMESH: I'm looking forward to that. It's going to be a very, very, very tough year for Donald J. Trump.
BONGINO: But you haven't refuted --
PIRRO: Ari, let me ask you a question. Ari, Ari, let me ask you a question, why are you looking forward to that?
ARAMESH: Justice have got to be meted out.
PIRRO: Your party is the obstruct - I know that, I did it for 30 years. Your party is the obstruct and resist and don't let anything good happen and now what you're promising the American people is next two years of nothing but going after Donald Trump.
We elected him. Stay out of it. Until you can prove some Russia collusion, go back to your hate-filled leftist you know - really progressive corners.
ARAMESH: All right, punchline over? You had the House, you had the Senate, you have the Supreme Court and you had the President for two years. You guys did not achieve a thing. You know why? The Republicans are bad at governing. Get out of our way. Republicans are bad at governing.
BONGINO: This is from the party of Obamacare --
ARAMESH: Economic recovery.
BONGINO: This is from the party of the IRS targeting --
ARAMESH: Healthcare, economic recovery, healthcare. This is from the party of a guy who sits down with Kim Jong-un and gives him everything on a platter and guess? The UN --
BONGINO: At least, he didn't him $500 million in cash like he gave the Iranian.
ARAMESH: Well, he's given them both.
BONGINO: At least, you they did deal on a handshake, right? After they chanted "Death to America."

PIRRO: Only one hand who emptied out Guantanamo - and he's your hero that let them go back on the war field. Anyway, Dan Bongino, Ari Aramesh. Thank you so much, and we have a lot of young people in the audience tonight. Do you think they identify with liberal or conservatives? We will learn the answer and meet our new surprise guests, "Justice" is back in a moment.
(COMMERCIAL)
PIRRO: Welcome back to our "Justice" special I want to ask you all by a show of hands, how many of you believe that most young people identify more with liberals than conservatives? What do you think 70%? I've got a few - how many of you think they identify more with conservatives?
Now wait a minute, this ain't making sense. Nobody raised their hand for conservatives and only about 70% for liberals, but anyway let's bring out a few people who are changing the way we think young people look at conservativism.
A big welcome to Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk; Turning Point Communications Director, Candice Owens, and adviser to the 2020 Trump campaign, Katrina Pierson. Hi, everybody. Welcome. Great to have you all here.
All right, so I believe that most young people or more young people identify with liberals than conservatives and Candace Owens, I'll start with you. Is that - do you think that's right or am I totally off-base?
CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: I think it is right, but it's changing. We're seeing sort of a shifting paradigm thanks to a lot of the efforts led by Turning Point USA and also the President. We have a President that actually appeals to the youth generation more.
PIRRO: And Charlie?
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: It's not that young people are opposed to conservative ideas, it's just they're not exposed to them at all in the first place and you know, Candace and I, we did a historic campus tour this last year. I think we're the only conservative duo to go to Stanford, UC Berkeley and UCLA in a span of a month and lived to tell about it.
PIRRO: Well, yes, did they try to burn the building down? I mean, was there any arson? Was there a twelve-hour riot?
KIRK: Well, UCLA, we had a little fun.
OWENS: A little bit of fun. They were definitely blaring Beyonce music trying to drown out our voices, but I mean, it's a fight. It's a cultural war we're in.
PIRRO: Where do you think it started? You know, Katrina you were in the 2016 race. I mean, you were a spokesman. You all recognize Katrina. She was the spokesman for the President. I mean, why the dissidence? Why is there such an inability to get young people to come out and why are campuses the feeding ground for hate for people on the right?
KATRINA PIERSON, ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well. I think Charlie is right. A lot of it is exposure. A lot of people say, "Well, Donald Trump has a millennial problem," and I say, no, the GOP has a millennial problem and it is because so many people have not been exposed to conservative principles or conservative values and those who are exposed to them, they're being preached to and not spoken to.
And I think that has caused a huge disconnect with a large number of young people. On top of that, you have most of the professors in the universities who are very liberal and you top that off with the fake news media; 60% of millennials think Donald Trump is a racist. I'm a black woman and he chose me to represent his 2016 Presidential campaign. It's ridiculous.
PIRRO: It is and you know, we can pull up a poll here. Trump's popularity among young people 69% of people aged 15 to 26 disapprove of President Trump's performance as a President. Candace, I'll go back to you. Wait a minute. Isn't the economy doing great now? Or --
OWENS: Well, first and foremost, we don't pay attention too much of the polls. I mean they told us that Hillary was going to win and they were 80% sure and she's not sitting in the Oval Office last I checked, but look, I think that this President in particular is going to appeal a lot more to the youth generation because something about him feels very punk-rock and rebellious. He is a rebellious President. He is rebelling against the establishment. He is rebelling against the mainstream media. And it's something that we identify with.
When you're younger, you're sort of in a more rebellious phase and it's something that this country needs to rebel against these socialist principles that are being taught on the left.
PIRRO: All right, I think we have - thank you, we have a question from the audience.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So looking back at the election this past November and the 2016 Presidential election, are you seeing trends among college students going forward with voting on if they're going to vote conservative and this 2020 election or are you going to see a liberal turnout for them?
PIRRO: Charlie?
KIRK: So the Democrats did a little bit better with younger voters in the 2018 midterm, so they did not do as well as they thought they would do and they did not do well enough to win states like Ohio and Florida.
You see states like New York and California where younger voters are becoming more and more radical where they consider Nancy Pelosi to be a moderate, which is kind of horrifying to think about. You're going to see more of those Ocasio-Cortez type candidates, but you look at Florida, you look at now governor-elect Ron DeSantis what he was able to do there, it's absolutely amazing to energize younger voters and even African-American female voters in a way that really defied conventional norms.
PIRRO: Should the President visit colleges in 2019?
KIRK: Absolutely.
OWENS: Without question.
PIERSON: It would be amazing ...
OWENS: Without question, it really matters. He's got to engage the youth more and I think that the future of this country depends on it.
PIRRO: All right, I think we have another question here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, my question had to do with 2020 in the election coming up. It's not too early to plan for it and there are some that are saying that in the suburbs, we lost ground. I'm wondering how we can make up for it when we have 92 % of the media going against us.
PIRRO: Go ahead, Katrina.
PIERSON: Well we lost a little bit of ground in the suburbs, but in some areas, we didn't. I don't know if those numbers have come out yet, but I'll also say you know, one of the things that the President is very good at is you know, speaking directly to the American public, which is why the rallies are so important and why going to college campuses would be an amazing opportunity to talk directly to young people because what President Trump does - what most politicians at least on the Republican side doesn't do is speak directly about the issues.
For so long, you've had GOP candidates who want to talk about philosophy and they want to talk about their 341-point plan to fix the economy. What Donald Trump just says, "I'm going to bring you jobs. I'm going do X, Y and Z to do it," and that's what young people want.
They want to know that when they get out of college, they're going to have a job. They want to know that their future is bright.
PIRRO: Okay, last word, Candace.
OWENS: And I just wanted to add what we lost in the suburbs, we can certainly make up for in the projects. I think that black America is paying attention right now and that he should go there he should speak to them because as the left appeals more and more to illegal aliens, there's one group of individuals that are being forgotten about and that's black America.
PIRRO: Okay, great. Great segment. Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, thank you so much. Katrina, stay right there. You're going to be right back with us after the break and I am, too. Coming up, I want to know who our audience thinks and hopes the Democratic Presidential nominee will be in 2020. Who do you think it will be? The predictions you won't want to miss next.
(COMMERCIAL)
PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of "Justice" with our incredible studio audience, Katrina Pierson is still with us and now Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie are back. So let's jump right into it. Trump 20209 campaign is ramping up. Who do we want to see him battle among the Democratic candidates? I've got some ideas, but I'll start with you guys. I just walked you out, David. Who do you want?
BOSSIE: I'll take any of them. Donald Trump is a tremendous --
PIRRO: Back up, back up. What was your job in the campaign?
BOSSIE: I was the deputy campaign manager.
PIRRO: Okay, what does that mean? Tell the audience. You beat up on everybody.
BOSSIE: Yes, I took - we worked on the debates because we were right in that time period where Hillary - we had three debates with Hillary Clinton. We did all the logistics. I planned every single rally. I built the strategic scheduling under my - so we built - six times a day, every day of the week, we were running around the country.
PIRRO: Okay, all right you're fighting - I thought you were going to say that you and Corey would go out and just find people beat them up and just make sure they vote for the President.
LEWANDOWSKI: We do that now.
BOSSIE: Yes, we do that now.
PIRRO: Now, with your new book. All right, who do you want to see run, David?
BOSSIE: You know, I think that - I would love to see a traditional candidate by the Democrats because that's going to be the easiest person to beat.
PIRRO: Really?
BOSSIE: Yes.
PIRRO: I would think - I would think that the easiest person to beat would be a progressive lefty who wants an open border and everything else?
BOSSIE: Well a traditional kid, what I mean by that is like a Bernie Sanders type thing. You know, that's your traditional candidate. An outsider would be an Oprah Winfrey or somebody that is a not a traditional politician.
PIRRO: Oh, I see, a politician. Go ahead, Corey, who do you think?
LEWANDOWSKI: Yes, look I think the Democrats are going to move so far to the left as they've done in the past. They're going to forget about Middle America. You're going to see you - may see Hillary back in in this, but look, I think Joe Biden is going to run. I think Hillary is going to run. I think Elizabeth Warren is going to run. We know that Cory Booker is going to run, Kamila Harris is going to run. Michael Bloomberg, right?
And so the question is going to be who can go as far to the left as possible --
PIRRO: To get the nomination.
LEWANDOWSKI: To get the nomination and the great thing is, Judge --
PIRRO: Once they do --
LEWANDOWSKI: What we know is, once they do, it's over, right?
PIRRO: All right, Katrina? Who do you think?
PIERSON: Well Corey listed everybody except Tom Steyer. He's sort of - he's sort of the guy that wants to be like the outsider candidate like the Trump to get out there and represent the party just to defeat Trump, but his platform is just anti-Trump and the President has done such a great job at keeping his campaign promises. What are you going to do? You're going to run against a great economy? You're going to run against all of the amazing opportunity that's now available to Americans? They don't even have a platform to run on.
PIRRO: You know, David, Katrina brings up the promises made, promises kept. You know, I was in Jerusalem for the opening of the embassy that the President promised and the people in Israel, I mean on every street corner, "We love Donald Trump. Thank you, America." Why isn't not like that here, David?
BOSSIE: Well, one of the reasons is that the Democratic Party and along with the mainstream media have decided that they were going to create a narrative and then defeat this President in his reelection.
First, they tried to defeat him during the campaign, then they tried to delegitimize him during the transition and now, they've spent the last two years working to undermine this President. Look, there are people in this - in the Democratic Party and elsewhere that hate this President more than they love the country and they're doing damage to our country.
PIRRO: Well and Corey, the next two years are going to be even worse given the fact that the House is absolutely going to start these hearings and go after - they're going to subpoena everybody, I mean, they're going subpoena housekeepers who work for the Trump's. I mean, I don't know that anyone who wasn't around that family isn't going to be under stress and investigation.
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Judge when you look at what has now happened, right, we knew that Trump had enemies in Congress. Some of those were Republicans, but now that the Democrats have taken over, they have already said they're going to use the power of the subpoena to move their agenda forward.
So in other words, look, we just saw the most progressive member which is a very scary thing of the Democratic Party threatening to subpoena Donald Trump, Jr. because of a tweet he put out, right? Just recently.
And if that is not abuse of government power of an incoming member of Congress to threaten the private citizens because they don't like what we said on Twitter, we should be very afraid. We should be very afraid of the power that some of these people have and how they're going to abuse it.
PIRRO: All right, last --
BOSSIE: And they're not going to be able to control themselves. The Democrats who make up that conference, they're going to be out of control to investigate and impeach this President. Nancy Pelosi is not going to be able to control them and so the American people are going to in 2020 be able to look back and see exactly what they did.
PIERSON: It will he'll be a stark contrast for us.
BOSSIE: Very much.
PIRRO: I can see of myself, anyway, Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie and Katrina Pierson, thanks so much and we'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL)
PIRRO: Thanks so much for watching, everyone, and a very special thanks to all of our fantastic guests and the audience members. I'm Jeanine Pirro, advocating for truth, justice, and the American Way. And I'll see you next Saturday night.
