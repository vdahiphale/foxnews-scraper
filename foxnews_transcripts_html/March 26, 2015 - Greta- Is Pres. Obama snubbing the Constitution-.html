'Off the Record,' 3/26/15: A potential nuclear deal with Iran is a treaty. Does Pres. Obama know that?

Let's go "Off the Record." Is President Obama snubbing the Constitution?
Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 says treaties must be ratified by two-thirds voted of the Senate. So what's a treaty? I looked it up. Here are two dictionary definitions. One says it is a formal agreement between two or more nations with reference to peace, alliance, commerce, or other international relations. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the other dictionary says a treaty is a formal written agreement between two or more nations. So ask yourself, what is it that President Obama is negotiating with Iran? Here is what the Obama State Department spokesperson told us about it: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JEN PSAKI, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: It's negotiated between countries and it's negotiated between leaders of countries.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bingo. It's a treaty. She knows it. And frankly, so does the president. He knows it.
So my message to President Obama, how about it? You taught constitutional law, so it's time to walk the walk. This deal with Iran is a treaty. Period. That means it must go to the Senate for two-thirds ratification. If it's a good idea, the Senate should ratify it. If not, the Senate should not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But at this point, I don't know what the deal is. No one will tell us. But that's another problem. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
