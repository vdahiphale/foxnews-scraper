Is the DNC trying to delegitimize Fox News? Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee discuss. 
This is a rush transcript from "The Ingraham Angle," March 7, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Liberals are doing all they can to silence free speech and especially on campus. Dinesh D'Souza experienced it firsthand and he's here to expose it.
Plus, the DNC trying to delegitimize this network by blocking us from hosting a 2020 Democrat primary debate. Former DNC Chair Ed Rendell is here with Mike Huckabee. That's going to be hot.

And the real story about how illegal immigration is hurting Americans. You will not believe the flow from just El Paso, people who came in were apprehended, bused to Tucson, Arizona. When they're bused to Tucson, we're going to tell you tonight. You got to follow this. What happens then? Who gets the money? How people are dispersed throughout the country? We have it all. Border sheriff is here to reveal it.

INGRAHAM: That's what occurred when college Republicans at Portland State University invited a little-known blogger named Michael Strickland to speak on campus. The harassment continued for an hour, as campus police just looked on. The speaker was effectively silenced for that period of time and the event basically ruined. And that perspective went unheard for the period of time schedule.
This is just yet another in a long line though of examples where conservatives on campus are deprived of their free speech rights. Yes, I'm going to say it again. Deprived of their free-speech rights.
On February 19th, 2019, UC Berkeley, conservative activist Hayden Williams. Remember him? He was punched and attacked.

INGRAHAM: Clever rhyming. Well, there are too many examples to recount here. But the effect in all cases is the chilling or the outright silencing of free speech. Now, I haven't even mentioned the speeches that were scheduled only to be canceled because of left-wing threats. Berkeley canceled Ann Coulter in April 2017 due to security concerns.
Unless you think moderate more mild-mannered Republicans are immune from being targeted, well, think again. Texas Southern University withdrew its invitation to its home state Senator John Cornyn who was slated to be its commencement speaker after activists on campus went nuts. This must stop.

While it's good that police did arrest Zachary Greenberg on this alleged brutal assault on Hayden Williams at UC Berkeley, it shouldn't require a conservative getting injured for universities to start taking this seriously. Colleges talk a really good game about valuing diversity, don't they? On its website, Portland State claims they value diversity and they go to great lengths to proclaim their duty to advance and protect "marginalized communities and those underrepresented in higher education." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');

        }
      
Well, who is more marginalized on campus these days than conservatives, especially conservative guest speakers? Well, despite what happened to D'Souza, Michigan State claims to be "wholly dedicated to freedom of speech, not just as a public institution, but as an institution of higher education. Here ideas - not people - are meant to clash and to be evaluated based on their merits." Well, that sounds nice. But words mean nothing if they're not backed up by action. So what am I talking about? There must be severe and swift repercussions for those who ultimately aim to terrorize, frighten, or defame anyone with opposing views. Now I'm not talking about banning legitimate protests or op-eds, or really the free harsh criticism of people (inaudible). That's fine. I'm talking about punishing those who are essentially robbing others of their First Amendment rights. That's a no-no.
College administrators and trustees who allow these organized intimidation campaigns on campus, they themselves must be held to account. Our producers today called 17 officials at Portland State University, and we also called the Office of Public Safety for comment. Or we asked all of them to appear on the show, including the Portland President Rahmat Shoureshi, and all of them - all of them declined. But we did receive this response from their media relations folks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

"A campus public safety officer monitored the event to ensure the safety of participants. When an individual disrupted the event by ringing a cowbell, the officer used his professional judgment and determined not to threaten or restrain the individual so as not to escalate a potentially unsafe situation. After the disruption, the meeting continued, and PSU facilities management allowed college Republicans to extend their meeting beyond the scheduled end time that night because of the disruption and delay." Well, a lot to unpack there. But the best way to look at that response is in this light. Imagine what would happen if some Neo-Nazi protester interrupted a black students association event in the same way, using similar vile language? Would campus police have just sat there, stood there? And another question, what message does just standing there send to other conservative students who want to invite a speaker who is actually a high-profile person? Again, the chilling effect continues long after the event is disrupted.
And when a state university does this, there are clear constitutional implications because you could argue that they're state actors. Their inability to ensure that students feel comfortable expressing their views on campus and that all speakers - liberal, independent, conservative, what have you - can speak without fear for their safety is the reason President Trump is now promising executive action.

INGRAHAM: Hardly a radical proposition. I say it's about time. But given the fact that groups like Antifa and other assorted domestic, far left organizations conspire to deprive individuals of their constitutional rights to freely speak and associate on campuses, perhaps it is time for the Justice Department to consider some kind of RICO prosecution, RICO civil suit could be filed, maybe a clever lawyer could devise a legitimate class action filing to defend Americans' God-given rights even on campus. The new Attorney General, Bill Barr, has a lot to think about there. And that's “The Angle”.

I'm taking this really seriously because I'm concerned it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
Andy, I want to start with you. You filmed this incident at Portland State. Now, you saw the response from the college. It was - it was rather, you know - rather nothing, if you ask me. Police and campus administrators did nothing to defuse the situation and they claimed that's what kept it safe. And you say?

They did absolutely nothing.

INGRAHAM: Dinesh, he admits he just made up the accusations. Now, is this kind of a common tactic for the anti-free-speech thugs?
DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: Well, first of all, it's important to realize that this - the level of repression of speech on campus now is - this is new. I've been speaking on the campus for 25 years. We've had episodic cases like this. But it has now become systematic. The last four events I did, Dartmouth College, Michigan State, American University, Stanford, disruptions at every single event of varying types, but all aimed at intimidating the conservative students and shutting down, if possible, the event. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think the roots of this actually go back to what a California professor in the '60s advocated. He basically said that we should be tolerant. We on the left should be tolerant. But we should not be tolerant of intolerance. And so what the left is doing here is using this kind of idea, that they are fighting intolerance, except that they are fighting conservatism. They are fighting Republican values and they're taking on people who are not advocating intolerance but just advocating a different point of view. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Now, that's a great point. Because if you're fighting against Hitler, then you - by any means necessary, defeat Hitler. If conservatism, Donald Trump is Hitler, then you can just take them all out. Victor, you've been writing about this for years. The Washington Post op-ed today that made this case that more free - more speech controls will actually hurt conservatives. They claimed it would probably just amount to a deeper distrust and increased vitriol and more partisan conflicts. So they are saying, no, no, no, no, no, just let this all play out.
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: They sound like characters in Orwell's 1984. We want to know where this came from. The guy with the cowbell didn't think this out. He's a product of an educational system that really says that segregation is a safe space, and censorship is a trigger warning, and free speech is hate speech. And so they've been taught that, that any means are justified because they have this noble equality social just ends. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And how do you - and there was also a sin, not just of commission in education but omission. What if he not be taught? He wasn't taught about how rare free speech is in history, from the Greeks to the Romans, the renaissance, and it's this thin. And it's always cut. And it was really a gift, and he would go in and destroy it and he doesn't realize that only in places in the United States and Europe does it even exist. And he threw it away for nothing, like a buffoon. And the question is, how do you stop it? And--
INGRAHAM: Well, I just laid out some ideas. OK?

INGRAHAM: --that don't protect free-speech rights.
HANSON: Exactly. I will give it to this program or this moment that I can certify, but I'm not going to give money because it's like giving narcotics to an addict.
INGRAHAM: Well, Andy, the problem is a lot of these colleges have huge endowments. If you're talking about the Ivy League schools, even in places like Michigan, they have multi-billion dollar endowment. So unlike when Dinesh and I were at Dartmouth where they really felt the pain of alumni saying, well, we're not giving, now they have this - they have kind of a realm of insulation around them. So what -- Andy, given everything you've seen, what's next in this battle for free speech? And what do you suggest that conservatives, parents and students, do about it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
NGO: Well, it doesn't look like university administrators are being part of the solution. Portland State has made it absolutely crystal clear that they are only going to intervene when there is imminent, physical violence or property destruction. In other words, they're providing a blueprint for how to shut down an event. You don't even need a mob anymore. You can just have one person with a cowbell or a bullhorn. I think perhaps this is evidence that Trump's free-speech executive order is needed.
INGRAHAM: Dinesh, I think about $41 million - how much guys gave to Portland State? $41.8 million in federal research money went to Portland State for this kind of thing to happen.
D'SOUZA: I think that Trump is - Trump's step is an important first step, but it's only the beginning. I mean, as this stuff escalates, when you have Antifa violence in places like Berkeley, let's remember, Berkeley is a state university. It's fully accountable to the First Amendment. And the First Amendment is not less valuable than, say, the 14th Amendment, which protects civil rights.
So if I were Trump, I would consider an extreme circumstance of sending in the National Guard because sending in force to protect basic constitutional rights is actually an appropriate use of force. I also think conservatives should not back down in the face of these threats.

A few years ago, Condoleezza Rice was offered a graduation slot, I believe, at Rutgers University. There was a ruckus on campus, and she graciously withdrew, ladylike, basically saying I don't want to speak if they don't want me to speak.
INGRAHAM: Giving in to the mob.
D'SOUZA: But the problem with that kind of surrender is it makes it impossible for that kind of event to occur in the future.
INGRAHAM: Yes. It's raising the white flag of surrender even if she did it because she - she doesn't want to be the focus of any discontent on - which I understand that too. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Victor, there's another - I want to get response for another statement we got today from Portland State's Director of Media and Public Relations, Kenny Ma. We asked him if the university supports free speech or the oppression of free speech and what the university is doing to promote free speech on campus, here's what he said. "We support free speech on campus. The meeting the college Republicans was disrupted. It was not shut down. It continued after the disruption." But is that - is that good enough so you can--?
HANSON: No.
INGRAHAM: If - students are busy. They're doing - I mean, they're shutting, they have a lot of -amount of time to go to something. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANSON: That's like saying I'm going to destroy the studio and you're going to still broadcast at midnight and that it was OK. Those excuse that behavior. So - look, I think that we - all these guys that act like they are Woodstock 2.0 and you see these guys with long hair and - we think they don't - and they're not careerists. They're in college or from the affluent classes in large part.
If they had a criminal conviction or they had an expulsion from the university, I know people my age that that happened too. And they still worry about it. That would be some - that would be a deterrent act. But they do this because they feel that either they're going to be rewarded or there's no consequences. So you're right about that, but if you started expelling and arresting these kids and you--
INGRAHAM: What did we talk about with the Kavanaugh? You have Julie Swetnick--
HANSON: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: --and people making false allegations or leaking information from the committee, Dianne Feinstein's office.
HANSON: Yes.
INGRAHAM: You can't just let it go.

        }
      
HANSON: No. And you saw what The Washington Post did when they were threatened with that - with that--
INGRAHAM: Lawsuit.
HANSON: --lawsuit. Absolutely. And--
INGRAHAM: Lawsuit by the Parkland. I mean--
(CROSSTALK)
HANSON: They're not courageous socialist justice. The way we act--
INGRAHAM: Covington Catholic.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANSON: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: Andy, do you agree with that that we need federal action? In some cases, there could be state action, university action, alumni pressure, as Dinesh said. Maybe parents decide they're not going to send these kids to these lousy schools and they're going to go to - lousy because they don't protect free speech not because they're not great departments, but they're going to go to other schools, maybe they'll go to University of Chicago or they'll go to - I don't know - Liberty or Hillsdale--
HANSON: Hillsdale.
INGRAHAM: --Hillsdale or whatever school says we're going to protect free speech, they could corner the market on a lot of conservative parents who want to send their kids to a place they think is safe to express their truth. Andy.
NGO: Those across - everybody across the political spectrum needs to take these incidents more seriously. What's happening is the equivalent of modern-day book burnings. It's people using the heckler's veto to stop the access of information. And the fact that we have those on the left who are downplaying or dismissing these incidents is doing a disservice to the cause of what the university mission is about, which is about open inquiry.
INGRAHAM: Yes. Dinesh, this is the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, otherwise known as FIRE. Their statistics on schools. 90 percent of colleges and universities restrict speech. Only 9 percent of institutions don't - do not maintain any policies that compromise student expression. Almost 800,000 college students attended institution that maintains one of these, ironically named, free-speech zones.
So what do you tell parents out there who, even if they're conservative, just don't like this police state atmosphere on college campuses? What do you tell them today? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
D'SOUZA: I think the parents and the alumni shouldn't just withhold the money. They should actually be more of an activist presence on the campus. And they should actually support the cops. I noticed in the Michigan State incident where the student was yelling and screaming, the police were intimidated. These are working-class cops who are intimidated by upper- class students because they know that the students have the backing of the administration. So the cops are scared of the students. If the cops were empowered, they would do their job. But they're not empowered by the university itself.
INGRAHAM: Victor, I'll let you close that out. That's true. It's true on city streets too. Real quick.
HANSON: Absolutely. Every time we've seen one of these incidents taped or videoed, when somebody is confronted after they provoke somebody, they back down, because - Dinesh is right. As what you've pointed out, they're upper- middle-class kids that don't want any consequences and they've been told by their professors that that behavior is rewarded.
INGRAHAM: They're cuddled kids.
HANSON: They are.
INGRAHAM: And most of them are total cowards.
HANSON: No, they're cowards, absolutely.

INGRAHAM: Welcome back to “The Ingraham Angle” tonight. The effort to suppress free speech across the country, it's not just happening on college campuses. The Democratic National Committee is now blocking Fox News from hosting any 2020 Democratic debates. DNC Chair, Tom Perez, says, "The network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates." Really? Because there's no bias at the other networks, right?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIAN STELTER, CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Every night in primetime, Democrats are dehumanized, they are attacked relentlessly by Fox News primetime hosts. It was always hard for me to imagine the Democratic primary debate taking place in those hours when figures like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are constantly demonized and attacked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK. I got to get this straight for a moment. Stelter says that Fox News dehumanizes Democrats. It's called criticism. OK? But that's what he says. But the liberal media and all the other cables, OK, their primetime hosts, they get a free pass to eviscerate President Trump single night?

INGRAHAM: Well, joining me now is former DNC Chair and former Governor of the great State of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell, along with Governor Mike Huckabee, a Fox News contributor. All right.
Gov. Rendell, let's start with you. What the heck is going on with your party? OK? Gillibrand, Klobuchar, they were just on this network. We have Juan Williams, all sorts of people on our network, the likes of which would not be as conservatives on places like CNN anymore. They've gotten rid of basically all their more pro-Trump, Trump-friendly contributors. So what's going on? Why are Democrats afraid of Fox News or afraid of Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, really?
ED RENDELL, D-PENN., FORMER GOVERNOR: Well, before I answer your question, I want to say hello to Mike Huckabee. Mike and I served as governors together and we collaborated on a lot of initiatives when we both served in the National Governors Association. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The answer to your question is, I don't know. I think it's a mistake for the DNC to do what it did. I know they were taken off a little bit by the New York article. But as you said, if I was DNC Chair - and I think Tom Perez is doing a good job. But if I was DNC Chair, Laura, I would say, give me Bret Baier, Chris Wallace, and Juan Williams, and you can have that Fox debate anywhere, anytime, any numbers of times.
INGRAHAM: Yes. I mean, Chris Wallace--
RENDELL: And I'd be confident—
INGRAHAM: --Martha MacCallum - I mean, take a group of them.
RENDELL: I'd be confident it would be fair. Right.
INGRAHAM: Yes. I--
RENDELL: If we could pick the commentators and the moderators, I think we should have the debate on Fox, because let me tell you, even if you persuade 3 percent of Fox viewers--
INGRAHAM: Yep.
RENDELL: --3 percent last time out carries Michigan.
INGRAHAM: Fat chance. All right - I'm just kidding. Yes. You're making a very valid point.
Governor Huckabee, I want to play something else from Perez because he doubled down on this. The barring of any Fox News hosting of a Democrat debate. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PEREZ: This is about - and this New Yorker report was about interference at the highest levels of Fox News--
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. Yes. We read it. We were at the Bret Baier's (ph) report--
PEREZ: And news side--
I want to have 100 percent confidence that our debates and - and the debates are the most important thing - one of the - some of the most important things we can do.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get it. I just don't know how it helps.
PEREZ: And I want to make sure the debates are focused on the issue--
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get that you want an assurance--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK. So no issues. I want to play one more thing for you. So one would be leading to believe that Fox just doesn't care about issues, the anchors aren't going to handle issues. Let's watch what we did in the last couple of debates.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you promise that you will - and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said several things in that debate, which were not true, sir.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think there should be any restrictions--
TRUMP: No--
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --on the Second Amendment?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for President even if it's not you?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Those are all examples, of course, of Fox News anchors being more than tough, and probably fair, with President Trump -- candidate Trump.
MIKE HUCKABEE, R-ARK, FORMER GOVERNOR: Well, Laura, first of all, let me say hello to Ed Rendell. I wish he and I were running things because we've got along great and got a lot of things done.
INGRAHAM: Yay!
HUCKABEE: By golly, we should be in charge. Ed, great to be with you. But let me get right to the point. I've been on the Presidential debate stage two different times. Well, actually many times, but two different election cycles. One thing people forget, it's not the venue for the networks. It really is the venue for the two parties. I'm going to be like the contrarian here.
And I think Tom Perez is making a mistake. I do agree wholeheartedly with Ed Rendell, there ought to be Fox access to Democrat candidates.
But here's what I would say to both the chairman of the Democrat and Republican committees, Ronna McDaniel and Tom Perez -- take charge of debates. These are your debates for your candidates. I think the whole process is ridiculous and out-of-control, and it is in need of a great blow up. And there should be a complete restructuring of how they are done. And the parties need to control the debates in terms of the time, the place. They ought to pick the people who ask the questions because it has turned into a TV show, not an honest forum. The questions are often ridiculous and insulting.
And I would love to be able to give the political chairmen an earful of what they could do that would help their own parties get their message out to their voters.
INGRAHAM: That's a great point. I think that's a brilliant point. Local reporters are often better, as well --
HUCKABEE: Way better.
INGRAHAM: -- at doing some of these interviews on these big issues, not to take anything away from the big names. But I like some of the local reporters' input.
Governors, I also want to get your reaction to the big news of the day here in Washington. The House voted overwhelmingly to approve a broad resolution calling out racism and anti-Semitic comments without naming Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The Democrats seem to be, I don't know, they don't want to name her despite the fact that that's what brought this whole thing up, obviously, initially linking Jews to money, and then talking about certain people having a divided allegiance to other countries. Should it have been restricted just to the anti-Semitism? A lot of Jewish Americans, at least on social that I'm reading tonight, are pretty outraged.
ED RENDELL, FORMER DNC CHAIRMAN: I think it should have focused on the anti-Semitism. It should have said that Congresswoman Omar made a mistake, because she did make a mistake. As an American, I can tell you the thing that's most cutting to me is that when people talk about Jews and money, and the Benjamins, and us being sneaky people who control things by our money. That to me is the worst slur you can make to a Jewish person.
Congresswoman Omar has some good points when she talks about what's going on in the way the Palestinians are treated, but she should make those points substantively. There is no place for name-calling in any of our affairs, whether it be domestic affairs or international affairs, we should make our points and rest on the strength of our arguments.
So I would've liked her to be named as having made a mistake that triggered these thoughts of anti-Semitism, condemn anti-Semitism, and later on we can condemn all sorts of hate speech, and all sorts of --
INGRAHAM: I watched the C-Span debate. I watch the C-Span debate, Governor, Huckabee, today. It turned into, basically, at least on the Democrat side, kind of a Trump bashing fest. So it was about the migrants and how they're treated. It got expended into all these other topics.
And remember, Steve King lost a committee chairmanship and committee appointments in the wake of making his racially charged statements. They threw the book at him. So why aren't Democrats doing the same thing for Congresswoman Omar, especially when what we are seeing over in Europe with the Labour Party getting just humiliated due to anti-Semitism, we have anti-Semitic floats in carnival parades in Belgium I saw today also online, disturbing images of Jewish Americans in Europe.
HUCKABEE: I just got back from Poland this morning, and one of the things I was doing there was to participate in a ceremony for the righteous of the nations, Polish Christians who helped saved Jews during the holocaust. I think people need to understand that anti-Semitism is not just about rhetoric. There is a long history of people being brutally and savagely murdered in cold blood. And we are not just talking about military combatants, we are talking about innocent men, women, children, and older people. It's a horrible thing and it needs to be addressed.
And I think Nancy Pelosi -- and I have to give her some credit. She's trying, but she's got her hands full with some of these young Democrats who really don't understand what I call basic playground manners when it comes to getting in a public office. And it's creating some real problems for the Democrats. As a Republican, I could take some glory in it and some joy in it, but I don't because it's bad for the country. And that's not good for anybody.
INGRAHAM: Governors, thank you so much. Go ahead, governor.
RENDELL: Laura, in all due difference, in all due difference, I just want to say don't give the Republicans too much credit for what they did to Steve King. It took them 10 years to get around to it.
INGRAHAM: All right, governors, thank you very much.
And new video of a Muslim reporter attempting to question known anti-Semite Linda Sarsour in the halls of Congress. We're going to show you the reception she received. That woman joins me next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: We have a Fox News alert. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort sentenced tonight to 47 months in prison for tax and bank fraud. To be clear, the charges have nothing to do with the president, nor to this case. Manafort faced up to 25 years in prison for five counts for filing false income tax returns, one count of failing to report foreign bank accounts, two counts of bank fraud.
Tonight, he told the judge that he was, quote, humiliated, talked about time in solitary confinement, how horrible that was. And Manafort will be back next week in U.S. district court in D.C. to face sentencing on charges of witness tampering and conspiracy related to his illegal Ukrainian lobbying, and his money laundering. Again, none of this had anything to do with the president or Russian collusion. Judge Ellis strenuously said, today, in the Eastern District of Virginia made this point.
Also tonight, the House overwhelmingly approved a broad resolution to condemn anti-Semitism, but doesn't call out Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The freshman lawmaker has made no apologies for a series of offensive remarks. Her colleague and other radical freshman, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, now doubling down on her demands to impeach president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: I will be joining folks and advocates across the country to file the impeachment -- My god, what is - resolution. I'm sorry. I'm not in the Michigan legislature. Impeachment resolution to start the impeachment proceedings.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Sometimes words like "resolution," they just --
And now one of their friends, Linda Sarsour, seen on Capitol Hill ignoring questions about her own anti-Semitism by a Muslim reporter.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait, wait --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you turn the camera off? I know what you're doing, and I don't appreciate it. Excuse me, why are you blocking the door? You are, like, blocking the door.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just need some of the supporters to actually --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are blocking the door.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now is that reporter, Asra Nomani, and Sara Carter, Fox News contributor. Asra, kudos to you. Loved it, loved it, loved it. What didn't we see in that video?
ASRA NOMANI, MUSLIM REFORMER: What you saw was the Muslim supremacists in action on Capitol Hill. They acted like they own the House of Representatives, and they sort of do right now. They marched through the quarters of Longworth Office Building, and the came to the front door of Rashida Tlaib's office. Linda Sarsour turned to one of her buddies at CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told them not to let me inside the public office. And then the woman stepped forward along with another man, and they became the bouncers at Rashida Tlaib's office. All of a sudden, lobbyists from the Muslim organizations became the gatekeepers in Congress.
INGRAHAM: Everyone should know that Asra happens to be, obviously, a well- known reporter, former reporter for the "Wall Street Journal." But you are a Muslim woman yourself.
NOMANI: I am. I'm Muslim. I helped found an organization called the Muslim Reform Movement. We accept the state of Israel. We don't hate Jews. We are people who believe in secular governance, women's rights, the ability of all of us to live and assimilate and coexist, not making demands and acting like victims in American society.
INGRAHAM: Sara Carter, this has been a really disturbing period of time I think in this country regarding anti-Semitism. We're seeing it in Europe. I'm going to play some sound in a moment. But how serious is this for the Democrat party? They brushed it away, turned it into Trump is a bad guy today, everything is about Trump. This woman says these things about money and Jews and divided allegiance, or divided allegiance, some congresswoman act like they have divided allegiance, and then it's Trump's fault? What is that?
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: It's beyond disturbing, Laura. I think this is just the beginning. I think what we are seeing in these divisions. And Asra said it perfectly. I've traveled, I have many friends that are Muslim. I've traveled throughout the Middle East. This is perfectly said, Muslim supremacy. And who won today? The people that won today are CAIR and the extremists in the Democratic Party. But who lost? It was the Democrats. The Democrats have lost completely, because now how are they going to confront anybody even on the Republican side about anti-Semitism? Look at what they've done today. They refused to call a spade a spade. They have backed out. They have cowered actually down to these progressive radicals.
INGRAHAM: It's amazing.
CARTER: And it's really frightening. And I think Asra really can bring this to the table because we don't hear enough from reformers.
INGRAHAM: Muslim women I think have the power to take this whole thing back. I talk to so many friends of mine --
NOMANI: Some women.
INGRAHAM: Some do. But not Linda Sarsour.
NOMANI: Not fake feminists like Linda Sarsour. But what's happened is the liberal Democrats have decided they are the poster girls.
INGRAHAM: Why? Why do they glam on -- why is Linda Sarsour delivering this new nirvana of feminism? Can you explain that to people?
NOMANI: It's the playbook of these Muslim organizations now. They decided about a decade ago that they were going to become the victims. So that's what happened this last couple of weeks. Rashida Tlaib went from being the bully to today being the victim. And they inserted the anti-Muslim issue into this resolution when it was nothing about that. They made it number one.
INGRAHAM: I'd like to show some images here of what Europe is dealing with. At the big carnival in Belgium, this is on Tuesday I believe, this is a parade float, OK? And Belgium is now in many places majority Muslim, and there's a big Islamist movement in Belgium. Let's put it up on the screen. These are pictures of people obviously who looks Jewish. There's bags of money. This made the rounds on a lot of Islamist websites, like we got them good.
Now, this is happening in the Labour Party in Britain. Let's play this next soundbite.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I never thought I would see the day when Jewish people in this country were concerned about their future in this country.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I cannot remain in a party that I have today come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Moves by other Muslims in Britain against gay citizens, disturbing images that we saw today. What do you make of it?
CARTER: These are horrific images, and this is a very dangerous time. I can tell you this, Laura. There was a documentary I helped worked on, it's called "Never Again Is Now." And it was about two Jewish women in Amsterdam that literally left Amsterdam to the United States because of what is happening over there in Europe. The anti-Semitism is extreme. We are seeing it here in the United States. We have to call it out. We cannot be afraid, we cannot cower down. And we have to talk for Muslim women that do not support this type of radicalism.
NOMANI: So for us, what is happening is our religion has been taken over by these extremists. Seventeen years ago, it was my colleague Danny Pearl who was murdered. His last words, "I am a Jew, my mother is a Jew, my father is a Jew." Danny's father called me today, and he said that he is, I wrote it down. He said I am devastated. Today is a day of infamy, because like in the U.K., Jews in America are afraid. And we have to stand with them.
INGRAHAM: This cannot stand. Both of you, your voices are very important. Thank you for joining us tonight. We'll have you both back on this issue, be covering it.
And I've got a big update on this border crisis. What's happening that's impacting communities away from the border, not too far from the border but away from the border? A sheriff near the border is sounding an alarm on a real emergency. Don't want to miss make it, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: We have been telling you for months, actually the last year-and- a-half, about the real impact illegal immigration has on communities across this country. But what really happens when they arrive illegally? And what impact does then that have on local resources? For more, we go to a fairly shocking report from Trace Gallagher in our west coast newsroom. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Laura. The media has focused almost solely on the Central American caravans whose journeys toward the U.S. have in most cases abruptly ended in Tijuana where they wait for their U.S. asylum claims to be processed. By that is a small part of a much bigger picture. For example, as we have been reporting and as the Arizona republic is now handling in-depth, thousands of Central American migrants are still crossing and being smuggled across open borders.
The way it works is they turn themselves over to Border Patrol agents, apply for asylum, and are then released until their case comes to court. Last month alone more than 1,100 families, mostly from Central America, were apprehended near El Paso, then transported to Tucson and released. They are initially housed in Tucson at makeshift shelters including a former monastery that holds 200 people, but for months has struggled to accommodate the constant flow of families. In fact, El Paso is now the second busiest crossing point along the southern border behind the Rio Grande Valley.
And then there is this -- apprehension of migrant families this year from last year is up 1,689 percent. And asylum-seeking families make up more than 60 percent of all apprehensions, which leads to the domino effect, meaning 25 percent of on-duty border patrol agents have to be diverted to care for, transport, and process those migrant families. And when you take away a quarter of the enforcement, the border is less secure, which exacerbates the problem. And now Tucson is feeling pressure in not just its shelters, but at hospitals, food banks, and schools. Laura?
INGRAHAM: Trace, unbelievable. Thank you very much.
And here now to react, a sheriff of one of those communities that spans more than 100 miles along the Mexico border. Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Napier joins me now. Sheriff you heard a report. What are you seeing? Are you seeing violence, unrest as a result of illegal immigration in your community specifically?
MARK NAPIER, PIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA, SHERIFF: Well, Laura anybody that would deny that there is a crisis, a humanitarian crisis, a public safety crisis on the border, is simply being intellectually dishonest. We have tremendous influx of migrants and no way the system to care for them, especially because the advent of unaccompanied minors and families units is something the system is just not adapted to address. So we have these temporary shelters, and sometimes we even have them just dropped off at bus stops and left to wonder into the community. So this is a humanitarian crisis that we've never experience. I've been in this valley for 32 years, I've never seen anything like this. And then the leveraging of migrant traffic to then backfill drug trafficking behind it because as the last person pointed out --
INGRAHAM: Look at this.
NAPIER: -- Border Patrol is overwhelmed.
INGRAHAM: Look at this line. I just want to play something really quick for you. This is from Jacob Soboroff who has done a lot of reporting on the border on MSNBC. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JACOB SOBOROFF, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: The reason the numbers are going up are not because of some crazy phenomena we have never seen before. Donald Trump and his policies and his rhetoric are encouraging people in some cases, forcing people in other cases, to cross the border illegally.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I've never heard of anything more ridiculous in my life. Trump is encouraging people to come? Sheriff, very quickly.
NAPIER: Completely absurd. That is absolutely false. It's the conditions in Central America, the desperation of other than Mexican people are feeling to come here in hope of a better life is exacerbating that condition. The president has absolutely nothing to do with encouraging this behavior, and that is just a silly argument.
INGRAHAM: It's one of the more disingenuous things I've heard, and I've heard a lot of disingenuous things. Sheriff, thank you very much.
By the way, we invited some Tucson sheriffs onto the show tonight, but they curiously said no. We've got to remind them that they are representing the citizens of Arizona, not one particular constituency that happens to be transported into the state from Texas.
All right, the last bite, you don't want to miss it when we come back. It's a good one.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(SHOUTING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That is amazing, and it demonstrates why great teachers and coaches are so important for students. Thank you for your service, captain, you got quite the welcome home from your students. I think I watched that five times.
That is all the time we have tonight. Make sure to check out my new podcast. It dropped a new one today, a new one tomorrow. Subscribe at Podcast One or iTunes.
