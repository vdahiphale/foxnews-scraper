MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Thank you, Bret. So, "The Story" does begin tonight in Alabama where there is a fierce fight underway to the finish. We have dual rallies tonight in Alabama on the eve of their special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' seat. Republican Roy Moore is in Midland City -- you can see the camera getting its focus on the left-hand side of your screen there. And then, you got Democrat Doug Jones, he's in Birmingham on the right-hand side of the screen. This as outsiders' dive in, full steam ahead in the final hours tonight. President Trump, former President Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, all making their feelings known in robocalls on behalf of their candidates.
Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. A new Fox News poll shows Roy Moore down by 10 with a few hours to go until the voters start to cast their ballots there. The poll shows 50 percent of likely voters prefer Democrat Doug Jones over Roy Moore. That is unprecedented in Alabama, folks. So, we're going to be watching this very closely. We will speak with Roy Moore's campaign spokesperson in a moment, but first Peter Doocy gets us up to speed at the Jones' rally in Birmingham tonight with our top story. Hi, Peter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER: Hi, Martha. Judge Moore weathered weeks calls to drop out of the race but didn't do it, and he lasted long enough to make it to his campaign election day ritual tomorrow morning, which is a horseback ride with his wife to the polling place. So far, on election eve, the only time that we've seen Judge Moore has been on social media, where after the port authority terrorist attack earlier, he told his followers that he is the candidate who would help President Trump enforce his travel ban. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The final Moore Campaign event does happen a little while from now in Midland City. It's a rally with Steve Bannon, the third-time Bannon has been in Alabama on the judge's behalf. I just talked to a source familiar with what he will say, the president's former chief advisor, and the focus is going to be on economic nationalism. He's going to make the case that the things President Trump has been doing on his own have been working, but he needs Judge Moore in the Senate to take on the establishment and advance the Trump agenda even further. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On another side, the Democrat Doug Jones, is counting on Republicans to help him win, because he says that voters here have been supporting Republican Senator Richard Shelby for decades, so we think that they are going to follow his lead and ditch Moore for a ride-in candidate, which is (INAUDIBLE) for Jones to point because Shelby never actually said to back Jones. The Democratic candidate has not spent a ton of time today rehashing allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore. Instead, he's trying to draw attention to the fact that Roy Moore reportedly left the state to attend this weekend's Army/Navy game in Philadelphia.
The Jones Campaign today is benefitting from that robocall recorded by President Obama, but the chairman told me he doesn't really think that Alabamians want to be told what to do by an outsider. So, tonight, at the closing rally right behind us, about 45 minutes from now, they're going to hear from a hometown hero, Charles Barkley. You can see the people are starting to trickle in right now for that. Martha.

        }
      
MACCALLUM: Peter, thank you very much. Peter Doocy on the ground there. So, what is the Moore Campaign strategy in the final stretch? Here now, Janet Porter, Roy Moore Campaign Spokesperson. Janet, good to have you with us tonight.
JANET PORTER, SPOKESPERSON, ROY MOORE CAMPAIGN Thank you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: You know, first address that. There's -- all weekend, it was where is Roy Moore? Why is he not campaigning? Was he at that game over the weekend? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PORTER: Well, I don't know where he was, but I do know that he's been campaigning all along. And we run into each other all the time along the trail, and he's going to be campaigning here tonight, telling Alabama voters that he's the guy to send to Washington to drain the swamp. But let me tell you why we see the -- all the swamp creatures are crawling into Alabama to try to tell them what to do, because this whole race is about the United States Supreme Court, because the winner of this senate race is going to be the deciding vote on who will sit on the United States Supreme Court for the next 30 or 40 years. So, it doesn't do any good to --
MACCALLUM: I mean, that could've been true, really, regardless of who the Republican is. You know, I do want to ask you about Senator Shelby, though, because, you know, Alabamians have elected him for over 40 years. And it's really stunning for a sitting senior senator to say do not elect the man who is from my party in this election. I want you to write someone else in. That's a pretty stunning development.
PORTER: Well, you know, what it's a pretty easy thing to do when you don't look at the fact that the allegations have no credibility. When you do look at who stands with Roy Moore, it's President Trump, it's the governor of Alabama, the party of Alabama. It's people like Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Ben Carson, Governor Mike Huckabee, Governor Sarah Palin, and most importantly the people of Alabama. They know the judge the best. And I believe they're going to stand with him -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: But let me ask you about this, Janet. Let me ask you. You know you brought up the allegations. Quinn Hillyer, who's a very well- known conservative Alabamian writer, you know, he's backed Judge Moore through a lot of his tribulations over the years. He came out, and he said he lied. He said that Judge Roy Moore has said I don't know any of these women, I didn't date any of these women, I'm not engaged in any --
PORTER: That was a misunderstanding. Let me clarify that.
MACCALLUM: -- let me finish. Sexual misconduct with anyone. But in previous interviews, he said, actually, that he knew two of them. He said, he knew Debbie Wesson and Gloria Thacker, so which is it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PORTER: Which, by the way, those women have not alleged any misconduct. What he was speaking of, is that he didn't know the women who had actually alleged any misconduct. So, those women, he has nothing to do with, never met them, doesn't know them, and he may have been a family friend of some of them, he may have gone to dinner, I don't know. But, and when it talks about these sexual misconduct, what we're talking about here in this situation, is that the very single shred of evidence, that yearbook, was shown to be a fraud. For those who missed it, the woman who said that he signed it, he didn't sign it. She said she signed it in part, which is a forgery. When you say something is true, and you know that to be -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: No, she -- hold on a second. Janet, hold on. Hold on. The note, he wrote, OK? We can all agree on that, right? And then, the date and place is her handwriting.
PORTER: But she had previously said -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: But, no. But we have to be -- we have to be factual about this.
PORTER: She previously said he signed the whole thing.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PORTER: What she said is that Judge Roy Moore, this was his entire inscription, that he signed --
MACCALLUM: No, Janet. You know you know you're splitting hairs here, OK? I just want to -- I don't want it, you brought this up.

I just wanted to clarify some of the things that have been, you know, kicked up in the dust in all of this. And when it comes down to it, the voters tomorrow night get to make sure their choice about who they want to be their senator, whether or not they believe the allegations, whether or not they think they're credible, whether or not they think they're substantive enough to influence their decision.

TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Look, I think that it's fascinating, but one of the things that happen is, the entire conversation that we've been having through this race, which is about whether or not someone signed a yearbook or didn't, and who he knows and who he doesn't, and it's because the left doesn't want the details of the issues to be discussed. That's the problem. I also think when it comes to someone like Senator Shelby, it's fascinating that he says, well, effectively ride-in someone for this, but he says he's not telling anyone to vote for Doug Jones.
The fact is, this is an issue now about turnout because we see the polls are all over the place. If you, in fact, negate your vote by putting in a ride-in, you're effectively voting for Doug Jones, because you're taking the vote away from the Republican. And for the Republican Party, regardless of what happens tomorrow, to be behaving in a manner that would make sure that -- especially with the issues that we face in this country - - that the Republican wouldn't be moved into the Senate, that is going -- there's going to be some backlash for the party itself. And I think the president still is learning about the nature of the party, this kind of recommendation to actually help a Democrat, who is the antithesis of everything that the revolution, the Trump revolution stands for. That, I think, is not helping his base -- the GOP base, and certainly not the voters of Alabama don't like it either, I think.
MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, regardless of the circumstances, or even who may have encouraged some of these stories to come out and fomented them, they're out there. So, now, everyone has to decide whether they think they're credible, whether or not these issues matter to them if it's something they feel strongly about. And we know, Richard, that we've heard a lot of Alabama voters say that they don't believe it, that they don't believe these women, that they believe Judge Moore when it comes to these issues, and that they don't want to be told by outsiders what they should think.

FOWLER: I mean, I think that's absolutely right, Martha, which makes this race so interesting. And I think poll -- the Fox Newsletter that we released today, speaks to one thing, and I think the poll that actually might be a little bit tighter tomorrow. And we really don't know who's going to win this election. But when you think about it for just a moment, you listen to Janet, his spokesperson, she was on just a second ago, they seem to try to dismiss these sorts of things like there are no facts here. But if you look at The Washington Post source, the first story, it had 30 different sites, including testimony from this particular woman. Now, due process is going to really come down to what the Alabama voters decide to do tomorrow. Do they stand with somebody who slept with teenagers, because he's going to vote against abortion or do they stand with --
MACCALLUM: I don't know that there's an allegation of sleeping with a teenager. But anyway, go ahead. No, if you look at the facts of the case, that's not part of it. There's touching accusation, but, you know.
FOWLER: That's a very fair point.

MACCALLUM: Let me ask you a quick question, because, you know, this is where we're going in this whole me too situation, right? You know, Al Franken, for example, he said, didn't do it, didn't do what he was accused of. That's what Roy Moore says as well, Richard. So, what do you stand on that?

FOWLER: Well, listen, I saw this earlier today and happening now, and I'm going to say it again here. I think this idea of both parties trying to find some moral high ground is an absolute mirage because there is no moral high ground to conquer or to claim. Because on both -- in both parties, both the Democratic Party and Republican Party, you have individuals that's engaged in some sort of sexual misconduct, or allegations of sexual misconduct. For the Republicans, those allegations of sexual misconduct goes over to the White House. For the Democrats, it goes to many senators.
BRUCE: If I could just add, all of this, frankly, because there is some equity here with what's horrible about it, but these issues are larger. What your family is going to face in the next several years, whether or not we're a safe nation, frankly, this is larger than Roy Moore, and that's how people are going to vote. And I don't know if Richard Shelby doesn't like to vote for Roy Moore, how does he manage to walk into the capitol building these days --

        }
      
BRUCE: I think not. This is the same dynamic that's happening here in Alabama that should happen next year and happened last year. The American people realize they've been taken for a bit of a ride by the swamp. They want a different future, and they're going to fight for that different future. They will then, perhaps, in the midterms, also make switch outs and expect the Senate to be cleaned out in general. But I think, no, this is about the future of American families, and that's what matters to the American people.

MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, a terrorist with a homemade bomb tries to blow himself up in a crowded subway tunnel this morning. That was the Monday morning head to work for a lot of commuters in New York City. Hours later, he's in custody. The city's back to normal. A lot of people say, this is the new normal -- this is what we live in now, folks. This is a normal Monday morning in America. They might think twice when they hear what he was really planning, what he had inside that bag, and the concerns about Christmas in New York. Pete King next on that.
And then, a story exclusive as three women step forward to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct. The woman who made that kind of accusation against Bill Clinton with a far more brutal crime. Why the media refused to listen to her then and why they're still shutting her out now. Juanita Broderick shares her story with me live, coming up.

MACCALLUM: When a pipe bomb goes off on your morning commute, leaving several people injured, you would expect that be a really big issue that shuts down the whole city, right? But this morning it took a matter of minutes for the police to arrest the suspected bomber, and a matter of hours before New Yorkers just returned to work. They were all over Rockefeller Center, all over the city, business as usual. When you think about it, we, all of us, really, in this country are living essentially in a war zone, because you really don't know where or when the next bomb will go off. That is the new normal, and it feels, well, it just feels wrong. Trace Gallagher is here with the backstory, with the 27-year-old man, and who is in a New York hospital tonight, who started the day by strapping a bomb to his chest. Good evening, Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening, Martha. The explosion happened in a passenger way of New York's busiest transit hub with subway trains below ground and a bus station above. Authorities say, 27-year-old, Akayed Ullah, strapped a pipe bomb to his body using Velcro and zip ties. Though, investigators have yet to determine if the low-tech device was intentionally detonated or it went off accidentally.
The New York ABC affiliate is now reporting the explosive was a 12-inch pipe bomb packed with nails and other bits intended to make it more lethal. And while the motive remains unclear, Ullah was inspired by ISIS, although it appears he never had contact with the terror group. Akayed Ullah is a Bangladeshi national living in Brooklyn as a lawful permanent resident. He came here from Bangladesh in 2011, on an F-43 chain migration visa, meaning that he was sponsored by a family member who had already been admitted to the U.S. It's called chain migration because the process sets off a chain reaction.
According to the center for immigration studies, over the past 35 years, 61 percent of all immigrants came here through chain migration -- something President Trump is trying to change. Today the president released a statement that reads in part, "As I have been saying since I first announced my candidacy for president, America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access to our country." And Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this. Watch.

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president's policy calls for an end to chain migration, which is what this individual came to the United States through. And if his policy had been in place, then that attacker would not have been allowed to come in the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: It's notable, Sayfullo Saipov, the man accused of killing eight in New York's Halloween truck attack, came to the U.S. through a diversity immigrant visa program, which the president is also trying to end. And the man accused of today's attack in New York says he chose Times Square because the Christmas posters reminded him of the Christmas market attacks in Europe in recent years. Martha?

MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. Here now with more tonight, New York Congressman Peter King, Chairman of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee. Congressman, good to have you with us tonight.
REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: Thank you, Martha.
MACCALLUM: You know, this morning when I saw all of this, I thought, you know, is this a decoy, is this the first one, and then other ones around the city. And we've all become sort of wired to live this way.
KING: Yes. In fact, I was on my way to Manhattan for a meeting with Governor Cuomo, which obviously has to be canceled. And that was the concern that the police and the FBI had, was it one-off or was it the first of many? Is it being coordinated overseas, are there other bombs around New York, New Jersey, or Long Island, that they have to be concerned about? Right now, it appears that he was acting on his own, that he was inspired - - he says he's been inspired by ISIS, and it's not part of a larger sequence.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Having said that, Christmas is coming up. There are millions of people in Manhattan. You walk through the streets during Christmas time, you know how crowded they are. The subways, the six million passengers on New York City subways every day. It's not like an airport. You can't put them through magnetometers, and you can't be checking their I.D. So, the NYPD is the best in the world at what they do. They're definitely going to be stepping up security. But Martha, we live in a dangerous world, and I think, unfortunately, people in between attacks, they forget how real a threat is. If this done was done slightly different today, we could've had countless people murdered or maimed.
MACCALLUM: So true. I mean, it's just a couple of months ago, we had a guy drive down the west side highway onto the bike path and killed people. This is the message that ISIS is putting out there about Christmas. You know, obviously, they have propaganda all over the place. We need a Christmas in New York, this, you know, chilling message says. And this guy was, sort of, like a failed Tsarnaev brother. I mean he was at home on the Internet. He lived in his basement, apparently. The only weird thing from neighbors is that some of them said that there was fighting going on in the house in the house over the last couple of days. Lived with his brother and his sister. But these guys are very hard to find, right?
KING: They are. Again, though, we do need increased surveillance, we need more monitoring, we need to have more sources within the Muslim community. That's where the threat is coming from. We can't let political correctness get in the way. And as the investigation goes forward, we may find out there were other signs. You know, it took us several weeks before we found out on the Tsarnaev brothers that there were actually reasons to be suspicious of them. In this case, there may or may not be, but --

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Well, they've been investigated by the FBI a couple of times. I don't think that's the story with this guy, right?
KING: No. From what I understand, there's nothing in his record at all, so far. There's no criminal record, there's no terrorist watch list he's on, and it doesn't appear to be anything he's done back in Bangladesh. But again, (INAUDIBLE).
KING: And we know he went back there not too long ago, right?
KING: He did go back. And again, it's going to be important to find out who he was with, again if he had any contact with them after he left. The FBI and NYPD, they got warrants -- they've gone through his e-mails, they're going through social media, they're going through his phone messages, they're talking to his friends and neighbors, every place he's bought something at, any people he's visited, people at work. All that is being monitored. So, we're really in the first 12 hours of a long investigation.
MACCALLUM: And he's alive, and he's in a hospital here in New York. Peter King, thank you, congressman. Always great to talk to you.
KING: Thank you, Martha.
MACCALLUM: So, about two hours after today's attack, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told New Yorkers essentially that this is the way it is, that terror attacks are a part of life here. Watch.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Here now, Brigitte Gabriel, Founder and CEO of Act for America; and Mohammad CHAUDHRY, a Member of the True Islam Campaign. My thanks to both of you for being here this evening. Brigitte, first to you, when you listen to that statement, you know, it feels like it's on replay, every time something like this happens.
BRIGITTE GABRIEL, FOUNDER AND CEO OF ACT FOR AMERICA: It is. This is the new reality we live in. We are at war, and we better start admitting and realizing that we are at war. We may not have started this war, but our enemy sure is determined to attack us and kill as many of us as possible. They repeatedly tell us this. ISIS already issued videos about attacking America on all (INAUDIBLE) during the holiday season. They even put up a picture of Times Square. So, it's not like we didn't expect it. And this is why the citizenry, Martha, right now need to work with our FBI and our first responders, and we are truly the eyes and ears in our community. We need to pay attention to what's happening around us, especially around the holidays. If you are walking in Times Square, or any major city, instead of walking and looking at your phone, look around you, watch for suspicious activity, and call the authorities if you see anything out of place.
MACCALLUM: Yes. Muhammad, you know, it becomes a conversation right away, this man fit the profile of the people that we've seen who do these kinds of acts time and time again. What are your concerns about that, and what can be done to make sure that we find these guys before they do this?
MUHAMMED CHAUDHRY, MEMBER OF THE TRUE ISLAM CAMPAIGN: Martha, first and foremost, what's really important is the security of our fellow Americans, and we want to be thankful to our first responders for doing this day in and day out. As a representative of the Muslim Community, Muslims who believe the Messiah, we need to turn to proven models versus shallow theories in times like this. And I want to turn to the leader of Islam has said, the (INAUDIBLE) Islam has said items that he's addressed this.

One is, to immigrants' two integration is to have a love for your country and be completely loyal to it, and that's an Islamic tradition, that's the Islamic faith. So, he said that. Secondly, he has said all our mosques, Congressman King just addressed, opening our mosque, he has said, all our mosque are open because transparency leads to trust. I believe this person is a lone wolf. He does not represent Islam and a political ideology. But as Muslims, we are ready and we have campaigns to ensure that this doesn't happen again in America.
MACCALLUM: Yes, would you two agree with all of that?
GABRIEL: Actually, I do agree with him, but I want to point out that Muhammed belongs to the Ahmadia movement like he said in the beginning. The Ahmadia movement is not what Muslims worldwide believe that represents Islam. There are only 10, 20 million around the world. They started at the end of the 19th century, they have the Orocan leaf, they have their own caliphate. Actually, Muslims around the world, Sunni Muslims, consider that as covfar or morted. So, therefore, we need to realize that people like Muhammad, he wants more of him, of his sect, his voice speaking out. Unfortunately, what he's saying does not represent the ideology of these radicals who want to kill not only us but also the Ahmadia as well. So, we do have and need to recognize that, and we do need to recognize that there are --
MACCALLUM: Let's let Muhammed respond to that quickly, and then I got to go. Muhammad, go ahead.
CHAUDHRY: It's not -- I've got to say, the Ahmadia Muslim community is the largest organized Muslim community in the world, and we're fighting on the right side of this. And I don't think we should discard it. I mean, the America has six percent of the world population, yet it is a leader in the world. So, size doesn't matter as much as ideology, and I think we can beat ISIS, we can beat these extremists, by providing a counter-ideology alike, the true Islam campaign which you mentioned earlier.
MACCALLUM: Thank you so much to both of you. Good to have you here tonight. So, you might expect the details of a terrorist attack to steal the headlines when you turn on the morning news, but some viewers were treated to this as well, an in-depth analysis of the president's eating and drinking habits this morning at the same time this was happening.

Then, remember the DOJ official recently demoted -- we documented this story very closely here last week for concealing the meetings that he had. He's a member of the DOJ, but he was meeting with the guys from Fusion GPS and Christopher Steel. But that wasn't the only thing that he didn't tell us about his ties to the dossier. The explosive new headlines about his family member when we come back.

UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I think people who have been around the president for any real period of time knows that he is a television addict.
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The other thing that would concern me more is this consistent consumption of fats and sugars and all sorts of stuff that's bad for you.
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is not OK, what doctors would recommend. This is not the healthiest diet.

MACCALLUM: Here now David Bossie, president of Citizen United, former deputy campaign manager, and author of the new book, Let Trump be Trump, the inside story of his rise to the presidency. David, I mean, you know, you have to be very concerned. You heard the man, about President Trump's diet.
DAVID BOSSIE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: This is coming from people who don't know him. I don't know who that person is, never heard of him. Maybe he's a close personal friend of the president. But I'm not concerned about the president's eating habits. Look, this guy has a motor, a stamina that is unbelievable. Young people.
MACCALLUM: Apparently fueled by caffeine and Diet Coke. I mean, if you drink 10 Diet Cokes, you're going to have quite a bit of energy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOSSIE: No, no, no. Look, he enjoys a Diet Coke every now and then, but this is ridiculous. This is what the American people get sick of, this type of gotcha moments by all the news -- of fake news is fit to print in the New York Times. It's outrageous. Look, during the campaign, did we eat, you know, fast-food? Absolutely. Why? Because the president was always on the move. He was going from event to event, city to city, state to state, and we never stopped for a meal. We didn't sit in restaurants and eat. We were on the move.
MACCALLUM: And certainly you're not going to say no when the boss wants his McDonald's, which you guys document in your book is definitely his preference. But I think you touched on something that's probably the most important point here, which is that we have a lot of really important things going on in the world.
BOSSIE: That's right.
MACCALLUM: And I think about -- when I heard this, you know, sort of dissection of his eating habits, which I think is just sort of -- it's anecdotally interesting to hear, you know, what presidents do in their free time or while they're working simultaneously, you know, keeping one eye on cable news while they're talking with other people and all of that. I thought about Churchill, because I recently read a similar sort of iteration of his habits, you know, beer in the morning, whiskey for lunch, a one-hour bath at lunchtime. Does President Trump take a one-hour bath every day in the middle of the day that you know?
BOSSIE: Never heard of such a thing. No, no.
MACCALLUM: And Churchill was remembered as someone who got quite a bit -- quite a lot done. So I just find it really hilarious. He said -- Churchill said, champagne and meals and buckets of carrot and soda in between. He said I neither want it, brandy, or need it. But I think it's pretty hazardous to interfere with eradicable habit of a lifetime. So, you know, perhaps President Trump should stick with his Diet Coke.
BOSSIE: Yeah. He doesn't drink alcohol at all, in any form or fashion. So, you know, look, this is a ridiculous story, and the president's TV habits. The president of the United States, it doesn't matter which president it is, has televisions on in the background at all times. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Yeah.
BOSSIE: These people don't know anything about what they're talking about.
MACCALLUM: Well, he has a voracious media appetite. We've known that about him forever.
BOSSIE: But he reads everything. He's a voracious reader. He reads cover to cover. This is a story that people don't know. He reads cover to cover, not the front page section, an entire newspaper cover to cover, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, every day. This is laughable.
MACCALLUM: David, I want to ask you one other question of substance, since, you know, I'm mocked other places for not doing that. I want to ask you about taxes and corporate taxes because now Kevin Brady on the house side is saying that he's not necessarily married to the 20 percent number. It used to be at 25. And the president was very committed to that number. So, is he going to be OK with less than 20?
BOSSIE: Here's what I think. I think that the issues of the state and local tax, the salt issue, is something that they're trying to rectify so that people aren't harmed, so that people aren't getting a tax increase in certain states, and there's about 8 or 10 states that are being talked about with a potential increase. So, I think they're talking about the corporate rate maybe having to be adjusted as part of an opportunity to get tax cuts for all individual American taxpayers.
MACCALLUM: All right. We'll stay tuned. David, always good to see you, thank you very much.

BOSSIE: Thanks for having me.
MACCALLUM: So today we saw three women step forward accusing President Trump of sexual misconduct, but what about the woman who accused President Clinton of a much worse crime, actually. She said that the media has had no interest in her story. Juanita Broaddrick here to share it in my exclusive interview straight ahead. And then, remember the DOJ official recently demoted for concealing the fact that he met with Christopher Steel of the dossier and also Glen Simpson. But that wasn't the only thing that he didn't tell us about his ties to the anti-Trump dossier, the explosive connection to his closest family member, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, exclusive new information obtained by Fox News, shedding light on the politics of what is supposed to be an independent investigation into the Russian collusion question in the 2016 election. We were the first to break the news last week that Bruce Ohr, a man working at the highest level of the probe at the Department of Justice, was demoted shortly after Fox News asked about his ties to the anti-Trump dossier, ties that included meeting with Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson, whose organization commission the dossier, also meeting with Christopher Steele. And tonight, those ties appear to extend even deeper. We're learning that Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS during the campaign. So what to make of all of this? Here now Buck Sexton, former CIA officer, David Tafuri , former state department official and Obama campaign foreign policy advisor. Welcome to both of you. David, let me start with you. It's like a family tree, you know, and you keep extending it out. Glen Simpson's wife also had connections. There's all of these ties to the Clinton campaign. You have Andrew Wiseman, who went to the party that was supposed to be her victory party that night. So how can these people be impartial when it comes to investigating either Hillary Clinton before the election, or President Trump and his team during the campaign?
DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, it's important that Fox News did the investigative work to break the story, and congrats to you and to James Rosen, and this is an important story and we need to get to the bottom of it. The latest information is particularly concerning, because it suggests that Ohr's wife was working for Fusion GPS. That would suggest he had a conflict of interest under the DOJ guidelines. It could be both a financial conflict and a personal conflict because she was apparently being paid by Fusion GPS, and she also had an interest in supporting Fusion GPS. And so that's of concern. But we don't know exactly what Ohr's role was in the investigation. And it's also important to note now that the special counsel's office is operating separately from the Department of Justice, independently from the Department of Justice. So Ohr and whatever he was doing, would not have influence over Mueller and the special counsel investigation.
MACCALLUM: But what is clear, Buck, is that, you know, there wasn't really a very big effort to choose people to do this investigation, who would be completely above reproach. Conflict of interest, sometimes, that's all it is. It doesn't mean that you have any strong feelings, that you would act differently, but just that there's an appearance of impropriety that smacks of something that should not be part of the investigation, and it appears they made no effort to do any of that.
BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Martha, yeah, I think it's much worse. I think what we see are a whole bunch of pro-Clinton, anti-Trump partisans that have at key knows -- at key points in the investigation, whether it's Hillary's emails, or the interview with General Flynn, and then with the Mueller special counsel probe, have been involved in ways that I think do raise a lot of questions. And once we start talking about the dossier, specifically, there is still the possibility that much of what we're discussing when it comes to the Russia collusion probe could have been started by the dossier, which was opposition research, paid for by Hillary and the DNC. And if in fact that was the basis for essentially weaponising part of the intelligence community to engage in a counter intelligence investigation against a U.S. political campaign that is a bombshell, and I think that's why you've seen some hesitancy on the part of the DOJ to come clean with some of this information. I mean, we should have known a long time ago if anyone tied to the dossier was also involved at the DOJ with the Mueller probe, this should not be news -- and again, Fox News doing excellent work to unearth it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: I mean, David, that's the problem. I mean, it looks terrible, right? It looks like all these people were so concerned about a Trump presidency that they felt like they were doing something righteous to try to throw whatever roadblock they could in front of it, even if it meant paying for a dossier that turned out to be largely unsubstantiated, and using that as a way to investigate members of the campaign?
TAFURI: Well, let me correct something that Buck said. Buck said this started with a dossier. It did not start with a dossier. This started with the communications between the Trump campaign and Russia. Those communications happened, and we have evidence, irrefutable evidence, of those communications.
SEXTON: What's the irrefutable evidence? I like to know. How would you what that evidence is?
(CROSSTALK)
TAFURI: Let me tell you, they're emails between Donald Trump Jr. and Wikipedia, which was serving as an agent.
(CROSSTALK)
TAFURI: There's conversations between the Russian ambassador and the Trump campaign. There were meetings.
SEXTON: This is nothing.
TAFURI: . Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. -- don't interrupt me, Buck. Let me finish. There're meetings that happened. All of this there's irrefutable evidence of now. So it doesn't matter what the dossier says.
(CROSSTALK)
SEXTON: And the WikiLeaks story that would have been evidence of some kind of collusion was just entirely debunked much to the mainstream media's chagrin. If it's as straightforward as you just said it was.
(CROSSTALK)
TAFURI: I'm talking about the emails between Donald Trump Jr. and Wikipedia, which are verified.
MACCALLUM: We've got to leave it there guys. But I will have you back, I promise. Thanks you guys. Coming up, she accused President Bill Clinton of doing the unthinkable. And now as the media continues to shed light on horrific stories of sexual assault, she wants to know why her story has virtually been ignored. Juanita Broaddrick joins me exclusively to share her story and she has a message for everyone in the media when we come back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: And no human being was more harassed and ridiculed and trashed as Bill Clinton's victims were.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: They've investigated other Congress members, so I think it only stands fair that he be investigated as well. And I think also a nonpartisan investigation is very important, not -- you know, not just for him, but for anybody that has allegations against him. This isn't a partisan issue. This is how women are treated every day.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Three women today calling out President Trump, saying that he behaved inappropriately when he was around them, and they want congress to investigate. It comes amid a reckoning of sorts across this nation on harassment and sexual conduct. Just last week, Time Magazine named the silence breakers as their person of the year, so to speak. But one person who was not included in that issue, the woman who for decades accused former President Bill Clinton of rape. Juanita Broaddrick joins me now in a story exclusive. Juanita, good to have you here tonight. It's stunning, you blaze this trail before anybody was willing to listen, and you told your story again and again. How do you feel when you're not included in something like that?
JUANITA BROADDRICK, ACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF MISCONDUCT: Well, it was disappointing to me, Martha. They had called to ask me -- I think it was on -- got it here, November 24th, and asked if I would be interested in participating in a story that they were doing about the Me Too movement. I really didn't feel a part of that movement. You know, I was Me Too decades before it was OK to be Me Too. And I truly didn't feel a part of that. And actually, at that time, I did decline because just like I said I didn't feel a part of it. Then they called me.
MACCALLUM: go ahead.
BROADDRICK: I'm sorry?
MACCALLUM: Go ahead. I'm sorry.
BROADDRICK: Yeah. They called me back approximately two days later and asked if I would just make a comment, and I was very happy to do that. I supported these women. I thought they were brave women. And I told her, yes, I would be happy to submit a comment. And then a few days went by, and I was so happy when they were declared person of the year. And when I went to look for my comments, they weren't there.
MACCALLUM: It wasn't there.
BROADDRICK: That disappointed me.
MACCALLUM: You know, today, you saw these women who are coming out to make accusations against President Trump. Some of them did the same thing during the campaign. And you lined up with other accusers of Bill Clinton at the debate very famously. But it's interesting, because when you get into this question about who should be believed, Hillary Clinton was asked, should all women be believed? And here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they're disbelieved based on evidence.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: She's talking about you, Juanita.
BROADDRICK: I know, I know. She has nothing else to say but that. You know, she is -- she just won't accept that it's true.
MACCALLUM: And how do you feel about that? I mean, you're in the middle of this movement, where everyone is saying every woman should be believed, and it took a long time, and a Wall Street Journal expose' for someone to finally listen to what you were saying about the man, the most powerful position in this country?
BROADDRICK: I know. It's very disappointing. And to think that it was held, Martha, until after the impeachment hearing, that was probably the most devastating to me, that they considered holding it until -- and then run it opposite of the Grammys. That was so disappointing.
MACCALLUM: So you stood by President Trump throughout the course of the campaign, and now he has these women who came out today, and they say they think he should be investigated. What do you say?
BROADDRICK: Well, I think every victim of sexual abuse has the right to be heard, and they need to have fairness accordingly. I have no idea what is true and what's not true. I can only speak to my own situation. It was something I lived through. And that's all I can speak to.
MACCALLUM: Juanita, thank you.
BROADDRICK: I can't speak to others.
MACCALLUM: Thank you so much.
BROADDRICK: Yeah.
MACCALLUM: Good to have you with us tonight. Hope you'll come back. Juanita Broaddrick, joining us this evening.
BROADDRICK: Thank you.
MACCALLUM: We'll take a quick break. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Thanks to the new leader of Saudi Arabia, the man who brought you the $450 million Da Vinci. Saudis can now go to the movies for the first time in 35 years. Whole new world there, right? That's "The Story" for tonight, thanks for being with us. We will see you back your tomorrow at six.
