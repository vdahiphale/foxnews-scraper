'Off the Record', 2/21/14: The FCC has backed off its controversial study of America's newsrooms, but Greta has 'agreed' to answer five of their questions in the spirit of cooperation 
By Greta Van Susteren

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

OK, let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. After getting caught with its pants down, a stunning development. As you know, FCC now announcing no journalists will be required to answer their snooping questions. But in the spirit of cooperation, I'm volunteering to answer each of their five specific questions they intended to ask.
Question number one: What is the news philosophy of the station? My answer: None of your business. Read the Constitution. Question number two in this study: How much news does your station air everyday? My answer: Watch and figure it out yourself. I'm not doing your work for you. Question number three in here: Who decides which stories are covered? My answer: None of your business. Read the Constitution. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Read the Constitution is what they should have done before they even did this study. Question number four: How much influence do you have deciding which stories to cover? My answer: None of your business. Read the Constitution. And question number five: Have you ever suggested coverage of what you consider a story with critical information for your customers that was rejected by management? My answer: None of your business. Read the Constitution. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK, so those are my answers. But get this: Do you know what FCC wanted to do with all of the answers from their dragnet investigation? The written plan -- I read it myself -- was to lock them all in a filing cabinet in a locked office for seven years. Then the data would be destroyed so no one could ever factcheck the FCC report. Transparency? You know what my first thought was? Putin and the KGB. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
