SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity," and this is a Fox News Alert." Tonight, former FBI director James Comey releases his opening remarks ahead of tomorrow's congressional testimony. It raises serious legal concerns for himself, and not the president. Plus, the president's lawyer says the commander-in-chief -- he feels vindicated tonight by Comey's prepared testimony, and he is now ready to move forward. We will have full legal analysis and reaction of Comey's prepared statement.
And also, the left, the mainstream media -- they are outright lying to you about this at a level never before seen in our country's history! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Their goal is to destroy the president by now any means necessary. They are nothing more than agenda-driven ideologues. They stage protests. They call the president a piece of you know what. They even have people posing like ISIS fighters with a severed head of the commander-in-chief. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They attack the first lady's, the president's children, even his 11-year- old son. Now, this is all designed to stop what you, the American people, voted for in November by any means necessary. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So tonight, it's time to stand up and fight for the soul and future of this country. And tonight, that starts by being honest and giving you coverage you won't find anywhere else about the former FBI director James Comey and his agenda-driven mission.
Now, did James Comey himself commit a felony and break the law by not coming forward with his claims? That is tonight's all-important "Opening Monologue." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right, so earlier today, the former FBI director James Comey released his opening statement that he will give tomorrow before the Senate Intelligence Committee. This statement contains several key points that blow the Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory completely out of the water. And it completely shoots down the media and the Democrats and all the hyperventilating and foaming at the mouth about obstruction of justice.
And now we've discovered, by the way, that they have been lying to you for months. Now, we're going to cover everything in terms of this self-serving document released by Comey -- it almost reads like a novel -- in great detail tonight. But here are some very key points that I want to tell you about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Number one, the president did not obstruct justice. Comey never says his interactions with the president were inappropriate or illegal, and by the way, that this is key, that they constituted in any way an obstruction of justice of violation of the law. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Number two, Comey told President Trump that he was not personally under investigation. The president wasn't.
Number three, Comey admits that there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge. Number four, if Comey thought it was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, did Comey commit a felony and violate the law?
Number five, unlike his conversations with President Trump, Comey writes that he never created memos about interactions with President Obama. Now, remember, he also didn't put Hillary Clinton under oath during her FBI interview and Comey didn't bother to have the bureau create a full transcript of that interview. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So let's start with the first point, the president did not obstruct justice. Now, Comey described the February 14th meeting in the Oval Office as follows. Quote, "The president then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, 'He's a good guy. He's been through a lot.' And he repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but the fact that he had misled the vice president. He then said, 'I hope'" -- I hope -- remember, "I hope," key words here -- "'you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He's a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' And I replied only, He's a good guy."
Well, first of all, any lawyer, legal expert will tell you that this alleged conversation doesn't come anywhere close to obstruction of justice like the media is claiming tonight. And then there's this from Comey. "I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn's departure and the controversy around his accounts of his phone calls. Regardless, it was concerning, given the FBI's role as an independent investigative agency."
So according to Comey in his opening statement tomorrow, President Trump only mentioned Flynn and didn't try to bring up the topic or try to impede the overall, quote, "Russia investigation." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And here's another major point that the media won't tell you. There were only two people in the room. This is only James Comey's version of events and how he perceived Trump's comments. Now, the president may have a much different interpretation, in spite of all the insane, breathless coverage you might have watched earlier today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Again, there's no legal basis for obstruction. And that means the destroy Trump media, which has been hyperventilating, foaming at the mouth about this -- they've been completely wrong. Watch this coverage.

        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: Three words, obstruction of justice.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, now, here's the most important point that the media will never tell you. If James Comey did, in fact, think this was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, Comey could have committed a felony and he himself broken the law. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we're putting up the law, the actual law, on the side of your screen. And as my colleague, Gregg Jarrett, has pointed out -- and he will be here in a minute to explain more -- if James Comey thought the president was doing something illegal, he had a legal obligation to come forward immediately! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's not what Comey did. In his testimony, Comey says he didn't bother to tell the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, about his conversation with President Trump because, in part, well, he thought Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. That would not be a reason not to follow the law!
And then when Comey complained to the attorney general, Sessions, face to face about not wanting to be left alone with the president, he once again decided not to tell Sessions about his conversation with the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Another key major point. Comey also told President Trump he was not personally under investigation, not once, multiple times. Now, this means, once again, every conspiracy theory you have heard for month after month after month about President Trump colluding with the Russians -- the president colluding with the Russians -- is not true.
And given the mainstream media's nonstop, incessant coverage and the fact that Comey told Trump he's not under investigation, it is unreasonable for the president to say -- Hey -- you know, it's not unreasonable to say, "Everyone's claiming that, in fact, you know, I might be involved here, and you are telling me I'm not under investigation, can you just come forward and set the record straight and tell the American people the truth to clear my name because it's interfering with my job"? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, do you think that's unreasonable? Shouldn't the FBI director come forward and tell the truth that he believes to the American people? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that's not all. Comey admits there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge which happened at a private dinner. Now, take a look at this from Comey's prepared testimony.
"He then said, 'I need loyalty. I replied, 'You will always get honesty from me.' He paused and then said, 'Well, that's what I want, honest loyalty.' I paused and said, 'Well, you will get that from me.' As I wrote in the memo that I created immediately after the dinner, that it was possible the we understood or misunderstood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently, but I decided it wouldn't be productive to push it further."
So was it loyalty? Was it honest loyalty? And by the way, what does this mean anyway? I could have been a ton of different things. Is it loyalty to the Constitution and the rule of law, not loyalty to the deep state, Comey -- or not loyalty to the former administration that Comey worked for? Comey even admits that there was confusion about that part of the conversation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And there's also a glaring double standard here. Unlike with President Trump, James Comey -- he didn't write memos about his conversations with President Obama. I said this weeks ago. I think that's because Comey is planning on writing a novel or a tell-all book and probably be working for MSNBC and following probably Rachel Maddow every night. And he's a perfect black helicopter conspiracy theorist, it seems, himself. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And there's also the fact that James Comey did not require -- think of this. Hillary Clinton was not put under oath when she was interviewed about her server or that a complete transcript of that interview was said to be created. Why not? Why wasn't that done?
For example, look at what happened to Michael Flynn. Now, the guy was tarred and feathered by the press when Trump allegedly said, Well, I can hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. You know, he's a good guy. I hope you can do this. I hope you can let this go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Was it similar to what the president said on "60 Minutes" about the Clintons, that he, quote, "didn't want to hurt them?" That -- you know, he was basically saying he wanted to let them go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Comey apparently didn't want to hurt the Clintons, either, because remember back during the campaign, he felt it was necessary to come out and announce the FBI's findings about Hillary Clinton. And Comey laid out that Clinton had secret, top secret, special access program, classified information on her unsecure server that we believe 99 percent certainty was hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies.
But then after all that, well, he treated Clinton with kid gloves. You may remember this in July of last year.

HANNITY: No, that's not mishandling of classified material by putting it on a mom-and-pop bathroom closet, the server with the top-secret information on it. No, no. That's not -- or getting rid of emails, some 30,000-plus, even top-secret emails.
By the way, Clinton broke several laws, committed several felonies, but she gets the courtesy of the public announcement. But the president, who the FBI director told a number of times did nothing wrong, wasn't under investigation, did not get the same treatment. That's ridiculous, and Comey, by the way, should be ashamed of himself. This reads like a political document in every way, shape, matter or form.
Now, by the way, there's more to say in terms of the big story that we're following earlier today. Now, the media won't cover this tonight. Earlier, during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, earlier today, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers -- they threw cold water on the narrative that President Trump acted inappropriately during their conversations with him. Oh, they're saying something different.

ADM. MICHAEL ROGERS, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DIRECTOR: In the three-plus years that I have been the director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything I believed to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate.

I have never felt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relationship to an ongoing investigation.

Joining us now with reaction, is the American Center for Law and Justice chief counsel, Jay Sekulow, from Circanews.com, Sara Carter, and FOX news anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett.

JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, let me tell you what you've got here, a total and complete vindication of the president of the United States on any of these allegations of obstruction of anything and the fact that also, the president was clearly not under investigation, not a target. So all of the left's talking points are completely incorrect by James Comey's own testimony, in his written testimony.
This now is bad for the country to continue spending resources -- distracting everyone, including the Congress, from really getting to the people's business. This is a waste of money. But I'm going to tell you what this is. This document right here? Case closed! There is no case! And by the way, couple that, Sean, with all of the statements from Sally Yates, from all of the other -- besides all the intelligence individuals -- heads of the intelligence agencies, James Clapper, all of them are saying no evidence!

SEKULOW: Right. So here's what you've got...
HANNITY: ... no evidence of collusion.
SEKULOW: What you've got is case should be closed, complete vindication, total vindication. Let me add one other thing here, Sean. President Obama -- people are going to forget this, but I want to remember because I handled this case in court. In the middle of a criminal investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative organizations -- in the middle of that investigation, the president of the United States said there was not even a smidgen of corruption while the investigation was open and pending!

Did James Comey write a memo about that? No! Selective disclosure disorder. I've been saying that for weeks. That's what it is!
HANNITY: And just like with Hillary and the e-mail server. Sara Carter, let's bring you in.
SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Yes, hey, you know, I was just thinking, Jay is right on the money about a lot of this because the obstruction argument is completely illogical here. You know, if you think about it, director -- former director Comey of the FBI had told President Trump three times that he was not under direct investigation. So he didn't fire Director Comey because he suspected he was under investigation. He fired Director Comey for the way he was handling the FBI.
And if we just take a step back and look at all of that -- I mean, even with the stories about Russia and collusion, this is all hearsay. There's no facts to support it. We've been reporting this for quite a long time, that there is no evidence of collusion between President Trump and the Russians. And yet it perpetuates itself in the media. So think that this was, in a way, a vindication of President Trump. And it certainly...

        }
      
HANNITY: I agree, total vindication.
CARTER: ... lays to bed -- laid to bed any argument that President Trump is being looked at.
HANNITY: All right, and the most -- and the most important point is a point that, Gregg, you've been making, that if Comey did claim obstruction of justice, like everybody in the media's been saying, Oh, this is obstruction -- that would have meant he committed two felonies. You're the first that I saw reported this.

        }
      
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS: Yes, and it'll be interesting tomorrow when he testifies, Sean, because he'll asked, Did you think this was obstruction of justice? He's going to...
(CROSSTALK)
JARRETT: He either has to say no or he's going to dodge it. Good luck with that because the crime is called misprision of felony. If a federal government official knows of a felony like obstruction, he must, under the law, report it to his superiors at the Department of Justice, in the case of Comey. Failure to do so is a crime punishable by three years behind bars. So Comey has to say...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: ... pick it up there. Stay right there. We're going to come back to whether or not Comey could have committed a felony. More with Sara, Jay and Gregg right after the break.
And later, Austan Goolsbee -- all right, he weighs in on James Comey's prepared testimony and much more tonight.

HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity," as we continue now with Jay Sekulow, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett.
All right, I want to go back to 18 U.S. Code 4, Gregg, the point that you made, Gregg. If Comey thought that there was any attempt to obstruct justice, it doesn't matter if he thinks that the attorney general is going to recuse himself or the deputy attorney general is only interim. He had to report immediately or he committed a felony, right?
JARRETT: Yes. It's called misprision of felony. I had to laugh at the statement here by Comey in which he offers up the vacuous excuses to why he didn't do it because, Oh, gee, I thought Sessions might recuse himself, and you know, the assistant attorney general probably wasn't going to be in the position for a while. Under the law, that doesn't matter.
So tomorrow, Comey has to say, Oh, yes, the -- the conversation was concerning to me, but he cannot say it was obstruction of justice. If he does, the next words to Comey will be, Sir, you have the right to remain silent.
HANNITY: Wow! Jay Sekulow...
SEKULOW: Look...
HANNITY: ... I agree with Gregg's analysis. I think the law is clear. Your thoughts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SEKULOW: Yes, well, it is. Look, James Comey's legal standards are, you know, he gets mildly nauseous when someone says, You intervened in a political campaign. He's mildly nauseous.
(LAUGHTER)
SEKULOW: And in his memo, his new legal standard is, I was uncomfortable when I was with the president. Really? That's now the legal standard? But I'll tell you why he's not -- why he did not follow through with reporting obstruction of justice. Because there was no obstruction of justice! And he would have to be under oath saying that he thought there was a case for obstruction of justice and bring a charge under a 18 USC 4 against James Comey?
So what did he do? His lawyer said, You know what? You better not testify on a false statement of your own because now James Comey, by the way, is the former FBI director. He is a witness. He's under oath. He's obligated to tell the truth. He didn't walk across the street because there was no case. And he said that in his memo.
HANNITY: And it's funny because you go to -- Oh, I hope that poor Michael Flynn doesn't get attacked anymore.
SEKULOW: All right...
HANNITY: And you go to that, which he kind of said, Sara, about Hillary. But I didn't hear any conversation about the one law we know that was broken in all of this, which was the unmasking and the violation, the felony violating the Espionage Act by releasing raw intelligence on Michael Flynn. He was a victim of a felony.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARTER: Absolutely, he was a victim of a felony. And you know, earlier today, in earlier testimony, when Rogers was questioned, as well as Coats was questioned -- I mean, This was a big deal, and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said, You know, we will prosecute to the full extent of the law if we find out people violated section 702 of the FISA. We will prosecute this to the full extent of the law. And we know people have because we know that name leaked and there were very few people -- remember that, Sean -- very few people who had possession of the name Mike Flynn at that point in time when it was leaked.
HANNITY: All right, last -- last point. Rod Rosenstein, Dan Coats, Mike Rogers, Admiral Rogers, Andrew McCabe all said no one from the White House has asked to influence an investigation. They even went on, Gregg, and said things as interesting as they were never asked to do anything illegal, as Admiral Rogers says, immoral, unethical or inappropriate. All of that was said today, and none of it's getting any media play!
JARRETT: Well, I don't know if the media is either ignorant or malevolent, but the way they've been portraying obstruction of the president is really a shame to the American public that watches them or reads them. Look, the law is very simple. It either has to be lying or threats or bribery or destroying evidence or altering documents. That would be obstruction of justice. None of that happened here. The president never threatened Comey with his job by saying, Clear Flynn or you're fired. If that had happened -- maybe.
HANNITY: He just said, I hope so. I hope so.
JARRETT: Maybe.
SEKULOW: Right.

He is going to fight terrorism. He's going to get this health care bill through. We're going to get tax reform. But this right now is a sideshow for no reason.
HANNITY: All right...
SEKULOW: You know what it should be? Case closed.
HANNITY: I got to tell you you are all -- you all have been amazing. And I will tell you it is pathetic how ideologically, how viciously inaccurate the media is to the American people. It is propaganda and misinformation on steroids, human growth hormone. We've never seen it before, and it's a big problem. I want to think you. Hopefully, we'll have you all back tomorrow night.

A defiant North Korea is at it again, this time launching several short- range surface to ship cruise missiles. It's just the latest in a series of missile tests despite international pressure to stop. The missiles traveled about 124 miles. Just last week the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea claims the missile testing. North Korea claims the missiles are needed to counter U.S. aggression.
Twelve people are dead and dozens injured after a pair of terror attacks in Iran. Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked Iran's parliament and the tomb of its revolutionary leader. ISIS is claiming responsibility for that, but Iran blames the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. President Trump is among several world leaders condemning the attacks tonight. The president also accusing Iran of sponsoring terrorism.

So did James Comey show a blatant bias towards the Trump administration? After all, Comey did admit that he didn't take notes on his conversations with President Obama. Plus the FBI didn't put Hillary Clinton under oath. Joining us with reaction, former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, and still with us from CircaNews.com, Sara Carter.
To my good friend, Austan, glad to have you. Here's a question. Do you agree that Hillary Clinton putting top secret information and special access program information on a server in a mom and pop shop bathroom in a closet that have a 99.9 percent certainty ended up in the hand of five foreign intelligence agencies, would you say by definition that's mishandling of classified material?
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISER: That's not a characterization of what happened that the intelligence community agrees with. If that were what had happened, then, yes, I would say that was a mishandling.
HANNITY: Sara, is that what happened? Because apparently Austan does not read the newspapers.
SARA CARTER, "CIRCA NEWS": I completely disagree with you, Austan, on this. Look, there was a lot of concern among U.S. federal law enforcement personnel, FBI personnel that were investigating Hillary Clinton's server, multiple servers. And the concern was that there was classified information on there and she knew that this information was classified even though she claimed she didn't understand what she was sending or what she was looking at certain points during their interview with her.
I can tell you this because I've interviewed numerous people connected to this investigation. And not only that, because McCabe brought it up, the acting deputy director of the FBI brought this up in his testimony and said there were people that were angry. In fact, I was told some FBI agents actually threw sandwiches at the television when Comey made that announcement. People were angry. And I don't think the American public understands that.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Wait a minute --
GOOLSBEE: How is that relevant to this?
HANNITY: Austan, you are a smart guy. It is a fact, even Comey himself admitted, that it was in a server in a mom and pop shop. And that is not - - if you can't see that's mishandling of classified material, then we can't get to second base. And if we can't get to second base, I can't ask you about the double standard.
GOOLSBEE: I never said -- I said from the beginning, and my impression was that Hillary Clinton herself said that she made a mistake and she should not have handled her emails in that way.
HANNITY: Mishandling is actually called a felony under federal law.
GOOLSBEE: Wait. The president of the United States, according to Comey, explicitly asked the law enforcement Jeff Sessions to go out of the room so he could be alone with him and asked him to shut down an investigation.
CARTER: Sean, look, there's concern here. You are innocent until proven guilty. And if you are running an investigation and you believe that you have evidence against somebody, you don't leak it out. This appeared to be a concerted effort by people within the intelligence community and federal law enforcement who did not like Trump to leak these things out and put him in a public sphere where the administration was then strangled by these news reports a day in and day out, and they still are. And they were trying to fight against untruth, but how can you prove it? Because the people who have the classified information could not speak out publicly and correct the record because everybody was talking anonymously. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: By the way, Comey exonerated Hillary, even stepped on the role of the attorney general at the time, which is something he shouldn't have done. But he tells Trump privately, well, we are not investigating you. And Trump says, can you tell the public, can you tell the American people because they are believing the helicopter -- black helicopter lies in the media.
GOOLSBEE: That part, on both of those count, on Sara's count and your count, I agree with that. The leaking of information, that is illegal. It shouldn't exist. And if he --
HANNITY: Your friend Obama set it up.
GOOLSBEE: -- and he won't say that publicly, I can see why he would be upset. But this Comey letter, this is not a leak. This is his sworn testimony before Congress. He's saying the president asked him to shut down an investigation --
HANNITY: This is one man's version of events. It's a he said, he said. Go ahead, Sara.
CARTER: I don't think he's saying that he asked him to shut down the investigation on Russia. If you read it carefully, he was talking about Mike Flynn.
GOOLSBEE: It was about Flynn.
CARTER: It was about Mike Flynn. And I think there was a concern there, and I can't speak for the president. I don't know what he was thinking. I don't know what Director Comey was thinking at the time. But you can see clearly in Director Comey's testimony that he did tell him three times, you know, that he is not under direct investigation. He also, I think the president is not as aware of how things operate here in Washington, D.C., and you know, he was concerned actually about Flynn. I don't think it was a nefarious move.
HANNITY: We've got to go. I will say one thing.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: No, no, he broke no law.
GOOLSBEE: I don't know that that's true, Sean. He asked the head of the FBI to shut down an investigation.
HANNITY: Excuse me, you are dead wrong. And if he did, then that means Comey by not reporting it would have committed two felonies, because he had a legal obligation to immediately tell the Justice Department. You are wrong on the law.
GOOLSBEE: -- not to be true. Our country is --
HANNITY: Comey is saying it's not true.
GOOLSBEE: -- if it's true.
HANNITY: All right, and still to come on this busy breaking news night tonight here on HANNITY --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Donald Trump again being a schmuck, thinking that he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them. I'm sorry, that's how he thinks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, liberal Joe Scarborough emotionally unhinged, now calling the president of the United States a schmuck. Herman Cain will weigh in.
And also tonight, Piers Morgan confronts the mayor of London right to his face over monitoring potential terrorists and how they are letting them free even when they go fight in Syria with ISIS. Brigitte Gabriel, Ric Grenell weigh in.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." All right, following this weekend's past London terror attacks, Piers Morgan, he confronted the London mayor about alleged terrorists returning to the capital city from the war-torn countries, and things got heated. Look at Piers take him down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PIERS MORGAN: What could be a bigger priority than people coming back from a Syrian battlefield with intent to harm British citizens? Why is it not the number one priority? Why are these people just allowed to come back in in the first place, and then the London mayor doesn't appear to have a clue where any of them? I mean, no disrespect to you, but where are they?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's one of the question that, obviously, the police services are going to --
MORGAN: But you're the mayor.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: How do not know where they are? Donald Trump, Jr., also calling out the London mayor over his feud with the president. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP JR., PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON: Maybe rather than the mayor of London attacking, maybe he should do something about it. Maybe he should do something to fix the problem rather than just sit there and pretend there isn't one.
SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR: So you think the mayor of London is at fault for what happened there?
DONALD TRUMP JR.: No, that's not what I said. I think it's time for the people there to probably act and do something a lot more proactive than what's going on. And I do think that's something people have to do. We can't just sit there and pretend this is not a problem.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here now with reaction, from Act for America, the founder, Brigitte Gabriel, former spokesperson for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Ric Grenell is with us. Let me play for both of you, this is the mayor of London actually referring to moderate Muslims as Uncle Toms. Really? Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR: You can't pick and choose who you speak to. You can't just speak to Uncle Toms. You can't just speak to people who will say what you want them to hear. I can assure you, and you can to speak to some who will tell you the hard time they've got talking to ordinary British citizens of the Muslim faith, British groups of the Muslim faith. And I can tell you meeting all of them, are critical friends.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Doesn't that reveal how he really thinks rather than whatever apology he gave out later, Brigitte?
BRIGITTE GABRIEL, ACT FOR AMERICA: Yes it does. Usually they say whatever comes out of the mouth first, that's what's really going on in the mind. And his true colors are shining. And this latest attack in London basically shined a light on his real character and his true colors and how he is doing as a mayor and people's trust in him. I think this is a good wake-up call for the Londoners that voted for him in the first place.
HANNITY: And by the way, he tells, oh, this is our new way of life. And, oh, by the way, after the attacks where people are killed and stabbed and injured, oh, London is safe. Just ridiculous.
Ric, so you have this Piers Morgan. It just made him look so stupid. They let people that go to Syria come back to London. They don't know where they are. Those would be the first people I would look at, along with this documentary. One of the terrorists with the ISIS flag, Allah Akbar, Sharia is coming to 10 Downing Street, we'll air it as you answer. Why do we even have intelligence if we're not going to go after the lowest hanging fruit, the people we know believe this?
RIC GRENELL, FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Right, exactly the point. We have intelligence officers who gather information, who do all the hard work. And they put people on a watch list. They put people on a watch list so that our public policy leaders and our politicians will watch them. But instead we have the mayor of London, as you referred to, he literally said, Sean, that it is part and parcel of living in a big city to experience terrorism. And I would argue that it's only part and parcel of living in a big city experiencing terrorism when you have a mayor or a politician or a leader who doesn't watch the watch list. That's his whole job. And I think the British voter is going to absolutely wake up and say we cannot have leaders who aren't taking terrorism seriously, who don't believe they can crush it.
HANNITY: Theresa May has not done a great job, but there's no option in the election. When you have somebody that either fights in Syria and comes back and you don't know where they are, or you have someone who is chanting Allah Akbar with the ISIS flag, Brigitte, and you don't get rid of them, you basically -- in my mind, if they act on the stated opinions and you know who they are, I say you have almost as much blood on your hands of the people responsible. Don't you?
GABRIEL: I completely agree with you. These elected officials are the enablers because when you are in power and you have access to information that can prevent the loss of lives of innocent civilians and you don't take action, you are as much to blame as much as everybody else.
And look, why are they allowing them? They complain in England that they don't have enough people to monitor all these terrorists that they have? Then why are you allowing those that you know served with ISIS that came back, returned from Syria? Kick them out of the country and take away their citizenship. I think the Europeans need to development a backbone, and now is the time to start.
HANNITY: All right, guys, thank you. And up next on this busy breaking news night tonight, here on "Hannity" --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: Donald Trump again being a schmuck, thinking that he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them. I'm sorry, that's how he thinks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, liberal Joe Scarborough called the president of the United States a schmuck today on NBC News. Now we will have more of liberal Joe and Mika's emotionally unhinged moments. That's all coming up straight ahead. And we get reaction from Herman Cain. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity." So the destroy-Trump propaganda press is unrelenting in their abusively bias, negative, and sometimes apocalyptic coverage of the Trump administration. Now for months one cable show with some of the most absurd and, frankly, emotionally a little unhinged coverage has been none other than MSNBC's liberal Joe. That's the liberal Joe show, low rated, by the way. And we are calling them out tonight. And that is our next mini monologue.
All right, so earlier today liberal Joe and his cohost, Mika Brzezinski, they continued their usual nasty coverage of President Trump, this time calling the president of the United States of America a schmuck. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: Donald Trump again being a schmuck, thinking that he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them. I'm sorry, that's how he thinks. I know that first hand. He thinks if he invites you to the White House and gives you food, that you are going to cut him a break, cut him slack.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Liberal Joe also took some time to bash a certain cable network that dared to report the devastation of the cultural leaks in Washington. Take a look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: If Republicans end up looking like they are reading the talking points from the White House or from -- now the Trump run RNC, or from certain cable news shows on other networks, and all they are talking about are leaks, they will pay a heavy, heavy price in 2018 for caring more about protecting a corrupt -- apparently corrupt -- president and administration than getting to the truth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Liberal Joe, he can critique this network or any other network, and their coverage of Washington and leaks, and so on and so forth, but liberal Joe, you really shouldn't be throwing stones from your incredibly fragile glass house. After all, liberal Joe routinely features some of the most vile, unfair, disgusting, and even emotionally unhinged coverage of President Trump. But don't take my word for it. Instead, here are some of the lowlights. Take a look yourself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: He looked like a thug. He looked like a goon. You look at the handshake. Look at this. Just what a thug. What an embarrassment. Look, he's mauling him like an idiot. What an embarrassment to the United States.
MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Optic matter. I understand why you liked him, but this man is lying to you.
This presidency is rotten all the way to the core and right to the top.
You've got to stop putting Kellyanne on the air. It's politics porn.
SCARBOROUGH: Totally unprepared for the job of being president, unfortunately not knowing what he does not know.
BRZEZINSKI: And possibly unfit mentally. Sorry. I'm just saying.
It's like, like --
SCARBOROUGH: Oh, oh, oh, yes.
BRZEZINSKI: Like a kid pooped in his pants and then saying I meant to do that.
This is really bad. This is really bad. Just for the record, we're all really nervous.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Actually, it's really funny. Joining us now, former presidential candidate, Fox News contributor Herman Cain. All right, Herman, "schmuck, thug, goon, mauling, idiot, embarrassment, liar, unbalanced, unfit mentally." Let's keep going, "political porn, rotten to the core, disgusting," just a small sampling of the emotionally unhinged coverage. But there's a certain viciousness to all this. I want to get your thoughts.
HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First of all, she might be nervous. I'm not. I'm looking at the result like you and many of your people. I am not nervous.
(LAUGHTER)
CAIN: I like the accomplishments that this president and his administration -- that they are making despite this vitriol coming from people like Joe and Mika.
Secondly, they literally think people are believing their poisonous vitriol. They have taken Trump derangement syndrome to a whole new level, Sean. And that is sad because they are assuming that the American people are stupid.
HANNITY: All right, Herman, good to see you. When we come back, we need your help with a very important question of the day, and yes, the Hannity Hotline is back, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Time for tonight's "Question of the Day." James Comey's opening statement released today, what did you think about his prepared remarks? Obviously pretty angry, bitter over being fired, disgruntled employee. And by the way, no obstruction of justice. But we want to hear from you, Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.
All right, good or bad, hit me with your best shot. It's the Hannity hotline.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Sean, you're doing a great job. You're a true patriot. Keep up the good work, and keep those lefties running.
ADAM: I need you to do me a favor. Could you quite using the word "besmirch" or "besmirchment" or any form of the word? Could you get a new word, please?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, want to say something nice, mean to me, doesn't matter. Call the number on your screen, we love from hearing from you. We take notes of what you're saying and pay very close attention -- 877-225- 8587.
That's all the time we have left this evening. And we'll see you back here tomorrow night.
