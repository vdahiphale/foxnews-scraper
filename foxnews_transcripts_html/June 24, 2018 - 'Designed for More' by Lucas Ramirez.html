Legal immigrant to the United States, Lucas Ramirez, shares his family's story on 'Fox & Friends.' 
From the publisher: Designed for More draws groundbreaking implications for how to achieve unity and collective movement through new research on a jaw-dropping phenomenon of flocking starlings known as a murmuration. This marvel is one of nature's most spectacular sights: Imagine hundreds of thousands of birds in motion, caressing the sky like a brush on canvas. It is a beautiful madness that is completely ordered.

Our world is divided and fragmented. Even among followers of Christ, God's great story of reconciliation has been crippled because the messengers of that story are unreconciled.
But God designed us for so much more. Thankfully, He has hidden incredible lessons in nature to help solve complex human problems. Birds first taught us to fly, and now they will teach us to unify!BUY THE BOOK 'Designed for More: Unleashing Christ's Vision for Unity in a Deeply Divided World'
