Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Listen to what President Obama said about the attack on a kosher deli in Paris.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you have got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

Random? Well, now, that's a bit off-the-charts bizarre, if he thinks that slaughter was random. It was a kosher deli in a Jewish neighborhood. What could be more obvious than it was targeted and not random than a hit on a kosher deli at a Jewish neighborhood, right?
Well then today, the State Department's spokesperson was asked about it although it seems impossible, she gave a worse answer than the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JEN PSAKI, U.S. DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I believe, if I remember the victims specifically, there were not all victims of one background or one nationality. So, I think what they mean by that is I don't know that they spoke to the targeting of the grocery store or that specifically but the individuals who were impacted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does the administration believe this was an anti-Jewish -- an attack on Jewish community in Paris? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PSAKI: I don't think we're going to speak on behalf of French authorities and what they believe was the situation at play here.

OK. What was that? Jen Psaki later tried to clarify her remarks on Twitter posting, "We have always been clear that the attack on the kosher grocery store was anti-Semitic attack that took the lives of innocent people". And, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also taking to twitter today trying to defend the president's comment tweeting "Our view has not changed, terror attack at Paris kosher market was motivated by anti-Semitism. They didn't intend to suggest otherwise." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, my thought: Maybe one of his aides should tip him off not to say, "random" if that's not what he means. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
