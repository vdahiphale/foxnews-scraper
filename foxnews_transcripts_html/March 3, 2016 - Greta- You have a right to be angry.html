Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: There are many reasons for voters to be angry. You are not wrong ... your leaders have failed you 
By Greta Van Susteren

Let's all go "Off the Record." Yes, of course, I have heard the anger in this country. I don't have potatoes in my ears, and I can hardly open my email account without burning my fingers off from your sizzling mad emails. You're upset, so yes, I hear you and I get it, you're mad. And guess what? I don't blame you.
You have every right to be upset. You pay taxes, and you expect leaders to lead. And you expect a well-run government. It's not asking a lot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, what's happening? Our roads are all potholes. Our bridges of decaying, many at risk of collapsing. The Justice Department has big corporations buy off their crimes with shareholder money - could even be your money. The IRS terrorizes you, demands you pay on time but then slow-walks your refund. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Students are drowning in debt coupled with dismal job opportunities and the nation can't pay for anything. The nation is dead broke. We're in debt to the tune of $19 trillion. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And to top it all, we have now gotten to the point where Americans are fighting over whose lives matter more. Seriously?
Yeah, so I get it, you're angry. The media has failed you and your leaders have failed you. And you are not wrong to be angry. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
