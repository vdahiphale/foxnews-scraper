'Off the Record,' 1/30/15: President Obama desperately wants to believe the war on terror is over. Tell that to ISIS. Tell that to the Taliban

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. President Obama has a fatal flaw and it's clouded his thinking. He thinks the war is over. It's not.
He wants the war over. So do I. You do, too. We all hate wars. But no matter how much he wants it, I want it, or how much you want the war over, once in a war, with people still trying to kill you, hoping it is over or a unilateral declaration that the war is over, does not end it. You are fooling yourself if you think it does. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
War only ends if you annihilate your enemy out of existence. We have not. Or if both sides agree that the war is over, like two nations signing a peace agreement. That has not happened, either. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just this week, ISIS threatened to behead President Obama and in the White House, and yesterday in the Kabul the Taliban murdered three Americans. When your enemy is still killing you, it's war. And, yes, of course, we can debate whether we should have gotten into this mess or not in the first place. But that debate is a little late, like 14 years late. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Where we are now, we are in a war. Right now, we need solutions. And that is the president's job as commander-in-chief. The president needs to get out of his denial. Denial is not a strategy. He needs to quit hoping the war is over. Hope is not a strategy, either.
I'm not suggesting this is easy. It's not. But denying reality is dangerously spinning our wheels into a much deeper disaster. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
