SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity."
President Trump wrapping up a huge enthusiastic rally in Minnesota. We'll show you all the highlights. That's coming up tonight, including his comments, all-important comments on immigration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, earlier today, the president signed an executive order ending the separation of children and parents who crossed our border illegally but not before Democrats and the so-called mainstream media went off the rails. In moments, we're going to show you just how insane and unhinged the left and the media has become, even the president's 12-year-old son, a target of a repugnant attack.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we'll also reveal a blatant double standard in the media. In fact, the press gave a pass to the beloved Barack Obama, the anointed one, over his border tactics, including -- you guessed it -- separating children from their parents. We have the evidence tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also, anti-Trump deep state sycophant Peter Strzok, he is in huge trouble. Earlier, we reported that he was escorted out of the FBI headquarters. Well, next week, the disgraced FBI agent could be forced to testify before Congress. Bad news for Andrew McCabe, James Comey, and, yes, even Robert Mueller and his witch hunters themselves. After all, Strzok is at the very center of what is a tangled web of nothing but corruption and extreme bias, oh, to influence a presidential election.
And we're just at the precipice of the biggest scandal in modern political history. It's only getting started. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have a jam-packed edition. I know the president's not doing my hour tonight, like Tucker, of "Hannity" tonight. 
We begin with our important breaking news opening monologue. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {

HANNITY: The president's raucous rally that you saw right here on Fox just ended, but you wouldn't know it if you were watching the mainstream media. CNN, they barely covered it, and conspiracy TV MSNBC literally acted like it wasn't happening. 
Now, by the way, of course, we brought you the rally, including when the president took Democrats, the mainstream media to task for their blatant hypocrisy over the topic of immigration. And one of the reasons the media didn't cover it, they would have been called out for all of their lies and the fact that they're missing the biggest story in American history. Take a look.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats don't care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities, your schools, your hospitals, your jobs or your safety. Democrats put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens. 
We've already started the wall. We got $1.6 billion. The wall has been started, in San Diego and lots of different places. 
And we go but, boy, it's tough. They want to do anything they can to obstruct and to make sure it doesn't happen. But it's happening, it's happening.

HANNITY: Now, for days, the so-called members of the press, the destroyed Trump media, along with their friends in the Democratic Party, they have been in a complete utter insane meltdown over reports that children were being separated from parents at the border after being detained for crossing the border illegally. And I've said numerous times this week, no one ever wants to see ever a kid separated from their parents. Nobody wants to see that. 
And earlier today -- by the way, the president has been saying it all week. The president addressed this important issue and he signed an executive order on doing their damage and ensuring that illegal immigrant families would be kept intact.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, not his law, he didn't pass it. Congress did. Another president signed it, but he fixed it. Take a look.

TRUMP: Border security will be equal if not greater than previously. So, we're going to have strong, very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together. I didn't like the site with a feeling of families being separated. It's a problem that's gone on for many years as you know, through many administrations, and we're working very hard on immigration.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
It's been going on for 60 years. Sixty years, nobody's taken care of it. Nobody's had the political courage to take care of it, but we're going to take care of it.

HANNITY: So, today, the president undid the damage Congress mandated and a previous president signed.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');

        }
      
Now, this order fills a void vacated by Congress which has totally dropped the ball when it comes to both illegal immigration and legal immigration. Now, it's time for these lazy, obstructionist members of Congress to step up and do their job, and that's a permanent solution -- fix our broken immigration system. 
And by the way, if we're going to do it, let's do it right. If we're going to do it, every bill, any bill needs to literally point out what the president laid out. And by the way, go back to the State of the Union Address. 
Secure the border, build the wall, the problem is solved completely, but it must be completely funded and constructed and the money -- well, I don't trust these guys, get it upfront or no deal. And, by the way, all the loopholes have got to be closed that are used by criminals and terrorists and enemies of this country to ever enter the country, and that includes ending the visa lottery system. That includes ending catch-and-release of illegal immigrants they'll never show up to court, eliminating chain migration.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then and only then, OK, the Democrats will win something too. They'll get their concessions on DACA. And, by the way, the issue of child-parent separation will end forever, something we all say we want.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the wall, the lotto system, the visa lottery, the end of catch and release, they can't be talking points. 
Congress, we're on to you. We're watching you. We know you often lie in your talking points and say one thing, and it never matches the fine print of the bill.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, don't play these swamp games the American people are now hip to your little lies. Everything that we're talking about needs to be straightforward, fully legislated and enacted before any so-called DACA compromise.
And, now, without a wall, without border enforcement -- well, the problems that the wall will never go away, ever. And sadly, that were -- you know, we have to see all of this through the prism of the midterm elections. Everything you're seeing and hearing from politicians and on these fake news networks is about 2018.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And instead of passing legislation and permanently fixing a big problem for the country, immigration -- well, you've got many Democrats, they'd rather use this issue to malign their political opponents. They never solve the problem, which fits perfectly into their brand of identity politics.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They want the American people to believe, as they do every two to four years, Republicans are racist, they are sexist, they're misogynist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, oh and they want dirty air and water, and they want to kill your children and push your grandmother over a cliff. You hear those lies every two and four years, I played the history of this so many times on this show.
Let me tell you the four things that will happen, by the way. You let Democrats win this election, this midterm and guess what's going to happen? This is their agenda. Number one, they want to impeach the president but they're not going to tell you that. They told every Democrat: stop Maxine Waters from saying impeach 45. They want to do it, but they won't tell you. 
The rest of their agenda -- they want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare. And just like Nancy Pelosi said, they want to roll back the tax cuts and steal those crumbs back, as she called them, that the president gave you in the tax cut bill.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

OK, Lester, maybe you ought to get out of that studio once in a while. I've been to the border 12 times, all across, Rio Grande to San Diego. I've been in the drug warehouses. I've been out when they have arrested gang members and I've been out in the drug warehouses, floor to ceiling, all laid at the altar or going to our kids.

Actor Peter Fonda, remember Hanoi Jane, brother of him, tweeted about Donald Trump's DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Kirstjen Nielsen is a lying bleep that she'd be put in a cage and poked at by passersby, the bleep should be pilloried in Lafayette Square naked, whipped by passerby while being filmed for posterity.
And then he continued his rant, and this time, he turned his sick, twisted, ugly vicious rage towards a 12-year-old kid, and, by the way, the president and Melania Trump's son Baron. We should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand up against the giant bleep she is married to. Ninety million people in the streets on the same weekend in the country bleep.
OK, disgusting. Now, rightfully, the first lady has every right to protect her child. And by the way, making terroristic threats against the first family, that's actually illegal and she contacted the Secret Service after that horrible tweet and Peter Fonda then lately perhaps sobered up deleted the tweet, later apologized, saying in part he went too far.

And here's the big question of the day: where's Nancy Pelosi? Where's Elizabeth Warren? Where is the champion of women Hillary Clinton? Where is the outrage from the so called compassionate left?
Now, Peter Fonda's comments are sick, twisted, ugly, demented and this is the insanity coming from America's left. And it's -- there's a lot more. Look at Occupy Wall Street promoting the murdering of ICE agents. A member of Antifa publishing a list of 1,500 ICE agents personal information, blasting it all over Twitter. They're going to get somebody killed here. This is not a game.
And then this happened: Donald Trump's DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who's following the laws of Congress, the laws of the land, literally is run out of a restaurant last night by a group of leftist protesters and we have the video. Watch this left-wing insanity.

HANNITY: Hillary, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, where are you? Where's the Me Too movement right now tonight and the assault and the horrific vicious things that are being said here? 
Which brings us to a very important point. While the left, the media literally blows up over the Trump administration's, quote, border tactics, and they're obeying the law, they were very quiet when Obama was their president. The images we're about to show you, take a look at this, children in cages, sleeping in cages, oh without their parents being there at all. Many separated from their parents. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
These images -- they weren't taken after Donald Trump was sworn into office. No, we checked it out today. "The Daily Caller" printed a lot of these. This was under Barack Hussein Obama. Those pictures are from the Obama administration and this is how they detained illegal immigrants and children. In fact, one such Obama era policy actually detained minors without their parents for months before releasing them back to their home countries. 
And remember, it was President Obama who prosecuted oh nearly a half a million illegal immigrants, not Donald Trump. It was Obama who said he was merely enforcing the laws -- laws that he alone can't change and even if they create great damage, he's compelled to enforce the laws of Congress. Remember? 
He said all of this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: There are those in the immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are illegally with legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books. But I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. 
When I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works.
Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you, not just -- not just on immigration reform. But that's not how -- that's not how our system works. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I'm the president United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: My job to execute laws that are passed. I'm not the emperor. That's exactly -- by the way, what Donald Trump signed today, let me be blunt, it'll last five minutes in a courtroom before it's thrown out, but at least gives Congress time to do their job. We're going to have more on immigration throughout the show tonight.
But, first, we have something else to bring you that the left, the mainstream media is barely touching. And, by the way, one of the biggest stories of our lifetime, of course, the inspector general's report totally vindicating the president's decision not only to fire James Comey but the I.G. corroborating everything we have told you for months on this show that the rest of the media never talked about -- a two-tiered justice system, a rampant deep state bias, an attempt to literally create a soft coup in America and prop up one candidate and destroy the other candidate and you thought Watergate's a big deal and so much more. 
The mainstream media -- well, they couldn't care less. 
Look at the headline from Newsbuster's today. Monday, CBS News totally ignored the I.G. Horowitz first testimony since the release of the I.G. report. And after two days of damning testimony from the I.G., Michael Horowitz, and so many new revelations surrounding Peter Strzok, yesterday, your friends at ABC so-called news Georgie Stephanopoulos place, NBC News, they avoided covering Strzok at all, the guy at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in American history.
Of course, we know one of the most central figures, of course, was the anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and I doubt he's going to testify. Let's see if he chooses the right to remain silent.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we showed you a detailed timeline last night revealing what is rampant by is shared between Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page, including clear instances where Peter Strzok, the head of both investigations, was vowing to work against Strzok and protected Hillary from known felonies. Now, remember, Strzok was also the lead agent in her case, that is the server investigation and then immediately thereafter tapped for the lead role in the FBI's Trump Russia investigation, rendering by the way illegitimate Mueller's investigation. 
He cleared Hillary who committed literally felonies one after another, he vowed to protect by the way, and he worked against Donald Trump and tried to destroy him. And that was all in the context of a presidential election. That sounds like a big deal to me in a lot of different ways.
Oh, and by the way, as he's trying to protect Hillary Clinton, isn't it interesting that it didn't work out? Anyway, as we scroll forward, remember, Strzok was the lead agent and Hillary's server investigation then tapped for the lead here. OK, nobody in the media is telling you any of this. 
He clears one person -- think about this -- in the context of a presidential election, in the context of a presidential election you know targeting Donald Trump who eventually becomes president.
All right. Now, as we move on he will be called to testify before Congress and, by the way, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is reportedly ready to issue a subpoena. My prediction, he ain't going to talk, just a guess. He'll join us in a few minutes of the upcoming showdown.
And, of course, we also know Strzok is just the tip of the FBI's high-level corruption. In fact, the I.G. referred five agents for investigation over rampant anti-Trump actions and Strzok's pending testimony could blow the lid off this deep state house of cards, which this is all beginning to collapse, people are going to go to jail over this. In other words, we're now created a deep state firing squad.
And we're learning another wrinkle in the deep state scandal. It surrounds Christopher Steele. Guess what? Christopher Steele, the foreign spy who the Clinton campaign paid for to produce phony Russian lies against Trump - - well, that guy infamously known as the dossier creator filled with those Russian lies -- well, Steele, by the way, you know, he was welcome at Obama's State Department just days before the 2016 election, where he allegedly briefed officials. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
So, what did John Kerry know? What did Obama know? When did they know it? Because you know what? What do they do with this phony information?
And, by the way, when is the media going to start talking about all of this? And more importantly, what is the next shooter drop in all of this? We have so much more to come and what is the biggest political scandal in your lifetime and you at the forefront of seeing it.
All right. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer joins us, the author of "Why We Fight: Recovering America's Will to Win", Sebastian Gorka, and senior fellow with the London Center for Policy Research, Monica Crowley.
Sean Spicer, let's first go to the absolute venom of people on the left and the lack of coverage of the biggest story in their lifetime and the lack of telling the American people the truth about Obama's separation policies.
SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I thought your monologue was spot-on. I mean, it's unbelievable what the left says and does and gets zero outrage and zero coverage. And I think most of it is because you kind of pointed out in the monologue, the media agrees with it, and when they agree with it, they ignore it and they almost, you know, in some cases I think they mistakenly retweet it or like it because they forget that people actually can see some of those tweets.
But it's amazing to me, the lack of outrage. I mean, these people -- you pointed out the Peter Fonda tweet. There are so many more where they use disparaging language, make threats and yet there's zero coverage. Yet, anything that's done on the right by the president or any of his supporters is called out and asked for an immediate apology and has to be denounced. 
The way in which they view the same kind of outrage is unbelievable. There's zero when it comes to people on the left. And it's, you know, everyone needs to be denounced and we have to have boycotts and censor the people on the right whenever they do anything. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I'm not excusing any of the behavior on the right. Don't get me wrong. I think when people do something wrong -- 
HANNITY: All right. I'm sorry -- 
SPICER: -- they stepped over the line, they should be called out. 
But it is unbelievable what happens on the left, the way they get away with it.
HANNITY: You think about this, Monica, OK, talking about raping a woman, talking about kidnapping the first son, 12 years old, and putting him in a cage with pedophiles, and then there was even an assassination CBS reported a real threat against the president today. Is the rhetoric connected to it by these people on the left?
MONICA CROWLEY, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH: We are so far beyond normal politics, Sean, and the reason is because Donald Trump, from the moment he came down that escalator in June 2015, represented a serious existential threat to the ruling class on all sides and that includes the mainstream media. And from that moment on to this very day, their mission has been to destroy him, everybody around him, discredit his presidency, destroy his voters, smear them as well, because he must not be allowed to succeed. 
And that's why you see this kind of over-the-top extreme reaction. Their first response to anything this president says or does is always to reach for the most extreme rhetoric and actions. And that's not going to end anytime soon.

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Is this what you do to the Singapore crew, Sean, really?
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: I know you traveled 24 hours in the air both ways for our audience. I love you. Don't worry.
GORKA: The hypocrisy -- can we have some honesty about this immigration issue? So, suddenly, the left, Peter Fonda included, care about minorities and care about children? 
What about the 60 million children that have died in the womb since Roe v. Wade? What about the money they spend on Planned Parenthood? Nineteen million African Americans killed in the womb. They -- that's how they care about minorities.
But let's forget about pregnant women and embryos, if they want to call them embryos. When did we hear the left talk about Nisa or Kayla, the 15- year-old beautiful girls that were murdered in Long Island by gang members born abroad? I didn't hear them protest about needing to protect American children from gang members. 
The hypocrisy, the rank hypocrisy tells you one thing, Sean, they are desperate. They have no message for November. The economy -- the rally was incredible, the things that the president rallied off about the economy, North Korea, raising the pay of our military -- they are desperate and this is a very good sign of how desperate they are. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: I don't have a lot of time tonight as we did go along in the open segment. But, Sean, you know this media. You know fake new CNN didn't want to cover this and they only dipped in occasionally and why MSNBC same thing? I'll tell you why. Because they would be exposed in the president's speech and rally for being the liars that they are. 
SPICER: Well, look, I think you pointed out in the monologue. The bottom line is I think the president is getting results whether it's the economy or foreign policy. I think the media has made it very personal. They don't like him. They don't -- they never liked conservatives. We knew. But this is very personal for them. 
They don't like him and they're not going to do anything they can to talk about the results that he is getting from the American people. I'm glad he took the action today. The images of watching children was horrible and it was heart wrenching. I'm glad he took that action today to make it happen. I hope Congress follows up on the president's action. But what the media is doing and what the left is getting away with something that's just something -- I am speechless. 
HANNITY: All right. We're going to leave it there. By the way, Monica, somebody said the nicest thing about you today. I'll tell you about it later. 
(CROSSTALK)
MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK. Thanks, Sean.

Mr. Chairman, to me, here are more questions than there are answers, number one. And number two, in spite of Strzok's lawyer saying yes, we are going to willingly come before the committee, I don't believe that for 10 seconds. Let's see it before I believe it.
REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Are you asking me that? 
HANNITY: Yes, sir. 
GOODLATTE: Absolutely. He's got to appear before the committee. We believe we have an agreement for him to appear next week. It's important that he appear for an interview. And then we'll have a public hearing after. And we are prepared to issue a subpoena for anything that's necessary to do. But if he appears voluntarily we're good. But if reneges, he'll see a subpoena immediately. 
HANNITY: Sir, let me ask you, because there was a meeting last Friday. I understand you were in that meeting, along with Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy Gowdy and Speaker Ryan and Rod Rosenstein. And you were promised documents according to the published reports, sir, and those documents that you have been subpoenaing and requesting and Trey Gowdy has been and Devin Nunes has. They promised them this week. 
Or you guys promised that you will in fact, hold them in contempt and perhaps issue articles of impeachment as it relates to Rod Rosenstein for their obstruction and unwillingness to abide by congressional subpoenas. And why do I think if I did it, I don't think I would get away with it. 
GOODLATTE: I don't think anybody should get away with it. I also believe that we have -- thanks to John Loesch, the U.S. attorney from Chicago -- we have a much better situation, we have now access to over a million documents in a room at the Department of Justice that we can see unredacted and then we can point individual documents and demand that they be produced. 
But there are other things in that subpoena where we specially asked for. Some of it been complied with. Some not. And the speaker made it very clear that if they didn't produce them this week, that they would face the resolution which has been already introduced. 
HANNITY: All right. Mr. Goodlatte, I want to thank you for what you are doing. And if we don't get those documents, I hope you hold them accountable and I believe you will. I know you meant what you said. 
Joining us with more, Ohio Congressman and Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan. Congressman Jordan, I don't see the documents presented. And we now have all the evidence we need, Hillary, it's irrefutable, committed felonies. Lead investigator Strzok exonerated her long before he ever interviewed her or the witnesses, which means the fix was in and then they tried to smash and destroy Donald Trump the other candidate. I can't think of a worse abuse of power or corruption scandal in American history. Maybe you can help me out. 
REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: No, no, you're right. The same six people, the key people who ran the Clinton investigation then ran the Russian investigation. Think about this, Sean. Jim Comey has been fired. Deputy Director McCabe has been fired, faces a criminal referral and lied three times under oath. 
Chief of staff Jim Rybicki has left the FBI. General counsel Jim Baker demoted and has now left the FBI. Lisa Page, FBI counsel demoted now left the FBI. And of course, Peter Strzok deputy head of counterintelligence demoted and a couple of days ago escorted from the FBI. 
So when you have ever seen a federal agency where six of the top people ran the two most important investigation I've ever heard of, when have you ever seen that happen? So, yes. Mr. Goodlatte is exactly right. If they don't give us the documents we are going to pass a resolution on the House floor. The speaker has been clear about this. 
HANNITY: How soon? 
JORDAN: It will happen next week if they don't do it. It will -- the speaker has been clear. They will -- we will pass that and whole House will go on record saying Mr. Rosenstein, give us what we are entitled to have to get answers for the American people. And then if he still doesn't do that then it's contempt. And then finally the ultimate leverage we have and ultimate pressure we have is the impeachment article.
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: And you are telling the American people tonight you will do all of this, this is not a game? This is -- if they don't us their word.
(CROSSTALK)
JORDAN: If they don't give us -- well, this is -- but it's the speaker of the house, this is Devin Nunes, this is Chairman Goodlatte, these are the people in the House and Senate who says we a right to get that.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I agree.
JORDAN: And the full House will -- the resolution has been filed by Mr. Meadows and I several others. Mr. Meadows filed it last week. 
HANNITY: All right. Let me ask you this. 
JORDAN: That's what have to happen this.
HANNITY: So, apparently this was a little bit of a showdown on Capitol Hill on the floor today between Mark Meadows and who's the chairman of the freedom caucus and Speaker Ryan. And apparently it was about the talking points that are being fed to the president and the American people about immigration don't match up with the bill. Are we being lied to or mislead again by Republicans? 
JORDAN: Sean, I wasn't a part of it. Normally I would be a part of that conversation with Mark. I wasn't on the floor. This time Mark and the speaker had a conversation--
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: Have you seen the bill? Do they match the talking points which this is what is about? 
JORDAN: Here's -- well, I haven't had a chance to fully review the bill yet. Both bills are going to be on the floor tomorrow, but what I do know is Goodlatte, Chairman Goodlatte's first piece of legislation is the one that is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election. More importantly, consistent with what we told the American people we were going to do. Because it does the good borders, builds the wall, stops the chain migration, stops the--
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: Wait, wait. OK. The most important thing, is the money for the wall up front? All of it? 
JORDAN: It has to be. It has to be in both bills. But the first bill is the one I think is the best bill. That's the one I'm supporting. 
HANNITY: All right. By the way, I know you were a wrestler in college. You only lost one match all your life? 
JORDAN: I lost more than that in college. I lost more than that in college. High school. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: High school you won one match.
JORDAN: That was a long time ago I saw it. 
HANNITY: Listen, I've my second degree brown belt in mixed martial arts, but I don't think I'm messing with you. Wrestler--
(CROSSTALK)
JORDAN: I won't mess with you. Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Thank you, congressman. When we come back, more highlights of the president's incredible rally tonight. So much energy in that room, sir. According to David Schoen we got a lot of people legally in jeopardy. This has only just began actually. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With Peter Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. 
(CROWD BOOING) 
TRUMP: I don't think their wife and husband are too happy about that. What do you think? What do you think? I don't think so. No, but have you been seeing this whole scam? Do you believe what you are seeing? No matter she did. No matter how many crimes she committed which were numerous, they wanted her to be innocent. With me, nothing. No collusion, no nothing and they wanted to take all of us, they wanted to put us in trouble. And it's not working too well, I'll tell you. 
(CROWD CHEERING)
TRUMP: Disgusting.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: The president earlier tonight talking about the I.G. report. 
Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter, civil rights and criminal defense attorney, David Schoen. All right. This is only the tip of the iceberg. You just heard from Jim Jordan, Bob Goodlatte, we know this war is going on behind the scenes, Sara, and we also know that they are going to ultimately be not only criminal referrals but if there's justice in America there's going to be indictments of some of the highest level people in the FBI. 
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's really significant, Sean. Because this is like the first time in American history in modern American history where we are seeing this. One of the important things that I think developed this past weeks is what Mark Meadows disclosed. 
It was the fact that there is a possibility that the 302's which we've mentioned before on your show, those are the interviews that Peter Strzok conducted with General Mike Flynn or other witnesses in this case. Now, Meadows didn't specifically talk about Flynn's case in particular, but that 302's may have been altered both in the Clinton investigation and in the Trump investigation. 
So if that turns out to be the case, that is an extraordinary violation. And it could be a Giglio violation which if that's the case -- I mean, if it's in Flynn's case, it could be that the judge could throw the case right out. 
HANNITY: Pretty amazing. Let's go to the legal criminal side of this. David Schoen, I don't think I would want to be any of these people at this particular point in time. But the big caveat here. If there is equal justice under the law, and by the way, that would also mean that Hillary would also be charged with felonies even today. 
DAVID SCHOEN, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: That's right. And of course, it is a big if unfortunately, but let's hope justice prevails. Let's not make the mistake though of marginalizing Strzok and these others. What the inspector general identified in an entire culture of corruption and bias. They are bad apples but it's not just a question of a few bad apples. 
Let's be forward thinking and not reactive. Because what we know for sure is Mr. Mueller handpicked a committee to makeup his special counsel team that has the exact same agenda. We should demand the e-mails especially those who are former Justice Department employees like Mr. Weissmann and others demand their e-mails. I would imagine we would see some things similar to what Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page, agent two, agent five, Mr. McCabe wrote and spoke about, stop Trump agenda. 
HANNITY: Is this illegitimate the entire -- since the get-go is, literally the fix in for Hillary rigged an investigation and then immediately the same people start the sledge hammer on Donald Trump to destroy him. Does that render everything--
(CROSSTALK)
SCHOEN: That's right.
HANNITY: -- Mueller is doing illegitimate or question the legitimacy of it? And if you are an attorney for any of these guys, do you not go to a judge and say, judge, this is predicated on a prejudice that exited from the get-go, therefore none of this should be admissible? 
SCHOEN: Absolutely. The United States Supreme Court in Kyles versus Whitley said the integrity of the investigation is always at issue and must always be at issue in the case. The investigation is what informs a prosecutor's decision and ultimately the discretion. But again, we know that these same people have that same agenda. There's just no question about it. 
HANNITY: Yes. Let me go to Sara. Sara, you have some breaking news as it relates to General Flynn and his story. Wow. Nobody thought he lied. But yet he got charged for lying. 
CARTER: Yes. And he pleaded guilty. I mean, he was strong armed according to the sources that I have spoken to. I mean, he lost million dollars trying to defend himself. He had to sell his home. 
HANNITY: Lost his home by the way. 
CARTER: Yes, he lost his home. His family was threatened. So there was a lot of reasons why General Flynn would just want this over with. And it's such a flimsy charge. Because according to Comey himself, behind closed doors, the agents didn't believe that he was lying. 
But then you have to ask yourself this. Peter Strzok was one of those agents that interviewed Flynn. Peter Strzok is still up and hopefully will be subpoenaed and hopefully will speak to Congress. But he was already tainted. When he went into that interview, he wanted to take people down in the Trump administration. And so I believe that everything he touched was tainted. And I don't know what his attorneys are going to do. But certainly something is going to will come of this. 
HANNITY: All right, guys. Thank you both.
(CROSSTALK)
SCHOEN: The I.G. said it's a huge cloud. Thank you.
HANNITY: Yes. We'll never give up on this story. And I'm telling you now the real hard work of justice begins. That's the interesting part of all of this. When we come back, the ever so shy, the ever demure non-controversial Roger Stone is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Special witch hunt, witch hunt counsel Robert Mueller reportedly examining a previously undisclosed meeting set up between Trump associate Roger Stone and a Russian figure who allegedly tried to sell information on Hillary Clinton. By the way, this was not disclosed by Stone or former Trump aide Michael Caputo during their interviews with the House intel committee. 
And based on a pair of letters from attorneys for Stone and Caputo, they now believe the guy was an FBI spy, informant trying to set them up.
Here to explain more the author of a brand new book "Stone's Rules," the ever so shy, demure, and non-controversial Roger Stone. All right. So you're kind enough to send me your book. Every chapter is about how you dressed. Roger, I wear jeans and t-shirts except for this hour of my day. I broke every rule. 
ROGER STONE, FORMER TRUMP ADVISER: But you have good taste in neckties, Sean. So, it's so bad.
HANNITY: Half of them are Trump ties. Way before the election, by the way. You know, I read -- when I first heard the headline, I'm like, OK, why didn't they tell? And then as I read it and talked to Michael Caputo about it, why didn't you just tell. So you met with some guy that said he had dirt on Hillary, offered--
(CROSSTALK) 
STONE: Michael Caputo contacted me and he said that he had been contacted by a man using an alias as it turns out Henry Greenberg who had an information that he said would be of great value to the Trump campaign. I met with him. And it turned out--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: By the way, this is important, every Congress would take the call if they got that call. We got info on your -- oppo research on your opponent. 
STONE: Well, and then in a presidential year, I mean, I was writing a book the making of the president. I was starring in a Netflix documentary. 
HANNITY: I saw it.
STONE: I was appearing on today on info wars where we're fighting a terrific war against net censorship. But I took the meeting. And Henry Greenberg turns out to be an FBI informant of Russian descent who's admitted to the country nine times on informant visas, who is a violent felon who otherwise could not be in the country. And then he tries to entrap me, but he gives away the game when he says he wants $2 million for negative information on Hillary. 
When I tell him I don't have $2 million. He says it's not your money I want. It's Donald Trump's money. 
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Did you ever agree to Donald Trump--
STONE: I think is the first known example of the Peter Strzok insurance policy. I think it was an FBI plant seeking to compromise and I think to entrap me and compromise Trump. I never mentioned this to the president--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Have you -- why didn't you mention it earlier? Again, your lawyer said you spoke honestly and truthfully. It never came up in the hearing. Why didn't you bring it up? 
STONE: Well, in all honesty, remember this is May of 2016 which is prior to Hillary raising Russo phobia. I simply didn't remember it. But since the results of the meeting, don't produce anything illegal or improper, I have no reason to dissemble or to hide it. I merely forgot it. The more important question is, why is a government informant who has been admitted into the country nine times on FBI visas--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Violent felon.
STONE: -- coming to see me at all. It's a set up. 
HANNITY: You know, this is, you know, between the spies in the campaign and everything else we now know, I want the answer to your question. Why? Why was this guy trying to set you up? Now you never told the president, correct? 
STONE: I never mentioned it to candidate Trump or President Trump. 
HANNITY: All right.
STONE: Rudy Giuliani is exactly right about that. Because it was such a ludicrous idea. I turned him down flatly. The Washington Post accurately reported that. I said, no dice. Not interested. It's just like a shakedown but now we know it was worse. It was a set up. 
HANNITY: This is scary. Scary times. "Stone's Rules," Roger Stone, good to see you. Thanks for being with us. 
When we come back, more highlights from the president's rally tonight, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. During his rally tonight in Minnesota, the president spoke about a successful negotiations with North Korea, the media ignore that, too. As well as the I.G. report. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: They stopped shooting missiles over Japan, they stopped all nuclear testing. They stopped nuclear research. They stopped rocketry. They stopped everything that you'd want them to stop, and they blew up sites where they test and do the testing.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Yes, they forgot to report all that stuff. All right. We have a lot more tomorrow night. Let not your heart be troubled. We will always be fair and balanced. There she is, Laura Ingraham.
