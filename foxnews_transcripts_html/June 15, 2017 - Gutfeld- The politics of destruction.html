Yesterday, a left-wing creep open fire on GOP lawmakers practicing for tonight's game. Now, despite the attack, the lawmakers took the field tonight at Nationals Stadium in D.C.

Since the shooting, we have seen a lot of finger-pointing. After preaching unity, Nancy pants blames the Republicans:

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you see this as equally afflicting the left and the right --

HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: No, I do not. Somewhere in the '90s, Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons. And that is the covenant of it. And that's what has continued.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Sorry lady, the politics of destruction started way before that. And it's back for one reason: The attacks on discourse. If you shut down discourse then there's no stopgap between rage and violence. Discourse keeps us from killing each other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So knowing this, let's ask these questions. Are conservatives the ones shouting people down on campus? Are conservatives blockading offices and physically attacking speakers? Are conservatives rioting after elections? Are conservatives harassing professors for calling out racism? Are conservatives stabbing police horses? Are they throwing urine on young women? 
This attack on discourse is not a right wing thing, it's a left-wing thing who perfected it for decades, seeking to subvert the West. I don't know one righty who wears a Che shirt. But I remember Bill Ayers. He set off bombs. Whose side is he on again? It's the same side targeting descent with violence now. The premise is simple: If they think you are evil, not just wrong, then there can be no dialogue and only violence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, there's the rub: If a person agrees with you that it's time for calmness, then they aren't the problem. It's the people who embrace violence who are. I'd ask them to stop right now but I don't think they watch "The Five."  </pre>
