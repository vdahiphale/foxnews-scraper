BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Jesse is that a Doberman? Allright. Anyway, thank you, Dana. Good evening, I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we are covering three big stories. The battle lines arebecoming clear for next week's impeachment trial. Democrats will sayPresident Trump aimed a mob of supporters like a loaded cannon at the U.S.Capitol last month. Trump lawyers will argue the Senate has no authority totry him now that he has left the White House.The current occupant of the Oval Office President Biden announcing a reviewof the immigration system as he seeks to reverse Trump border policies. Oneday after hosting Republicans for COVID relief talks, as the sides remainmore than a trillion dollars apart.As Dana mentioned, in just a few minutes we will speak exclusively with aman with a lot of power in Washington nowadays, West Virginia DemocraticSenator Joe Manchin.But first, we begin in Florida where two FBI agents were killed whiletrying to serve a warrant today. It's the first time a bureau agent hasbeen killed in the line of duty in more than 10 years. Correspondent PhilKeating is on the scene in Sunrise, Florida. Good evening, Phil.PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. It all went down just after six this morning a brutal, brazen andtragic incidents inside that apartment complex behind me. Five FBI agentswere shot, two of them fatally.Just minutes ago, the FBI down here called this a very dark day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE PIRO, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FBI MIAMI: We are saddened by theirloss as we struggle to come to terms with what happened.However, as we grieve their loss, we will continue the mission to protectthe American people.KEATING (voice over): The federal agents showed up to the subjectsapartment before dawn for what was planned to be a surprise serving of asearch warrants in an ongoing child pornography case.Instead of nonchalantly answering his door, the subject grabbed his gun andstarted shooting. The two agents killed taken from the hospital to theBroward County Medical Examiner's Office, with American flags draped overtheir bodies, and a solemn line of fellow agents and local officerssaluting and paying grim respects.In Washington, FBI Director Christopher Wray stated: Every day, the FederalBureau of Investigation special agents put themselves in harm's way to keepthe American people safe. Special Agent Alfin and Special AgentSchwartzenberger exemplified heroism today in defense of their country. TheFBI will always honor their ultimate sacrifice and will be forever gratefulfor their bravery.The still unnamed suspect also died inside the scene in his apartment afterbarricading himself for a time. It appears he took his own life instead ofsurrendering, Bret.BAIER: Phil Keating in Florida. Phil, thank you.Now, to immigration. Late this afternoon, President Biden announced thecreation of a task force to reunify families, rescinded some policies fromthe Trump administration and ordered the review of others. Moments ago, thepresident defending his executive actions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's a lot of talk with goodreason about the number of executive orders that I have signed. I'm notmaking new law, I'm eliminating bad policy.What I'm doing is taking on the issues that, 99 percent of them, that thelast President of the United States issued executive orders I thought werevery counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are asa country, particularly in the area of immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: National Correspondent William La Jeunesse is in San Diego on theborder. Good evening, William.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Hi, Bret, the executive orders definitely send the signal not just to thepresident's base, but also abroad. And it's a very narrow offence to(INAUDIBLE) because he's telling migrants not to come.But if they happen to already be here in Tijuana or elsewhere along theborder, well, be patient, help is on the way.The executive orders, as you said, make it easier to obtain a green cardfor Central American countries to obtain aid and creates this task force tobasically reunite some 600 families separated by President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We are trying to repair the damageand the horrific actions of the prior administration.LA JEUNESSE (voice over): The challenge, how to undo the policies ofPresident Trump without increasing illegal immigration.PSAKI: This is not the time to come to the United States. We need the timeto put in place an immigration process, so people can be treated humanely.LA JEUNESSE: President Biden currently enjoys an immigration honeymoonthanks to Title 42, a COVID protection protocol allowing the Border Patrolto deport everyone but children.Since the pandemic began, the agency turned back more than 300,000migrants.REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Title 42 is the essence of right now keeping peopleback. And by taking away the remain in Mexico policy and then eliminatedTitle 42, you're going to see a tremendous surge.LA JEUNESSE: It's already creating a backup in the immigration pipelinewith migrant camps forming along the border.DEMETRIO MARTINEZ, GUATEMALAN MIGRANT (through translator): Don't send meback. I asked you please to look at me. I am Guatemalan and you will seethat things are tough over there.LA JEUNESSE: Agent says smugglers are using the words of candidate Biden topull migrants north were starting asylum, legalizing millions already here,limiting ICE enforcement.KEN CUCCINELLI, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: The Bideneffect is creating its own humanitarian crisis with an already overwhelmedimmigration system.LA JEUNESSE: Some sectors report a steady climb in apprehensions,especially of Central American families and unaccompanied children, someleft by parents at the border, who then go it alone. Without detention,many continue until they succeed.ALI NOORANI, PRESIDENT & CEO, NATIONAL IMMIGRATION FORUM: The Trumpadministration cut down (INAUDIBLE) shut off the nation's asylum system, sothat these parents were left with no other choice to protect their childrenother than pretty much handing them over to the U.S. government.LA JEUNESSE: President Biden promises to leave families intact while asylumclaims are heard.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hope that those who have been put in remain in Mexicowill be able to make their asylum cases from the safety of the UnitedStates and outside of detention.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (on camera): So, the task force reports back in four months.Meanwhile, the Border Patrol is preparing for another surge driven by thepoverty in Central America and a more welcoming approach here. No mentionof Title 42.As for the wall, officials what the Biden administration said last night,it was wasteful and useless. The agents here beg to differ with that, Bret.BAIER: William La Jeunesse along the border in San Diego. William, thanks.The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump begins next week. Democratswill seek to present a case that the former president incited aninsurrection at the Capitol. Trump's legal team says the trial is apolitical weapon, calling it unconstitutional and undemocratic.Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram is following the case on CapitolHill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):House impeachment managers say rioters couldn't have stormed the Capitolwithout former President Trump "Creating a powder keg, striking a match."House managers weaponize the words of Senate Minority Leader MitchMcConnell against the former president.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The mob was fed lies. They were provoked bythe president.PERGRAM: The president's defenders say Mr. Trump encouraged his supportersto march "That managers say the president's other language was incendiary."DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We fight. We fightlike hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have acountry anymore.PERGRAM: President Trump's attorneys deny that that phrase had anything todo with action at the Capitol, defending his right to freedom of speech.DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP DEFENSE LAWYER: This is a very, very dangerous road totake with respect to the First Amendment, putting it risk any passionatepolitical speaker.ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL CONTRIBUTOR: If this were a legaltrial, I think that would be an exquisite defense on the president's part.Having tried a solicitation to violence case, it's a very, very tough proofin a courtroom. But we're not in a courtroom, we're in a political realm.PERGRAM: The former president's attorneys contend the trial is moot becauseMr. Trump now holds no public office. Unresolved is a framework for thetrial.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The impeachment resolution on the trial, youknow, has been set back because the president keeps switching lawyers.PERGRAM: It's unclear if senators will hear from witnesses.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you vote to call one witness, non we'recalling the House get ready for a long trial.PERGRAM: The Senate lacks the two thirds vote required to convict theformer president. But Schumer cracked the door open to censure for Mr.Trump if senators don't convict him.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: A somber mood at the Capitol tonight, the remains of U.S. CapitolPolice Officer Brian Sicknick will lie in honor in the rotunda. Sicknick isjust the third Capitol Police officer to lie in honor or did so after dyingdefending the Capitol, Bret.BAIER: Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill. Chad, thanks. Both President Biden andthe group of Senate Republicans he met with for almost two hours in theOval Office Monday to discuss COVID relief called that discussionsubstantive and productive.On Capitol Hill, the Senate approved the first step to fast track Biden'snearly $2 trillion package. White House correspondent Kristin Fisher joinsus from the North Lawn with the latest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): White HousePress Secretary Jen Psaki says President Biden is not bending from his $1.9trillion request for COVID relief despite Monday night show ofbipartisanship. An Oval Office meeting with 10 Republican senators who wanta less expensive and more targeted package.PSAKI: The risk here, as he has said many times is not going too big, it isgoing to small. That's why he can -- he supports the efforts by SenatorSchumer, leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi to move this package forward.FISHER: Today, the Democratic leadership did press forward with a keyprocedural vote to set up passing the president's proposal through anobscure but powerful tool known as reconciliation. It would allow Democratsto pass the American rescue plan without any Republican support.And while Psaki he says the president "Is hopeful that the rescue plan canpass with bipartisan support, a reconciliation package is a path to achievethat end."Republican Senator Mike Braun doesn't see it that way.SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): Looks to me like an approach of hey, I want to talkto you. But if you don't kind of come my way, we're going to do it anyway.FISHER: Today, President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen droppedin virtually on Senate Democrats weekly luncheon.SCHUMER: He was very strong in emphasizing the need for a big bold package.He said that he told Senate Republicans that the $600 billion that theyproposed was way too small.FISHER: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says the president did tellRepublicans that he'd be willing to make some modifications, though Psakideclined to speculate on what those concessions might be.PSAKI: We're not going to negotiate from here or frankly in public aboutwhat is going to be in and out of the package.FISHER: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says the 10 Republicans whomet with the president last night, walked away with the impression that thecommander-in-chief was more interested in bipartisanship than his staff.MCCONNELL: I can't remember a budget and the time that I've been here thateither side has ever voted in a bipartisan way. So, we're off to a totallypartisan start.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): Now, there was some bipartisanship on Capitol Hilltoday. Six Republican senators voted yes to confirm Alejandro Mayorkas asthe new Secretary of Homeland Security. And he is going to be playing a bigrole in executing the executive orders on immigration that President Bidensigned here at the White House just moments ago, Bret.BAIER: Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you.One of the key votes in the Senate joins us right now. Democratic senatorfrom West Virginia, Joe Manchin. Senator, welcome backto SPECIAL REPORT.SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV) (on camera): Thanks for having me, Bret. Appreciateit.BAIER: Senator, I want to make clear what happened today, you voted to movethe procedure forward on the budget resolution. You didn't vote for thepackage itself, the 1.9 trillion, you moved it forward. You have problemswith the 1.9 trillion as it's written?MANCHIN: Basically, we know we have a challenge in our hand, we have apandemic, and we're not sure what direction this pandemic is going,especially if the variants come into it.So, the need for a pandemic relief is needed. People can decide on what thesize of that needs to be. The president has said 1.9. and then myRepublican colleagues and friends have taken a different approach.But, at least, they started this and I thought it was a great meeting lastnight that the president -- the first entertainment of any legislators was10 of my friends in Republican colleagues who went and spent two hours withthe president that showed a tremendous gesture of goodwill. Now, we justgot to find a bipartisan way through. I voted to start a --BAIER: There's a big difference here between 1.9 and 600 obviously, just ontop line, but as you go into the specifics, the $1,400 stimulus checks. Butthe big one, are you for raising the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour?MANCHIN: Bret, I don't think that's going to make it in because it doesn'tfit within I know it's just the inside ballgame, but inside the bird rule.The only thing we can do during this -- during this reconciliation isanything that comes within the financial realms of what we're dealing with.It's called a budget reconciliation, has to be within the budget lines.That does not come within that at all.And it really needs to be debated. It doesn't work in different states aredifferent. Some states already have $15.00.I think anybody that goes to work in the morning and works 40 hours a week,and works 50 weeks a year, that's 2,000 hours shouldn't be above a familyof three above the poverty guidelines and that's not $15.00.BAIER: Yes, let me put up the Biden coronavirus relief plan and that's$1,400 stimulus checks, the $15.00 an hour which you're saying is not goingto fall into the rules as --MANCHIN I don't think it does.BAIER: And also, 350 billion in state and local relief, you're for that?MANCHIN: Well, we have to look at that. I think that's way high, fromeverything I've seen that's extremely high.But with that, we want to make sure that the states that truly hit -- beenhit the hardest, have revenue shortages, because the type of economy theyhad have some relief. We're very sympathetic towards that.And you know, we've worked together in the 900 billion 908 team that we puttogether with Democrats and Republicans and came up with a good compromise.But you had to meet metrics in order to do it. You had to show me need. Youhad to show basically the coronavirus, how much it attacks your state andbasically how your economy lost in the population.So, they're going to have to prove that they need it, but I don't thinkit'd be anywhere near that.BAIER: So, if they say we're pushing forward with reconciliation whichmeans not 60, 51 votes.MANCHIN: Sure.BAIER: Let's say they figure out a way to write it where it all fits underthe rules. You're questioning that, but let's say they do. And they come toyou and say, Joe, we need that vote. And it's $1.9 trillion. Are you votingfor it?MANCHIN: What -- Bret, what I have told everybody I made it very clear fromthe president of the United States to all of my colleagues, we're going tomake this work in a bipartisan way, and my friends on the other side aregoing to have input, and we're going to do something that we agree on.I'm not going to do it just down the lines of just saying party-line vote.It has to make sense. And if it's out of the realm that makes sense in whatwe've worked on together, we built too much trust up among each other toallow this to fall apart, so they can count on me to make sure that we doeverything to make this bipartisan.BAIER: So, that sounds like a no, if they try to blow it down the line.MANCHIN: We're not going to blow it down the line. They can't do it downthe line. Basically, we've got to be able -- to those who are defendingtheir numbers whatever they may be and whatever category, they have to showwhere it comes from the sources, and where the need is.We have to look at basically how much we've already spent in those arenas.There's a lot of money that's going out the door and we all know that. Ididn't -- I wish we would have been able to sit down and work through abipartisan way. They all knew that, they knew where I stood. But I wasn'tgoing to stand and not allow us to go down a pathway.And they're going back in history Bret. In 2009, they said that I wasn'there. They tried to work on the Affordable Care Act. They worked for eightor nine months negotiating, and then, it all fell apart.We really don't have that amount of time if we -- it would fall apart. Idon't think it would, but that's their interpretation of it. So, I said,fine.BAIER: Yes.MANCHIN: We'll start this process. But I want you to know, I will vote in abipartisan way.BAIER: Senate -- now-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the reasonhe was going to forward with the power sharing deal is because you andArizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema essentially pledged publicly that you wouldnot break up the filibuster, the 60 vote threshold for legislation.MANCHIN: Sure.BAIER: Two questions here. One, under what conditions would you vote to endthe filibuster?MANCHIN: I don't think there is any. You understand I come from the statethat had a senator who served this country unbelievable. But the bottomline was he was a defender of the Senate.He used to tell me, Bret, he said, hey Joe, he says, when I was governor,he says, let me tell you about the Senate, it's a special place. There'snothing like in the world. He says, why do you think Rhode Island has twosenators in California? The smallest and the largest. Why do you thinkthat? Don't you think our founding fathers were thinking of basically howthe big person couldn't press to the smaller person? Why do you think wehave the filibuster, so the minority has input? I was -- this was ingrainedinto me.And he said, Joe, they even named a rule after me, called the Byrd Rule.You know what that's there for, why I put that in? He said, so, theycouldn't go around the back door and do away with it. So, you're talkingabout a person that's going to defend the legacy of Robert C. Byrd.BAIER: And so, Sinema and yourself, you're both public. But are there otherDemocrats you know of that would --(CROSSTALK)MANCHIN: I sure do.BAIER: -- not (INAUDIBLE) to bust up the filibuster?MANCHIN: I think there is. I really do. I think though. And just it's --you know, they're have to speak for themselves, but I have -- I've had agood conversations, a lot of my friends, and I think there's people thatfeel exactly like I do.This didn't work well in 2013 when Harry Reid did it. And then, my -- MitchMcConnell did it in 2017, it hasn't worked well for anybody. OK? We shouldwork together.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Yes. Let me --MANCHIN: That's the purpose of the Senate, Bret.BAIER: But let me ask you this.MANCHIN: Yes.BAIER: The White House, politically, tried to put a little pressure on youit seems. You know, having the Vice President Harris go to his localstation in West Virginia.MANCHIN: Yes.BAIER: You said you didn't know about it. Have you talked to them sincethat? Did they make a mistake by doing that?MANCHIN: Absolutely, they made a mistake and it shouldn't have been done.But a mistake was made, and we're going to make mistakes. (INAUDIBLE) says,to err is human, we're human beings.But with that being said, I've spoken to the president about that and I'vespoken to his -- some of his top officials, and I understand the mistakewas made, it should not have been done.BAIER: You know, today at the White House, Jen Psaki pointed to WestVirginia Governor Jim Justice and said that he is for a big package as faras coveted relief. What they don't talk about though is the other part ofthat interview from Governor Justice. And here is a little piece of thatabout climate change.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JIM JUSTICE (R-WV): If you want civilization to advance, today, weneed clean energy. And I'm all for it. But we just have to have a strategyrather than a knee jerk and that's what we have going on right now and it'sgoing to backfire. It's really going to hurt us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Do you agree with Governor Justice or what happened with the climatechange executive orders in the Biden administration?MANCHIN: Well, at the bottom line, I disagreed, and I respectfully disagreewith the president and executive order on going away the Keystone pipeline.I've seen the train blow up in West Virginia carrying that crude. I've seentanker cars explode going through towns. It's much safer in that pipelinethan it is coming across the road or the rail. If they think they're goingto stop that project, that's a heavy crude we need in our refineries.The bottom line is in that -- I'm an oil and energy person, Bret. And wehave to have energy basically and not depend on foreign energy. So, we haveto have the heavy crude. I rather for come from Canada and I would fromVenezuela.So, all of this being said, we're going to find a pathway forward. Butbottom line is we can do it cleaner. You cannot eliminate your way to acleaner global environment. You can innovate your way through technologyand that's what we intend to do.And in West Virginia, we'll build the new technology that the rest of theworld can clean up the environment. This is -- it should be an opportunity.There is transitions going on.BAIER: I have 10 seconds here, Senator.MANCHIN: Sure thing.BAIER: Are you the most powerful person in Washington?MANCHIN: Let me tell you something. I've seen people who thought they hadpower and abused it. I've seen the people that desired power and abused it.And I've seen people that had an opportunity to be in a situation where youcan make a difference, and I hope I'm that person to make a difference tobring our country together and start using --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Senator, you're always welcome -- you're always welcome back here onSPECIAL REPORT, we appreciate the time.MANCHIN: Thanks, Bret. Nice to be with you.BAIER: Up next, the careful balancing act congressional Republicans are nowfacing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): We have to move beyond what someone thinks mightbe true because it's on the Internet into what is true as best as we canunderstand it.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Positive day on Wall Street today on the prospects of the stimuluscoming. The Dow rose 476, its largest one-day gain since November. The S&P500 jumped 52, the NASDAQ finished up 209.Republican leadership on Capitol Hill has a tough task trying to wranglethe wings of the party. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said hewill speak to Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene about her social mediapost and conspiracy theories, while at the same time, being under pressureto remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership post.Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich looks at the political tag of war right nowon Capitol Hill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Surrounded byRepublican colleagues in Texas, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy keptthe conversation to President Biden's energy policies, avoiding questionsover newly elected Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and conspiracytheory she espoused.In a rare move, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell nudged McCarthy toact, inserting himself into McCarthy's domain, writing, "Loony lies andconspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country.Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11,that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that Clintons crashedJFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality."Other Republicans agreeing with the minority leader.CASSIDY: I'm a doctor, my whole training is we need to base things onfacts. I agree wholeheartedly with what the leader has said.HEINRICH: Greene claimed this weekend, she has the former president'ssupport. And she clapped back after McConnell's statement on Twitter,writing, "The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans whoonly know how to lose gracefully. This is why we are losing our country."SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I think I adequately spoke out about how Ifeel.HEINRICH: McConnell is also inserting himself in calls from within theparty to oust Representative Liz Cheney from her leadership post after shevoted to impeach President Trump last month.Ahead of her sit down with McCarthy, deciding her leadership fate,McConnell endorsed Cheney, writing, "Liz Cheney is a leader with deepconvictions and the courage to act on them.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera): And Democrats are trying to force McCarthy's hand andthreatening to strip Greene of her committee assignments. If McCarthy won'tdo it himself -- if he won't, they will make (INAUDIBLE) of it in themidterms. Bret.BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich, live on Capitol Hill. Jacqui, thank you.Up next, masks are now mandatory on public transportation. We'll bring youthat story. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around thecountry are covering tonight.Fox 32 in Chicago where the stalemate between the city and teacherscontinues tonight. Public school systems announcing remote learning willcontinue through Wednesday, and teachers will not be locked out of thesystem, calling it a gesture of good faith toward educators. The head ofthe teachers' union called it an encouraging step.This is a live look at Philadelphia from Fox 29. Remember what today is.The big story there, six more weeks of winter expected, at least, accordingto Punxsutawney Phil. The famous groundhog saw his shadow on a snowyGobbler's hill with no crowd in attendance due to coronavirus restrictions.Thousands watched the live stream of the event. Bill Murray, apparently,was not in attendance.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. Wewill be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Mother Nature has not helped the vaccine push with the northeastsnowstorm causing vaccination sites to close, and at airports across thecountry the TSA is now enforcing mask mandates. Correspondent JonathanSerrie is following it all from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport inAtlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As a severe winter storm cripplesthe northeast, governors have been forced to cancel or postpone vaccinationappointments for some of those who need the shots the most.MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) NEW YORK CITY:  We don't want folks, especiallyseniors, going out in unsafe conditions to get vaccinated.SERRIE:  In an effort to get as many shots into arms as possible, the Bidenadministration is urging providers not to hold vaccine supplies in reserve,saying manufacturers are scaling up production to ensure second doses willbe available when needed. And next week the administration plans to beginshipping 1 million doses of vaccine to 6,500 U.S. pharmacies.JEFF ZIENTS, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS COORDINATOR:  This pharmacy programwill expand access to neighborhoods across the country so you can make anappointment, get your shot conveniently and quickly.SERRIE:  Today the CDC's mask mandate took effect on commercial and publictransportation, including planes, trains, buses, and ride shares. Operatorsare required to notify passengers of the federal law, only allow peoplewearing masks to board, and they are directed to monitor passengers forcompliance and to disembark violators as soon as it's safely possible.PATRICIA MANCHA, TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION:  This is not aboutstrongarming people or trying to force people to do something. This isreally more about everybody working together to help secure thetransportation system.SERRIE:  The mandate allows exemptions for children under two and personswith disabilities that make mask wearing dangerous. You and your familydon't have to wear masks when traveling in your personal car, andcommercial drivers can go mask-free if they're alone in the vehicle.(END VIDEO TAPE)SERRIE (on camera):  And the federal mandate, which also applies toairports, imposes civil penalties for noncompliance.

Jonathan, thanks.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made an emotional appeal to herInstagram followers connecting the Capitol riots to her past trauma ofbeing sexually assaulted.

On China, Iran, and Russia, where a courtjust sentenced Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny to two years inprison, Secretary of State Antony Blinken writes, quote, "We reiterate ourcall for the Russian government to immediately and unconditionally releaseMr. Navalny, as well as the hundreds of other Russian citizens wrongfullydetained in recent weeks for exercising their rights, including the rightsto freedom of expression."On Iran, the State Department says the U.S. is ready to return to the 2015nuclear agreement once Iran does.PRICE:  We would then use that as a platform to build a longer and astronger agreement that also addresses other areas of concern.(END VIDEO TAPE)EDSON (on camera):  On the relationship with China, the State Departmentsays the U.S. is in a serious competition with China, though there areareas where the two countries can cooperate on a limited basis, issues likeclimate change. Bret?BAIER:  Rich, speaking of the State Department, the State Department'sdeputy spokesperson drawing criticism for comments she posted callingpolice, quote, the largest threat to U.S. national security?EDSON:  Yes, this is the Deputy Spokesperson Jalina Porter. She in astatement told us that she made those comments, or wrote those comments ina Facebook post as a private citizen five years ago in response to what shecalls uncomfortable and deeply painful truth of race-based violence in theUnited States. She also goes on to say "The pain I expressed was real.Nevertheless, I should have chosen words that were less passionate and spurof the moment as well as more constructive. I, of course, know well thatnot all law enforcement officers pose a threat to our community."Now, we asked the State Department whether officials take issue with thatstatement that she posted on Facebook. Officials referred us to JalinaPorter's statement. Back to you.BAIER:  OK, Rich Edson at the State Department. Rich, thanks.Up next, the panel on President Biden's immigration plans and COVID relieffunding, including reaction to my interview with West Virginia DemocraticSenator Joe Manchin.First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. An out of control wildfire burning nearthe Australian city of Perth has destroyed at least 59 homes after doublingin size overnight. Six firefighters have been injured. The cause of thatblaze still unknown tonight.And sad news from the United Kingdom. Captain Tom Moore, the British WorldWar II veteran who raised millions of pounds for health service workers onthe frontline of the battle against COVID-19 has died. Moore gained fame bywalking around the garden, his garden, during the lockdown to raise a lotof funds. Captain Sir Tom Moore was 100-years-old. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV):  Bret, what I have told everybody, and I made itvery clear, from the president of the United States to all of mycolleagues, we're going to make this work in a bipartisan way. My friendson the other side are going to have input, and we're going to do somethingthat we agree on. I'm not going to do it just down the lines of just sayingparty line vote. It has to make sense. And if it's out of the realm thatmakes sense in what we've worked together, we've built too much trust upamong each other to allow this to fall apart. So they can count on me tomake sure that we do everything to make this bipartisan.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Democratic Senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin on this showearlier. The gap, the difference between the proposal by the Bidenadministration, $1.9 trillion, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, and what GOPsenators are bringing forward, $600 billion, that's a lot, $1.3 trillion.Joe Manchin is saying they've got to negotiate. It's not going to be pusheddown anybody's throat.Let's bring in our panel, Bill McGurn, columnist for "The Wall StreetJournal," Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for NationalPublic Radio, and Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for "Axios."Mara, your take from the Manchin interview? It sounded prior to that, thateverything was heading down reconciliation and it was going to be a partyline vote maybe.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, Joe Manchin is going to vote for at least the process to letreconciliation go forward. But he said pretty clearly he wants it to bebipartisan. Does that mean he has to have 10 Republican senators make itbipartisan or just a couple for reconciliation? Because, it's very hard forme to imagine the package that would keep all those 10 Republicans on boardand Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin. It's just hard to see it, the gap is sobig.BAIER:  But Jonathan, he also said he is against raising the minimum wage,which is part of the Biden plan.JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, "AXIOS":  Right. So he's tryingto draw at least a few red lines. But I think, as mara said, the fact thathe has voted to move forward with this process suggests that ultimatelyhe's going to support something that is going to be basically a partisanvote.There's a lot of posturing going on right now, but if you're reading thetea leaves, it does seem like it's going to be a Democrat bill,overwhelmingly if not entirely and exclusively supported by Democrats.BAIER:  Bill McGurn?BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I agree. I would like to see things godown the normal process rather than through budget reconciliation, becauseI believe that all these moves so the Democrats are in a position to do itnow, like executive orders, going down budget reconciliation, they don'tfeel unity. What we really need is a lot more emphasis on the legislaturewhere the Democrats dominate and where each side gives a little. That's theway the system is meant to work.And that's really the path to unity. We're never going to agree, the twosides are never going to agree on policy. But you have give-and-take. Youget some and you lose some. And I think that the Democrats might see ashort-term advantage of pushing all this through, but it makes theseachievements very brittle, and I don't think it helps.And the president's problem, sometimes it's harder when you have the kindof slight majority that the Democrats have now, because you're alwaysvulnerable for defections, as the Republicans learned with John McCain andhealthcare. And so it's not just Joe Manchin. Every Democrat in the Senateis the 50th vote. And that's a problem. To slightly resay what Mara said,it's hard to see a bill, if you go too far in Joe Manchin's direction, theBernie Sanders wing is going to object, and vice versa. So it is a verydelicate balance.BAIER:  The other news out of there was on busting up the filibuster.Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona senator, and Joe Manchin publicly have saidthat they would not vote to do that. But he said, the senator said, thatthere are other Democrats he's talked to who are in that boat.Mara, I want to turn to immigration. President Biden defending hisexecutive orders and actions, now more than 43, that have been signed, thisone on immigration. And he said that, I'm not making new law, I'meliminating bad policy.LIASSON:  Well, several of the immigration executive orders are basicallyto study the situation, see how you can reunite parents with their childrenwhen they were separated. To see what you can do to stop a surge at theborder that might include giving more aid to countries in Central Americato keep people from going to the United States. So, so far these areexecutive orders are attempts to put something in the place of the Trumpimmigration policies.BAIER:  Jonathan, Brit Hume said last night that maybe these executiveorders and actions are giving him cover to do some negotiations withRepublicans, with his progressive side. Do you buy that, from inside theWhite House?SWAN:  Some of them might, but this one won't. This was a recognition that,actually, it's really easy to criticize Donald Trump for all of hisimmigration plans. It's much harder to implement your own policy. So thiswas basically a punt. Today, it was actually very cautious and reflectedthat he realizes, oh, it's much harder once you're actually in office. Easyto criticize, much harder to actually implement.BAIER:  And quickly, Bill, there could be some immigration legislation thathas some bipartisan appeal, the DACA situation. But on the big picture ofimmigration, it's always been like Lucy and the football, trying to getsomething through Congress.MCGURN:  Yes. Bret, I was with President Bush when we were trying to craftthe immigration proposal back then and watched it blow up in our faces. Istill think America needs a fixed and reformed immigration system. I don'tthink we're going to get comprehensive reform. But any agreementlegislatively is the first path to a permanent solution, and not justsomething that will hold for the next few years until the next presidentcomes in.BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by, if you would. When we come back, thepanel looks ahead to tomorrow's headlines.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines with the panel.Jonathan, you are up.SWAN:  I'm going with Biden's awkward dance. He's making a show ofconsulting Republicans on the COVID relief package. Meanwhile everyone onthe team knows it's must more likely to be Democrats jamming this throughwith a simple majority.BAIER:  All right, Bill?MCGURN:  Bret, kids languish, but still no sign of Chicago teachersreturning to the classroom.BAIER:  That's kind of cut and dry. Mara?(LAUGHTER)LIASSON:  Mine is Reddit day traders find a new stock to boost, Bed Bath &Beyond.(LAUGHTER)LIASSON:  Just thinking of another kind of sleepy company that doesn't seemlike it should be valued at a gazillion dollars, but might be soon. Andit's being shorted.BAIER:  But Mara, do you think that there's going to be some pushback onthat effort?LIASSON:  Sure, but they did it once, they can do it again. And someobscure company, which doesn't seem like it should be valued at billionsand billions -- hundreds of billions of dollars -- might just get there.They seem pretty powerful.BAIER:  And by the way, if you want a podcast to listen to, Jonathan Swan,what's the name of it?SWAN:  "How It Happened" by "Axios."BAIER:  "How It Happened," very good, by "Axios." Thanks, panel.Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the"SPECIAL REPORT," fair, balanced, and still unafraid. There is this greatshow, FOX NEWS PRIMETIME.
