Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. We are in a very bad spot. ISIS is winning in Iraq, and the Iraqi security forces, when they aren't looking weak, are running away with their tails between their legs.
So, what is President Obama going to do about Iraq? Well, here is what White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The United States is prepared to train them, to equip them, and to back them on the battlefield with coalition military air power as they take the fight to ISIL in their own country. The United States is not going to be responsible for securing the security situation inside of Iraq. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Not responsible? Well, of course. I don't want to endanger any of our troops, and I sure don't want to spend any more of your tax money, but is President Obama taking a look at the big picture? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So far, Iraq has shown neither the ability, nor the will, to stand on its own. Those are ugly facts but the cold truth.
So, if President Obama takes this minimalist role, this "tough love" approach, what do you think Iraq is going to do? Suddenly grow up? Get strong? Or turn to Iran? And then what happens? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
