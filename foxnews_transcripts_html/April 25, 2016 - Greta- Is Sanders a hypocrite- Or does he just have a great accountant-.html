Let's all go "Off the Record." Is he a hypocrite? Or does he just have a great accountant, his wife? I'm talking about presidential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders.
Sanders brags that his wife does his taxes. I don't know what your tax rate is, but I do know now Senator Sanders' tax rate. But before I even get that, here is a bit of "feeling the Bern." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But we are going to fight for is to the man that in time of massive income wealth and equality. The wealthiest people of largest corporation start paying their fare share of taxes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is always money for tax breaks for billionaires.
SANDERS: The wealthy are getting wealthier. Many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');

OK, now this, according to the Sanders tax return, he and his wife made $205,271 of taxable income in 2014. Now, that income level places him about in the top 5 percent of earners in the nation, it is not the top 1 percent, but above the top 5 percent. So, what is his tax rate? 35 percent? No. 25 percent?  No. 15 percent? No, not that, either. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Try 13.5 percent. He is almost in the top 5 percent of income, and he pays less than 14 percent tax rate. Who is getting burned? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, what is his wife's phone number? I could use her accounting skills doing my taxes. And that is my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
