              <h2>Greta's 'Off the Record' commentary, 6/24/15: What kind of the message is the Baltimore state's attorney sending by posing in Vogue magazine, appearing on concert stages? Instead of fussing about our report, she should investigate who leaked the Freddie Gray autopsy report</h2>

Let's all go "Off the Record." Leaking evidence is dirty. And last night, we spoke about Freddie Gray's autopsy report being leaked to the Baltimore Sun. Baltimore prosecutor Marilyn Mosby won't give the defense lawyers a copy yet, so we know the lawyers didn't do it. So, who leaked it?
Last night, I said at the outset that Mosby's office denies they did. Two offices have a copy, the medical examiner's and the prosecutors, so both are suspects. And apparently, our report last night hit a nerve, Mosby's, because while we were on the air - and even afterward -  I set her off as she denied leaking the autopsy. Mosby's office emailed this: "I want to make it very clear that the state's attorney's office did not release the Freddie Gray autopsy report, as I have repeatedly stated. I strongly condemn anyone's access to trial evidence who has leaked information prior to the resolution of this case." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Note to Mosby: Skip the condemning. That's just talk. She needs to make sure it doesn't happen. That's the job. One other thing, why is Mosby going on stage at rock concerts and posing in a fashion magazine, Vogue? Is she trying out for a reality show, or being the chief prosecutor? You tell me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now we have, of course, reached out to Marilyn Mosby, and she has an open invitation to go "On the Record." I will be tough, but I will be fair. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
