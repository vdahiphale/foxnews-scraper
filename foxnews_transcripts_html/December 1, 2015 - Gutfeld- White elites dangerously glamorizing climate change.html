Crusade getting the attention terror doesn't 
Did you know that the Paris climate talks emit 300,000 tons of CO2? Here's some of that gas:

DAVID CAMERON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Let's just imagine for a moment, what we would have to say to our grandchildren, if we failed.
What was it that was so difficult when the Earth was in peril? When the sea levels were rising in 2015, when crops were failing, when deserts were expanding. What was it that was so difficult?

SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS: The president warns it will soon be too late to stop climate change. We find evidence in China's pollution emergency and in the melting arctic.
MARK PHILLIPS, CBS NEWS: The scientists say what happens up here is what's going to happen to all of us.

DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: Overseas tonight and to Paris and to that unprecedented climate change summit tonight. A major gathering of world leaders -- nearly 150 in all -- including of course President Obama, who said today the United States deserves some of the blame for climate change.

What self-perpetuating poop. You've got to wonder why such drama hasn't been directed at terror. Maybe it's the difference between those who fight for such causes. The climate crazies are elitists: lavishly educated, expensively caffeinated and predominantly white. The older and richer they are, the more this elite status becomes obvious. See Prince Charles, Leo DiCaprio, Al Gore, still there. But I beg you, try finding a poor Indian, a working-class Asian or a struggling Latino on the activist front trampling over the shrines to the Paris attacks. No, they are almost entirely white, European elitists who wish to deny cheap fuel to the billion Third World, not on the electricity grid. Maybe they're racist. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As Prince Charles falsely links drought to terror, this war on cheap resources is a more likely link, for when you ensure poverty to a billion people a death cult becomes viable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So climate panic helps terror in two ways: by diverting resources from the fight and punishing the poor.
Now let's look at those who see terror as a bigger threat than climate change. They aren't in Hollywood. They aren't in the media. They're not tenured. They don't have private jets, they don't drip with royalty or party with Leo on yachts stacked with topless supermodels. They aren't chic. They look like you and sadly, me. Could that be why the climate crusade gets the summit and the attention and the accolades that terror warriors never get? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Imagine if we flipped this and made the war on terror the glamorous one. ISIS wouldn't stand a chance.  </pre>
