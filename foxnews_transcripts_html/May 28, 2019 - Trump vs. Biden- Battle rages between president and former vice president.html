DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kennedy, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
The road to 2020 looking like a good one for the president, three new projection models predict Trump will win re-election, that's according to a former Obama administration official, Steven Ratner saying the combination of a strong economy and being the incumbent currently point to a win for Trump. And as the race to the White House continues to heat up, the president not letting up on his attacks on Joe Biden. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
While overseas, Trump ripping the former vice president for his role in the 1994 crime bill, critics say that legislation led to the mass incarceration for African-American, quote, anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African-Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for criminal justice reform which has tremendous support and help fix the bad 1994 bill. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But the road to 2020 could prove difficult for Biden. The Washington Post calling out his campaign strategy which is apparently not doing a lot of campaigning. Quote, the light public schedule reflects the unique position of his campaign. Advisors say with near universal name recognition high favorability ratings among Democrats, the former VP doesn't need to introduce himself to voters like nearly every other candidate. And as the leader in early polls, he can attract media attention without splashy events. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Oh, but how long, Greg, can you do that? Does a lack of campaigning eventually catch up to you if you don't look like you are really hungry for it?
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Hiding Biden. New nickname, hiding Biden. This have not work for Hillary. Remember, they were keeping Hillary, you know, in a freezer. You know, they had her powered down. And then they would charge her and send her out and then, you know, nothing would happen. Look, this is like three segments in one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Yeah.
GUTFELD: OK, first the polls. This is Ratner is a sneaky little skimmer. This is all hands on deck approach, like telling people that Trump is gonna win, Trump is gonna win, so you better not be complacent because that's what happened with Hillary. So they don't want people to get complacent, so they're not going to play down the Democrats positive polls and play up any Republican or Trump poll to do that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I could talk about the crime bill, but I -- it's -- you can't throw the baby out with the bath water. There's some good stuff in that crime bill and Biden did a good job on it. Trump is coming lately to that stuff and saying that he's, you know, for criminal reform which he has -- but -- this is a new time for Republicans because it used to be -- there're now four housemen after them. It used to be media, academia and entertainment industry. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Those were the three groups that were coming after Republicans all the time. They would paint you -- they would say that if you didn't vote Democrat you weren't cool. That was four decades. You were a dork if you weren't a Democrat. Now you can add the fourth horseman which is social media. And that's arguably the most powerful of the four.
So now you have four groups that are coming after you, and social media will do it in different ways by playing up positive stuff for the Democrats on their platforms, and playing down positive stuff for Trump on their platforms and you won't even know it. So that's going to be a new hurdle. The other new thing is about -- you have is you have a president who's now a heavyweight contender defending his belt. That's what Trump is. He's Ali defending his belt which means he's going to be trash talking all the way to the end. I just addressed four topics for you.
PERINO: You did a very good job. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Sorry about that.
PERINO: I want to ask you, Juan, in the 2016 primary, one of the most effective attacks and weapons that Bernie Sanders had against Hillary Clinton was the crime bill. So it's almost sort of strange to now have the President of the United States trying to use the crime bill against Joe Biden.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: I think it is strange. I think it's strange because to go with Greg's analogy if this is Muhamad Ali defending the belt, he just dropped his hands because everybody is gonna say, ah, Mr. President, what about you and the Central Park 5, people that you wanted executed who were later exonerated. That's how vicious and angry you were in terms of crime. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Greg picks up another good point which is, hey, wait a second, I thought lots of conservatives, in fact, liked the crime bill, and thought that, in fact, putting more people -- and I will say, you know what? It's not fair to Greg. It's not just conservatives. There're a lot of people in the black community, the majority of the black caucus in Congress --

GUTFELD: You had the crack epidemic.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Right. But now you have people out of time, and I think Trump is, you know, kind of trying to imagine people out of context who don't have that memory just jumping on Joe Biden. But I don't think it's gonna work with most Democrats. It might work with some on the far-left, the Black Lives Matter and the like. And people who've written books about mass incarceration which is an issue. But I'm not sure that they're going to say, oh, yeah, as a result of Joe Biden's mistake with the crime bill, I'm voting Trump? I just don't see --
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: But this is where Trump is a different candidate because he'll hit Biden from the left on something like crime. He hits him from the left on something like trade or foreign intervention or drug pricing. Then when he's all dizzy because he's not used to handling it that way, he'll come from the hard-right on immigration or hard-right on taxes. It's an unorthodox fighting style that a non- traditional candidate isn't used to defending against. And I don't think Biden has the political dexterity to handle those types of attacks. He's old, he's rusty, and he's so traditional. He'll be overwhelmed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, we'll see. But -- you know what I would say for Trump on this, I think -- I haven't seen a Democrat yet who's able to repeat which is the magic sauce for Democrats, which is you get blacks, Latinos, and immigrants and women together. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Well, that was the Obama coalition and I don't think Biden has the juice to reenact that.
WILLIAMS: We'll see.
PERINO: Kennedy, do you think that Biden right now is creating an illusion of safety for Democrats? And -- his crowds aren't that big, but his numbers are really, really high. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, HOST: I understand the strategy because he doesn't want to put himself out there and make a bunch of unforce gaffes before the debates while the field is so vast, because while the field is this big he's got so many people coming after him. And if he just lays low and rests on his moral and every once in a while emerges to talk about the good old days of the Obama-Biden presidency and era, he's fine doing that for a little while. He is just biding his time while they're hiding Biden. But I do -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: You ain't lying.
MONTGOMERY: I do think that opens him up to a number of attacks to Jesse's point. And my problem with the crime bill is it took an entire generation, particularly men of color, and showed that they were disposable and not redeemable. And that's the problem with it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I can't believe it's taken 25 years to right that course. And, you know, we're having the most bizarre conversation with actors leading it that you never wouldn't imagine. You wouldn't imagine that some people see Trump as a hard-core conservative, that he is the one leading the discussion on criminal justice reform which would have been such --
GUTFELD: But that's how it works, right? You always -- you always trust the hard liner to do the soft line, right?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Right. And also you couldn't even have this conversation if it was 1994. Like without the crime bill and the results you would not be actually having the conversation of was that too much.

GUTFELD: You could create -- the crime bill could have created, you can argue this and disagree with it. But you can argue that crime bill decreased crime in such a manner that we can now sit here and entertain that it was wrong.
WILLIAMS: Well -- yeah, you could.

MONTGOMERY: When we talk about these things going forward, I hope it changes the discussion. And I hope we talk about unintended consequences. And that's why, you know, people get really frustrated when we talk about socialism which is it's filled with some wonderful intentions, but the bad that can come of it in the exact same way could be so destructive and long lasting, and I hope that's what leads our political conversation there.

PERINO: Since World War II only two president have not won re-election.
WILLIAMS: Yes. So he's got that. Plus, he, you know, it seems to me if you think about it, you know, he -- it's not that it's insurmountable. Let me just not confuse anybody. I'm not trying to play games of the kind of - - I was -- Ratner was accused of. I think Ratner is based on this on a economic model. I think if Trump, in fact, was just based on economics, we would be a very popular president, but he's not. It's because he says things like the craziness he said over in Japan.

So now you have someone smart enough to go, oh, maybe if we talk about how great Trump is doing that would actually drive some movement --
PERINO: Also there's a long way to go, 12 months in fact. All right, big day in federal court for Michael Avenatti, the latest on his back-to-back arraignments when we return.

WATTERS: It wasn't a good day to be Michael Avenatti, the embattled attorney facing two separate arraignments in federal court here in New York involving multiple charges. First, he pleads not guilty to allegedly stealing nearly 300 grand from Stormy. He then also pleads not guilty to charges that he tried to extort up to $25 million from Nike. Here what he told reporters outside the courtroom this afternoon.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL AVENATTI, LAWYER: For over 20 years I have represented David versus Goliath across this nation in many courthouses just like this. I am now facing the fight of my life against the ultimate Goliath, the Trump administration. I am confident that when a jury of my peers passes judgment on my conduct that justice will be done and I will be fully exonerated.

WATTERS: All right. And he faces I think 400 years. So one of the things -- you don't need to put up the text on the screen, one of his defenses is he wants to investigate the investigators. He wants to know how this whole thing shook out.
PERINO: It got a certain ring to it.

WATTERS: I wonder where he got that from.
PERINO: A certain ring to it. You know, he got a very busy day today and I think that he should enjoy it, make the most of it, because if he's going to be in jail for 400 years then he won't have that many busy days going forward. I think perhaps a jury of his peers will let him go. However, the jury of his legal peers they look very -- they frown very much on stealing from you clients. Like that's a number one thing, should not ever steal from your client.

He said -- every day he keeps saying I look forward to being vindicated. In what? A court of law which he denied Kavanaugh. The fact is you have to keep looking forward to everyday to being vindicated, maybe look at your own lifestyle, that's all you do.

GUTFELD: Having --
WILLIAMS: Avenatti.
PERINO: Creepy porn lawyer on. He said, well, you know, he's in the news. He's on like cable news, so of course we put him on. So basically he's saying that because we put him on CNN, we're going to put him on CNN. That's like saying, you know, I beat the cat because my previous cat beatings made it acceptable to beat the cat. No logic there.
WATTERS: We haven't heard a lot (INAUDIBLE), Kennedy, from the media for putting this guy on. You'd think there would be some sort of self- examination. You know, what did we get wrong?

MONTGOMERY: Well, you think there would be better vetting processes because I spoke to a reporter last week who very easily dug up some of the questionable business dealings that Avenatti have had for years. And, of course, Avenatti went after this journalist and threatened him with legal action because he basically printed the truth.

MONTGOMERY: Here's the other thing, President Trump has gone after a lot of people, and sometimes it's very uncouth, sometimes it's unforce, sometimes it's unattractive, but those people aren't facing 400 years in prison. So it's not just by virtue of the president being your enemy that land you in legal deep yogurt.

MONTGOMERY: It's the fact that he has done, reportedly, bad things to a bunch of people over a number of years. And some of these issues that he's facing are very, very serious. And Judge Napolitano laid that out earlier today on Fox News. This guy is facing some real time. So anyone who wants to be a high-profile ambulance chaser or, you know, just one of these celebrity lawyers, make sure that your past is a little squeakier than Avenatti did because he was not very careful.
WATTERS: And this looks like a case of straight greed, Juan. I mean, this is a guy with a Lamborghini, leases, you know, jewelry --
MONTGOMERY: Remember his dry cleaning bill?

But, you know, as I'm listening to this conversation, a couple of things, one, I think all of you are saying, well, because Avenatti was Trump's nemesis and now he's, you know, proven or not proven but allegedly a thief, oh, therefore, everything is cool. But, you know, the reality is --
MONTGOMERY: No one said that.
WILLIAMS: -- that Trump lied about not knowing about a payment to silence a porn star that he was supposedly having sex with --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: It was about Kavanaugh, nothing about Trump.
WILLIAMS: No, forget Kavanaugh for a second. This is about Avenatti. And Avenatti is well known. This comes to your point, though, Greg. The reason Avenatti was on cable so much, and I think everybody here would say you've got to cover it, the president -- a man who becomes President of the United States is accused of having sex with a porn star, says it's not true, says he knows nothing about payments to that porn star, and then it's proven --

WILLIAMS: OK. So you can say what you want about Kavanaugh --
GUTFELD: Thank you.
WILLIAMS: I'll just stick to why he was prominent to be in a position --

MONTGOMERY: OK, bed bugs are prominent but bed bugs are not a contender for the presidency. And that's unfortunately how a lot of people in the media framed Michael Avenatti.
WILLIAMS: No, nobody -- look --
GUTFELD: Don't smear bed bugs --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Subsequently, when he was so prominent because guess who was another prominent TV star? Oh, the president.

WILLIAMS: He made awful salacious allegations against Kavanaugh that were -- I don't know if proven wrong, but it didn't matter ultimately --
MONTGOMERY: It weren't proven --
WILLIAMS: But with Trump the reason he became prominent was Stormy Daniels, and there's no getting away from that for you guys.
WATTERS: So Juan's argument is that Kavanaugh should thank Michael Avenatti.
WILLIAMS: In many ways --

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: It's a good day when one of the biggest news story is about a tweet that didn't happen, which you can add to the Trump-era wars that don't happen, or the Trump-era collusion that didn't happen either. Over the weekend, political science professor Ian Bremmer tweeted this quote attributed to President Trump, quote, Kim Jong-un is smarter and would make a better president than Sleepy Joe Biden. No joke. You could almost hear Trump saying that which is the problem.
A bunch of hysterical anti-Trumpers believed it clogging twitter with breathless outrage for a day. Later Bremmer said it was a joke and he took it down. He apologized, problem solved. But here are a few lessons to turn this tiny, tiny story into a segment. If a parody doesn't offer a clue that it's a joke then it's not a parody, it's just misleading. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Unlike most media which misleads on purpose by parodying actual journalism, and it's on Memorial Day weekend which notes the sacrifices of those who died for our country. One way to commemorate that is to make sure in the future that your country's blood is always treated as precious. So we must be doing somewhat better if our military foot print seems to be shrinking, and that many of the wars among adults are now over tweets.
Two years ago we worried about real missiles coming from Kim, now it's about fake tweets heading toward him, that's progress for now anyway.
He apologized promptly. I think the problem was it was plausible as he said.
PERINO: Yes. Ian Bremmer is one of my dear friends. And so --
GUTFELD: Globalist.

GUTFELD: You have a fantasy book?
(CROSSTALK)
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Where you dressed up as a policeman?
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: This is going to be so good.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Remember the book I want to write called tweets I never sent.
GUTFELD: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
PERINO: And also like twitter -- ah, twitter.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. Jesse, I do feel safer now than I did with North Korea --
WATTERS: You do.
GUTFELD: -- even with the tweet. I do. And I think it's due to Trump's kind of nature of dealing with separating the person from the country. So he deals with the person which is what salesman do.
WATTERS: Right. And I just think it's fine that these so-called experts keeps falling for hoaxes and then they blame the hoax instead of themselves.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WATTERS: These people aren't as smart as they really are cracked up to be. Think about everybody that's an expert fell for Smollett, fell for the Russia collusion, fell for the dossier, fell for this. It's like -- it takes two days or a week of checking something and then you get to the bottom of it. But I don't even go on twitter anymore. I didn't go on twitter once this weekend --
PERINO: Wait.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: -- and I feel great. Then when they --
PERINO: That is why we told you not to tweet anymore.
WATTERS: That was your intervention?
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: Greg and I were trying to help you.
WATTERS: That was the first successful intervention that ever happened with me.
GUTFELD: It's true. We took him in the greenroom and we've said --
PERINO: I took twitter off Hannity's phone in 2015.
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's right. You're the twitter cop. You're not just an interventionist foreign policy, you're an interventionist of social media. Juan, you've been a journalist for many years. Anything that seems too perfect never is, right?
WILLIAMS: Absolutely. It's almost more of the story. The rest of the story is as famously say. But I am a little surprise that this conversation in that last week wasn't it Trump supporters who put out was a distorted totally manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi looking like she was drunk, and people had to say, hey, this is not real.
MONTGOMERY: You don't need to distort those videos. They speak for themselves.
WILLIAMS: Well, no. If you slow them down, Kennedy, so that she sounds like --
GUTFELD: But they were obvious.
WILLIAMS: Oh, they're obvious. Well, I think --
GUTFELD: I noticed it.
WATTERS: Democrats are complaining about propaganda. That's rich, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.
WATTERS: Yeah, that's rich. You're complaining about fake news?
WILLIAMS: Absolutely. You can't --
WATTERS: OK.
WILLIAMS: When people put out stuff -- because I think there's lot --
WATTERS: It happens all the time, Juan. It's just a video.
WILLIAMS: Distorted video.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: It's just a bunch of strange people in their basements making videos, and go around the internet and that's life
WILLIAMS: OK. And then Greg says here on the show, oh, he feels safer when you have Trump repudiating what his own National Security Advisor John Bolton says, reputed what--
WATTERS: I thought you hated John Bolton.
WILLIAMS: I do not hate John Bolton.
WATTERS: Now, you're citing him as a--
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: OK. How about Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan? All of them say, "Hey, Kim is a danger and Trump saying, no, he's all right. He didn't violate the deal".
GUTFELD: He's playing chess and they're playing checkers.
WATTERS: I never heard that before.
GUTFELD: I just coined it right now.
MONTGOMERY: He's talking about Nixon's dog. God rests his soul.
GUTFELD: Yes, Kennedy thoughts, prayers?
MONTGOMERY: You're helping him Ian Bremmer is helping the President with tweets like this. And you never see the onion put up a funny headline and go, that's plausible.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes.
MONTGOMERY: That's the problem. It shouldn't be plausible. If it's parody, if it's farce it should be so incredibly outrageous.
GUTFELD: Yes.
MONTGOMERY: But the problem is he puts something in the realm of plausibility just to make people like Ana Navarro and Ted Lieu - so they retweet it like, "See we told you, he has to go impeachable". Impeach, impeach, impeach.
And you're only helping him because the biggest problem is that people will continue to divorce the President's actions and personality from his policies and result, and the more that happens "The Great Divorce" as C.S. Lewis called it. The better that President's chances are.
And if you run around saying everything he does is just symptomatic of his insanity, at some point that starts to--
WILLIAMS: When he says stuff like, "Oh, yes, Kim Jong-un is right, Joe Biden is a low IQ fool". You think, "What, that's our President?"
GUTFELD: Yes, that's bridging differences, Juan, when you can agree with an adversary. Can I make a shout at?
MONTGOMERY: President Obama did the same thing about Trump when he was overstepping (ph).
GUTFELD: I want to make a shout out, though I've been ripping on CNN. I got a compliment Jake Tapper spends all Memorial Day basically just tweeting out memorials of fallen soldiers and that's the one area where you take the kind of the cemetery formality and he transferred it over to the superficiality of Twitter. So you can't just stay on Twitter and pretend that Memorial Day doesn't exist.
PERINO: One of his best - one of Jake Tapper's best tweets this weekend was, he was quoting a soldier who said "Be an American worth dying". Very inspirational.
GUTFELD: I try that every day. All right coming up this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMIE SIMPSON, FOX45 WEATHERMAN: Just go back to the show. No, we're not going back to the show folks. This is a dangerous situation, OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: TV weatherman unleashes on viewers who'd rather watch "The Bachelorette" over his tornado warnings.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Tornadoes wreaking havoc in Ohio and amid the severe weather a local meteorologist was forced to scold angry viewers, they were griping about tornado warnings interrupting last night's episode of "The Bachelorette".
Jamie Simpson was reporting on several twisters ripping through Ohio overnight killing at least one person. The powerful storms also left millions without power. But after Simpson broke into coverage, he got major, major backlash prompting this response.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SIMPSON: I was just checking social media; we have viewers complaining already, Just go back to the show. No, we're not going back to the show, folks. This is a dangerous situation, OK. Think about if this was your neighborhood.
I'm sick and tired of people complaining about this. Our job here is to keep people safe, and that is what we're going to do. Some of you complained that this is all about my ego, stop. OK. Just stop right now. It's not. I'm done with you people, I really am, this is pathetic.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Simpson later apologized for his rant, but not for his message about safety. So Kennedy, I got to say, I don't think he was doing this for ratings. I think it really is a life-and-death situation.
MONTGOMERY: I don't think he necessarily makes the call single-handedly. He certainly can influence the call as to whether or not they dip in and out of programming. I haven't seen an interruption this egregious since the Knicks game was interrupted by the OJ chase.
And I think they have to be incredibly mindful of what they're - it's very funny because, you want to keep people safe and you want to keep people alive and make sure that they have adequate information. But you really don't want to insult your audience.
WILLIAMS: Wait, you mean it was an insult not to interrupt, but the rant.
MONTGOMERY: Yes, the rant. Look it up, Jamie, that's all I have to say.
WILLIAMS: All right. But Jesse I think it's kind of moronic to say, I'd rather watch "The Bachelorette" and endanger my life?
WATTERS: Yes, I mean, if it's the rose ceremony, that's not a good time to interrupt with storm coverage. People would rather die than find out who got the final rose, and that's fine. People are stupid, and they don't care about their fellow people in Ohio.
But the guy - it was a little annoying. All he had to say was I'm sorry, we're getting a lot of comments from social media about interrupting The Bachelor, I'll make this as quick as possible. This is a life and death situation, that's all he had to say. He didn't need to get on his high horse.
WILLIAMS: Does this mean like when Shepard Smith comes on that we can just say, "Hey listen, you know what happened to that meteorologist in Ohio, can we do that?"
PERINO: Well, he got to you.
WILLIAMS: Dana, I got to tell you, if there's a tornado near me, I'd be scared. I know flying--
PERINO: So I grew up in a Eastern - rural Colorado and we had tornado warnings almost every day after school and my sister and I had taped a VCR - look it up folks - VCR and "The Grease" and then we would watch that movie all the time, but it had recorded during a tornado warning so there was like a big chunk of the movie that was missing. Even so we watched it every day.
GUTFELD: You just said thought there were tornadoes in "Grease".
PERINO: Every single time.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: But I also think this. A lot of people aren't watching your local stations anymore, right. You're watching on all sorts of different ways Netflix, Prime Video, whatever. I think that we should be allowed to have a technical device that you can suppress it at your own risk.
If you don't want to know about tornado warnings, that's fine, you can right here it says I give up my right to see the thing and I'm going to watch "The Bachelorette". Let people make a choice.
WILLIAMS: Well, that's like that's like, Greg, when they tell people to evacuate and they're just yes.
GUTFELD: I will just hang out here. I do find - I get the guys frustration. But if you go to the dump and you find trash it's not the dump's fault. Like, you know that you're going to get nothing but superficial takes on Twitter of people pissed off. So if you go there, it's kind of you're actively looking for that to get angry--
WATTERS: Yes, why is he on social media?
PERINO: When there is a tornado.
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: It drives me crazy when people - they go Twitter and they make - they say something provocative and they get all this response. And then they get - then they're the victim. Like, "Oh, my god people are attacking me. Oh, please stop". It's like just get off there - get off there.
But I do understand it's his vocation, he takes it seriously. But man when “The Five” is on and all of a sudden there's breaking news and worse - people--
PERINO: Don't check your social media.
GUTFELD: Don't check your social media, because people are angry.
WILLIAMS: Well, the thing - I must say - so like, I - my family goes down to the Outer Banks for summer vacation and they get hit by terrible hurricanes once in a blue moon. And then people - some people are like, "Nah man, I'm hanging out". And some people actually - I think you'd like this Kennedy, go surfing.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: There is a big wave. It's like, "Hey, what is wrong with you?"
MONTGOMERY: No, surfers are the best storm chasers. They always go right in before the storm hits, because that's when the waves are perfect, because you have a nice onshore wind it's - where everything is --
GUTFELD: Did anybody watch "The Bachelorette" last night?
MONTGOMERY: Great surfing in Ohio, by the way.
GUTFELD: Did anybody find out what happened?
WATTERS: No.
GUTFELD: Neither did I.
MONTGOMERY: It was very tragic. OK.
WILLIAMS: All right. Next up, the heat is on how a new study could give women the leverage to control the temperature, even in this studio.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MONTGOMERY: Oh, it's cold in here. The debate over office temperatures is heating up and it's all thanks to a brand new study. It turns out women now have a valid reason to want to raise the temperature.
The study found more ladies are more productive working when it's warmer, while men thrive in colder temps. And the battle for the thermostat - the Goldilocks temperature for both genders appears to be the mid-70s, which is also the Golden Age of dating. Jesse, do you agree with that - mid-70, 75, doesn't it sound a little bit warm?
WATTERS: I'm comfortable in most places. But I have a new strategy, which I'm going to employ, since we got new offices and we have a thermostat in our offices now.
MONTGOMERY: Wow, oh, we do?
WATTERS: Yes, we do.
MONTGOMERY: Oh, I didn't see.
WATTERS: So our executive producers are female, Meghan, and she likes to come into my office and boss me around. She - next time she comes in I'm cranking that thing down to 54, 53, it's going to totally rattle her. She'll never be able to come and boss me around again.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: I'm going to freeze her out of this office, yes, she never want to come in.
MONTGOMERY: Is there something to this study? Do you like a warm or cold?
PERINO: I like - well, my grandfather used to say that the women in the household liked it at 72 degrees and we were just right, 73 we were too hot and 71 we were too cold, so it's very hard to keep it just down --
MONTGOMERY: Well, there is a Goldilocks temperature.
PERINO: It is. But technology is helping figure this out. A lot of cars on now - brand new cars, you didn't say that you've got--
MONTGOMERY: Dual climate control.
PERINO: Yes. You've got heated seat, if you like that. I don't like heat in my face, so I like --
WATTERS: You don't?
MONTGOMERY: Not since the prom. Greg.
GUTFELD: Oh, my God. Terrible. You know what, we're just dancing - we're dancing around the major part of this that men and women are biologically different.
PERINO: How dare you--
GUTFELD: Yes, women metabolic rate is 23% lower, maybe because they have far less muscle mass, and that and they evaporate less heat through their skin pores and so their hands and their feet are also, what, three degrees colder.
PERINO: Until menopause?
GUTFELD: They have lower skin temperatures and yet we must pretend at all costs, especially in the media, that sex differences are fabricated by a sexist culture.
MONTGOMERY: But what does it mean? So I've always liked cold water. I love swimming and cold water - ocean--
PERINO: Oh, no.
GUTFELD: You're weirdo. You're just weird.
MONTGOMERY: And on my show on the Fox Business Network, a weeknights at 9:00 p.m. Eastern 6:00 in the West, I keep the temperature icy cold.
WATTERS: Well, it's also good to keep the temperature really cold, because it forces women to cuddle with you. So then they need body warmth--
MONTGOMERY: But not--
PERINO: Not office--
WATTERS: Not at the office. That's frowned up on.
MONTGOMERY: Well, unless you're Joe Biden. Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, I - but I want to say --
WATTERS: Juan - one time I left you speechless, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Because, you know - my wife is always telling me, open the window, turn on the AC and I'm like what? It's hot in here, what are you doing?
GUTFELD: Juan is there, he's hot in there.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But I must say, look at this set, got three guys, two women, right? And everybody performs very well at this temperature. But you always hear complaints from the women it's too warm.
GUTFELD: You know what's funny? I remember Jesse saying something--
MONTGOMERY: Too cold.
WILLIAMS: Too cold - sorry too cold.
GUTFELD: --did you say this on “The Five” that you do not like sweaters?
WATTERS: Yes, I think sweaters are--
GUTFELD: Emasculating?
PERINO: You didn't want it for Christmas.
WATTERS: No, here is what. I think you don't need sweaters in 2019 anymore, because when you go outside you wear a jacket when you come inside you have modern day heating. You don't need that second layer in most places.
MONTGOMERY: But what about - being handsome and elegant?
WATTERS: Well, for people that are into fashion, perhaps. But I mean in terms of utility --
GUTFELD: I think you think sweaters are emasculating like that men--
WATTERS: Well, you look silly when you have a little collar and a little sweater. It is silly look.
WILLIAMS: Oh, my god. But you know you can wear a sweater outside.
WATTERS: Yes, you can.
WILLIAMS: Oh, OK.
PERINO: I like men in sweaters.
MONTGOMERY: OK.
GUTFELD: Not cardigans.
MONTGOMERY: Mr. Rogers not only had 735 confirmed kills in Vietnam.
GUTFELD: Did he?
MONTGOMERY: No.
WATTERS: Retweet.
MONTGOMERY: But that isn't debunked (ph), but it's a great urban myth. He also big cardigan fan.
WATTERS: Big cardigan fan.
GUTFELD: Well, of course.
PERINO: Well, nobody like the cardigan really. I mean we're talking a crewneck.
WATTERS: Crewneck, I can --
MONTGOMERY: Oh, I love it--
WATTERS: Crewneck is debatable. The V-necks, no way, but here's the other thing.
GUTFELD: Wait on, what's wrong with the V-necks?
WATTERS: You know what's wrong. So --
MONTGOMERY: What your veins are exposed to vampires? What's wrong with the V-necks?
WATTERS: Sometimes people are cheap, like in New England, and they don't want to have high heating bills, like my parents, so they keep it at like 64 in December and then it freezes everybody and then they make actually make fires. They make fires in the house.
WILLIAMS: By the way, have you been in the gym recently?
WATTERS: What are you saying Juan?
WILLIAMS: Women are all complaining - women complain that it's too hot in the gym and I'm like, dude you want to get hot--
GUTFELD: That's not the problem at the gyms these days. It's who goes to which bathroom.
WATTERS: That's right, biologically different.
PERINO: I don't see gender.
GUTFELD: Yes, I don't see gender.
MONTGOMERY: Yes, I like to see gender in the sauna.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
MONTGOMERY: I choose my own adventure and go to the gym. "One More Thing" is up next, lucky for all of us. Stay right here.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Time now for "One More Thing". Jesse?
WATTERS: You remember "Fan Mail Friday" just this past Friday?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I want to address something. Here's the discussion. Roll it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: What was your most memorable experience with law enforcement?
KATIE PAVLICH, PANELIST: Oh, no.
WATTERS: I got pulled over by a cop and I thought I was speeding, but he just wanted a picture with me.
GUTFELD: No, he didn't.
WATTERS: Swear to god. It was Michigan.
MONTGOMERY: I don't believe that.
WATTERS: I swear to god.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right, so Gutfeld said that I was a bold-faced liar. Guess what Gutfeld, I got a Facebook message from the police officer, Lieutenant Bob Latent (ph).
PERINO: Oh, Bobby.
WATTERS: And he told me tell Greg, my employer can't touch me now, because I'm retired. All right? And the county magistrate even had the picture hung up in her office. All right. So Bob thanks for reaching out. There were are together in Michigan.
GUTFELD: Oh, geez, please.
PERINO: But other police officers, please don't get the idea - I might have a heart attack, if I got pulled over.
GUTFELD: Oh, my goodness.
PERINO: All right, Greg.
GUTFELD: All right. So another Gutfeld Monologues. Throw up the little thing there. It's going to be another great show, Tom Shillue, July 20th at the Paramount Theater, Asbury Park, New Jersey. I hope you guys will come.
PERINO: Oh, fine.
MONTGOMERY: Great theater.
GUTFELD: Yes, it is a great theater. The Gutfeld Monologues, go to ggutfeld.com to buy tickets. They're going to sell out rather fast. All right, now it's time for something new?
"Greg It's Just A Doughnut News" OK. So Hostess - put up this Hostess tweet. This really got my chow. All right, I don't even know what that means.
MONTGOMERY: That's a phrase.
GUTFELD: It says "New Jumbo Donettes for breakfast individually wrapped so you can throw one in your satchel and go". OK. Jumbo Donettes is a doughnut.
PERINO: Yes
GUTFELD: When you enlarge something that is miniature, it becomes normal size, so don't call it Jumbo Donettes. Call it a damn doughnut, because that's what it is. It's just a doughnut.
WATTERS: Doughnut singles.
GUTFELD: Doughnut singles. I'm so tired of the lies.
WATTERS: I like the idea with the packaging.
GUTFELD: You do?
WATTERS: That's really smart.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Doughnut singles, sounds like a bar you would go to.
PERINO: I don't know.
WATTERS: All you can eat Greg.
GUTFELD: Doughnut singles, a dating club.
PERINO: OK. So I had the pleasure maybe sitting a dog named Spike. That might have seen him around Fox News.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: So he's the yellow lab there. He is a companion dog. Well, he is in training, OK. So he is the dog of my producer Jennifer Williams. She had a little procedure done this weekend, so he came with us for five days and was fun having the two dogs.
Now he has different rules from Jasper. Like, he can't get on the furniture. He can't have any human food. But we all worked - we worked it out. He had a little vacation. There's Peter with him at the beach. It was a lot of fun.
WATTERS: Were those rollback scarfs on, and they loved that. That's the lighthouse toy. That did not last long after - there's Jasper had enough of all of that. But it was really funny in canine companions. They're going to get a good dog in him. He goes to intensive training on August 9th, so just a couple of more months, so it's been fun to have him.
GUTFELD: Does he have any outstanding loans?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: No, I think he's going to be just fine. He's little - we have loaned our hearts. Juan?
GUTFELD: That's gross.
WILLIAMS: All right, so what's the difference between a tadpole and a salamander? Well, granddad found out this Memorial Day weekend on a family trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains, West Virginia. My daughter who's on the Board of the National Park Trust took us to George Washington National Forest.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: On the trip the grandkids decided to scoop up little animals with their bare hands from the edge of the pond. So when I said hurt the tadpoles, they scream pop up those are salamanders, you idiot.
Here I am with Eli (ph), at the edge of the pond. There was also time for making a fire. Here are Morgan and Raffy (ph) taken the lead on getting the fire going. And here I am with my wife against the beautiful backdrop of what you remember this, John Denver famously described as, "Almost Heaven West Virginia".
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You went to a George Washington Park?
WILLIAMS: What's wrong with that Greg?
GUTFELD: I don't know. We'll talk about it later.
WATTERS: I thought you guys were going to wear the same outfit.
WILLIAMS: Yes. No, that's when we--
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Kennedy bring us home.
MONTGOMERY: Absolutely, right. There are three things that I love.
PERINO: OK.
MONTGOMERY: The national anthem.
PERINO: Yes.
MONTGOMERY: Vets and the Harmonica. A 96-year-old World War II vet, named "Harmonica Pete". He serenaded the audience the - all those in attendance in Harrison New Jersey at the Red Bulls stadium for the U.S. women's soccer game. It was a match between the U.S. and Mexico, and the U.S. women destroyed them.
And here is "Harmonica Pete"-- Pete DuPre. He has thrown down the national anthem on this instrument. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MONTGOMERY: That man is a patriot, the poise, the control. He served as a medic in the 114th General Hospital Unit in Kidderminster England during World War II.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I "Harmonica Pete" better than Mayor Pete.
MONTGOMERY: He is actually -- he's actually running against --
PERINO: Hey, you know, Mayor Pete implied playing the harmonica, too. He can do everything else. All right, never miss an episode of “The Five.” We love having you. "Special Report" is up next.
Hey, Bret.
