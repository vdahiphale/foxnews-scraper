CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.The Democratic-controlled Congress is one step closer to passing COVIDrelief, delivering on President Biden's top campaign promise.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  Unity. Unity. Unity. That'show we got this done.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Passed.WALLACE (voice-over):  So what's in the package for struggling Americans,schools, and businesses?JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Everything in thispackage is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgentneeds of the nation.WALLACE:  While Republicans question whether this is emergency relief or aDemocratic wish list.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER:  The most progressivedomestic legislation in a generation.WALLACE:  We'll talk with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who has staked outa position as the most powerful member of Congress.Then --GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R), TEXAS:  It is now time to open Texas 100 percent.WALLACE:  Governors in both parties and pandemic lockdowns and thepresident pushes back.BIDEN:  The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking.WALLACE:  We'll ask Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson about starting to liftrestrictions in his state and former CDC Director Tom Frieden about whethersome states are moving too soon.Plus, growing calls to impeach New York's governor over his handling ofCOVID nursing home deaths and accusations of sexual harassment. We'll askour Sunday panel whether Cuomo will survive the twin scandal.And our Power Player of the Week, the head of Peloton on how the pandemicgave his bikes a big push.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday." (MUSIC)(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.President Biden's push for his $1.9 trillion COVID relief package is now inthe home stretch after the Senate approved the measure Saturday in astraight party line 50-49 vote. The legislation includes funding forvaccine supplies and distribution, along with a new round of stimulus forfamilies, businesses, and state and local governments.Democrats hope to get the bill through the House and put it on thepresident's desk before some benefits expire a week from today.In a moment, we'll speak with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin who votedfor the bill after reaching a deal late Friday over unemployment aid.But first, let's bring in Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill with what happensnext.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BIDEN:  It's a good day today.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President Biden is astep away from a major legislative accomplishment, but recognizes he mustkeep his fellow Democrats together as it heads back to the House.BIDEN:  As Bernie Sanders said, this is the most progressive bill he'd everseen pass in history since he's been here.EMANUEL:  The legislation is so large, it's $1.9 trillion in spending isnearly one-tenth of the U.S. economy.SCHUMER:  Nobody said passing one of the largest, perhaps the mostsignificant bill to help the poor and working people in decades was goingto be easy.EMANUEL:  And it wasn't. It took more than 24 hours to pass the legislationin the Senate and last-minute negotiations to get West Virginia Senator JoeManchin on board. Now $300 in enhanced on employment benefits will be paidthrough Labor Day.Republicans unanimously rejected the massive funding package but could notstop it.MCCONNELL:  The Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more haphazard wayor through a less rigorous process.(END VIDEOTAPE)EMANUEL (on camera):  The House is expected to take up this legislation onTuesday. Democrats there can only lose four votes and still pass it. So,leadership will seek to move swiftly to send it to the president's desk forhis signature -- Chris.WALLACE:  Mike Emanuel reporting from Capitol Hill -- Mike, thanks forthat.And joining us now, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who's become the keyswing vote in Congress.Senator, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday."SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV):  Hey, Chris. It's always good to be with you.Thank you for having me.WALLACE:  On Friday, you held up this COVID relief package for the betterpart of ten hours over a dispute on unemployment benefits.Were you really prepared to tank this bill, President Biden's toplegislative priority, if you didn't get what you wanted?MANCHIN:  Absolutely not. That's not how negotiations should go and thatshould never be the intent of anybody. There was nothing that I wanted morethan to have a balanced bill. And that is something that came into it atthe last minute. I thought it was something that more than what we everagreed on or intended.And when they talk about this being strictly a Democrat bill and nobipartisan, I worked with my colleagues and my friends on the Republicanside for the last month all the way through. A lot of the things I was ableto get into that bill and target the bill the way we talked about camebecause of negotiations at talks with my Republican and Democraticcolleagues.So when that happened, Chris, I just said hold on, if we stay at $300 forunemployment, it's seamless, no one misses a paycheck, not at all, andbasically, we were doing so much more with child tax credits, we werehelping every family and there's got to be a balance and I'm in that modernmiddle I guess, it's not real crowded, Chris, I can assure you, but we justtry to make it all come to fruition, and it did, and that's the waynegotiations should go.WALLACE:  Senator, if -- Senator, if you had all this Republican input intothe bill, if you've been talking to them for a month, why didn't any ofyour Republican colleagues vote for it? Was it just pure politics?MANCHIN:  No, it wasn't just my politics or Democrat politics. It was maybea little bit more than what they thought they could have done on the amountof money that was going in investing. What we were able to target, westrung it out.We didn't just throw it all at one time, so we were able to say, okay,first time in history, now a little town or community or county, whereverit be in America, can have some control of their destiny fixing water andsewer, Internet service. It's going to go out to 2024 on that, the tranchesof money going out helping people long term, fixing the school systems,making them safe, all the things.There might have been more than what they thought was needed at this time,but truly, they had input with me and they knew that, and we workedtogether, Democrats and Republicans, until the final passage and then itwas  my -- more than what maybe they could have voted and supported, butthey did have input, I can assure you.WALLACE:  But let's talk about the bill and this question of the amount ofaid that you gave. The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office came outwith an estimate that the economy was down only $600 billion to $700billion because of the pandemic, and yet this bill gives $1.9 trillion,triple almost what the CBO says you really need.That raises the question, one, is this bill going to overheat the economyand create inflation? And two, as you point out, it isn't all just thisyear, it's out four, five, some of the money doesn't get spent until 2030.So, is this really COVID relief or is this a Democratic wish list?MANCHIN:  No. COVID relief is more than just the vaccines. The vaccine isthe most urgent thing we can do. Keeping people able to stay in their homesis absolutely as urgent as anything else we do, and we did all of that.COVID relief means are you going to be able to move on, have the economymove on as strong as you want to, not have a lapse in that? That's why wewere able to target it and move out some. I'm hoping economists look atthat too.President Biden was concerned because he was there in 2009, I was not. Iwas still governor at that time. When they do the Recovery Act and theythought they didn't do it quick enough.I basically reminded people, that was a financial collapse, this is ahealth care pandemic. It's much different. We will come out of this.I want to make sure the workforce is ever ready to go too, Chris, andthat's why we wanted to make sure that we didn't basically just throw everything at one time. We're going to make sure that we're recovering in 2022also so we don't have a lapse or a relapse.WALLACE:  But what about this argument that the economy is only down $700billion only, but it's down $700 billion and you're spending $1.9 trillion,and that you may end up overheating the economy and causing inflation, sir?MANCHIN:  Well, I hope we don't, I don't think we will because, again, as Isaid, we spread it out. We didn't throw (ph) it all at one time.They're saying we're going to spend $1.9 trillion on top of what we'vealready spent in his one year, there might be some concerns about that, orthere should be, I'm sure. I'm concerned now more about the debt that we'reaccumulating and we've been accumulating through all different types ofdifferent administrations.It's time to get our financial house in order, I'm in that modern -- middleand common sense is not real common sometimes in Washington but we can cometogether, we have too. So, we're watching this very carefully but I canassure you, we have helped every segment of society right now, more so thanever before with this piece of targeted legislation, and I'm going to bemonitoring and watching as close as long as my other friends will too.WALLACE:  You kept talking about the moderate middle, do you like being themost powerful member of Congress, the swing vote in a 50/50 Senate? Do youlike that, sir?MANCHIN:  No, I do not, and I did not lobby for this, did not seek it out.The bottom line is I am who I am and I'm always been that person, to try tofind the middle of common sense.My state of West Virginia expects that. They know me that -- they know meas that. They're good people, and we just try to do things in a rational,common sense way.So I've said this about power, Chris. I've seen people who have had powerthat have abused it, I've seen people that sought power that destroyedthemselves trying to get it and I've seen people that seize the moment.If I can seize this moment and start healing our country, helping ourpresident bring our country together, listening to all sides and making adecision that doesn't intend to harm anybody and don't play the tribalpolitics. It's just not who I am.And I can't -- I am who I am, I'm not going to change, and I think thathopefully people understand that and they give me the flexibility andunderstand that, and I appreciate that. I know it's difficult for somepeople to understand.This is who I am. I'm just Joe from West Virginia.WALLACE:  Well, let's talk about just Joe, because you have staked out thisposition and you were doing it in November right after the election. I wantto put up some of the positions you've taken, breaking with your party.You said early on, you would not be the 50th Democrat to end thefilibuster. You'd not be the 50th Democrat to pack the Supreme Court. Andso far, whether it's the $15 minimum wage or Neera Tanden's nomination,you've broken with your party.You just put up -- you just said the quote I was going to put it up on thescreen because you said it before about power and what it can do to people.The question I guess I have -- here's the quote: I have watched peopledestroyed -- watched power destroyed people, good people because theyabused it.Look, I love talking to you, Senator, but you are on four Sunday showstoday, and the question I have is, are you enjoying your position of powermay be a little too much?MANCHIN:  I sure hope not. Oh, my goodness. I would be -- that would behorrible. That's not, no.I want to make sure people understand, I am in that common sense middle,that's who I am. It happened to come down to 50/50, this doesn't happenthat often in our political posturing or governing, and I hope it doesn'tcome around again for a long time.We need to find a way to work together. That's all I'm trying to do. I'mnot taking advantage of any moment at all, but if I can seize the momentand make you understand, hold on, we're not going to just blow things up,we're not going to destroy the Senate the Founding Fathers decided would bethe most deliberate body unusual for any other form of government in theworld and the history has ever known.Seize the moment and fix what has gone wrong. Why do we go so right and soleft? We don't run our lives from the extreme. You always try to find thatmoderate middle to make decisions, to run your life, to enjoy your family,to make sure that you're able to prosper and move forward.You can't do that from the extremes, that's all and now we've pushed apart.Maybe social media, I don't know what's doing it but when people can talkabout people without looking them in the eye, shaking their hand and givingthem their word and that's who you are and stick with that, I don't know,maybe it's old-fashioned West Virginia. It's the way I was raised, Chris.WALLACE:  So, Senator, let me ask you one last question because goingforward, one of the things that you staked out very early on, I've only gotabout two minutes here -- MANCHIN:  OK.WALLACE:  -- is that you would not end the filibuster.The question I have is, would you consider if the Republicans just won't goalong with anything, reforming the filibuster? For instance, the filibusterdoesn't apply now to either budget rules, budget -- that's why you had thisreconciliation, budget issues, or to nominations.Would you consider extending exemptions to other issues? Or would youconsider going back to the old filibuster, sort of like Mr. Smith goes toWashington and Jimmy Stewart -- MANCHIN:  Yeah.WALLACE:  -- where you want to filibuster, it's not an automatic 60 votes.You've got to stay on the Senate floor and keep talking.MANCHIN:  The filibuster should be painful. It really should be painful.And we have -- we've made it more comfortable over the years, notintentionally, may it just evolved into that. Maybe it has to be morepainful. Maybe you have to stand there. There's things we can talk about.But, Chris, whenever you take away in the Senate the ability for theminority, however it may be, Democrats or Republicans to have input, why dohave two senators in Rhode Island and two senators in New York orCalifornia? Why is there one body that treats everyone, hopefully, theability to intervene, the ability to be involved, the ability to representno matter how large or small?That's so the big person doesn't take advantage of a smaller person or aperson in not just stature but in their position. That's what this is allabout. And I'm going to fight for that.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But just to be -- but just to be clear, with 30 seconds left -- MANCHIN:  Sure.WALLACE:  -- you would consider making it harder to invoke the filibusterso that you just don't automatically have 60 votes that you need for anylegislation?MANCHIN:  I'd make it harder to get rid of the filibuster. I'm supportingthe filibuster. I'm going to continue to support the filibuster.I think it defines who we are as a Senate. I'll make it harder to get ridof it but it should be painful if you want to use it. You should make surethe place works to where, okay, I want to work with you, how can we dothis, how do we move forward?My Republicans are my friends. They're not my enemies. And my Democrats ismy colleagues, they're not my enemy either. That's my caucus.Together, we've got to make this place work and it should be harder toinvoke pain. It should be painful for us, don't make it painful for theother side.WALLACE:  Senator Manchin, thank you. Thanks for your time after a verybusy few days, and we'll be watching the bill's progress on the Hill thisweek.MANCHIN:  Thank you, Chris. It's a great piece of legislation. It's goingto help Americans for a long time.WALLACE:  Thank again -- thanks to you again.Up next, some states are bucking the recommendations of public healthofficials and lifting COVID restrictions. We'll talk with one of thosegovernors when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  It's been a year since states started shutting down businesses,limiting gatherings and mandating masks and now, several states haveannounced those days are coming to an end.Joining us from Little Rock, Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson, vice chairof the National Governors Association and, Governor, welcome back to FoxNews Sunday.GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Great to be with you, Chris.WALLACE:  Last month, you changed your public health state directives toguidelines, changed them in effect from mandatory to optional so nowrestaurants, bars, gyms, and other businesses in Arkansas can be open evento 100 percent capacity. Why did you do that, sir?HUTCHINSON:  Well, you emphasized the key point, and that is that it's beena year. And during the course of the last year, we've educated the publicas to what's required on public health. Our businesses have taken the rightmeasures in place. We've had a mask mandate in place and there's just alimit as to how much the restrictions can be placed on business and for howlong. They've struggled, they've suffered, and so we wanted to give moreflexibility.It's not the immediate ending of everything. We still have our guidelinesin place and actually there is an incentive to keep control of thefacilities because that gives you business tort liability immunity if youfollow some of those guidelines, and so we're not having a cliff (ph) here.We keep the emergency in place, our mask mandate is in place until the endof the month and I asked our public health folks to give me specificcriteria as to when we can lift that and we agreed upon the criteria thatthe public knows that we can lift that mask mandate, hospitalization'sdown, vaccines going out, testing is in place, positivity rate down.WALLACE:  So I want to pick up on that, because while you have relaxed theopening of businesses, you are not ending the mask mandate until the end ofthis month and then only if the state stays under current COVID spreads --COVID numbers.Why didn't you go along with the governors of your neighboring states, ofTexas and Mississippi, which are ending the mask mandate right now?HUTCHINSON:  Well, this just reflects that governors can do it differentways. Flexibility, I think, is the model of our states. But for me andArkansas, I wanted to set a goal and give people hope that we can end themask mandate if we get to these -- this place and where we feel morecomfortable that our hospitalizations are still down, and so we wanted anoff-ramp, we didn't want a cliff. I wanted an off-ramp.So we set our goals and expectations, the public knows exactly what we haveto do to lift that mandate. Of course, it would be converted to a guidelineand I think masks are going to be with us for some time, but at some point,we have to rely upon common sense and good judgment versus mandates and,particularly, when it comes to our businesses. They want to be able to dothe right thing with their patrons and customers, but they want to be ableto have some flexibility and that's critically important and that's we'regiving them, hope and flexibility.WALLACE:  Governor, in this plan, which does make it no longer mandatory,in terms of the businesses to reopen 100 percent, you're going against theguidance of President Biden and his top public health officials. I want youto take a look at what they said this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantimeeverything is fine, take off your mask, forget it. It still matters.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR OF NIAID:  It really is quite risky tocompletely remove all of the public health measures and just act likethere's no virus in the community when we know it is at an unacceptablyhigh level.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor, why do you think that you know better than the experts?HUTCHINSON:  Well, of course, if you relied simply upon strict publichealth guidelines, they would love to have a shelter in place for a year,which we cannot do as a society, and so you have to balance what our publichealth dictates with the reality that we have to move, we have to get backto school.And President Biden is a perfect example of this. You know, he is leadingby encouraging people to take the virus seriously, but at the same time,he's saying vigorously, let's open our schools. Well, there's risks toopening the schools, but it's a risk that is very, very important becausewe need to have in-classroom instruction.And I'm proud of my state, of Arkansas, that we went back to school lastAugust and September with in-classroom instruction and then the presidentsays, we need to vaccinate all the teachers. Well, we did that. We movedthem up on our priority list early on. And so that's important forgovernors to be able to lead their state. It's -- and I don't think it'sfair to say it's Neanderthal-type thinking.The history of our country from the Boston Tea Party is freedom, protestingagainst over taxation, government control, and so it's pretty natural tohave a sensitivity to freedom-loving Americans that say, we'll do the rightthing, we know what to do, just give us our freedom back and lift some ofthese mandates.That's the nature of America and I understand that. That's not cavemanthinking, that's common sense.WALLACE:  But let me just press one more time on this issue of publichealth. There's no question that Arkansas is in much better shape than youwere during that big, terrible spike around the country in January butyou're still not out of the woods.And I want to put up the latest numbers on the situation in Arkansas. Theaverage of new cases in your state is 373 new cases per day.Hospitalizations, 420. And according to the CDC, Arkansas ranks 45th out ofthe 50 states in the number of COVID vaccinations per capita.Given all of that, Governor, is this the right time to take your foot offthe brake?HUTCHINSON:  It's a good question, and that's the reason we didn't end theemergency, that's the reason I have a ramp. If we see the cases spike up,if we see the hospitalizations go up, then we can reinstitute the maskmandate because it's a ramp, it goes until March 31st with specificguidelines. We can take the action that's needed.And so we're not out of the woods, but at the same time, the key ishospitalizations and because of improved therapeutics and because of thevaccines, because we have more people following guidelines and taking itseriously, we're in a pretty good position. If it goes the wrong direction,we can take the steps necessary. But people have to have hope.This has been a year and we have to give them hope that we can work our wayout of this emergency. We've got a good balance and a good plan inArkansas.WALLACE:  Finally, I want to get to this philosophical issue. I've only gotabout two minutes here, Governor.But you talk about freedom and I understand that and I understand peoplechafing at not being able to lead their own lives. But you know, we keepspeed limits and we keep seat belt laws even though people clearlyunderstand the benefits of both.Don't you worry that on the one hand yes, freedom, but on the other hand,this may change people -- when they get the word from the governor of thestate, you know, you can go back 100 percent and within a few weeks you'regoing to be able to take off your masks, that it may change people'sbehavior?HUTCHINSON:  We have to be careful about that, you're absolutely right andwe don't want to send the wrong signals. But whenever you look at thenecessity of these mandates and the business restrictions -- sure, we haveseat belt laws. That can be a permanent thing. But I don't think you wantto keep a business that put in an investment that they could be at 100percent capacity and you hold them at 50 percent or 75 percent. You have tobe able to give that flexibility in gyms, salons.And so lifting those restrictions, converting them to guidelines is a goodbalanced step that we can take. The mask mandate, people understand --right now people can protect themselves. If you go out and people aren'twearing a mask, keep your distance from them, you wear a mask. If you haverestaurants that are not following the guidelines, well go to a restaurantthat is following guidelines. People can make good decisions.WALLACE:  Governor, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. It's always goodto talk with you, sir.HUTCHINSON:  Thank you, Chris. Great to be with you today.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll get reaction to what some states are doing fromthe former head of the CDC, Dr. Tom Frieden joins us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, the Biden administration is taking heat for a surge ofunaccompanied minors at the border.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We believe that the humaneapproach is to treat this kids with humanity and -- and insure that theyhave a safe place to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the fallout from the president'simmigration policies. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: As states lift restrictions a year into the pandemic lockdowns,are some of them moving too quickly?Joining us now, Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for DiseaseControl.Doctor, you just heard Governor Hutchinson talk about lifting mandatoryrestrictions in his state. You see with the governors of Texas andMississippi are doing, both on restrictions for businesses and they arealso lifting the mask mandates this week.Your reaction to all of that.DR. TOM FRIEDEN, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR: Well, first off, I think, Chris, itis true, we are really sick and tired of this virus. And there's a lot ofgood news coming. More vaccines, more people getting vaccines, more optionsfor vaccines and really good data that vaccination is making a bigdifference. So I would make a big distinction between reopening the economyand lifting mask mandates. One of them you could debate. The other issimply wrong.WALLACE: Well, explain that a little bit.FRIEDEN: Sure.WALLACE: Clearly you think that opening businesses is -- is debatable but -- but lifting the mask mandates is flat wrong?FRIEDEN: That's right. And -- and this is the way to think about it. Thereare a lot of harms to closing businesses, not just economic harms,educational harms when it comes to schools, personal hardship, health harmsfrom people not having work. So it's really important to get our economyopen again as safely as possible.Now, I wouldn't necessarily open everything. For example, an indoor stadiumwith people coming from all over, that's a really bad idea.On the other hand, masks, you know, the only freedom a mask inhibits is thefreedom of the virus to spread and kill people. Masks work. Mask mandateswork. And lifting mask mandates is very dangerous, particularly with therisk of more dangerous variants emerging and spreading.WALLACE: But let's talk about this, because this isn't just Mississippi andTexas. There's a push in this area across the country. I'm going to put uptwo maps for you to take a look at, Doctor. The first one is, this week, 16states, all run by Republican governors across the south and the Midwestand some of the Rocky Mountains states, 16 states all run by Republicangovernors will either have lifted mask mandates or never had them. And all50 states, all 50 run by Republican and Democratic governors, will beeither mostly or partly open for business, and some of them at 100 percentcapacity.Is that -- clearly on the masks you think it's too much too soon. On theopening businesses, are you concerned that that's moving too fast,particularly 100 percent capacity in -- in gyms and restaurants and bars?FRIEDEN: Well, interestingly, Chris, those two things are related. If youkeep a mask mandate in place, you'll be able to open more and be morelikely to keep it open without risk to people, not just to other customers,but the workers there as well.I do worry about restaurants and bars where people may be speaking loudlywithout masks on. And you really do have to focus -- you know, the governorsaid, well, if you don't want to go into a restaurant where people aren'twearing masks, you can go to a different restaurant, not if you're thewaiter. If you're the waiter, yes, you can wear a mask but you're mustsafer if the customers wear a mask when they're not eating, obviously, andyou wear a mask.So mask mandates are a way of preserving our health and our economy.WALLACE: Doctor, as we said in -- in the last segment, President Biden iscoming down pretty hard on -- on these governors who are -- are relaxingrestrictions. His famous phrase this week "Neanderthal thinking." But theday after Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, noted that with a lot ofpeople right now coming across the border illegally into this country, that108 people who had been released in Brownsville, Texas, had tested positivefor the COVID virus and Governor Abbott continued on with this.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): The Biden administration was exposing Texans toCOVID. That is a Neanderthal-type approach to dealing with the COVIDsituation.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Doctor, is this the right time to be relaxing immigrationrestrictions and allowing more people to come across the border and morepeople to be released into the country when you're in the midst of a publichealth crisis?FRIEDEN: Well, let's get the numbers straight here. The United States hasmore than 50,000 cases a day diagnosed and probably two or three times thatmany actually occurring every day. The vast majority, 99.999 percent of theinfections spread in the U.S. arise in the U.S.Let's focus on getting our house in order. And we can do that by maskingup, doubling down on protection protocols, vaccinating the moment it's yourturn. And as we do that, Chris, over the next few months, we will get to amuch safer situation, we will get to a new normal.But I think masks are going to be a part of that normal for many months tocome. That's the sensible thing to do, to get our kids back in school,people back to work, and our economy moving again.WALLACE: But I -- you talk about the fact that we're headed in the rightdirection. I want to put up some video on the screen because, as you wellknow, this is spring break time and there are a lot of young people who areflocking to Florida, congregating on beaches. This is one of the moresedate -- ah, this is a bitter picture of people in bars at spring break.Does that worry you? Is this your worst nightmare?FRIEDEN: It does worry me.Chris, what we'd seen every time there's been a holiday with peopletraveling and mixing, we've seen a big surge in cases after. Right now the-- the main question that we have to know is, is there going to be a fourthsurge in this country or not? We've had three deadly surges. Will we have afourth? And the answer to that -- the answer to that is something we cancontrol by masking up and avoiding sharing indoor air with people not inyour household.WALLACE: Dr. Frieden, thank you. Thanks for joining us. Please come back,sir.FRIEDEN: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, calls for impeachment grow over New York Governor AndrewCuomo's nursing home scandal and allegations of sexual harassment. Can hesurvive? We'll ask our Sunday group.That's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): It was unintentional and I truly and deeplyapologize for it.CHARLOTTE BENNETT, CUOMO ACCUSER: I thought, he's trying to sleep with me.The governor is trying to sleep with me. And I'm deeply uncomfortable and Ihave to get out of this room as soon as possible.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responding to allegations of sexualharassment and Charlotte Bennett, who is one of now four women who accuseCuomo of inappropriate behavior as a third former aide came forward lateyesterday.And it's time now force our Sunday group. Marc Short, former chief of staffto Vice President Mike Pace , Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for theAssociated Press, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, Governor Cuomo -- let's put up on the screen all of the problems hefaces because it is not just these allegations of sexual harassment nowfrom four women. He also faces federal and state investigations of whetherhis office covered up the number of nursing home residents who died ofCOVID and the state legislature just voted to strip Cuomo of emergencypowers in the pandemic.Julie, what are you hearing from top Democrats, both in Washington and inNew York, about Cuomo and all of his problems?JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, Cuomo doesn'thave a lot of allies among Democrats right now, not a lot of peoplerallying around him to support him in this moment. But you also aren'tseeing a lot of Democrats, with a couple of exceptions, calling for hisresignation. The party line at the moment is basically, let's let thisindependent investigation of these sexual misconduct allegations moveforward. We feel that these are inappropriate actions on the part of thegovernor, but we want to see what comes out of this investigation.I do think that this is Democrats and society at large grappling with wherethe line is right now. What is an action that is so inappropriate, that isso egregious that a public official can no longer stay in office.But I do think to your -- to your opening here, I think it's important tonote that Cuomo is not just facing these sexual misconduct allegations. The-- the allegations of cooking the books essentially on nursing home deathsis really serious and I think that gets to the heart of just his overallleadership of the -- of the state of New York through this pandemic and Ithink you're going to increasingly see a lot of attention focused in thatdirection as well.WALLACE: Marc, you spend enough time in Washington, and I -- I hate to becynical about it, you get a pretty good sense of how these scandals aregoing to play out and whether the person at the center of them is going tosurvive or not.What's your sense of this scandal -- actually two scandals?MARC SHORT, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MIKE PENCE: Yes, well, Chris, I thinkthat the sexual harassment allegations are serious and should beinvestigated. But probably on the -- on the nursing home, a little moreknowledge because of our relationship during -- managing the crisis. And Ithink that the -- the -- the lack of leadership is really shocking here andI think the cover-up is very serious.The reality is that Governor Cuomo sent sick COVID patients back intonursing homes and infected other people and lives were lost because ofthose decisions. It's hard to think of any state that received more federalassistance during COVID than New York from the Trump-Pence administration.Whether or not that was ventilators or refurbishing the stockpiles, it wasalso basically the federal government creating a hospital in the JavitsCenter, sending the USS Comfort up to New York to be in the harbor foradditional beds. There were all sorts of options he had. He made a wrongdecision and now there are allegation he actually covered up and lied aboutthe number of COVID deaths that actually occurred within the nursing homesbecause of his decisions.Those are incredibly serious allegations and I -- I think he's on a verytenuous standing.WALLACE: Juan, and I think Marc Short is a pretty good example of that,Democrats are having a field day with the problems that Cuomo is having.First of all, they say liberals were far too slow to recognize that Cuomomade a serious mistake when he issued this directive that seniors who werein nursing -- or were in hospitals should be sent back to nursing homes.And then there's the whole question of cooking the books. And they alsonote the fact that, you know, it wasn't so long ago that liberals weresaying, you know, if a woman accuser comes forward -- they certainly saidthis about Brett Kavanaugh, she must be believed. Now they're a littleslower to say that, maybe a lot slower to say it when it comes to AndrewCuomo.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think on the nursinghome scandal, I think you would know that the New York Assembly, statesenator as well, they've limited Governor Cuomo's powers right now withregard to how the pandemic is handled. So they're raining him in. They'reholding him to a higher level of accountability.And, by the way, I think that's just bad decision-making. I don't know thatthere's anything illegal. Clearly people died and there's a terrible pricefor all families who lost a loved one to pay, but it was a decision. So, Imean, I'm still curious as to what exactly anyone could say that was doneillegally.But on the sexual-harassment side, you have the New York attorney general,a Democrat, by the way, who is now going to have an independentinvestigation with subpoena power for documents and for witnesses, Chris. Ithink the pressure for that independent probe, by the way, came from bothsenators, both Democrats. It also came from New York's mayor, Bill deBlasio, who is no friend to Governor Cuomo and, again, members of the stateassembly and state senate.So, you're seeing a lot of Democrats who I think are resistant to the ideaof a fourth term for Governor Cuomo and who see him as a bully and who'srun them over, Democrats I'm talking about, who are saying, you know, maybenot now. I would also add that if you look at the latest Quinnipiac polldone this week after both scandals had emerged, most New Yorkers are notcalling on him to resign. They don't want him to run again, but they're notcalling on him to resign right now.So I think we have to keep all this in mind and also, I would say, youknow, I don't see any independent investigation of Donald Trump and hefaced far more serious charges of sexual assault, you know, even more thanthat, and I don't see those kinds of calls coming from Republicans.WALLACE: Well, I -- I -- yes, but on the other hand I don't know that wecould say that Donald Trump went uninvestigated over the course of his fouryears in the presidency between the special counsel and two impeachments.Anyway, let's move on to this quite serious question about this surge ofunaccompanied minors across the border.The Biden administration seems determined to kind of play it down.Take a look at this exchange this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Do you believe that right now there's a crisis of the border?ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: I think that the -- theanswer is no. I think there is a challenge at the border that we aremanaging and we have our resources dedicated to -- to managing it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Julie, the Department of Homeland Security put out a report thisweek. It wasn't put out to the republic, but it was leaked, that they arenow projecting 117,000 unaccompanied minors that are going to cross theborder this year, way over what we thought was a very serious surge in2019.Is that sustainable for the -- for the Biden White House to say, well, it'snot a crisis, it's a challenge, we're managing it, and -- and, moreimportantly, do they really have a plan to get this under control?PACE: Well, they don't have a plan at the moment to get this under control.We do know that the White House is dispatching some officials to the borderto try to see this situation firsthand. But, right now, they're caught inthis situation where they are saying that the policy steps that we've seenBiden take on emigration, essentially rolling back a lot of the Trumpadministration's deterrence policies should not be read by migrants as anopen invitation. Do not mass at the border. This does not mean you can getacross easily.But for all of their talk about that, all of their messaging on it, that'snot the message that is actually being received by a lot of migrants and soyou do have this situation where people are increasingly coming to theborder, families with young children do feel like this is a moment wherethey can get into the United States. They do feel like there's going to bea more receptive policy from the Biden administration.So this is the challenge that the White House has. If they don't think thattheir policy actually is an open invitation, then they have to signal thatmore clearly because that is -- that is, obviously, not the way it is beinginterpreted at the moment.WALLACE: Marc, in its zeal to reverse Trump policies that they are happy tocall inhumane, and that's one of the more -- the milder words being used atthe White House podium these days, has the Biden White House gone too far?SHORT: Chris, they're absolutely rolling out a red carpet for illegals tocome into the United States. And the reality is, it is a humanitariancrisis. And, as you mentioned, in the last couple months alone, it's the --the numbers of migrants reaching the border is three times what it was andit's only going up. It's going to get worse by the end of the spring.One of the things that the Trump-Pence administration did was a remain inMexico policy that required migrants to stay in Mexico as their asylumclaims were adjudicated.Now, by rescinding that, basically immigrants are about to walk freely intoour country and the numbers are going to continue to increase. You're goingto continue to see the using of human trafficking, of taking young kids,unaccompanied minors, to the borders is going to continue to increase.And just think about your last segment. The reality is right now if you'rean American citizen and you have to -- you have to fly back in the UnitedStates, you're required to get tests, but if you walk up to our border asan illegal, you're allowed to come straight in without any COVID test.That's something that Governor Abbott pointed out in your last segment.WALLACE: I've got about 20 seconds, Juan. Your thoughts about this? Isn'tthe Biden administration leaving itself open to a real problem at theborder?WILLIAMS: I think we do have a real problem at the border, Chris. I thinkthe biggest change in policy is halting the immediate expulsion ofunaccompanied minors. And the -- the Biden administration is simply tryingto have a more humane, rapid processing response.WALLACE: But they got some problems at this point. We'll see what happens.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week," the man behind the fitness machinethat's helping millions stay in shape during the pandemic lockdown.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: During this last year of pandemic lockdown's, the popularity ofone home fitness product has exploded.Here is our "Power Player of the Week."(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOHN FOLEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, PELOTON: I honestly pinch myself.
