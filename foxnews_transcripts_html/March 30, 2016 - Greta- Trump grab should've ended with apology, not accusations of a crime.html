Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: The incident between Donald Trump's campaign manager seems like a routine pushing and shoving dustup that should have been resolved with apologies, not allegations of a crime 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record." This has gotten way out of hand. A media scrum around a presidential candidate Donald Trump with routine pushing, and shoving ended with an allegation of a crime.
Now, whatever happened in the scrum, and I don't think the video or eyewitness statement is convincing, this incident never should have ended up as a crime. It should have ended with an apology. I'm talking about "Grab-gate" or "Pinch-gate," whatever you want to call it. Reporter Michelle Fields and the scrum around Donald Trump trying to get a soundbite from him was grabbed, pinched, resulting in bruising. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Fields said Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, did it intentionally. Yes, of course, grabbing someone accidentally, or even intentionally, is not so nice. But is this one a crime? Plus, don't forget court dockets are already so overcrowded and now it has been blown up even more. And 16 women in the media, some reporters, some analysts, signing a letter calling on Trump to fire Lewandowski. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Two things. One, Lewandowski hasn't even had a trial and they're calling for his head. Yes, they have tried and convicted him. And second, each of these women has now shot herself in the foot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How can any one of them continue to cover the presidential race by not waiting for the DA's decision to trial the case or not, or wait for a jury verdict? But instead, they have come out swinging, taking sides in such a public way. It may be a hard sell for each of these women now covering this election to say she is fair.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.  </pre>
