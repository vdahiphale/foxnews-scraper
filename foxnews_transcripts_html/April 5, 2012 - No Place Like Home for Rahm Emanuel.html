Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

White House spokesman Bill Burton responded to a question today about President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel potentially leaving to run for mayor of Chicago -- answering, "There's going to be a decision pretty soon, but right now Rahm is focused on making sure that the White House is run in the most effective way possible for the American people." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Emanuel may have a hard time moving back into his home in Chicago, if and when he decides to run for mayor. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Chicago Sun-Times reports the tenant living in Emanuel's North Side home has refused to budge. Just six days before Mayor Daley announced his retirement, the tenant extended the lease of Emanuel's home from September 1st of this year to June 2011. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The report suggests Emanuel will not have a problem with residency in a bid to run for mayor, but one election expert says: "You can bet it's going to be challenged."
Unhappy Meals 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In San Francisco, a vote on an ordinance aimed at making Happy Meals healthier has been postponed. The legislation would require fast-food meals with toys to have fruits and vegetables and not have excessive calories, fat, sodium and sugar.
McDonald's franchise owners claim they already offer healthy options and this proposal would undermine parental choice and responsibility. Even if the measure passes, Mayor Gavin Newsom has indicated he'd veto it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Different Strokes 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And finally, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's new colleagues at CNN took a lot of shots at the Democrat back when he was infamous as "Client Number Nine" in the prostitution scandal that forced him out of office.
Here's just a small sample of what was said in March of 2008.
Anderson Cooper -- "It seems like Eliot Spitzer, according to allegations, was spending a fair amount of time on his job figuring out ways to hire hookers." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jack Cafferty -- "Sometimes these moralistic, holier-than-thou, self-righteous folks get caught up -- hoisted on their own petard."
And John Roberts said, "His reputation is ruined and he could lose his job. Could the next stop for Eliot Spitzer be prison?"
Apparently not. His next stop is to co-host a show on CNN.  </pre>
