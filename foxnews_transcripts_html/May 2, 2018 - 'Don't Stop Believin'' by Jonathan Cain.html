When Jonathan Cain and the iconic band Journey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Cain could say he had finally arrived. But Cain's journey wasn't always easy - and his true arrival in life had more to do with faith than fame.
  
As a child, Cain survived a horrific school fire that killed nearly 100 of his classmates. His experience formed a resilience that would carry him through both tragedy and success. Moving from Chicago to Sunset Boulevard, Cain never let go of his dreams, eventually getting his big break with Journey - and writing the songs that would become the soundtrack of a generation.

Don’t Stop Believin’ is an epic story of one man's dream that takes you from playing old-country songs at an Italian Deli in Chicago and his experiences with a warm, encouraging father who died too soon, to suddenly writing mega-bestselling songs with some of the most talented musicians and performers ever to take the stage of some of the world's largest arenas. The song "Don't Stop Believin'" is the most downloaded song of all time, and is one that has been covered by major televisions shows and adopted by a whole new generation.
