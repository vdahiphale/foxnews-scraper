Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sacred Cow
Some advocacy groups are calling on a co-chairman of President Obama's debt commission to resign over a specific phrase he used to describe Social Security. The National Older Women's League calls Alan Simpson's comments offensive and sexist. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Simpson was responding to an April article critical of his position on Social Security. Simpson wrote: "Yes, I've made some plenty smart cracks about people on Social Security who milk it to the last degree... we've reached a point now where it's like a milk cow with 310 million tits!" 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Earlier Wednesday, Simpson apologized to the director for his comments saying he's put his size 15 feet in his mouth more than once before. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The American Way
The Obama administration has issued a report detailing its concerns about human rights in a certain country. China? Sudan? Iran? No, it's the United States. It's the first-ever U.S. report to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The State Department acknowledges in the report that some Americans -- particularly minorities -- are still victims of discrimination. The Bush administration refused to join the council over its alleged disproportionate criticism of Israel and over its membership that includes repressive regimes.
A Wall Street Journal editorial is critical of this new report on the U.S. -- "The report devolves into a celebration of the liberal governance and Mr. Obama's policies repairing the basic injustice of American life" -- it cites health care and financial reform and the attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Party Crasher 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
South Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Alvin Greene was kicked out of a restaurant Tuesday after he tried to crash a local Democratic Party meeting.
The Associated Press reports police saying Greene's invitation to address party officials was rescinded after his felony indictment earlier this month. Greene still showed up and, according to witnesses, a female friend began to fight with other patrons, prompting a call to police.
Greene already faces charges for allegedly showing obscene photos to a college student. He also faces incumbent Republican Senator Jim DeMint in the general election this fall.  </pre>
