      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "sentences": "This is a Fox News Alert. Any moment now, the President will be addressing supporters in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Just before arriving, the President announced the departure of his acting DHS Secretary. He should have plenty to say tonight, too, about Ukraine, his 2020 rivals and who knows what else. It was a remarkable rally last night, we expect another tonight. We'll go to the President as soon as he begins to speak.  But in the meantime, good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” An update on the story we've been following for the last few days. So by day, Steve Kerr is the coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team in the State of California. But in his spare time, Kerr moonlights as a political pundit. He is always happy to share his hot take on American politics. He is like a one-man Twitter.  The President is a racist, he'll say and you have too many guns. When Steve Kerr talks like that, the people around him applaud. They think he is brave for saying things that not a single person in their world disagrees with.  It's the kind of bravery that echoes consensus and bows before power, which is to say it's not bravery at all. It's cowardice. Just the other day, someone asked Steve Kerr what he thinks of the government of China? The government has constructed the largest police state in the history of the human race. Maybe because the NBA does do a great deal with business in China, Kerr suddenly seem flummoxed by the question, fascism or democracy? It's a tough choice, he said, I don't want to weigh in.  But as Steve Kerr discovered last night, sometimes you don't have a choice. He was asked again about China, and this time he answered the question. Sure, he said, China has problems, but so does the United States. I mean, China is a racist ethno state that sends religious minorities to concentration camps and executes political prisoners to steal their organs. But in America, they sell guns at Walmart. Surely there's a moral equivalence there.",

The world is a complex place and there's more gray than black and white.",

      "sentences": "Some things aren't that gray though. Like putting Muslims in concentration camps by the hundreds of thousands. Steve Kerr in the NBA it turns out were made for each other, tailor made. The NBA epitomizes modern woke capital ruthlessness under the guise of compassion. So of course they employ Kerr who epitomizes the modern, mindless elite left.  Kerr is happy to trash his own country whenever he gets the chance. He gets to feel good doing it and gives up not one thing in return. He receives only accolades.   But when real evil stares him in the face, he has nothing to say. What's the difference? The difference is real evil is powerful and there are costs to opposing it. You can get hurt. There are also rewards for accepting it. Both Kerr and the NBA have made their choice very clear.  Earlier this week, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver claimed the NBA is ready to stand by free speech no matter what the consequences from China. He lapped up the subsequent praise from the press corps, which is no surprise. Our media loves to cover for China, too. But it was all a lie. Several NBA teams are currently on an exhibition tour in China right now. So that presents a rare opportunity. Unlike ordinary people, superstar NBA players can say whatever they want, they could speak their minds about China's regime. They could get attention and avoid consequences.  You're going to put some NBA player in jail? No. They had a golden opportunity to speak real truth to real power, but the NBA stopped them.  Today, the NBA announced that none of the players on the tour in China will be able to speak to the media for the rest of the trip. Wouldn't want any of them using their free speech the wrong way and criticizing their Chinese masters. They're all like this, by the way. The coach of the San Antonio Spurs, Gregg Popovich. He is aggressively political. He calls the President a soulless coward who brings up the dark side in human beings. Okay, whatever.  In 2016, he bragged that as an American, he was allowed to speak his mind on anything. Yes. That's absolutely right. But what is he using that free speech for? He is not using it at all.   When asked him about the NBA in China, which is a critical -- the critical issue as of today -- Popovich has nothing to say. Instead, he blasted Trump for his handling of the Jamal Khashoggi assassination last year, that's a non sequitur. I mean, whatever. But what does it have to do with China? Nothing. Why did he answer that? Well, because Saudi Arabia has a smaller basketball market than China does. So there's no risk. By the way, where's Dallas Mavericks' owner, Mark Cuban. He has never been afraid to speak his mind. He has got an interesting mind and a lot to say. He has come on this show at least once, maybe twice, to tell us what he thinks. But so far, he's had nothing at all to say about China and its control over the NBA.  So what does all of this prove? It proves what you've known for a long time. The ruling class is totally phony. They're weak and they're pathetic. And that's obvious now.  They talk a big game about human rights. We care about people. Happy to lecture you about democracy and about their own moral vitality. They are way more impressive than you are. But it was all a sham. They didn't mean a word of it. The single biggest threat to your freedoms right now as Americans is not Russia or Saudi Arabia or Iran or Donald Trump. No. The single greatest threat to your freedom right now, as you well know, we all know, is China. China is the threat, and anyone who thinks otherwise isn't simply clueless, they are an accomplice.   Jason Whitlock is actually willing to speak his mind. So naturally, he hosts FS One's \"Speak for Yourself,\" which he does. He joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. The NBA had this stumble a couple of days ago at the beginning of this story, this story about China, and you thought maybe they would recover and do the obvious, really the only thing which is to take the side of America, but they still haven't, why?",

Just before arriving, the President announced the departure of his acting DHS Secretary. He should have plenty to say tonight, too, about Ukraine, his 2020 rivals and who knows what else. It was a remarkable rally last night, we expect another tonight. We'll go to the President as soon as he begins to speak. But in the meantime, good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” An update on the story we've been following for the last few days. So by day, Steve Kerr is the coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team in the State of California. But in his spare time, Kerr moonlights as a political pundit. He is always happy to share his hot take on American politics. He is like a one-man Twitter. The President is a racist, he'll say and you have too many guns. When Steve Kerr talks like that, the people around him applaud. They think he is brave for saying things that not a single person in their world disagrees with. It's the kind of bravery that echoes consensus and bows before power, which is to say it's not bravery at all. It's cowardice. Just the other day, someone asked Steve Kerr what he thinks of the government of China? The government has constructed the largest police state in the history of the human race. Maybe because the NBA does do a great deal with business in China, Kerr suddenly seem flummoxed by the question, fascism or democracy? It's a tough choice, he said, I don't want to weigh in. But as Steve Kerr discovered last night, sometimes you don't have a choice. He was asked again about China, and this time he answered the question. Sure, he said, China has problems, but so does the United States. I mean, China is a racist ethno state that sends religious minorities to concentration camps and executes political prisoners to steal their organs. But in America, they sell guns at Walmart. Surely there's a moral equivalence there."

      "utterance": "It has not come up in terms of people asking me about it, people discussing it. No. Nor has our record of human rights abuses come up either. People in China didn't ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall. I wasn't asked that question. The world is a complex place and there's more gray than black and white."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Some things aren't that gray though. Like putting Muslims in concentration camps by the hundreds of thousands. Steve Kerr in the NBA it turns out were made for each other, tailor made. The NBA epitomizes modern woke capital ruthlessness under the guise of compassion. So of course they employ Kerr who epitomizes the modern, mindless elite left. Kerr is happy to trash his own country whenever he gets the chance. He gets to feel good doing it and gives up not one thing in return. He receives only accolades. But when real evil stares him in the face, he has nothing to say. What's the difference? The difference is real evil is powerful and there are costs to opposing it. You can get hurt. There are also rewards for accepting it. Both Kerr and the NBA have made their choice very clear. Earlier this week, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver claimed the NBA is ready to stand by free speech no matter what the consequences from China. He lapped up the subsequent praise from the press corps, which is no surprise. Our media loves to cover for China, too. But it was all a lie. Several NBA teams are currently on an exhibition tour in China right now. So that presents a rare opportunity. Unlike ordinary people, superstar NBA players can say whatever they want, they could speak their minds about China's regime. They could get attention and avoid consequences. You're going to put some NBA player in jail? No. They had a golden opportunity to speak real truth to real power, but the NBA stopped them. Today, the NBA announced that none of the players on the tour in China will be able to speak to the media for the rest of the trip. Wouldn't want any of them using their free speech the wrong way and criticizing their Chinese masters. They're all like this, by the way. The coach of the San Antonio Spurs, Gregg Popovich. He is aggressively political. He calls the President a soulless coward who brings up the dark side in human beings. Okay, whatever. In 2016, he bragged that as an American, he was allowed to speak his mind on anything. Yes. That's absolutely right. But what is he using that free speech for? He is not using it at all. When asked him about the NBA in China, which is a critical -- the critical issue as of today -- Popovich has nothing to say. Instead, he blasted Trump for his handling of the Jamal Khashoggi assassination last year, that's a non sequitur. I mean, whatever. But what does it have to do with China? Nothing. Why did he answer that? Well, because Saudi Arabia has a smaller basketball market than China does. So there's no risk. By the way, where's Dallas Mavericks' owner, Mark Cuban. He has never been afraid to speak his mind. He has got an interesting mind and a lot to say. He has come on this show at least once, maybe twice, to tell us what he thinks. But so far, he's had nothing at all to say about China and its control over the NBA. So what does all of this prove? It proves what you've known for a long time. The ruling class is totally phony. They're weak and they're pathetic. And that's obvious now. They talk a big game about human rights. We care about people. Happy to lecture you about democracy and about their own moral vitality. They are way more impressive than you are. But it was all a sham. They didn't mean a word of it. The single biggest threat to your freedoms right now as Americans is not Russia or Saudi Arabia or Iran or Donald Trump. No. The single greatest threat to your freedom right now, as you well know, we all know, is China. China is the threat, and anyone who thinks otherwise isn't simply clueless, they are an accomplice. Jason Whitlock is actually willing to speak his mind. So naturally, he hosts FS One's \"Speak for Yourself,\" which he does. He joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. The NBA had this stumble a couple of days ago at the beginning of this story, this story about China, and you thought maybe they would recover and do the obvious, really the only thing which is to take the side of America, but they still haven't, why?"

NBA, Steve Kerr, Gregg Popovich. The NBA answers to Nike. Nike is a $40 billion business. The NBA is an $8 billion business. President Obama, the basketball President, friendly relationship with the NBA, went to Nike's headquarters to announce his defense of the TPP. This thing is very simple. This is about money. This is about a President that won't cooperate with what Nike wants done. Nike is using the NBA and its leverage over the NBA to go after this guy because they disagree with him about his policies as it relates to trade in China. It's very simple."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITLOCK",
      "utterance": "Because most people are looking at the low-hanging fruit. Most people are trying to please their Twitter feed more than be journalists and just go look at the facts. And so American journalists, we're so addicted to Twitter and being retweeted and liked and going viral. And so smearing Trump and getting in a feud with Trump is the easiest way. And look, Nike does a hell of a job of managing its relationship with the American sports media. They do a hell of a job. They're very nice to the American sports media. Look, ESPN, they have a relationship with the NBA. They needed to be very successful. There's no real incentive to go look for the facts. And the facts are so obvious. I'm begging you, people watching at home, your producers, punch it into Google. It's all there. Obama, May 2015 at Nike's headquarters, why did he choose Nike's headquarters to announce your defense of the TPP? Go look it up where President Trump has been on the TPP. He is the guy against it. It all makes sense. It's all obvious."

You know, these comments by Steve Kerr were not only just offensive on their face, they're also stupid. It's stupid to compare U.S. gun ownership with the human rights abuses of the Chinese Communist Party. Give me a break. The other thing is that Steve Kerr should know better. This is a guy whose grandfather helped the Armenians during the genocide in 1915, who grew up in Beirut, whose father was assassinated by the PLO. He should know something and have something to say about authoritarian regimes and tyranny. His brother is a Chinese scholar, too. So he doesn't have any excuse for not -- he knows what's going on in China. Everyone at the NBA knows what's going on in China and now everybody in America who follows the NBA knows what's going on in China. But you know, it's not just the NBA.

And we need their wisdom, because we're just simple Americans who can't understand how bad our country is.

And I have to say no, that it is not. When it comes to Beto in revoking the tax exempt status of churches. I am a gay man. I am married. I love my husband, and if we couldn't find a church that wanted to perform our marriage, we would just find another church. I don't need the state and I don't need the government to enforce that will on people and that's what we saw a lot from last night. We saw a lot of government intervention, if it's weaponizing misgendering.

There are some things that were going on last night in that Town Hall that were absolutely insane. And let me tell you something else, Tucker. I am a gay veteran. Right? I served two tours in the Middle East. I protested against don't ask don't tell for that gay and lesbian soldiers had the right to serve openly. This is not what I fought for. This is not what I advocated for. I did not advocate for the alphabet soup agenda. It really troubles me, Tucker. It's very mortifying, and there's so many spineless gays and lesbians on the left that will not speak out about this. They will not speak out about taxpayer funded gender reassignment surgery. They will not stop speak out about transitioning children, they will not speak out about these things, Tucker and it really pains me because it is very important in this moment in history."

You're going to have this conformity, this hive mentality of saying the same things over and over again, like the walls are closing in beginning of the end, news is tightening, turning point in the presidency, watershed moment. We keep hearing the cliches over and over. And most importantly, the term racist between July 14th and 21st, was said 4,100 times on CNN and MSNBC alone.
