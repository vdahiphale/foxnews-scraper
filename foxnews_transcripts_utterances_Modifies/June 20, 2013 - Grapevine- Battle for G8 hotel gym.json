The Sun newspaper reports both leaders put in a request for exclusive use of the fitness room at the Northern Ireland resort where the summit was held, but apparently the presidents did not want to compromise and workout together. Ultimately the Obama camp won since it turned in the request first. In true Putin style, the Russian president then decided to take a chilly swim in the lake outside. Is This Thing On? As we've been reporting, the NSA and FBI are testifying before Congress this week about government surveillance. Apparently NSA director General Keith Alexander thought yesterday's testimony by FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce went quite well. After the hearing, but before microphone were turned off, Alexander expressed his appreciation to Joyce."
