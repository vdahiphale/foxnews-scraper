Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation. Not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception. What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process. Our country, a man or a woman, must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny were proven innocent. Thank you.",

You wouldn't think our leaders would need to publicly defend the presumption of innocence, and that it would be controversial when they do, but that's where we are.  Politically, of course, this whole thing turned out to be an unexpected debacle from Democrats. The lessons of their defeat are pretty clear. Creepy porn lawyers make bad national spokesmen. Screaming mobs of child activists scare normal people, who are watching at home. Wild allegations of gang-rape tend to be counterproductive.   In other words, it is in fact possible to go too far, and they did. It's not a complicated message. And yet, none of it seems obvious tonight to Democrats. The activist Left has learned an entirely different set of lessons from the Kavanaugh experience. The Supreme Court is a sham. The Constitution is meaningless. The Electoral College must go. Only a country divided into warring tribes can be ruled effectively. If we can't control it, let's burn it down. That is the message they've internalized. Watch our activists gathered at the Supreme Court and reacted after the Kavanaugh vote on Saturday afternoon. Keep in mind as you watch this, this is not a clip from a zombie movie.

Important media figures seem to be saying exactly the same things at exactly the same time, and indeed, they were. They were repeating talking points from the Democratic Party whose interest they faithfully serve. For generations, conservatives called this the Liberal media. But that's not quite right. These are not Liberals. They're not people who believe in free speech or transparency or due process or challenging corporate power or any other recognizable Liberal value.  These are party people. They are hacks and joiners and drones. They read the latest pronouncement from the Central Committee like they're scripture. They repeat whatever they are told. They are robots. Liberals used to defend the rights of the minority, and good for them.

He's a finance billionaire who is one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors. People listen to Tom Steyer only because he sends them money.

What's actually happening, says Tom Steyer, is that Kavanaugh was installed by a specific racial group in order to hurt and disempower every other racial group in America. This is tribal warfare posing as democracy and your tribe is losing. That's what Tom Steyer is telling you. Now, as a factual matter, this is insane. It's the kind of lunacy that would have gotten you booted off a cable channel five years ago. It's also a lie and it's dangerous.   It's exactly the kind of thing that Hutu leaders in Rwanda were saying in the early 1990s. Responsible people do not talk like this. And yet, suddenly it is everywhere on the Left, and not just among the professional wackos pounding on the front door of the Supreme Court.

So everything is about race, everything is about gender because they have to pit one group against the other for their electoral advantage. Consider for a moment that if Democrats don't get at least 90 percent of the Black vote they go the way of the Whig party in this country. Despite the fact that they've gotten 90 percent plus of the Black vote, they have lost three of the last five presidential elections.

Now, it turns out Bezos runs Amazon.com, which happens to have a virtual monopoly on book sales in America. It might not have been the best marketing decision, but we meant it sincerely, so we did it. So fast forward to this week and, maybe not so surprisingly, Amazon is now telling customers it cannot ship them this book for weeks. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Our publisher is baffled. They're not telling people trying to buy Bob Woodward's book that. We don't know what's going on. We'll let you guess. But in the meantime, you can still buy the book at Barnes & Noble or at your local bookstore, and we hope you will. Well that's about it for us tonight. You can tune in every weeknight at 8 P.M.

Screaming mobs of child activists scare normal people, who are watching at home. Wild allegations of gang-rape tend to be counterproductive. In other words, it is in fact possible to go too far, and they did. It's not a complicated message. And yet, none of it seems obvious tonight to Democrats. The activist Left has learned an entirely different set of lessons from the Kavanaugh experience. The Supreme Court is a sham. The Constitution is meaningless. The Electoral College must go. Only a country divided into warring tribes can be ruled effectively. If we can't control it, let's burn it down. That is the message they've internalized. Watch our activists gathered at the Supreme Court and reacted after the Kavanaugh vote on Saturday afternoon. Keep in mind as you watch this, this is not a clip from a zombie movie.

What's actually happening, says Tom Steyer, is that Kavanaugh was installed by a specific racial group in order to hurt and disempower every other racial group in America. This is tribal warfare posing as democracy and your tribe is losing. That's what Tom Steyer is telling you. Now, as a factual matter, this is insane. It's the kind of lunacy that would have gotten you booted off a cable channel five years ago. It's also a lie and it's dangerous. It's exactly the kind of thing that Hutu leaders in Rwanda were saying in the early 1990s. Responsible people do not talk like this. And yet, suddenly it is everywhere on the Left, and not just among the professional wackos pounding on the front door of the Supreme Court.

So everything is about race, everything is about gender because they have to pit one group against the other for their electoral advantage. Consider for a moment that if Democrats don't get at least 90 percent of the Black vote they go the way of the Whig party in this country. Despite the fact that they've gotten 90 percent plus of the Black vote, they have lost three of the last five presidential elections.

It's pretty clear they're the first people to look at this systematically and there are far more than 11 million people in this country illegally. The largest margin in the history of presidential elections in this country, 1984, was about 17 million, so there are more illegal aliens than there are voters who made the difference in the biggest blowout in American presidential history.

But you're saying 22 million brand-new voters in our electorate, OK, I don't know, were here illegally, now they all get to vote, they're 90 percent and we're (ph) going to vote for the Democrats.

On the cover of the book is a caricature of Jeff Bezos, and there's more about him inside. He's one of the people the book says has hurt this country by his behavior. Now, it turns out Bezos runs Amazon.com, which happens to have a virtual monopoly on book sales in America. It might not have been the best marketing decision, but we meant it sincerely, so we did it. So fast forward to this week and, maybe not so surprisingly, Amazon is now telling customers it cannot ship them this book for weeks. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Our publisher is baffled. They're not telling people trying to buy Bob Woodward's book that. We don't know what's going on. We'll let you guess. But in the meantime, you can still buy the book at Barnes & Noble or at your local bookstore, and we hope you will. Well that's about it for us tonight. You can tune in every weeknight at 8 P.M. Eastern to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink, which is omnipresent. We don't even notice it. But it's everywhere. And it's destroying our brains. We're against that. Hope you are too. Have a great night. Hannity's next. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
