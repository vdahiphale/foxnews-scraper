Breaking tonight, the streets of some American cities becoming combat zones and what has transitioned from protest against police treatment to violence against police and others.  In New York, a demonstration supporting police turning violent this morning as counter protesters provoke physical confrontations with officers, including using some baseball bats against some people there.  In Portland, the Democratic mayor telling federal personnel to stay out of disputes between protesters and local law enforcement, even as those disputes are increasing in number.  And in Minneapolis, the family of George Floyd sues police officers and the city over the death they say as the result of a philosophy of killology. All of this comes as President Trump makes the restoration of law and order a key plank of his reelection platform.  We have Fox team coverage; correspondent Kristin fisher though starts us off tonight from the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening, Kristin.",

First, here is what some of our Fox facilities around the country are covering tonight. Fox 5 in San Diego, where the Navy says the fire aboard the U.S. warship has now moved away from the fuel tanks. Officials say it's too early to tell whether the Bonhomme Richard could be saved, they say, the fire could be declared extinguished sometime today after a lot of effort there. Fox 45 in Baltimore, as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is released from Johns Hopkins University Hospital after treatment for a possible infection. A court spokesman, says that 87-year-old Ginsburg is doing well. And this is a live look at Denver from Fox 31. One of the big stories there tonight, a squirrel test positive for bubonic plague. Health officials say it happened in the town of Morrison, about 17 miles southwest of Denver. Humans can be infected through bites from an infected animals or fleas.

Well, let them live with the consequences of that leadership. And if they don't like it, then they should do what the people of New York did in the 1990s and elect Rudy Giuliani to clean things up.

A song with words few people understand, which fewer can sing, whose sound and spirit bear no relation to our catchy, witty, unpretentious homegrown musical forms. Is this this really what we want to hear when we rise to honor America? Such songs celebrate power, majesty, monumentality. Often their view is militaristic. Our current political predicament is a reminder of how thing certain lines can be, how veneration of country can curdle into nationalism, how nationalism can tilt towards fascism. If we must have an anthem, it should be far different than the one we got now, positing another kind of patriotism, an alternative idea of America and Americanness.

There has been $23 million in damages to businesses in Portland from these riots. This is not small stuff. There are two ways of looking at it, and I'm of two minds on it. On one hand there is an argument to be said, let the cities burn. These people elected feckless Democratic leaders. They wanted to -- they are talking about defunding the police. Well, let them live with the consequences of that leadership. And if they don't like it, then they should do what the people of New York did in the 1990s and elect Rudy Giuliani to clean things up. But on the other hand, the argument is, what about the minority? What about the business owners? What about the people there? You can't just leave them defenseless against mob violence. And the president has a responsibility, $500 million of damage in Minneapolis, as I said, $23 million in Portland. These people need to be defended, and if their elected leaders won't do it, then it's up to the president to do it."

But I think it's a fair point at how far do you go when you are looking at generals who led -- compared to founders who owned slaves. And that is a serious debate that we ought to have."

      "utterance": "So in the words of Charles Krauthammer, I celebrate that that op-ed came out and has such a diverse view. I also absolutely disagree with it. And that's what we're missing right now, Bret, is I think our Constitution is still fine, we still have a First Amendment, but what our framers potentially never imagined is that our institutions, including our media, would begin to self-censor. And that is what is wrong right now. And we need to remember what Krauthammer says, we need to embrace each other's ideas, be brave, and be civil about it."

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, as we always do, ending with a few good stories. That is NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, who stopped to check on a driver on the side of a highway in Florida after a tire blew out. The basketball legend waited with her until deputies arrived to help out. How about that? Way to go, Shaq. And World War II veteran Paul Bogenschutz has always, obviously, been a soldier. Now he's beaten a new enemy. The 93-year-old from Kentucky was just released from the hospital nearly two months after being admitted with coronavirus. He was surrounded and supported by his family and friends. Applause from the hospital workers. Thank you, sir, for your service, and congratulations. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted about Martha MacCallum starts right now in studio.
