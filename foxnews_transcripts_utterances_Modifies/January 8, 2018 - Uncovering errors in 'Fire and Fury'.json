      "sentences": "Good evening. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" and I'm Jesse Waters in New York in for Laura Ingraham. We have a great lineup of stories for you tonight. Huma Abiden is one of Hillary Clinton's closest confidants could be in serious hot water.  We've learned that something she told the FBI under oath doesn't match what was revealed in a batch of her emails.  Plus, that tell-all book on the Trump administration just keeps falling apart. We've got the latest gaffe from \"Fire and Fury\" author, Michael Wolff.  And President Trump has postponed revealing his fake news award for another 10 days. But no worries, we have our own awards to unveil tonight. We'll also expose some brand-new liberal hysteria about the president and the national anthem tonight. You won't believe this. But first, Hollywood goes to rehab and hopes we'll move back after the movies, after the worst domestic ticket sales in 25 years. Tinsel town tried to rehabilitate its image at the Golden Globes last night. The first award show since the 2017 sex scandals.  Nearly all the women wore black. Perhaps appropriate for a funeral where Hollywood tried to bury its past since. The mainstream media responded with rave reviews. Did the movie making elite really accomplish anything other than making themselves feel better about their tarnished industry? Let's get into that with conservative millennial blogger, Allie Stuckey, in Dallas, in Washington, Attorney Michele Jawando, vice president at the Center for American Progress, and here in New York, Fox News contributor, David Webb.  David, I'm going to start with you. So, this Weinstein deal, I mean, this has been an open secret for three decades. It doesn't take a lot of bravery to now come out and say me too. They are a day late and a dollar short.",

I want to say congratulations to Hollywood for finally realizing what we poor, ignorant, backwards conservatives have been saying for years. That moral relativism especially in relation to sex and sexuality leads to bad things and that includes sexual assault and sexual harassment. So great job celebrities for finally catching up with the rest of us. You guys deserve a pat on the back, wait, you guys are already doing that. That's the only thing that you did last night, which really gets to the heart of my whole problem with it is that Hollywood seems completely incapable of standing up for a good cause without self-righteously preaching to the rest of us about it. You already mentioned that this was their sin.  I disagree that they were trying to bury it. They were trying to project it on the rest of us trying to turn this industry peddling sexual promiscuity for years into a pulpit from which they'll preach to the rest of us how to live our lives.

New tonight I'm told that Schiff keeps asking for more witnesses to try and prove collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia that has not panned out. That is being rejected by Republican Chairman Devin Nunes who is instead bringing in this month a series of witnesses that may bring more damaging revelations on the other side, top FBI and Justice Department officials who allegedly went easy on Hillary Clinton, and more revelations as well about Fusion GPS and that dossier you mentioned paid for in part by the DNC and Clinton camp. So Nunes is now planning to bring in eight witnesses, including FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who exchanged those anti-Trump text messages. Another witness we're told will be Obama Justice Department holdover Bruce Ohr who was just stripped of another title. He is now no longer the head of the organized crime drug enforcement task forces. Ohr there testify January 17th about critical issues such as the fact that his wife worked for Fusion GPS. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, who has seemed to buy into every Russia allegation involving the president, got called out on CNN yesterday for seeming to dismiss the allegations against top FBI and Justice officials before he did investigating.

Huma Abiden is one of Hillary Clinton's closest confidants could be in serious hot water. We've learned that something she told the FBI under oath doesn't match what was revealed in a batch of her emails. Plus, that tell-all book on the Trump administration just keeps falling apart. We've got the latest gaffe from \"Fire and Fury\" author, Michael Wolff. And President Trump has postponed revealing his fake news award for another 10 days. But no worries, we have our own awards to unveil tonight. We'll also expose some brand-new liberal hysteria about the president and the national anthem tonight. You won't believe this. But first, Hollywood goes to rehab and hopes we'll move back after the movies, after the worst domestic ticket sales in 25 years. Tinsel town tried to rehabilitate its image at the Golden Globes last night. The first award show since the 2017 sex scandals. Nearly all the women wore black. Perhaps appropriate for a funeral where Hollywood tried to bury its past since. The mainstream media responded with rave reviews. Did the movie making elite really accomplish anything other than making themselves feel better about their tarnished industry? Let's get into that with conservative millennial blogger, Allie Stuckey, in Dallas, in Washington, Attorney Michele Jawando, vice president at the Center for American Progress, and here in New York, Fox News contributor, David Webb. David, I'm going to start with you. So, this Weinstein deal, I mean, this has been an open secret for three decades. It doesn't take a lot of bravery to now come out and say me too.

ALLIE STUCKEY, TV HOST, \"CONSERVATIVE REVIEW\": Well, actually I think that congratulations are in order for these celebrities, Jesse. I want to say congratulations to Hollywood for finally realizing what we poor, ignorant, backwards conservatives have been saying for years. That moral relativism especially in relation to sex and sexuality leads to bad things and that includes sexual assault and sexual harassment. So great job celebrities for finally catching up with the rest of us. You guys deserve a pat on the back, wait, you guys are already doing that. That's the only thing that you did last night, which really gets to the heart of my whole problem with it is that Hollywood seems completely incapable of standing up for a good cause without self-righteously preaching to the rest of us about it. You already mentioned that this was their sin. I disagree that they were trying to bury it.

In my view if only 50 percent of what's been said in this book is real, it is incredibly damaging and all you have to do is look at the president's own reaction. If somebody said something about me that's a lie I would blow it off. I don't react. This president became the first president in U.S. history to pronounce I'm sane, really, I am.

The FBI found those emails, reviewed them, and shut down the investigation. Why? Because there was no material difference or impact. And so whether you agree with that or not, that's what the law is.

For them it was a different set of rules. For them really the law was like a series of suggestions that they could either follow or not follow at their convenience. And to lie to a federal agent -- this is one of my biggest issues, Jesse. General Michael Flynn was -- pled guilty to lying to a federal agent. So if Michael Flynn is guilty, Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin are also guilty. And if they're not guilty, why is he guilty?

That all to say, I think we need to go back, fully conclude these investigations and really get to the bottom of it. Was it is pay to play scheme? Was the Clinton Foundation a slush fund? Why did the Uranium One deal take place? But even Jesse, if you are looking at some stuff taking place, for example, with Bruce Ohr, the number four guy at DOJ whose wife was hired by Fusion GPS to investigate Donald Trump, he didn't find it within himself to mention this to anybody even though he met with Christopher Steele, even though he met with Glenn Simpson.

But to talk about your friends that are vacationing in Paris and they are ashamed to be Americans, I just don't know about the rest of the American audience when they see her talking like that if they really even care to relate. I don't think they do."

And we are looking forward to next Wednesday's edition of the fake news awards. All right, the more Washington learns about that Trump/Russia dossier the more likely it looks that some of the investigators are now under investigation themselves. Ed Henry joins us next with the latest on just who may have colluded with whom."

      "utterance": "Fox News' Ed Henry was on \"The Ingraham Angle\" a few weeks ago to tell us how the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff was worried Republicans were about to shut down their investigation into Russia. Now he may wish they would. Not only has no hard evidence of collusion between the president's team and the Russians emerged, the committee's focus has now turned to whether the Obama administration used a dodgy dossier to spy on Trump campaign officials. Let's get an update on where things stand from Ed Henry in Washington."

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Jesse, good to see you. It is looking more and more like the House Intel panel investigation is going to heat up this month, but maybe not in the way that Adam Schiff wanted. When last we reported on the top Democrat on the panel late last year he was seen leaving closed door testimony with Donald Trump Junior just before a series of leaks from that testimony started popping up on CNN, \"The New York Times,\" and other media outlets, raising questions about his handling of the sensitive information during that testimony. New tonight I'm told that Schiff keeps asking for more witnesses to try and prove collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia that has not panned out. That is being rejected by Republican Chairman Devin Nunes who is instead bringing in this month a series of witnesses that may bring more damaging revelations on the other side, top FBI and Justice Department officials who allegedly went easy on Hillary Clinton, and more revelations as well about Fusion GPS and that dossier you mentioned paid for in part by the DNC and Clinton camp. So Nunes is now planning to bring in eight witnesses, including FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who exchanged those anti-Trump text messages. Another witness we're told will be Obama Justice Department holdover Bruce Ohr who was just stripped of another title. He is now no longer the head of the organized crime drug enforcement task forces. Ohr there testify January 17th about critical issues such as the fact that his wife worked for Fusion GPS. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, who has seemed to buy into every Russia allegation involving the president, got called out on CNN yesterday for seeming to dismiss the allegations against top FBI and Justice officials before he did investigating. Watch."

      "utterance": "If they are investigating Hillary Clinton it doesn't take a genius, let alone a stable genius, to see why. It's not because there is some new evidence that has come to light. It's because they are being badgered by the White House to do it."

      "utterance": "Devin Nunes also scored a big victory on Friday what TD Bank turned over more bank records for Fusion GPS. The key is we're hearing this will reveal more about Fusion GPS's clients but also their relationships with media companies. So there could be more journalists who were either on the payroll or working in some way with Fusion GPS. These could be big revelations, Jesse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "OK, so it looks like bottom line, Schiff is a leaker. This guy at Justice, Bruce Ohr, was demoted because he was having secret meetings with the dossier firm, and the dossier firm's bank records are going to get cracked open. Who knows where this money was flowing in from? And then these kind of anti-Trump FBI agents that were sending these love texts to each other, they are in the crosshairs. This whole thing is now boomeranging. What kind of repercussions could all of this see?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "As you mentioned, the key question that Devin Nunes is trying to get at is, was it the dossier and these behind the scenes maneuverings by FBI and Justice Department officials more friendly to the Obama administration than to Donald Trump, is that what led to the surveillance approved by Obama officials that then eventually led to Robert Mueller? Is that just a conspiracy theory that conservatives pushing, or is there hard evidence to show there was a direct correlation? That evidence is not there yet but there are pieces of it as you start putting THIS together that are obviously very alarming."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Let's just look ahead really quickly because we only have a few more seconds. If they can prove that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for this fake dirt from this dossier firm to smear Trump with and the dossier was used by the DOJ under Obama to justify surveillance of President Trump which sparked this whole probe, what does that mean? What could that say? And could someone be punished for that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Here is one of the key pieces that you are getting at, which is the FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act where a judge would approve this surveillance of Trump aides, there is very specific parts of the law I'm told, and just from reading it myself but also from people who are experts on this, that say that if justice and FBI officials did not fully disclose what was going on behind the scenes, they could be in violation of law, they could be in a lot of trouble basically for using this to surveil Trump officials and that this could really blow up in their face. They're not there yet, but there is a lot of maneuvering behind the scenes and we're going to hear a lot more I'm told in the next few days."
