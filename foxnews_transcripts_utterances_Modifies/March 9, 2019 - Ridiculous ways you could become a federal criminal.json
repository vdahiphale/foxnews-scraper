And the absurd idea that you are going to hear from these defense lawyers for these media corporations that somehow Nick Sandmann was an accidental public figure and that that's the standard by which he should be judged is an absolute joke. It's an outrage and thank God for People like Lin Wood and the other lawyers on his team. We need more of this kind of accountability in order to chill and stop fake news. The other thing I want to talk about, too, is actual malice and reckless disregard for the truth. It happens every day on these official media blue-checked accounts on Twitter. They are never held accountable, certainly not by the Twitter Safety and Truth Council, and so it has to be litigated in courts of law, as well as courts of public opinion.",

And a hat tip to Kellyanne Conway who just tweeted this out. It's a great point. Nicholas Sandmann is a teenage kid who literally not figuratively said nothing, and the media, a powerful media conglomerate of leftist maniacs tried to ruin his life and yet, 37-year-old Ilhan Omar, a grown adult woman who just got elected to Congress, repeatedly, openly says the craziest anti-Semitic things, and yet the \"Washington Post\" runs interference for her every single day.

Jussie Smollett, they made it up where they couldn't find it. Ignoring it within their own ranks. That is Ilhan Omar, that's Rashida Tlaib.

You've got to decide for yourself, he is, unarguably, one of the most talented performers in the history, in the modern history of show business. He is the King of Pop for a good reason.  None had the same rhythm, none have the same use of lyrics. No one could dance like Michael Jackson.

I mean, I think every conservative public figure in political life expects this kind of smear mongering to go on, but this is a kid. This is a teenager. And the absurd idea that you are going to hear from these defense lawyers for these media corporations that somehow Nick Sandmann was an accidental public figure and that that's the standard by which he should be judged is an absolute joke. It's an outrage and thank God for People like Lin Wood and the other lawyers on his team. We need more of this kind of accountability in order to chill and stop fake news. The other thing I want to talk about, too, is actual malice and reckless disregard for the truth. It happens every day on these official media blue-checked accounts on Twitter. They are never held accountable, certainly not by the Twitter Safety and Truth Council, and so it has to be litigated in courts of law, as well as courts of public opinion."

Stop and get it right. It's okay if you are the second. Do not be the first and wrong.

The Covington kids, the Nikki Haley drapes story, the entire Russian collusion hoax. It never ends. But one more thing on this, Jesse, isn't this ironic, right? And a hat tip to Kellyanne Conway who just tweeted this out. It's a great point. Nicholas Sandmann is a teenage kid who literally not figuratively said nothing, and the media, a powerful media conglomerate of leftist maniacs tried to ruin his life and yet, 37-year-old Ilhan Omar, a grown adult woman who just got elected to Congress, repeatedly, openly says the craziest anti-Semitic things, and yet the \"Washington Post\" runs interference for her every single day.

That has been the theme that has run through every day since President Trump took office, and of course during the campaign as well. Covington, they saw racism where it doesn't exist. Jussie Smollett, they made it up where they couldn't find it. Ignoring it within their own ranks. That is Ilhan Omar, that's Rashida Tlaib. That's the entire resistance caucus of the Democratic Party, and I have said, often again, the French has become the mainstream and the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi has completely lost control of that party and what does that bode for 2020 and the current Democratic field of candidates there?

I agree with you that these allegations are horrifying to listen to. But you know, you ask, you posed the ultimate dilemma. Let's say that even though I am skeptical of some of these most explosive charges. I think that the issue of whether or not you play Michael Jackson music is really subjective one. You've got to decide for yourself, he is, unarguably, one of the most talented performers in the history, in the modern history of show business. He is the King of Pop for a good reason. None had the same rhythm, none have the same use of lyrics. No one could dance like Michael Jackson. And that's why, you know, when he died of the overdose, at the age of 50 of Propofol, he was going to the O2 Arena in London, England and he had sold out every ticket for hugely expensive week- long run there. Millions and millions of dollars. He is enormously appealing, whether or not you play his music, you know I have to leave it to you. If we start for instance, Wagner. Wagner, the great composer was a favorite of Adolf Hitler. I mean, do we still play Wagner? You know, I think that that's --"

This fantasy world that he created, where he was living in a bubble and could do whatever he wanted to do with whoever he wanted to do it with is over.

Now, you know, he has -- he is the subject of this explosive, very, very condemning allegation or series of allegations against him. I think what has changed though, Jesse, is the climate out there with the #MeToo movement, and the Zero Tolerance, all of these people who played fast and loose apparently with the rules of, you know, engagement with either underage girls, teenage girls or with young boys in Michael Jackson's case, whatever you got away with before, you will now be haunted because the rules have changed. You mentioned confederate statues, I think that that is a wonderful comparison. I think as history changes, history will be fragile and will be, you know, it will last for as long as something is in and then the next generation or the next style trend, it will change again. You know, the next thing, they are going to get rid of the cowboys and Indians, John Wayne is already being condemned by Native American groups.
