      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up, a busy night tonight. So, the party of identity politics, lies, smears, slander, no due process, no presumption of innocence, besmirchment, they're at again, and tonight, violence in two American cities. We have the videotape. We're going to show you how Democrats, their friends on the left are demonizing all political differences, how they have no vision for the country, fanning flames of violent protesting and lying to you, the American people, purposely.  Alec Baldwin wants to overthrow the U.S. government. Robert de Niro calling the president the devil. Bernie Sanders refusing to condemn violent protesters.  Meanwhile in Massachusetts, far left Senator Elizabeth Warren who once identified as a minority or Native American professor, well, she released the result of her DNA test and she's not. We'll explain.  And a brand-new undercover video from Project Veritas exposing Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill that we will show you exclusively, and far left views on everything from the Second Amendment to impeaching the president and how she's trying to hide it all. Also, Hillary Clinton busy defending her husband from allegations of sexual misconduct.  All of this and breaking from Saudi Arabia, Pastor Brunson, and a major setback for Stormy Daniels and Michael Avenatti. It's time for tonight's jam-packed breaking news opening monologue. All right. At this hour, we have breaking news on multiple fronts.  One, Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Trump, it has been thrown out and she has been ordered by a California judge to pay Donald Trump's legal fees. By the way, expect crickets from the Stormy Stormy, Stormy networks. Now, this is just the latest in a long series of public embarrassments for Daniel's third rate, attention craving attorney, Michael Avenatti.   And meanwhile, Michael Brunson, the former American pastor who was detained in Turkey for years, thankfully, he is back home in the United States. He met with the president at the White House earlier this weekend. He will join us on this show tomorrow. Also, our last piece of breaking news surrounding Saudi Arabia, the mysterious disappearance of a journalist last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey. Saudi Arabia was knowingly responsible for this man's death, well, that means that President Trump was lied to and that means strong punitive action is coming against the kingdom. And now, as we speak, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he is headed to Saudi Arabia in search of those answers. We'll have more on those important stories throughout the show.   But start tonight, 22 days, three weeks from tomorrow until the midterm elections. Now, we have to cover what has now become, and we've been warning people, an extraordinarily dangerous political climate all across America. Earlier today, the NYPD, the New York Police Department, tweeted out this picture of the suspects who were wanted for vandalizing and starting a fight in a New York City Republican Club, breaking windows and painting anarchist symbols on the front. Let me be clear. Violent mob rule, it's got to be unacceptable in the United States of America. Those responsible, I don't care what your reviews, need to be sent to jail regardless of political affiliation. But over the weekend we saw several brutal clashes, near riots between groups in cities like New York City and Portland, Oregon. Look at this on your screen. Now, listen, this stuff has to stop, somebody's going to get hurt and somebody's going to end up getting killed. At the end of the day, we all need to be safe.  This is what Rand Paul was warning about. Everyone was entitled to their opinions, we believe in free speech, the right to protest, regardless of the views, you don't have the right to throw punches.   Now, likely saw with Antifa, last week, in Portland, blocking traffic, assaulting pedestrians, intimidating commuters. Settle your political disputes, you have your shot in 22 days from now. Whether this type of violence occurs on the left or the right, we know it should be the duty of elected officials and leaders to strongly condemn these actions. Now, sadly, we can also report tonight, instead of calling out, these mobs for what they are doing and this violence, they are being spurred on by demonizing political differences, vilifying people that have different points of view. It's happening from the left.  This sounds like a call to arms or marching orders on behalf of some people, and it's extraordinarily dangerous. Take a look.",

And meanwhile, when Democrats, when they're not ramping up their over-the- top, divisive rhetoric, and lying to you, the American people, now, nowhere is this more obvious than with Massachusetts senator, Pocahontas as a president calls her, Elizabeth Warren. Over the course of her career, she has repeatedly, for long periods of time, identified herself as a minority, teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. She actually changed her ethnicity from white to Native American, at Harvard Law School.   She was once described as the first woman of color. She even published her very own recipe in the Native American cookbook entitled, \"Pow Wow Chow\".  And Warren frequently touted her Native American ancestry.  Today, she published the results of her DNA study and it turns out, she's roughly 1/64 to 1/1024 Native American. And even the Cherokee Nation slammed these test results and said they were useless. By the way, today, President has this to say about Warren's extremely distant, possible connection to Native Americans. Take a look.",

The double standard is so transparent. This is especially true in red states. Democrats, they're literally now being instructed by party leaders -- don't talk about immigration, open borders, eliminating ICE. Don't talk about what we really want to do.  Don't ever mention impeachment. Even though, by the way, those are the pillars to the Democratic agenda, should you give them power back in 22 days. Open borders, no more ICE, they want to take the crumbs back and illuminate the tax cuts. Endless investigation, it will never stop.  The list is 30 items deep at this point. No more deep state investigations, no more constitutional judicial appointments, and, of course, they want to preserve Obamacare and impeach the president. In Missouri, where Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill is in a tight race for reelection, this kind of two-faced political pandering, that's on full display. While McCaskill is trying to bill herself as a moderate, which she is not, a new undercover video for Project Veritas is exposing the senator as anything but. Now, by the way, we got this tape exclusively, and as always, we report, you decide.

And we have even more shocking developments to report out of Arizona.  Remember last week, we first showed you Democratic Senate hopeful Kyrsten Sinema once called the people of her state and her state the meth lab of democracy. In 2011, she's in Texas. She's speaking, calling her fellow Arizonans that she now wants to vote for her, calling them crazy. She also promoted events at Arizona State University, featuring a lawyer who represented the blind sheikh, who was under a federal investigation.  Blind sheikh convicted of the 1995 bombing, mastermind a terrorist plots against the United States. And tonight, we are learning a new bizarre story about an antiwar rally also organized by Sinema where she was summoning -- not making this up, \"Washington Examiner\", go check it out yourself -- to witches. Yes, witches, to reclaim the tradition of feminist witchcraft against the Iraq war.  Her opponent, Martha McSally, was defending her country. And despite Sinema's unusual and frankly seedy past, this raises very much up for grabs. War hero Martha McSally has now jumped out to a thin lead but it's a close race. Meanwhile in Missouri, Claire McCaskill, who just saw featured in the latest Project Veritas video, is also in a very important race, all winnable, in this case, against Republican Josh Hawley. It's important to remember, McCaskill enthusiastically voted against Kavanaugh, against due process, against the presumption of innocence. And in Nevada, we have Republican Dean Heller has opened up a significant lead, seven points. That is an important race, getting him reelected in Nevada. We are also focusing on 10 more critical house races. This will determine if radical Nancy Pelosi once again gets her shot at being speaker. We start in Georgia tonight, their sixth district, where Republican incumbent Karen Handel is being challenged by Lucy McBath. And in Georgia 7, GOP incumbent, Robert Woodall is in a dead heat with Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux. In Illinois, their Sixth GOP incumbent, Peter Roskam, he has a razor-thin edge over Democrat Sean Casten. In Illinois, 12th Republican district incumbent Mike Bost has a slim lead over Democrat Brendan Kelly. And in Illinois 13th GOP district, incumbent Rodney Davis has a significant edge over Democrat Betsy Londrigan. Now, in Illinois 14th, we have a Republican Randy Hultgren is locked in a close race with Lauren Underwood. Maine 2, this is important district, Donald Trump won this, Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin, his seat is now being threatened by Democrat Jared Golden. And in Michigan 7, Republican Tim Walberg squares off against Democrat Gretchen Driskell. In Michigan's 8th district, GOP incumbent Mike Bishop in a tight race, it's tightening even more, with Democrat with Elisa Slotkin. And finally, Michigan 11, pro-Trump GOP nominee Lena Epstein is in an uphill battle against Democrat Haley Stevens.  We are 22 days away from the biggest midterm election in our lifetime.  These races are extraordinarily tight, everything is at stake. Anybody that tells you that they know what's going to happen is lying to you. Now if you choose to stay home, that's essentially casting at least a half a vote for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. And, by the way, if you vote for the Democrat, you are voting for Nancy Pelosi because in most cases, 99 percent, they will vote with her. And if you are voting in a Senate race, however the Democrat is, be it Tester, Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly, Bill Nelson in Florida, Claire McCaskill, Sinema in Arizona, you don't vote for Dean Heller in Nevada, you basically are voting for Chuck Schumer. The Trump agenda would come to a halt, endless witch-hunt against the president will pop up every day. Impeachment would be pursued. Every single Democrat on the Hill, they are salivating over that, but they're not telling you. In other words, they are hiding their agenda. But if you like the booming economy, if you are in love with our Constitution, presumption of innocence, inalienable rights, due process under the law, the choice is clear. In 22 days, ask yourself, are you better off than you were two years ago.  Is your paycheck bigger? Are your taxes lower? Is the country safer? Is the world safer? According to a memo obtained by \"The New York Times,\" written for the Center for American Progress, that is John Podesta's group, the third tank also Third Way, Democrats have been advised to spend no time at all talking about immigration. You're out of touch. Just keep it quiet, just like I have been saying all along, it's a party of lies. They are hiding what they will do in the hopes they can trick you into voting for them in 22 days. You get the power, you have the power to shock the world again, like you did two years ago.  Joining us now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Andy McCarthy is with us. What's particularly disturbing, Andy, about Kyrsten Sinema, is, you know, not only she thinks Arizonans are crazy. We know that. She thinks her state is the meth capital of the world, and now, we see this new tape inviting witches. But the more important issue is the lawyer that she invited Arizona State University. You prosecuted the blind sheik. Who is Lynne Stewart?",

Tonight, the Cherokee Nation is accusing her of making a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses, while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, while President Obama's 2012 campaign manager says, quote, argue the substance all you want, but why 22 days before a critical election where we must win the House and Senate to save America? Why did Senator Warren have to her announcement now? Why can't the Dems ever stay focused? So this pretty much erases any doubt that Senator Warren has her eye on 2020. And then the other story that we were monitoring, what we were talking about, if of course, these reports that Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that they accidentally killed Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, that it was an unauthorized interrogation gone wrong.

When he flew at a moment's notice, sort of an hour's notice all the way to Saudi Arabia, halfway across the world, to deal with this story, I knew that it met the President meant business. He wanted to get down to the facts. This is an incredibly serious story. There are many fronts in which that the Saudis are very good partners with the United States. I worked with them very closely while I was in Saudi Arabia to curb the illicit flows of funding to Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. They clearly work with us on oil. So there are ways in which, as it relates to terrorism, as it relates to countering Iran, that the relationship with the Saudis is important.

The statement reads in part, quote, compelling Glenn Simpson to appear for a confidential deposition after he has stated his intention to invoke his constitutional right not to testify reflects the worst practices of past Congressional investigations and reinforces that this is a political exercise, not a serious inquiry. Lawmakers want answers from Simpson about the DNC Clinton campaign-funded anti-Trump dossier that was used like verified intelligence by the FBI and Justice Department in 2016 to secure a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign, a Carter Page. Depositions are also scheduled now with the FBI's former top lawyer, James A. Baker, who revealed earlier this month that the FBI got Russia information from the lawyer whose firm handled the Trump dossier. And a deposition is also on deck for Russia researcher, Nellie Ohr, who also worked for Simpson. In addition, documents show her husband, Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, became the unofficial back channel for the dossier to the FBI. And significantly, Sean, Simpson's earlier testimony conflicts with Ohr's emails about their contact. Meantime, the House committee's Republican Chairman is considering a subpoena for the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, to secure his testimony under oath about whether he's seriously discussed recording the President in May 2017 and removing him from office.

So, the party of identity politics, lies, smears, slander, no due process, no presumption of innocence, besmirchment, they're at again, and tonight, violence in two American cities. We have the videotape. We're going to show you how Democrats, their friends on the left are demonizing all political differences, how they have no vision for the country, fanning flames of violent protesting and lying to you, the American people, purposely. Alec Baldwin wants to overthrow the U.S. government. Robert de Niro calling the president the devil. Bernie Sanders refusing to condemn violent protesters. Meanwhile in Massachusetts, far left Senator Elizabeth Warren who once identified as a minority or Native American professor, well, she released the result of her DNA test and she's not. We'll explain. And a brand-new undercover video from Project Veritas exposing Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill that we will show you exclusively, and far left views on everything from the Second Amendment to impeaching the president and how she's trying to hide it all. Also, Hillary Clinton busy defending her husband from allegations of sexual misconduct. All of this and breaking from Saudi Arabia, Pastor Brunson, and a major setback for Stormy Daniels and Michael Avenatti. It's time for tonight's jam-packed breaking news opening monologue. All right. At this hour, we have breaking news on multiple fronts. One, Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit against President Trump, it has been thrown out and she has been ordered by a California judge to pay Donald Trump's legal fees. By the way, expect crickets from the Stormy Stormy, Stormy networks. Now, this is just the latest in a long series of public embarrassments for Daniel's third rate, attention craving attorney, Michael Avenatti. And meanwhile, Michael Brunson, the former American pastor who was detained in Turkey for years, thankfully, he is back home in the United States. He met with the president at the White House earlier this weekend. He will join us on this show tomorrow. Also, our last piece of breaking news surrounding Saudi Arabia, the mysterious disappearance of a journalist last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey. Saudi Arabia was knowingly responsible for this man's death, well, that means that President Trump was lied to and that means strong punitive action is coming against the kingdom. And now, as we speak, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he is headed to Saudi Arabia in search of those answers. We'll have more on those important stories throughout the show. But start tonight, 22 days, three weeks from tomorrow until the midterm elections. Now, we have to cover what has now become, and we've been warning people, an extraordinarily dangerous political climate all across America. Earlier today, the NYPD, the New York Police Department, tweeted out this picture of the suspects who were wanted for vandalizing and starting a fight in a New York City Republican Club, breaking windows and painting anarchist symbols on the front. Let me be clear. Violent mob rule, it's got to be unacceptable in the United States of America. Those responsible, I don't care what your reviews, need to be sent to jail regardless of political affiliation. But over the weekend we saw several brutal clashes, near riots between groups in cities like New York City and Portland, Oregon. Look at this on your screen. Now, listen, this stuff has to stop, somebody's going to get hurt and somebody's going to end up getting killed. At the end of the day, we all need to be safe. This is what Rand Paul was warning about. Everyone was entitled to their opinions, we believe in free speech, the right to protest, regardless of the views, you don't have the right to throw punches. Now, likely saw with Antifa, last week, in Portland, blocking traffic, assaulting pedestrians, intimidating commuters. Settle your political disputes, you have your shot in 22 days from now. Whether this type of violence occurs on the left or the right, we know it should be the duty of elected officials and leaders to strongly condemn these actions. Now, sadly, we can also report tonight, instead of calling out, these mobs for what they are doing and this violence, they are being spurred on by demonizing political differences, vilifying people that have different points of view. It's happening from the left. This sounds like a call to arms or marching orders on behalf of some people, and it's extraordinarily dangerous. Take a look."

And meanwhile, when Democrats, when they're not ramping up their over-the- top, divisive rhetoric, and lying to you, the American people, now, nowhere is this more obvious than with Massachusetts senator, Pocahontas as a president calls her, Elizabeth Warren. Over the course of her career, she has repeatedly, for long periods of time, identified herself as a minority, teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. She actually changed her ethnicity from white to Native American, at Harvard Law School. She was once described as the first woman of color. She even published her very own recipe in the Native American cookbook entitled, \"Pow Wow Chow\".  And Warren frequently touted her Native American ancestry. Today, she published the results of her DNA study and it turns out, she's roughly 1/64 to 1/1024 Native American. And even the Cherokee Nation slammed these test results and said they were useless.

Now, what we saw from Clinton, what we are seeing from Elizabeth Warren, what we are seeing from the radical left, typical of the Democrats' strategy. They lie when it benefits them politically. The double standard is so transparent. This is especially true in red states. Democrats, they're literally now being instructed by party leaders -- don't talk about immigration, open borders, eliminating ICE. Don't talk about what we really want to do.  Don't ever mention impeachment. Even though, by the way, those are the pillars to the Democratic agenda, should you give them power back in 22 days. Open borders, no more ICE, they want to take the crumbs back and illuminate the tax cuts. Endless investigation, it will never stop. The list is 30 items deep at this point. No more deep state investigations, no more constitutional judicial appointments, and, of course, they want to preserve Obamacare and impeach the president. In Missouri, where Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill is in a tight race for reelection, this kind of two-faced political pandering, that's on full display. While McCaskill is trying to bill herself as a moderate, which she is not, a new undercover video for Project Veritas is exposing the senator as anything but. Now, by the way, we got this tape exclusively, and as always, we report, you decide. And it features McCaskill and some of her campaign staffers talking about the senator's policies on guns and impeachment and more. Not exactly what she's campaigning on. Take a look."

And we have even more shocking developments to report out of Arizona.  Remember last week, we first showed you Democratic Senate hopeful Kyrsten Sinema once called the people of her state and her state the meth lab of democracy. In 2011, she's in Texas. She's speaking, calling her fellow Arizonans that she now wants to vote for her, calling them crazy. She also promoted events at Arizona State University, featuring a lawyer who represented the blind sheikh, who was under a federal investigation.  Blind sheikh convicted of the 1995 bombing, mastermind a terrorist plots against the United States. And tonight, we are learning a new bizarre story about an antiwar rally also organized by Sinema where she was summoning -- not making this up, \"Washington Examiner\", go check it out yourself -- to witches. Yes, witches, to reclaim the tradition of feminist witchcraft against the Iraq war. Her opponent, Martha McSally, was defending her country. And despite Sinema's unusual and frankly seedy past, this raises very much up for grabs. War hero Martha McSally has now jumped out to a thin lead but it's a close race. Meanwhile in Missouri, Claire McCaskill, who just saw featured in the latest Project Veritas video, is also in a very important race, all winnable, in this case, against Republican Josh Hawley. It's important to remember, McCaskill enthusiastically voted against Kavanaugh, against due process, against the presumption of innocence. And in Nevada, we have Republican Dean Heller has opened up a significant lead, seven points. That is an important race, getting him reelected in Nevada. We are also focusing on 10 more critical house races. This will determine if radical Nancy Pelosi once again gets her shot at being speaker. We start in Georgia tonight, their sixth district, where Republican incumbent Karen Handel is being challenged by Lucy McBath. And in Georgia 7, GOP incumbent, Robert Woodall is in a dead heat with Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux. In Illinois, their Sixth GOP incumbent, Peter Roskam, he has a razor-thin edge over Democrat Sean Casten. In Illinois, 12th Republican district incumbent Mike Bost has a slim lead over Democrat Brendan Kelly. And in Illinois 13th GOP district, incumbent Rodney Davis has a significant edge over Democrat Betsy Londrigan. Now, in Illinois 14th, we have a Republican Randy Hultgren is locked in a close race with Lauren Underwood. Maine 2, this is important district, Donald Trump won this, Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin, his seat is now being threatened by Democrat Jared Golden. And in Michigan 7, Republican Tim Walberg squares off against Democrat Gretchen Driskell. In Michigan's 8th district, GOP incumbent Mike Bishop in a tight race, it's tightening even more, with Democrat with Elisa Slotkin. And finally, Michigan 11, pro-Trump GOP nominee Lena Epstein is in an uphill battle against Democrat Haley Stevens. We are 22 days away from the biggest midterm election in our lifetime.  These races are extraordinarily tight, everything is at stake. Anybody that tells you that they know what's going to happen is lying to you. Now if you choose to stay home, that's essentially casting at least a half a vote for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. And, by the way, if you vote for the Democrat, you are voting for Nancy Pelosi because in most cases, 99 percent, they will vote with her. And if you are voting in a Senate race, however the Democrat is, be it Tester, Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly, Bill Nelson in Florida, Claire McCaskill, Sinema in Arizona, you don't vote for Dean Heller in Nevada, you basically are voting for Chuck Schumer. The Trump agenda would come to a halt, endless witch-hunt against the president will pop up every day. Impeachment would be pursued. Every single Democrat on the Hill, they are salivating over that, but they're not telling you. In other words, they are hiding their agenda. But if you like the booming economy, if you are in love with our Constitution, presumption of innocence, inalienable rights, due process under the law, the choice is clear. In 22 days, ask yourself, are you better off than you were two years ago.  Is your paycheck bigger? Are your taxes lower? Is the country safer? Is the world safer? According to a memo obtained by \"The New York Times,\" written for the Center for American Progress, that is John Podesta's group, the third tank also Third Way, Democrats have been advised to spend no time at all talking about immigration. You're out of touch. Just keep it quiet, just like I have been saying all along, it's a party of lies. They are hiding what they will do in the hopes they can trick you into voting for them in 22 days. You get the power, you have the power to shock the world again, like you did two years ago. Joining us now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Andy McCarthy is with us. What's particularly disturbing, Andy, about Kyrsten Sinema, is, you know, not only she thinks Arizonans are crazy. We know that. She thinks her state is the meth capital of the world, and now, we see this new tape inviting witches.

Sean, there are just so many questions about it, and that's one of the main reasons that the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is of course, on his way to Saudi Arabia to try and figure out first-hand what exactly happened. So that's one story that we are watching tonight. And then the other one is, of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is receiving just a lot of pushback from these -- from releasing those DNA test results, providing at least some evidence of her Native American lineage, anywhere from 1/64-1/1024 Native American to be exact. Tonight, the Cherokee Nation is accusing her of making a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses, while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, while President Obama's 2012 campaign manager says, quote, argue the substance all you want, but why 22 days before a critical election where we must win the House and Senate to save America? Why did Senator Warren have to her announcement now? Why can't the Dems ever stay focused? So this pretty much erases any doubt that Senator Warren has her eye on 2020. And then the other story that we were monitoring, what we were talking about, if of course, these reports that Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that they accidentally killed Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, that it was an unauthorized interrogation gone wrong. Now Fox cannot confirm these reports, but the President has been briefed about them. His Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is now on his way to Saudi Arabia to meet the King, and hopefully find out firsthand what happened, Sean, but a lot of moving parts on both of those stories tonight."

Morgan, you lived almost two years yourself in Saudi Arabia.  You know it very well. They had denied it vigorously. But in fact, Khashoggi never came out of this consulate when he went in. It didn't make sense. And it's hard to believe that -- the stories that are emerging. Again, not confirmed by Fox that he might have been well - an interrogation gone bad. I'm not buying that.

And I think that's crucial. We need an answer here from the King and from the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who called Jared Kushner and others in the administration to deny any sort of Saudi involvement. So the big thing that I'll be looking for tomorrow is what is Secretary Pompeo get out of this. When he flew at a moment's notice, sort of an hour's notice all the way to Saudi Arabia, halfway across the world, to deal with this story, I knew that it met the President meant business. He wanted to get down to the facts. This is an incredibly serious story. There are many fronts in which that the Saudis are very good partners with the United States. I worked with them very closely while I was in Saudi Arabia to curb the illicit flows of funding to Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. They clearly work with us on oil. So there are ways in which, as it relates to terrorism, as it relates to countering Iran, that the relationship with the Saudis is important. But I think that there needs to be a lot of answers here, specifically why they chose to lie to the President publicly for the past two weeks."

OK, that's a lie. She allowed a lie to go forward for a long period of time, and somehow she is acting as if she has been vindicated in all of this. And as the, you know, Cherokee Nation leaders said, no, we are not buying it either."

Morgan, when you lived in Saudi Arabia, we know how oppressive life has been for women in Saudi Arabia under Sharia Law. We know that -- until recently, (Inaudible) we know that gays and lesbians are either beaten or killed. We know you cannot practice Christianity or Judaism in the entire country. What was it like for you -- I mean when you left the consulate, where you are, I assume you had to dress and cover and all of those things. What was it like?"

We got a lot of work done. While I was in Saudi in 2011, it's whenever the U.S. government was able to kill Osama Bin Laden. There were a lot of things that I was proud of, but we did have to wear the (Inaudible). We did have to dress. And can I just say one quick thing about Elizabeth Warren? I'm just as much the little mermaid as she is an American Indian."

Joining us with the very latest on the developing deep state scandals, and there are a lot of them tonight, Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent, our own Catherine Herridge tonight. A lot happening, first Rod Rosenstein, Glenn Simpson, and of course, we are still waiting for subpoena documents."

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right, Sean. And good evening. A short time ago, Fox News obtaining this statement from Glenn Simpson's attorney confirming that Simpson will not defy Congress. He will comply with the House subpoena and appear on Capitol Hill tomorrow, but he won't answer questions about the anti-Trump dossier and he still plans to take the fifth. The statement reads in part, quote, compelling Glenn Simpson to appear for a confidential deposition after he has stated his intention to invoke his constitutional right not to testify reflects the worst practices of past Congressional investigations and reinforces that this is a political exercise, not a serious inquiry. Lawmakers want answers from Simpson about the DNC Clinton campaign-funded anti-Trump dossier that was used like verified intelligence by the FBI and Justice Department in 2016 to secure a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign, a Carter Page. Depositions are also scheduled now with the FBI's former top lawyer, James A. Baker, who revealed earlier this month that the FBI got Russia information from the lawyer whose firm handled the Trump dossier. And a deposition is also on deck for Russia researcher, Nellie Ohr, who also worked for Simpson. In addition, documents show her husband, Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, became the unofficial back channel for the dossier to the FBI. And significantly, Sean, Simpson's earlier testimony conflicts with Ohr's emails about their contact. Meantime, the House committee's Republican Chairman is considering a subpoena for the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, to secure his testimony under oath about whether he's seriously discussed recording the President in May 2017 and removing him from office. Also late today, Carter Page, who was the subject of the surveillance warrant, he was the target of that effort has filed a lawsuit against the DNC, as well as the law firm, Perkins Coie. That was the law firm that worked directly with Simpson on the Trump dossier, Sean."

Gentlemen, we have one other little piece here in the FBI. We know that Andrew McCabe is under criminal investigation. Now, he is also being investigated for leaks as it relates to General Flynn. And by the way, those leaks, we knew from the get-go were illegal, because that was -- we all know surveillance unmasking that, never shouldn't have happened or leaked in the first place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yeah. There are some new documents out tonight, Sean. The FBI released them on their public information side, the vault.  And they revealed the first time that there was an investigation of comments allegedly made by the Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about President Trump and Flynn. We don't know anything more than that. We know that they list McCabe as a witness in the investigation, not a subject. But it's the first time we've heard anything about this, and I think that's an important thing. Also today, the Senate intelligence security chief pled guilty to lying about his contacts with the media. So this leak facet was going on and starting to be exposed little by little."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We now have the entire puzzle framed in and we are filling in all the pieces, and it's pretty clear what happened. Carter, look. You are in the center of all this. We know that four FISA judges that fraud was committed on them. The bulk of information was that phoney dossier that even -- we know that Christopher Steele was on standby. Now, you have Rod Rosenstein. He's refusing to testify under oath. You know we can't get Glenn Simpson to testify under oath. We can't get the three or twos, the gang (Inaudible) information or the FISA applications that were all subpoenaed and supposed to be coming out. You are assuming the DNC and who else?"

      "utterance": "Sean, but it's also -- you know, it goes beyond any damages or any, you know, financial aspects. I mean there have just been so many lies, as you are alluding to, and you look at the damage it did to our Democratic systems and, you know, our institutions of government back in 2016. I'm just trying to get some justice in terms of getting some disclosure. If you look at some of the prior dodgy dossier cases, like Mr. Gubarev, he's the one that actually got some of the biggest information out there in that Senate Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee have been facing a lot of things on in terms of their investigation."

We'll talk about the midterms, the fake, phoney, dishonest news media, of course, the deep state, the left's new lows, and of course, yeah, get out there and get at people's faces. And by the way, create a ground and follow people into grocery stores and gas stations and department stores. Anyway, that interview with Rush Limbaugh Thursday night 9:00 Eastern. We hope you'll join us. All right, we're always fair and balanced. We'll never be the destroy-Trump media.  Let not your heart be troubled, why, the news continues as Laura Ingraham takes it away.
