      "sentences": "Martha, good evening. The edge of the eye wall of that storm is about eight miles off the coast. We are likely to conditions to get worse over the next four to five hours. Right now, a category three hurricane with sustained winds of more than 125 miles per hour. By the time the eye crosses over, it could be 30 with a category four hurricane. If -- the scale doesn't mean all that much to you, let me say what a category three hurricane can do, it can snap trees and it can take chunks out of well-built houses, not just mobile homes. So, we could be looking at some initial devastation here along large parts of the Texas Coast.  That's not even the worst of it, the real problem could come over the next day, two days, three days that's if this storm as expected just sits over the area. Low lying terrains have dumped more than 30 inches of rain in that area. This could produce in the words of officials here: life-threatening floods. So, we could see a 12-foot storm surge in addition to this heavy rain and the wind. The real problem now and the danger is, that the winds are so bad, first responders can't go out at this point. We're already feeling hurricane gust winds here right along the coast. So, if you have decided to stay here, you are on your own. Now, police can't come and help you if you do need help for the next few hours. Martha, back to you.",

      "sentences": "A new update just out from the National Hurricane Center, a Cat four storm. So, it has increased to a category four storm. Winds are at 130 miles per hour, so we have not seen any weakening of this storm. It has put up weather eight behind me, I'll show you a couple things here. But a category four hurricane right at landfall, a strengthening hurricane right at landfall is not what you want to see. A strengthening hurricane actually transports more of the winds down to the surface and it is a dangerous thing. We saw this with Hurricane Charlie and Hurricane Wilma.  And take a look at this imagery right here, Martha. We have a new satellite Goes-16; it's the first time we've seen a hurricane on it. This right here, you see all of the storms around the center of it. Centered it just around 20 miles offshore. The eye wall is going to be moving right on shore here kind of between Corpus Christi and up towards Port Lavaca. Not a lot of population right here, which is good news, but Corpus Christi right on one of it, Port Lavaca right on the other side of it. That means that's where the strongest of the winds are going to be, and the storm surge already pulling in here and in the next hour or so it's going to be catastrophic. This is now also moving much slower. So, it's forward progression instead of being 10 miles an hour is now seven miles an hour. That means, it's just a slower moving storm -- we thought this was going to happen. That saying eight miles per hour; I think it's 7, actually. But it's going to continue to pull towards the Northwest, and eventually, kind of stall it out. But you get the idea, we have seen the heaviest of the -- at least on the radar imagery, the heaviest of the storms right on kind of the front side of it. It's filling in around again back on the other side, and if you've got a strengthening storm, that certainly would be indicative of what we're going to see.  Bad news for the storm surge right here, certainly, in the short-term, it's about to get really bad. Other bad news is the storm surge doesn't go away anytime soon, because even though the storm kind of pulls offshore it's moving so slowly and stalls, and then drifts back towards the south again. And that means we're going to continue to see an on-shore flow here continuing to keep all of that water in these bays. Storm surge, probably 12-feet. Imagine what that 12-feet -- I'm almost six-feet tall, double my height at a storm surge. And then, rainfall totals three to five feet on top of that because the storm gets stuck here Wednesday to Thursday of this coming week, Martha.",

What matters are the things he did in advance. That is number one. He's got a real expert, not a political crony, not a friend of a friend of a cousin of a cousin who is in at the head of FEMA. He has gotten his White House staff in order by putting, as it turns out, the head of the agency in charge of this, Department of Homeland Security in as the da capo to de capo of his White House.

He never said you did this wrongly, you did that.

And we're going to teach them things that are absolutely contrary to science like boys can become girls, and girls can become boys. The idea that all of this is just genetically inbuilt.  There's no evidence to suggest that all transgender activity, all gender identity orientation, all of that is genetically inbuilt, and has no environmental impact at all. In fact, most kids who identify as gender confused when they're young grow out of it as they get older. And here, you have a school that's basically saying to the parents, we're going to teach our false version of science to your children. And not just -- apparently, they had a transgender party for one 5-year-old, and talk to the entire class about it at the same time. I mean, this is really despicable stuff. The idea is to protect the innocence of children, not to rip it away from them in the name of 5-year-olds making their own decision whether they're a boy or girl.",

It was a move, of course, by then President Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign that essentially shields the children of illegal immigrants from being deported. So, ending it could kick off a major controversy that draws the former president into his first direct battle with the current president, mano-a-mano. Remember, Obama warned earlier this year if DACA gets killed, he might break the tradition of former presidents holding their tongue declaring \"the notion that we would just arbitrarily or because of politics punish those kids when they didn't do something themselves would merit my speaking out.\" President Trump's own Department of Homeland Security, by the way, once run by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has raised questions about the feasibility of ending it. Though on the other side, you see Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he wants to take a tough law and order approach and is backed by 10 Republicans attorneys general, who say if the White House does not end it by early next month they will go to federal court to kill it.

But South Korea media says the missile launch from one of North Korea's eastern provinces, which is on the opposite side of the Korean peninsula from Seoul, appears to have been a ballistic missile that flew about 150 miles and then landed in the ocean between Japan and the Korean peninsula. The firing comes one day after North Korea's state run media released pictures of Kim Jong-un inspecting a missile site that appears to show North Korea's missile program has made unexpected advances. The photos include a previously unseen missile that experts say might be, might be, the key words there, the next generation of missiles the north has already fired. All of this is troubling for the Trump administration, which this week said that North Korea seemed to be backing down a bit. Remember, last week, Kim Jong-un was threatening to fire missiles near the island of Guam, which is a U.S. territory and considered to be U.S. soil. In July, North Korea conducted its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the shores of Alaska, and experts say they may also have the technology to arm the missiles with a small nuclear warhead. We should note that while the north has fired yet another missile, the USS John McCain is in port out of commission in Singapore after being hit by an oil tanker. The McCain is equipped with an aegis missile defense system, an effective counter weapon to North Korean missiles.

Either way, Cuba has a responsibility under the Vienna Convention, as Jose noted, to protect our diplomats and help us protect our diplomats. It sounds like they're cooperating with U.S. authorities and Canadian authorities in order to figure out why this happened, how this happened, and how to prevent it from happening in the future. That's important. There should be a response from the U.S. Perhaps we have to put in place some new sanctions, targeted sanctions to retaliate. Perhaps we have to do expulsion of more Cuba diplomats.

But the SPLC has been the beneficiary of huge corporate donations from the likes of JP Morgan and Apple. And that prompted Kim Strassel in a Wall Street Journal op-ed today to note this.

Right now, a category three hurricane with sustained winds of more than 125 miles per hour. By the time the eye crosses over, it could be 30 with a category four hurricane. If -- the scale doesn't mean all that much to you, let me say what a category three hurricane can do, it can snap trees and it can take chunks out of well-built houses, not just mobile homes. So, we could be looking at some initial devastation here along large parts of the Texas Coast. That's not even the worst of it, the real problem could come over the next day, two days, three days that's if this storm as expected just sits over the area. Low lying terrains have dumped more than 30 inches of rain in that area. This could produce in the words of officials here: life-threatening floods. So, we could see a 12-foot storm surge in addition to this heavy rain and the wind. The real problem now and the danger is, that the winds are so bad, first responders can't go out at this point. We're already feeling hurricane gust winds here right along the coast. So, if you have decided to stay here, you are on your own. Now, police can't come and help you if you do need help for the next few hours. Martha, back to you."

      "utterance": "A new update just out from the National Hurricane Center, a Cat four storm. So, it has increased to a category four storm. Winds are at 130 miles per hour, so we have not seen any weakening of this storm. It has put up weather eight behind me, I'll show you a couple things here. But a category four hurricane right at landfall, a strengthening hurricane right at landfall is not what you want to see. A strengthening hurricane actually transports more of the winds down to the surface and it is a dangerous thing. We saw this with Hurricane Charlie and Hurricane Wilma. And take a look at this imagery right here, Martha. We have a new satellite Goes-16; it's the first time we've seen a hurricane on it. This right here, you see all of the storms around the center of it. Centered it just around 20 miles offshore. The eye wall is going to be moving right on shore here kind of between Corpus Christi and up towards Port Lavaca. Not a lot of population right here, which is good news, but Corpus Christi right on one of it, Port Lavaca right on the other side of it. That means that's where the strongest of the winds are going to be, and the storm surge already pulling in here and in the next hour or so it's going to be catastrophic. This is now also moving much slower. So, it's forward progression instead of being 10 miles an hour is now seven miles an hour. That means, it's just a slower moving storm -- we thought this was going to happen. That saying eight miles per hour; I think it's 7, actually. But it's going to continue to pull towards the Northwest, and eventually, kind of stall it out. But you get the idea, we have seen the heaviest of the -- at least on the radar imagery, the heaviest of the storms right on kind of the front side of it. It's filling in around again back on the other side, and if you've got a strengthening storm, that certainly would be indicative of what we're going to see. Bad news for the storm surge right here, certainly, in the short-term, it's about to get really bad. Other bad news is the storm surge doesn't go away anytime soon, because even though the storm kind of pulls offshore it's moving so slowly and stalls, and then drifts back towards the south again. And that means we're going to continue to see an on-shore flow here continuing to keep all of that water in these bays. Storm surge, probably 12-feet. Imagine what that 12-feet -- I'm almost six-feet tall, double my height at a storm surge. And then, rainfall totals three to five feet on top of that because the storm gets stuck here Wednesday to Thursday of this coming week, Martha."

And Donald Trump has done the most important things to avoid. It doesn't matter whether he watches it on television or not, he can go work on his putting, who cares? What matters are the things he did in advance. That is number one. He's got a real expert, not a political crony, not a friend of a friend of a cousin of a cousin who is in at the head of FEMA. He has gotten his White House staff in order by putting, as it turns out, the head of the agency in charge of this, Department of Homeland Security in as the da capo to de capo of his White House.

And it caused Hillary Clinton to sort of suddenly say, you know, oh, well, we were going to go but we didn't want to be a distraction.

And Trump, whose campaign was struggling in August, saw an opportunity and went down there for the photo op. And then, accused Obama of not caring about the people.

The president's top economic advisor we know had been very troubled by the president's comments after Charlottesville. And now, he's come forward in an interview and said that he wrote a letter of resignation because he was so disturbed by the reaction. And then, he decided to stay because he feels that it's his duty to do his job. But he -- let's put that up on the screen if we can, we have the exact words that he used. He said that he seriously considered leaving, and then he went on to say that he thought in so many words that the administration needed to do a much better job of handling these sorts of situations too, and I'll just read the end of it here, to heal the deep division that exists in our communities. Chris, were you surprised by this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "No. He needed -- Cohn needed to get on the record, and he needs like others in the administration other Republicans have had to do, to find a way to denounce or kind of denounce or be anguished or say something derogatory. And Cohn is very careful to make sure he wasn't accusing the president of doing anything wrong but to say that he felt troubled about the administration's response and the White House's response, and he never attacked Trump. He never said you did this wrongly, you did that. But, remember, these business guys will do -- their consciences, I don't know which part of the conscience of all the people who dropped out of the president's council, all of the companies that expressed anguish and angst over all this thing. These business guys, they want that tax cut. And if Donald Trump says the right thing or the wrong thing about Charlottesville or statues or fomenting the discontent, and all these things. If he can come through with those tax cuts, I think a lot of these guys will find their consciences suddenly assuaged."

He's getting a lot of heat from both sides, some saying, well, you should resign then. But he chose a middle course, stay in the job.

We perceive that Antifa will show up and try to cause violence. Do not come ready to do violence in defense of my free speech right. We just paid, so that Berkeley will do it, right? Either Berkeley is going to protect my free speech rights or they're not. Now, we get to see a nation whether Berkeley is going to keep its words to protect free speech even when Antifa shows up.

The parents are the real obstacle here: we know better than you how to raise your own children. And we're going to teach them things that are absolutely contrary to science like boys can become girls, and girls can become boys. The idea that all of this is just genetically inbuilt. There's no evidence to suggest that all transgender activity, all gender identity orientation, all of that is genetically inbuilt, and has no environmental impact at all. In fact, most kids who identify as gender confused when they're young grow out of it as they get older. And here, you have a school that's basically saying to the parents, we're going to teach our false version of science to your children. And not just -- apparently, they had a transgender party for one 5-year-old, and talk to the entire class about it at the same time. I mean, this is really despicable stuff.

Steve Bannon may be gone, remember, it was just one week ago today that he was pushed out of the White House, but some of his key policies may remain. In fact, one of the president's top advisors sent me a note earlier saying the nationalism and America first streak from Bannon may remain because there are multiple reports tonight suggesting the president is leaning towards ending DACA, which could impact one million immigrants. It was a move, of course, by then President Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign that essentially shields the children of illegal immigrants from being deported. So, ending it could kick off a major controversy that draws the former president into his first direct battle with the current president, mano-a-mano. Remember, Obama warned earlier this year if DACA gets killed, he might break the tradition of former presidents holding their tongue declaring \"the notion that we would just arbitrarily or because of politics punish those kids when they didn't do something themselves would merit my speaking out.\" President Trump's own Department of Homeland Security, by the way, once run by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has raised questions about the feasibility of ending it. Though on the other side, you see Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he wants to take a tough law and order approach and is backed by 10 Republicans attorneys general, who say if the White House does not end it by early next month they will go to federal court to kill it. That is a split within the administration and it may be a reason why Sarah Huckabee Sanders today was cautious."

First of all, and this gets underreported, but Steven Miller the author of the Raise Act which proposed cutting legal immigration in half, and everybody pretty much in politics said it was dead on arrival. It's no longer been accepted into the room. He's no longer invited to the conversations instead of going on about DACA. So that is an early indication that perhaps it is going toward more of a centrist position. Second of all, the danger that DACA is in coming from the Texas lawsuit through Attorney General Ken Paxton, interestingly enough, has been reported as just a distraction from Ken Paxton's felony lawsuit that's going on from securities fraud from when he was a state representative--"

So this White House would have to reauthorize DACA, and they don't know. Their lawyers are concerned that they don't really have the authority to reauthorize it because they don't believe that it had correct legal under pinning to begin with, is that correct?"

Though, they're not saying how far they went. But South Korea media says the missile launch from one of North Korea's eastern provinces, which is on the opposite side of the Korean peninsula from Seoul, appears to have been a ballistic missile that flew about 150 miles and then landed in the ocean between Japan and the Korean peninsula. The firing comes one day after North Korea's state run media released pictures of Kim Jong-un inspecting a missile site that appears to show North Korea's missile program has made unexpected advances. The photos include a previously unseen missile that experts say might be, might be, the key words there, the next generation of missiles the north has already fired. All of this is troubling for the Trump administration, which this week said that North Korea seemed to be backing down a bit. Remember, last week, Kim Jong-un was threatening to fire missiles near the island of Guam, which is a U.S. territory and considered to be U.S. soil. In July, North Korea conducted its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the shores of Alaska, and experts say they may also have the technology to arm the missiles with a small nuclear warhead. We should note that while the north has fired yet another missile, the USS John McCain is in port out of commission in Singapore after being hit by an oil tanker. The McCain is equipped with an aegis missile defense system, an effective counter weapon to North Korean missiles. And remember, South Korea and the U.S. military are conducting joint military exercises as we speak in the Korean peninsula. Martha."

An investigation is underway into sudden mysterious injuries and illnesses that are striking at least 16 Americans who are serving diplomatically in Cuba. So it was one year ago that President Obama decided to strengthen ties with the repressive regime. Now there are suspicions that the brutal dictatorship is actively targeting American diplomats in their homes, which by the way, Cuba insists they live. Recently, all this happened with relation to the U.S. embassy. So here now to talk about it, Jose Cardenas is former official in the Bush administration state department, and David Tafuri is a former Obama state department official. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to have both of you with us. Let's start with Cuba, and then I want to get your thoughts on this North Korean missile launches as well, because this Cuba story is bizarre. And Mr. Cardenas, let me start with you, the story is that in their homes and in their workplaces they believe they are under sonic attack, some sort of waves that doctors have determined after examining them are happening.

And, therefore -- and they could wind up with permanent brain damage or other permanent health repercussions. It really is -- it boggles the mind to believe that this could happen in this day and age. Number one, it also shows the, basically, the folly of the Obama administration's attempt to normalize relations with Cuba and the Castro regime.

Now, it's worthwhile to note that we're not yet sure who is responsible for these attacks. It could be Cuba. But reporters and media reports suggest it could also be a third country. Either way, Cuba has a responsibility under the Vienna Convention, as Jose noted, to protect our diplomats and help us protect our diplomats. It sounds like they're cooperating with U.S. authorities and Canadian authorities in order to figure out why this happened, how this happened, and how to prevent it from happening in the future. That's important. There should be a response from the U.S. Perhaps we have to put in place some new sanctions, targeted sanctions to retaliate. Perhaps we have to do expulsion of more Cuba diplomats. We have to have a firm response. But it's also important to note that we have made some progress in the relationship with Cuba by opening up Cuba as a result of the normalization of relations.

Perhaps this is their response. There was a great report from Trace. He noted that these are short range missiles and that it sounds like they have failed. So it was a pretty poor weak response by North Korea, but certainly a provocation. And we have to see what the U.S. is going to do next.

The southern poverty law center in their quest to root out what they consider hate in this country labels these two people, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, and activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, as part of that group that they're against. She responded by saying this, quote, I'm a black woman, a feminist, and a former Muslim who has consistently opposed political violence. Yet, the SPLC has the audacity to label me an extremist. But the SPLC has been the beneficiary of huge corporate donations from the likes of JP Morgan and Apple. And that prompted Kim Strassel in a Wall Street Journal op-ed today to note this. By funding this list, JP Morgan and Apple are saying they support labeling Christian organizations that oppose gay marriage as, quote, hate groups. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and he joins me. Now, Victor, welcome. Very good to have you on the program tonight."

      "utterance": "This piece by Kim Strassel caught my eye this morning. And we had looked at -- obviously, your piece the other day on the war monuments. But this one to start with in terms of this sort of progressive leaning at corporations where they feel that if they don't back groups like the SPLC they might be criticized. There might be backlash from some of their consumers. But they may get just the opposite here."

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah. They do. They're business people. So they look at the world in a cost benefit analysis. And they've come to the conclusion that a few activists like the SPLC represent a greater danger by defamation to them or blackmail or boycotts than do the vast majority of Americans who basically agree with the tolerance of classically liberal views of Hirsi Ali. And more importantly, the SPLC to be specific looks at minority people as a burgh that they have to have uniform views. And somebody who's brilliant, beautiful, black, ex-Muslim, courageous female like Hirsi Ali, comes out and speaks empirically and talks about the world in way she sees it in a logical and rational manner. That represents unessential threat to the SPLC. And corporations as I've said are just a moral. They react to what the perceived profit loss calculus is."

      "utterance": "And we saw similar thing with many of them stepping away from these councils that the White House was operating for the same reason, right? They just felt that they sort of looked at their PNL and decided it wasn't going to be worth it for them because they're likely to get blasted on Twitter and on social media by organizations that may or may not represent the feelings of the American people at all."

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "No. And most people are traditionalist and they live and let live, especially, conservatives. And they're not the type of people when they see something that bothers them to get everybody riled up and to boycott and to magnify their numbers as people on the progressive left do. So, business people just react to perceived pressures. We've seen that with ESPN and the Asian American sportscaster psycho drama. We see it with USC Horse that happened to be named traveler. But I think corporations really have to ask themselves how long can they be this immoral and just react to perceived business decisions without offending people who may come out of the shadows and finally say enough is enough."

      "utterance": "Let's put up this hate group map that the SPLC put out, that included group like the Family Research Council. I mean, Victor, if you look at this, you would think there's just hate crawling across the entire country and you better just stay in your house and hunker down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah. They're bullies and they intimidate people. They're sort of like the McCarthyites of the 1950's. I've been a target of them for just speaking about in support of assimilation, integration, and inner marriage in the case of immigrants. And they feel that is somehow discriminatory. So they're riding high because of the Charlottesville incident. And they've got a lot of donations and it's gone to their head. And they better be careful because I think they're going to create a backlash not only among the American people but maybe the corporations that appease them right now might not in the future if there's a popular backlash."

      "utterance": "You know, with every passing day there are more examples of these statues and monuments being taken down. And they've become a symbol of the kind of strife that you and I are talking about right now. Thomas Jefferson was doused with red paint at the University of Virginia, which he designed and founded. And then you have Colonel Crawford at an Ohio University, and his statue was decapitated. You've been writing about this as I said, and you said when we wipe away history in a wind, and in parenthesis, why in 2017 and not say in 2015 or 2008. We better make sure that our targets are uniquely and mellow dramatically evil rather than tragically misguided, and which category do you think these individuals fall into?"

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, we're humans by nature applaud. When we apply the standards of the 21st century we can find all sorts of sinners in the past. But notice it's selective. People are not going after progressive racists, by our terms they're racist --, Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood, Susan B. Anthony, Woodrow Wilson. We can have a whole session on the things that they said by modern standards they should be airbrush away. They're not going after the Shake Lavera statue in Central Park who personally executed people with his own revolver. They're not going after Mahatma Gandhi who was a great man, but he said some terrible things about blacks in South Africa, and he said some terrible things about Jews on the eve of World War II. So they're selective and they're outraged. They're also insidious. As you pointed out, it's evolutionary and they're going after language. The horse and USC are -- things like that. They eat their own revolutionaries--"

Floyd Mayweather and Connor McGregor take to the ring in one of the most hype boxing matches of all time. There's no title on the line. But if McGregor wins, it will be considered the biggest upset in sports history. They've been trading at lot of words throughout the course of this week. So we will be watching to see who wins. We want to know your story. I want to know what you think about the big fight. Stay tune to Fox News throughout the night, live continuous coverage of Hurricane Harvey is straight ahead throughout the course of this evening.
