It's not because they're wasteful, but if you are driving 50 miles to work and that is the only job you can find and you can't afford some hybrid, so you are stuck with the old beater that you are driving around that gets eight miles a gallon, these gas prices are killing you right now. And so this is the reason why I've said that it is so important for us to invest in new approaches to energy.",
