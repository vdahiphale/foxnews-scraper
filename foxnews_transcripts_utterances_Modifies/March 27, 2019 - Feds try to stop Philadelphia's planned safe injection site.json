      "sentences": "Good evening welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” This evening we want to tell you a story about collusion, a real one -- actual collusion that's currently in progress. There are no shadowy hackers or imaginary rendezvous in Prague, in this story there's not a single Russian spy or secret sex tape. There's nothing shadowy about the collusion we're going to tell you about, it takes place right out in the open on live television. This is a story about where your news comes from. This past Sunday afternoon, we learned that the Trump campaign did not collude with the government of Russia. That was the conclusion of Robert Mueller's investigation, an investigation that spent two years exhaustively looking into the question. This was very good news for America. We don't have a spy in the White House, but it was apocalyptic for the Democratic Party and their press agents in the news media. These are the people who would stake their reputations and their fortunes on the collusion hoax and they were stunned.  Befuddled politicians stammered on television trying to figure out what to say about the news. Viewers of liberal media outlets didn't want to hear anything about it. Huge numbers of them just quit watching immediately.  Last night CNN's 8:00 p.m. show lost nearly 50% of its viewers. For progressive channels, this was a catastrophe. Something had to be done. So into this disaster step the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. On Monday just hours after the collision story collapsed, Pelosi announced that the Democratic Party would be switching gears. Going forward, Democrats would focus intently on healthcare, just like she disingenuously claimed they always had.",

      "sentences": "\"I hope the press focuses healthcare,\" Pelosi said. She didn't have to ask twice. At CNN, they were paying close attention to every word Pelosi uttered. To Jeff Zucker and the anchors who work for him at CNN, Pelosi isn't just a politician, she's the leader of the party -- their party -- the party under whose banner Zucker has said he may someday run for office.   When America's most powerful Democrat speaks, CNN listens with pen in hand. These are marching orders and the network swung into action immediately. The run downs of every primetime show were scrapped and rebuilt. Gone were the segments about office towers in Moscow and Carter Page's spying and Don, Jr. going to prison. In their place, long editorials about healthcare. The Democratic healthcare plan is sensible and necessary, CNN told us. The Republican plan - cruel and heartless. Between 7:00 p.m. and midnight last night, every show on CNN followed Nancy Pelosi's instructions. Every single show talked about healthcare and every single one channeled Nancy Pelosi's views on healthcare. She could have been writing the scripts, maybe she was.   Nobody hit that topic harder than an anchor called Chris Cuomo. Cuomo is the son of the former Democratic Governor of New York and the brother of the current Democratic Governor of New York. He spends a lot of time telling you what a committed journalist he is, probably because his instincts are so obviously political. Last night the Governor's brother read his Party's talking points as if off a cue card. Close your eyes as we play this and imagine you're listening to a 30-second attack ad on the radio during campaign season. See if you can tell the difference.",

On Pelosi's orders, it was healthcare week on CNN. And they were back at it this morning, assiduously. Starting at 6:00 a.m. today, every single show on CNN's morning lineup and all through the day regurgitated Pelosi's talking points to the word about healthcare.

According to our producers who are monitoring the situation, both CNN and MSNBC are talking about that's right -- healthcare, right now. Healthcare. Pelosi's orders.  What does that tell you? It tells you where your news comes from. Democratic officials pick the topic and the story line. Their servants in cable news dutifully repeat it to the word all day long. CNN is not a news outlet, it's a super PAC. It is running unregulated campaign ads 24 hours a day. Someone ought to call the FEC about it.   Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill\" newspaper and he joins us tonight. Joe, thanks a lot for coming on.

Going to their sources first saying, \"Hey, is this okay, you know, if I use this or I don't use this?\" Sharing stories in advance was another example. Teeing up stories and narratives and then e-mails talking about which reporters are the best to go to for that from the DNC and then openly advising campaigns on strategy.   So does this sound crazy?

It's of a piece with a separate plan that Soros and the Democracy Alliance had to put secretaries of state in office, too. And so this is involved in many cases, as in Chicago, far left candidates like Kim Foxx primary-ing incumbents who are also liberal, but not liberal enough and in Kim Foxx's race, the incumbent was somebody who the far left and Black Lives Matters and a lot of the identity politics groups were dissatisfied with because she didn't act fast enough on one of the police shooting cases involving a young man named, Laquan McDonald who was shot.  So this is very interesting, Tucker, because we have Kim Foxx who was supposedly put there as a progressive to serve the poor and underrepresented minorities who didn't have a voice in Cook County and who was she carrying water for?

He criticized his role in the Anita Hill hearings, which he described as quote, \"a bunch of white guys interrogating a black woman.\" And then he went further.

It's why the police need a search warrant to search your house. These are the best things about America. The things that keep our country freer and fairer than any other place.

So I think that the interesting question from my perspective is why are the proponents pushing them so hard if they know that they are illegal? And I think there's really two answers to that. First of all, they are pushing them because the proponents are arrogant. And secondly, they are pushing them because they have contempt for democracy and let me explain that a little bit. They are arrogant because they believe that the law doesn't apply to them. The law is just an inconvenience that other people have to worry about, but they have a higher purpose here and they don't have to worry about complying with the law. And I say that contempt for democracy because in America, the people's will is expressed through the law, okay, so if you are following the law or you're enforcing the law, you're showing your respect for democracy and when you're thumbing your nose at the law, like these proponents are doing, you're actually showing your disrespect and your contempt for democracy.",

Today, he tweeted this, \"Just met with Sundar Pichai, President of Google who's obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. military, not the Chinese military. Also discussed political fairness and various things Google can do for the country. Meeting ended very well.\" Well, obviously, we hope the President is right about that and Google really is committed to fairness and the security of the United States, but as we have extensively reported on this show, they haven't been before. Google has massively expanded artificial intelligence research in China. The president's top General said that the work Google does helps the Chinese military. Meanwhile, Google is rejecting Pentagon contracts because they upset Google employees who don't like the United States. Now, whether or not Pichai is interested in political fairness, personally his employees are not demonstrably. As we revealed last year, Google employees wanted to manipulate search results to fight the President's travel ban and in yet another case, a Google employee used company resources to boost Hillary Clinton's voter turnout, so it's possible today's meeting went well, but it's important to remember who you're dealing with when you're talking to the President of Google.

      "utterance": "Good evening welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” This evening we want to tell you a story about collusion, a real one -- actual collusion that's currently in progress. There are no shadowy hackers or imaginary rendezvous in Prague, in this story there's not a single Russian spy or secret sex tape. There's nothing shadowy about the collusion we're going to tell you about, it takes place right out in the open on live television. This is a story about where your news comes from. This past Sunday afternoon, we learned that the Trump campaign did not collude with the government of Russia. That was the conclusion of Robert Mueller's investigation, an investigation that spent two years exhaustively looking into the question. This was very good news for America. We don't have a spy in the White House, but it was apocalyptic for the Democratic Party and their press agents in the news media. These are the people who would stake their reputations and their fortunes on the collusion hoax and they were stunned. Befuddled politicians stammered on television trying to figure out what to say about the news. Viewers of liberal media outlets didn't want to hear anything about it. Huge numbers of them just quit watching immediately. Last night CNN's 8:00 p.m. show lost nearly 50% of its viewers. For progressive channels, this was a catastrophe. Something had to be done. So into this disaster step the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. On Monday just hours after the collision story collapsed, Pelosi announced that the Democratic Party would be switching gears. Going forward, Democrats would focus intently on healthcare, just like she disingenuously claimed they always had."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"I hope the press focuses healthcare,\" Pelosi said. She didn't have to ask twice. At CNN, they were paying close attention to every word Pelosi uttered. To Jeff Zucker and the anchors who work for him at CNN, Pelosi isn't just a politician, she's the leader of the party -- their party -- the party under whose banner Zucker has said he may someday run for office. When America's most powerful Democrat speaks, CNN listens with pen in hand. These are marching orders and the network swung into action immediately. The run downs of every primetime show were scrapped and rebuilt. Gone were the segments about office towers in Moscow and Carter Page's spying and Don, Jr. going to prison. In their place, long editorials about healthcare. The Democratic healthcare plan is sensible and necessary, CNN told us. The Republican plan - cruel and heartless. Between 7:00 p.m. and midnight last night, every show on CNN followed Nancy Pelosi's instructions. Every single show talked about healthcare and every single one channeled Nancy Pelosi's views on healthcare. She could have been writing the scripts, maybe she was. Nobody hit that topic harder than an anchor called Chris Cuomo. Cuomo is the son of the former Democratic Governor of New York and the brother of the current Democratic Governor of New York. He spends a lot of time telling you what a committed journalist he is, probably because his instincts are so obviously political. Last night the Governor's brother read his Party's talking points as if off a cue card. Close your eyes as we play this and imagine you're listening to a 30-second attack ad on the radio during campaign season. See if you can tell the difference."

      "utterance": "Our President said today that the GOP will be known as the party of healthcare, but it seems to me he left out a word. Based on his administration's latest move with the ACA, the President will make his party about removing healthcare. This President and his Party have no plan to provide care to tens of millions if the ACA is gone. Why? Why? Why? Welcome to the new normal."

      "utterance": "\"They're taking your healthcare away.\" If you're waiting to hear the paid for by the Kamala Harris for President Committee line, they left that out. They shouldn't have. The law requires it, but they did anyway. Don Lemon hosts the next show in CNN's lineup. As a person, Lemon isn't nearly as political as the Governor's brother is, he's a local news guy at heart, the former weekend anchor at a station in Birmingham. He's not into policy. On the other hand, Don Lemon has a very sweet gig and he knows it, so when Jeff Zucker calls and tells him to talk about healthcare, he does; and of course he did."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yet another lie on healthcare. At no point did any of the anchors on CNN yesterday mention what was so glaringly obvious. In the space of just 24 hours, that channel went from the Russia conspiracy network to an extended advertisement for the Affordable Care Act as written by Barack Obama. The viewers, those who remained, must have wondered what the hell was going on. Where's my segment about how Don, Jr. is going to prison. I want to hear more about that. But no. On Pelosi's orders, it was healthcare week on CNN. And they were back at it this morning, assiduously. Starting at 6:00 a.m. today, every single show on CNN's morning lineup and all through the day regurgitated Pelosi's talking points to the word about healthcare. Republicans will make you sick, only Democrats will make you well. Every single show made that point. If you were stuck in the airport, it was like living in North Korea. A speaker bolted to the wall above your head blaring an endless loop of propaganda you can't turn off."

Oh, I'm sorry I'm getting word -- I'm sorry, we have a news alert now. According to our producers who are monitoring the situation, both CNN and MSNBC are talking about that's right -- healthcare, right now. Healthcare. Pelosi's orders. What does that tell you? It tells you where your news comes from. Democratic officials pick the topic and the story line. Their servants in cable news dutifully repeat it to the word all day long. CNN is not a news outlet, it's a super PAC. It is running unregulated campaign ads 24 hours a day. Someone ought to call the FEC about it. Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill\" newspaper and he joins us tonight. Joe, thanks a lot for coming on. So Pelosi says on Monday we're pivoting to healthcare, the next day, CNN scraps its line up and does healthcare in every single hour. Could it be more obvious?"

      "utterance": "After listening to that montage, it appears that synchronized swimming is more than just an Olympic sport. Apparently, it's being in non-Olympics years as well. Look that's called the pivot, right? We talked about this last week, I think, that the pivot would be made and sure enough, here we are at the pivot. And look, I would say if you were to tell me this a couple of days ago, I'd say, \"I don't know you know the DNC or Pelosi, them telling a network what sort of narrative they should go with,\" but then it hit me and I remember this, the WikiLeaks dump of 2016 where you had e-mails that prove a point around this completely, where you had reporters talking about quote \"approval. Going to their sources first saying, \"Hey, is this okay, you know, if I use this or I don't use this?\" Sharing stories in advance was another example. Teeing up stories and narratives and then e-mails talking about which reporters are the best to go to for that from the DNC and then openly advising campaigns on strategy. So does this sound crazy? Well maybe not because write on paper, in those e-mails, we saw this happen once. There's no reason to think that it isn't happening again based on what you just laid out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's right. So you've been in and around TV a long time and you know that TV producers don't really want to talk about healthcare, they want to talk about sex scandals. It is not the juiciest topic and so, it's not like after -- I mean, CNN needs something new to talk about. They can't keep telling the same lies about collusion, but they wouldn't naturally all pick healthcare. The Democratic Party has decided that healthcare is the story of the day and CNN just dutifully repeats it and I have to wonder at some point, isn't this unregulated campaign activity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "It almost appears that way, but in a lot of networks, believe it or not, shows are very competitive with each other. They're competitive about guests. They're competitive about who has the better show and the higher ratings. You say, you know, we're all on the same team. Now, it doesn't really work like that with a lot of networks where different producers say, \"What are we going to do that's different from other shows to make us unique and make more people watch us and to see that sort of echo chamber,\" that's why yesterday, CNN didn't even average more than 540,000 viewers. That's a 40-year-old network with big brand name and a crazy news cycle, where you're talking about Smollett getting released, Avenatti getting arrested, the Mueller report -- how anybody isn't rising in ratings in this particular week when it's just been nuts, gift-wrapped for any cable news network, to only average 530,000 viewers, that's almost impossible to do unless your viewers don't trust you anymore based on all the speculation that you did recklessly and randomly over the last two years, Tucker."

Again, I mean, there are so many things to talk about. I do a talk radio show here in New York and we can't get to everything we want to because it's just been that insane. So where is everybody going? They're going somewhere else because clearly, they were promised something for two years that you're going to get collusion between Trump or Trump campaign officials and Russia, and it's like, you work for two years, you get your paycheck and the paycheck bounces and then instead of contrition, you see like the head of the Titanic, the captain saying that the orchestra did a great job playing the music while the ship was going down.

Today, Chicago Police released their investigative files on the case which were extensive and they revealed several pieces of evidence supporting the view that Smollett lied and that this is in fact a hoax, that's what they believe, that's what they've said publicly. Meanwhile, new reporting indicates that the State's Attorney, Kim Foxx, did not properly recuse herself as she claims she did and may have still unethically influenced the case. Fox's Matt Finn has more tonight from Chicago -- Matt."

Apparently, this case instead ended up in the hands of her right-hand man. The Cook County's clerk tells us that it cannot confirm if Foxx submitted paperwork formalizing her recusal. Fox's office has not responded to our multiple requests for clarification. Also this internal e-mail obtained by Fox News circulated around Kim Foxx's office today asks assistant attorneys to locate any cases that bolster Foxx's stance that dropping the Smollett charges is not as shocking as it appears. A portion of the e-mail reads, quote, \"Nobody is in trouble. We are just looking for further examples of how we, as prosecutors, use our discretion in a way that restores the victim, but causes minimal harm to the defendant in the long term.\" Today, Kim Foxx defended her actions saying there's confusion because people don't understand the intricacies of the judicial system."

They have concerns about the investigation.\" Foxx responded quote, \"Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson, I convinced him to reach out to the FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get to me shortly.\" Smollett maintains his innocence and has thanked the state of Illinois for their actions -- Tucker."

      "speaker": "MARK MORGAN, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not. Tucker, in my 25 years of law enforcement, I've never seen this. This is absolutely a miscarriage of justice and Chicago -- the city of Chicago should be outraged. The Police Department should be and they are outraged and it's not just for this indefensible decision, but it's also the way they did it. Again, I've never been in a situation where the investigators and the prosecution team didn't have a symbiotic relationship and they would have talked about this and talked about the decision and had discussions back and forth, but they did none of that and they disrespected the Police Department by not doing that and then they found about it at the same time you and I did. That's absolutely absurd. If I was the Chief, I would be demanding the State's Attorney give those hard-working detectives apology."

We have to be careful with that. So I'm assuming, if I was there, if I was especially in charge, I would definitely be talking to the Chief of Police and going through some of these facts that we just outlined here and say, \"Hey, what are our options here?\" But don't forget, you still have that letter. The FBI is still investigating that letter and that's not done yet."

It sounds like too many to me, speaking for myself, but this is just grotesque and it suggests that people who have connections, who know Michelle Obama, for example who are on TV shows get treated very differently than those who don't have those advantages. Is that you're your takeaway?"

All you've got to do is fork up 10 grand, a couple hours of community service and you're scot-free and you don't have to admit any guilt. That's the new bar."

Does that sound plausible to you? MORGAN; Look I don't want to talk about the community service, but what is not plausible is, is that they gave him -- he did that community service before they made the decision. That's also absurd."

This is not speculation, by the way. State's Attorney, Kim Foxx -- she's the person whose office dismissed the charges, the one we're just talking about -- received more than $400,000.00 in donations from foundations controlled by left-wing billionaire, George Soros and she's not the only one. Across America, Soros has been funding prosecutors who are interested in social justice, in many cases more than interested in protecting the public. Author and columnist Michelle Malkin has been following this story for quite some time. It hasn't, Michelle, received a lot of attention and that's a shame because it has, as we're watching now, profound implications sometimes."

      "speaker": "MICHELLE MALKIN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "It certainly does. George Soros has a plan. He always has a plan and he has executed it very efficiently and now we're seeing the fruits of it. This campaign to fund far left-wing prosecutor candidates in local district attorney's offices across the country has been in operation for at least four years publicly, probably a long time before that. It's of a piece with a separate plan that Soros and the Democracy Alliance had to put secretaries of state in office, too. And so this is involved in many cases, as in Chicago, far left candidates like Kim Foxx primary-ing incumbents who are also liberal, but not liberal enough and in Kim Foxx's race, the incumbent was somebody who the far left and Black Lives Matters and a lot of the identity politics groups were dissatisfied with because she didn't act fast enough on one of the police shooting cases involving a young man named, Laquan McDonald who was shot. So this is very interesting, Tucker, because we have Kim Foxx who was supposedly put there as a progressive to serve the poor and underrepresented minorities who didn't have a voice in Cook County and who was she carrying water for? Minority liberal elites in the establishment of the Cook County political machine tied to people like Tina Tchen and the Obamas."

Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29 and he served there for more than three decades. During that period, he ran for President twice. He made it to Vice President as you know, and now, he is making one last try for the highest office in America. The problem is that over the decades, the Democratic Party has changed a lot. The Party doesn't like people like Joe Biden anymore. He is the wrong sex, the wrong age. He has got the wrong skin color. If he wants to win, Biden will have to demonstrate that he hates himself profoundly and everything he stands for. Biden definitely wants to win, so he is doing exactly that. Last night, at an event in New York, Biden spent quite a bit of time attacking himself for the color of his own skin. He criticized his role in the Anita Hill hearings, which he described as quote, \"a bunch of white guys interrogating a black woman.\" And then he went further.

Biden wouldn't know that because he is an idiot. He doesn't read and he wouldn't care if he did know it. He will say anything. Whatever it takes. But for a second, consider what Joe Biden just said, what he's claiming. He says, \"English juror's prudential culture is what is holding America back.\" Is that true? Well, no, it's not true. It's the opposite of true. Our English common law tradition is why you are entitled to a jury trial. It's why you get a defense attorney when you're charged with a crime. It's why the police need a search warrant to search your house. These are the best things about America. The things that keep our country freer and fairer than any other place. Our system is the best in the world and the rest of the world understands that very well. That's why millions of them come here. Is there another place on the planet that Joe Biden would rather face a trial? I don't know, how about Malaysia? How about Jordan? How about even Italy? It will be fun to ask Biden that question. Who has got a better judicial system? The United States with its racist English traditions or say Somalia, the progressive Eden of the future? You've got 30 seconds to answer, Mr. Vice President, and remember Ilhan Omar is watching, so choose your words carefully. Well, the radical youth wing of the Democratic Party is getting more intense as the hysteria over Russia fades, that hysteria is being channeled instead to the cult of climate change. At a Congressional hearing yesterday, young pioneer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez repeated her claim that global warming is basically like World War II. They are the same she says because people are dying."

You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist. Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids have their blood is ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist.

And with that in mind, it's fascinating that neither Gillibrand nor Warren nor any other Democrat, not one in the United States Senate voted for the Green New Deal when it was just put up for a vote. Huh? Why didn't they? Well, maybe part of the reason is, nobody is dying from global warming. They are dying from lots of other things, but nobody is dying from global warming in this country. It is a sham just like the Russia investigation before it and the next sham after it.

And yet, Democrats had a chance to vote on it, but they didn't and then they said we're not voting on it because we don't have the science, the hearings about the science, but if they don't have the science, why are they making these claims in the first place?

That's purely speculative despite the lies that we hear, but one lie that really sticks out of my mind is that lots of people are dying from global warming. So I want to put up on the screen the actual death statistics. How do people die in the night United States? Here's how they do. So heart disease is number one; alcohol-related deaths, 88,000 a year; drugged ODs, 70,000; suicides, 45,000; motor vehicles, homicides are also very high. Here are the natural disaster deaths that climate people say are caused by climate -- wildfires, 106; cyclones, 102; winter storms, 31; major severe storms, eight -- so I guess my question is AOC tweets every day about the threat of global warming. She's tweeted once about suicide, why is that?"

We don't actually know what those are, but here's what we do know, the deaths from natural disasters are way lower than they were a hundred years ago. So it's not obvious that global warming is doing this. I mean, look at the deaths from hurricanes a hundred years ago, far more than now, a lot of reasons for that but come on now."

The spokesperson in Philadelphia for these sites is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and recently, he actually appeared in public and admitted that he knew when he got involved with these sites that they were actually illegal. So I think that the interesting question from my perspective is why are the proponents pushing them so hard if they know that they are illegal? And I think there's really two answers to that. First of all, they are pushing them because the proponents are arrogant. And secondly, they are pushing them because they have contempt for democracy and let me explain that a little bit. They are arrogant because they believe that the law doesn't apply to them. The law is just an inconvenience that other people have to worry about, but they have a higher purpose here and they don't have to worry about complying with the law. And I say that contempt for democracy because in America, the people's will is expressed through the law, okay, so if you are following the law or you're enforcing the law, you're showing your respect for democracy and when you're thumbing your nose at the law, like these proponents are doing, you're actually showing your disrespect and your contempt for democracy."

There is no support for these injection sites in the Kensington neighborhood where they've been proposed. There's no support in the Philadelphia City Council. There's no support in the Pennsylvania State Legislature. There's no support in Congress. But what you have is you have a small group of people who are very loud.

Why would anyone support someone who would spike the crime rate? MCSWAIN; Well, it's hard to get into the minds of voters, but I think the people are in some ways surprised at what's happening, okay. There are consequences to these decisions that are being made. Sometimes when you have people coming in promising a reform, you know, it sounds good on the surface, who can be against reform? But reform needs to be responsible. Reform needs to be incremental and reform needs to be step-by-step because if it's too aggressive, if it's too fast, if it's irresponsible, people lose their lives."

Today, he tweeted this, \"Just met with Sundar Pichai, President of Google who's obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. military, not the Chinese military. Also discussed political fairness and various things Google can do for the country. Meeting ended very well.\" Well, obviously, we hope the President is right about that and Google really is committed to fairness and the security of the United States, but as we have extensively reported on this show, they haven't been before. Google has massively expanded artificial intelligence research in China. The president's top General said that the work Google does helps the Chinese military. Meanwhile, Google is rejecting Pentagon contracts because they upset Google employees who don't like the United States. Now, whether or not Pichai is interested in political fairness, personally his employees are not demonstrably. As we revealed last year, Google employees wanted to manipulate search results to fight the President's travel ban and in yet another case, a Google employee used company resources to boost Hillary Clinton's voter turnout, so it's possible today's meeting went well, but it's important to remember who you're dealing with when you're talking to the President of Google. That's it for us. Back tomorrow, 8 p.m., the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
