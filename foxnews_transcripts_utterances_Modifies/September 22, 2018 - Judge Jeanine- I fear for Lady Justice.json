      "sentences": "Breaking tonight, a tentative agreement for Christine Blasey Ford to testify before a Senate committee on Thursday. Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals\" on the the New York Times best sellers list. We'll be talking throughout the hour about that breaking news on Christine Blasey Ford. A tentative agreement for the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of an attempted sexual assault to testify before the committee this Thursday. But again, this is tentative and both parties are still talking and hammering out the details.  We'll be talking about that more tonight with guests, including counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway as well as Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Charlie Kirk and Katrina Pierson from the Trump 2020 reelection campaign. But first to my open.  Now, I've spent my career in the trenches where crimes occur, where innocents are victimized, even slaughtered. I have actually fought on that battlefield for more than three decades where justice is sought for victims. And I have long fought for a level playing field, particularly for women. The often silent and forgotten victim of crime. I'm even advocating changing the name of the criminal justice system to the victims' justice system - the victim who never chose to be a part of the criminal justice system in the first place. I started the first domestic violence unit in the prosecutor's office in the nation in the late 1970s. As District Attorney, I created a sex crimes bureau. My crusade for women and children existed long before the #MeToo Movement.  I respect facts, I know the law and I understand what's at stake. Our criminal justice system is the most revered in the world. The constitutional rights of all Americans are etched in stone. And it is in this context that I analyze the situation we're in now. Number one, due process requires equal protection under the law for the victim as well as the accused. Number two, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. Number three, no warrant shall issue or criminal charge filed without probable cause. Number four, the accused has the right to a trial by an impartial jury. The right to remain silent. The right to not only confront his accuser but to cross-examine as well. Number five, the burden of proof in every criminal case is beyond a reasonable doubt and the burden of proof is on the prosecutor. Number six, as for the accused, there is absolutely no burden to speak or even present a case.  Now over the years, we've learned certain facts. Number one, sex crimes are underreported because of the victim's fears of not being believed or her fear of the perpetrator. Number two, the recidivism rate of sex offenders is estimated to be as high as 70%. So let us apply this foundational truth to the Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh situation. What motivation might someone have to come forward 36 years after an event and how credible could such an accusation be? Some members of Congress don't care about any of this. The woman has to be believed and he is guilty. Forget a trial, due process or even hearing from the victim, the Constitution be damned.",

      "sentences": "The dismissal of the fundamental rules of our justice system by congressmen, senators, congresswomen is stunning. Anyone who has prosecuted sex crimes cases knows that. Criminals rarely commit crimes in public or while a videotape is running. So in addition to the he said/she said, he look for corroborating evidence after we hear the core accusation of who, when, where and how.  Now we don't expect minuscule details when a victim is being traumatized. But here, the alleged victim does not know the address, the date, the owner of the house, how she got home that night. Why? What was her appearance when she got home. She was 15. Did her mother see her? Did he suffer a behavioral change? Did her grades go down? To whom did he complain and when?   In sex crime cases in particular, recent outcry is compelling and reliable. When the memory is fresh is when you would most expect the complaint. When is the first time she even used the name Kavanaugh? Here, there is no indication of any of that. Physical evidence such as torn clothes, injuries, visits to a doctor, a hospital, photographs. There is none. Corroborating witnesses, not are there none, but one who just reported that she heard about this at school retracted her story saying, \"I didn't think I would actually have to defend that.\" A man's reputation, family, career and civil liberties are at stake and you make a claim and you didn't think you had to be honest? And finally, does the complaint ring true? And a complaint does not gain credibility based on the name of the accused. If that were the case, Bill Clinton's accusers would certainly have gotten their day in court.  And what of the credibility and background of the accused. Sixty five women who have gone to school with him, dated him, worked for him and know him have come forward to say that his whole life has been about respecting women. Why, if there is such a high recidivism rate, a repeat of these crimes in violent sex crimes cases have we never heard anything like this after six FBI investigations? And motivation. Whenever a complaint is old any prosecutor would ask why now? Dr. Ford said she was outed. Well it was she who contacted two Democrat congress women six weeks before she came forward, and 36 years after it allegedly happened. And why take a lie detector test if she believed what she was saying? Why would she need an outsider to affirm whether what she's saying is true? Might it be part of a long hatched plan to reveal? Investigators ask for lie detector tests. And by the way, they're no unreliable that I fought for a law in New York that wouldn't allow police to require women to take lie detector tests because they're unreliable.  Now while Ford is highly political, one incident is even more compelling. Do you remember when a President nominated Brett Kavanaugh, we heard that Kavanaugh's mother was a judge. Ford's parents - follow me. Ford's parents had a foreclosure claim against them and their home in 1996 in Maryland. Ford's parents lost their home. The judge ruled against them. The judge was a woman. The judge was Brett Kavanaugh's mother.  Many time victims are teed up by attorneys who want to become famous or rich. Sometimes they're even used by politicians. Take a look.",

She was an intern in Hawaii a few years ago. How did she make that trip? Did she drive or surf across the ocean from California to Hawaii. And what's with this, \"we need the FBI.\" There's no Federal crime here. They keep saying \"we need the FBI,\" but they don't ask for it because they know it can't happen. If you want an investigation, call the local police or 911. My friends, truth and justice and law and order don't change depending on the political parties. Women are to be believed not because a political party thinks they should be, but when they sound credible and present a believable scenario. And believability does not depend on the party of the complainant. And all men who are accused have a right to be cloaked in the presumption of innocence unless and until proof beyond a reasonable doubt shatters that presumption.  And it matters not what your politics are, that Lady Justice is blind, has been the truth in our system from time immemorial. I have honored that lady. I've admired her and be in awe of her for as long as I can remember. But now I fear for her. I fear for Lady Justice.

It's that they're headlining a fund raiser for one of the 100 senators who is going to vote on Judge Kavanaugh becoming a Supreme Court Justice. So lots of different conflicts, but I think those who appreciate transparency and accountability are calling for it ought to know that, and guess who is leading that charge, one Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   You know, Jeanine, last Sunday was the first time Judge Kavanaugh heard the name of the - got the identity of his accuser, Dr. Ford. And less than 24 hours later, he gave his statement, his sworn statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee and that's under lots of penalties, of course, if you lie to Congress, it's - I believe, it's definitely punishable. But he did so less than 24 hours of even knowing her identity. Why? Because his story has never changed. It's always been the same.  He's been willing to raise his right hand and testify to clear his name and to say under oath and publicly for all to see and hear what he has said already, which is that he categorically and unequivocally denies this.",

She's the newest - she'd go, pull the transcript. But more importantly, there were private conversations between Senator Feinstein for example, who sat on this letter and Chairman Grassley understand - and judge Kavanaugh. That's the kind of form through which you touch upon sensitive matters.  One would think this would qualify as a sensitive matter. Nobody mentioned it. So two things, quickly, one is - it is completely at the seat of Senator Feinstein and the Democrats that Dr. Ford's anonymity was ever breached and her identity ever disclosed, number one. The whole chain of custody for that identity rested with the Democrats. Number two, you can argue that the whole reason she's getting a hearing, the whole reason she'll have a public say is because of the Republicans, not the Democrats. The Senate Judiciary Committee led by Chairman Grassley is honoring her request to testify. The White House has said all week, \"Let her speak.\" Everybody has said \"Let her speak.\" But to let her speak means, she's actually coming to speak, and not using cheap words like bullying. Nobody is bullying her. Nobody want her to be unsafe. It's not bullying to say \"Please adhere ...\"",

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight, a tentative agreement for Christine Blasey Ford to testify before a Senate committee on Thursday. Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals\" on the the New York Times best sellers list. We'll be talking throughout the hour about that breaking news on Christine Blasey Ford. A tentative agreement for the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of an attempted sexual assault to testify before the committee this Thursday. But again, this is tentative and both parties are still talking and hammering out the details. We'll be talking about that more tonight with guests, including counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway as well as Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Charlie Kirk and Katrina Pierson from the Trump 2020 reelection campaign. But first to my open. Now, I've spent my career in the trenches where crimes occur, where innocents are victimized, even slaughtered. I have actually fought on that battlefield for more than three decades where justice is sought for victims. And I have long fought for a level playing field, particularly for women. The often silent and forgotten victim of crime. I'm even advocating changing the name of the criminal justice system to the victims' justice system - the victim who never chose to be a part of the criminal justice system in the first place. I started the first domestic violence unit in the prosecutor's office in the nation in the late 1970s. As District Attorney, I created a sex crimes bureau. My crusade for women and children existed long before the #MeToo Movement. I respect facts, I know the law and I understand what's at stake. Our criminal justice system is the most revered in the world. The constitutional rights of all Americans are etched in stone. And it is in this context that I analyze the situation we're in now. Number one, due process requires equal protection under the law for the victim as well as the accused. Number two, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. Number three, no warrant shall issue or criminal charge filed without probable cause. Number four, the accused has the right to a trial by an impartial jury. The right to remain silent. The right to not only confront his accuser but to cross-examine as well. Number five, the burden of proof in every criminal case is beyond a reasonable doubt and the burden of proof is on the prosecutor. Number six, as for the accused, there is absolutely no burden to speak or even present a case. Now over the years, we've learned certain facts. Number one, sex crimes are underreported because of the victim's fears of not being believed or her fear of the perpetrator. Number two, the recidivism rate of sex offenders is estimated to be as high as 70%. So let us apply this foundational truth to the Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh situation. What motivation might someone have to come forward 36 years after an event and how credible could such an accusation be? Some members of Congress don't care about any of this. The woman has to be believed and he is guilty. Forget a trial, due process or even hearing from the victim, the Constitution be damned."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "The dismissal of the fundamental rules of our justice system by congressmen, senators, congresswomen is stunning. Anyone who has prosecuted sex crimes cases knows that. Criminals rarely commit crimes in public or while a videotape is running. So in addition to the he said/she said, he look for corroborating evidence after we hear the core accusation of who, when, where and how. Now we don't expect minuscule details when a victim is being traumatized. But here, the alleged victim does not know the address, the date, the owner of the house, how she got home that night. Why? What was her appearance when she got home. She was 15. Did her mother see her? Did he suffer a behavioral change? Did her grades go down? To whom did he complain and when? In sex crime cases in particular, recent outcry is compelling and reliable. When the memory is fresh is when you would most expect the complaint. When is the first time she even used the name Kavanaugh? Here, there is no indication of any of that. Physical evidence such as torn clothes, injuries, visits to a doctor, a hospital, photographs. There is none. Corroborating witnesses, not are there none, but one who just reported that she heard about this at school retracted her story saying, \"I didn't think I would actually have to defend that.\" A man's reputation, family, career and civil liberties are at stake and you make a claim and you didn't think you had to be honest? And finally, does the complaint ring true? And a complaint does not gain credibility based on the name of the accused. If that were the case, Bill Clinton's accusers would certainly have gotten their day in court. And what of the credibility and background of the accused. Sixty five women who have gone to school with him, dated him, worked for him and know him have come forward to say that his whole life has been about respecting women. Why, if there is such a high recidivism rate, a repeat of these crimes in violent sex crimes cases have we never heard anything like this after six FBI investigations? And motivation. Whenever a complaint is old any prosecutor would ask why now? Dr. Ford said she was outed. Well it was she who contacted two Democrat congress women six weeks before she came forward, and 36 years after it allegedly happened. And why take a lie detector test if she believed what she was saying? Why would she need an outsider to affirm whether what she's saying is true? Might it be part of a long hatched plan to reveal? Investigators ask for lie detector tests. And by the way, they're no unreliable that I fought for a law in New York that wouldn't allow police to require women to take lie detector tests because they're unreliable. Now while Ford is highly political, one incident is even more compelling. Do you remember when a President nominated Brett Kavanaugh, we heard that Kavanaugh's mother was a judge. Ford's parents - follow me. Ford's parents had a foreclosure claim against them and their home in 1996 in Maryland. Ford's parents lost their home. The judge ruled against them. The judge was a woman. The judge was Brett Kavanaugh's mother. Many time victims are teed up by attorneys who want to become famous or rich. Sometimes they're even used by politicians. Take a look."

      "utterance": "No, not 48 hours ago, 36 years ago. Delay becomes even more absurd when she needs to drive across the country to Washington because she won't or can't fly. She was an intern in Hawaii a few years ago. How did she make that trip? Did she drive or surf across the ocean from California to Hawaii. And what's with this, \"we need the FBI.\" There's no Federal crime here. They keep saying \"we need the FBI,\" but they don't ask for it because they know it can't happen. If you want an investigation, call the local police or 911. My friends, truth and justice and law and order don't change depending on the political parties. Women are to be believed not because a political party thinks they should be, but when they sound credible and present a believable scenario. And believability does not depend on the party of the complainant. And all men who are accused have a right to be cloaked in the presumption of innocence unless and until proof beyond a reasonable doubt shatters that presumption. And it matters not what your politics are, that Lady Justice is blind, has been the truth in our system from time immemorial. I have honored that lady. I've admired her and be in awe of her for as long as I can remember. But now I fear for her. I fear for Lady Justice. But not just Lady Justice, our institutions and our bedrock constitutional rules that have made America what Ronald Reagan referred to as the shining city on the hill. We can never allow that to happen. And that's my open.

The news flash here of course is not that they're Democrats. We knew that. It's that they're headlining a fund raiser for one of the 100 senators who is going to vote on Judge Kavanaugh becoming a Supreme Court Justice. So lots of different conflicts, but I think those who appreciate transparency and accountability are calling for it ought to know that, and guess who is leading that charge, one Judge Brett Kavanaugh. You know, Jeanine, last Sunday was the first time Judge Kavanaugh heard the name of the - got the identity of his accuser, Dr. Ford. And less than 24 hours later, he gave his statement, his sworn statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee and that's under lots of penalties, of course, if you lie to Congress, it's - I believe, it's definitely punishable. But he did so less than 24 hours of even knowing her identity. Why? Because his story has never changed. It's always been the same. He's been willing to raise his right hand and testify to clear his name and to say under oath and publicly for all to see and hear what he has said already, which is that he categorically and unequivocally denies this."

She had asked Judge Kavanaugh a similar question, but she asked him, \"Since you've been a legal adult, have you done this?\" But by the way, she was just doing that because that's what she does. She's the newest - she'd go, pull the transcript. But more importantly, there were private conversations between Senator Feinstein for example, who sat on this letter and Chairman Grassley understand - and judge Kavanaugh. That's the kind of form through which you touch upon sensitive matters. One would think this would qualify as a sensitive matter. Nobody mentioned it. So two things, quickly, one is - it is completely at the seat of Senator Feinstein and the Democrats that Dr. Ford's anonymity was ever breached and her identity ever disclosed, number one. The whole chain of custody for that identity rested with the Democrats. Number two, you can argue that the whole reason she's getting a hearing, the whole reason she'll have a public say is because of the Republicans, not the Democrats. The Senate Judiciary Committee led by Chairman Grassley is honoring her request to testify. The White House has said all week, \"Let her speak.\" Everybody has said \"Let her speak.\" But to let her speak means, she's actually coming to speak, and not using cheap words like bullying. Nobody is bullying her. Nobody want her to be unsafe. It's not bullying to say \"Please adhere ...\""

This is part of the Senate confirmation hearing. And what I think is important to notice , Judge Kavanaugh, this man of integrity, intellect and character, he has said he has never done this to anyone including her. So that's really definitive and unequivocal. And he's also said he wasn't at the party. So she will have it - these allegations are serious. We take them seriously. We want to hear from her."

New details tonight from Fox News contributor and investigative reporter, Sara Carter live as \"Justice\" rolls on in a moment. Developing tonight, is Rod Rosenstein rogue in the DOJ? According to a bombshell report from the the New York Times back in the spring of 2017, the Deputy Attorney General suggested secretly recording his conversations with the President, and floated the idea to invoke the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein denies it all. Fox News contributor and she's more than a Fox News contributor, she has been working for two years as a national security investigative reporter on this Mueller issue and she comes to us with decades of investigating - of being an investigative reporter and I could go on, Sara, but I'm not. So, let's talk about it. Because you are a source of so much that has been exposed in the last two years and I salute you for that. I really do. Now, do you believe the story that Rosenstein suggested taping the President and using the 25th Amendment to get him out of office?"

That means they were in communication with the Department of Justice during those two months. They were trying to verify all of the information in their story. They had other sources. We know this based on Andrew McCabe's memoirs, as well as Lisa Page's. Now, I know people are concerned. McCabe has lied in the past. That's why the Inspector General is looking into him. But look, he has nothing to lose. He is like a rat on a sinking ship with a bunch of other rats, Judge Jeanine, and he is going to take people down with him. He doesn't want to be the only guy to go down. He had these memos. He had these memos for over a year and other people have had them, too at the FBI, apparently they leaked.

But let me tell you this, I don't like him for a lot of reasons, not the least of which that he slow-walked all of the Congressional DOJ and FBI subpoenaed stuff to Congress and redacted just about everything. I don't trust him. He brought Mueller to be interviewed as FBI head and then appointed him the next day to investigate Trump, all right. I don't like any of these players. It's not about like. They disrespect our system of justice, which seems to be going on all over. But Rod Rosenstein, what is coming now when the president declassifies - and I don't know how much he's agreed to declassify and I want to know from you.

The president needs to declassify these documents. The sources I've spoken to who has seen these documents, who have the classification to view them had said there is nothing in there that is in any way damaging to sources and methods or national security. What is going to be damaging is to Rod Rosenstein, John Brennan and others going to be implicated once the information goes public.

Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and I unveil the winners next. Another week, another outrageous statement by none other than as Sean says, joyless Joy Behar. Take a listen. JOY BEHAR, HOST, \"THE VIEW\": These people in Congress right now and that Senate Judiciary Committee, these white men - old by the way, are not protecting women. They're protecting a man who is probably guilty."

This guy has a reputation, a DNA that doesn't reflect anything like that and he's guilty and it's a whole bunch of white men. But Joy, you might not know this but when I first started prosecuting rape cases, it was white men who were passing the laws that allowed us to do a lot of it. Of course, we came in and moved the wall forward, but talk to me, Charlie."

Was it white men that actually leaked this to the press that made Dr. Ford no longer be anonymous or not be known as her original wishes were? I'll tell you what, this is so disgusting. And I'll say to Dianne Feinstein and Joy Behar, they have selective outrage. They are now saying that he's probably guilty. Judge, as you well know, in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty and that is something that is very unique about western civilization and our judicial system. Now, the Democrats believe that the accusation means you must be immediately guilty, but only if you're a conservative. If you're Keith Ellison or Bill Clinton, then you're allowed to go after the victims and then you're innocent until proven guilty."

Keith Ellison's girlfriend - police report, photographs, tapes, doctor's report. Bill Clinton - Juanita Broaddrick. She had the lip, she reported it immediately. She was all - these Democrats are turning the Constitution upside down. It's an outrage and I fear for this nation. But anyway, all right ..."

Thirty five years later from high school and that's going to prevent a man with a sterling record and reputation to serve in the Supreme Court, I don't think so. If there are any Republican senators listening to this, you better not capitulate and let the sinister left angry mob win on this. Because then, they will never stop using these dirty tactics."

We all have crazy aunts and relatives and my family is no different. I hope they find peace in their hearts and let go of all of the hate.

It's kind of disappointing though because you would think this would be one thing where politics should be removed, which would be your family ties. But nevertheless, these six angry Democrat siblings are finding that their political affiliation is much more important than the sibling ties that they have. This is a constant theme though for the left, their identity is their ideology and the family ties do not mean as much."

Okay, we were out there to see the President and I went out with Sean and - to do the \"Hannity\" show. That's the lobby. Those are fresh flowers. You can't tell. All right, there I am with Alyssa Carey, she is one of the producers on \"Hannity.\" We're having a green drink, then I'm with Tiffany Fazio who is like the big boss on \"Hannity\" and then there is lunch. You could see a big sandwich and French fries and salad and an egg white omelet to make up for the fries. That's me and Gregg Jarrett getting wired up in front of an audience of about 20,000 in Las Vegas. There is the president and I chatting and that is Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Sean Hannity and myself and there is the beast, that's the President car. Don't forget to buy my book, \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals.\" This is Jeanine signing off. Thank you. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
