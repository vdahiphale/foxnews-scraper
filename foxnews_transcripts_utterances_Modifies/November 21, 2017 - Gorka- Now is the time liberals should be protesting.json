      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Mark. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. A massive new Democratic scandal is developing tonight. That is in fact, Congressman Bob Brady is being investigated over the FBI on allegations that he bribed his 2012 primary opponent to drop out of the race and for later lying to investigators. Also tonight, the liberal establishment is being rocked by a new wave of sexual misconduct allegations. Plus, the reckoning continues for the Clintons. Right here we will expose the bigot enablers of Bill's predatory behavior over the year. That is tonight's breaking news opening monologue.  We start tonight, liberal media lion Charlie Rose has now been fired by CBS, PBS and Bloomberg TV. They have all cut ties to the anchor after the numerous damning bizarre sexual misconduct accusations. '  Now, the original allegations are coming from a Washington Post report where eight women are accusing Rose of inappropriate sexual behavior. This behavior includes making unwanted sexual advances, lewd phone calls, prancing around naked in front of people that were accusers, but also strangers, and even groping them.  In a statement to The Washington Post, Rose did apologize for his inappropriate behavior. He says he was mistaken for pursuing what he thought were shared feelings. And earlier tonight, more accusers in fact have come forward. CBS News is now reporting that three more women who work at the company are also accusing Rose of unwanted sexual contact.  And also tonight, the House Ethics Committee is investigating Democratic Congressman John Conyers after he admitted that his office paid out $27,000 of taxpayer money to settle a harassment complaint from a former staffer. The staffers says she was fired after rejecting the lawmaker sexual advances. However, Conyers, he denies that claim. And today, the congressman and his office put out a statement confirming the settlement, but it said, quote, \"The amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment.\" Conyers still has some explaining to do, because according to the same bombshell report from BuzzFeed, other staffers have accused Conyers of requesting sexual favors and inappropriate touching, and one aide says her job was to use your taxpayer dollars to fly in women she assumed Congressman Conyers was having an affairs with. And BuzzFeed is also reporting tonight that a new accuser is speaking out about Conyers saying that she faced daily sexual harassment from the Democratic congressman that included unwanted touching.  Now, Congressman Conyers, he is saying he will cooperate with the ethics investigations.   Look, I don't agree with the word this guy has ever said over the years, but like everybody else, he is denying it. He's been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, and as of now with his denials he deserves the presumption of innocence. Every American as I've been saying is entitled to that. I remain one of the few people on the air in the media that are consistent. Also, Democratic Congressman Conyers isn't alone when it comes to sexual misconduct allegations. Two women have also come forward to accuse Senator Grope, Al Franken, of inappropriately touching them. Senator Franken is now owning up to those allegations, most likely because there is photographic evidence. Remember radio host Leanne Tweeden released this photo where Franken is seen groping her while she was actually sleeping while they were both on a 2006 USO tour. And another woman put out this photo where she is alleging that Senator Franken grabbed her behind while taking a picture back in 2010. And as we've been telling you, Senator Al Franken has a long history of making all kinds of lewd and sexually offensive jokes, including one about actually drugging and raping Leslie Stahl, of course she's a cohost of \"60 Minutes.\"   Also tonight, we have new photos that have been uncovered. They show Franken groping Arianna Huffington during a 2000 photoshoot. And here you can see Franken grabbing Huffington's breasts. And the second photo shows Franken touching her behind. And Arianna Huffington is rushing to Franken's defense tonight and saying they were just having fun in that people shouldn't be offended by the photos. Now, the rest of the mainstream media won't tell you this, but this kind of gross behavior is part of a pattern when it comes to Al Franken. Take a look at this photo from 2000. Franken is seen right there inappropriately touching Joy Behar while they are on the red carpet together. And just like Huffington, Behar shares his politics and she is downplaying the photo and defended Franken's actions. Look, I've known Arianna for a long time. She and Joy Behar, if they don't think anything is wrong with that, that is their choice. But from the outside, it looks kind of creepy and it's probably something most people would think as well.  I think many people will look at all of these photos find that type of behavior beyond offensive. And what we are now seeing in Franken is a pattern. Al Franken, Leanne Tweeden, she is asleep when he did that to her. And she rightfully was offended.   Also tonight, yet another sexual misconduct scandal is now rocking Hollywood. This time from the chief creative officer and founder of Disney's Pixar, and a huge Democratic donor, John Lasseter. And according to the Hollywood reporter, Lasseter is now taking a leave of absence for what he is calling, quote, \"missteps,\" but others are calling it a pattern of unwanted grabbing, hugging and kissing. And also in other news tonight, the president has weighed in on the Alabama Senate race with Roy Moore. Let's take a look at what he had to say.",

I mean, if you look at what is really going on and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn't happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. You were talking about -- he said 40 years ago this did not happen.  Roy Moore denies it. That's all I can say, he denies it.

      "sentences": "And as the White House has been saying all week, President Trump, well, he is going to let the voters of Alabama decide the fate of Judge Roy Moore in light of Moore's vehement denials and repeated denials.   And finally, as we promised to do last night, tonight we are naming names. We are exposing the people who have covered up for the Clintons for 30 plus years and made excuses for all of their behavior, all while attempting to discredit and utterly destroy all of his accusers. Let's start with the raging Cajun James Carville. Now, he ran Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, one of the fiercest defenders of Bill's sexual transgressions. For instance, Carville made this infamous comment about Paula Jones, who sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Quote, \"If you drag $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you were going to find.\" And it was Carville who also slammed Jones by saying her lawsuit was, quote, \"all about money, plain and simple, and a healthy dose of right-wing politics.\" Now, the Jones case was a lot more serious than Carville ever claimed because Clinton did end up paying over $850,000 in an out-of-court settlement.  Next, former Clinton senior advisor, now ABC, Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos, he wrote in his memoir, that in 1991 Hillary Clinton said \"we have to destroy her when\" describing one of Bill's accusers. He also helped oversee the Clinton campaign war room, all in order to deal with what some on the campaign we're referring to as bimbo eruptions. And then in '99 after he left the White House, well, George Stephanopoulos confessed to NPR that he put aside his doubts on Bill Clinton, why? Because he believed in the future president's message and because he was an ambitious guy and he wanted to work in the White House.  Next up, NBC. Well, that's the network that helped protect the Clintons for decades. In January of '99 NBC news reporter Lisa Myers taped the first exclusive interview with Juanita Broaddrick. I had the second. Remember Juanita Broaddrick accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978. And as The Washington Post reported at the time, instead of airing the interview, NBC News President Andy Lack, he's still on the job, and other top executives, well, sat on that interview for over a month, and at the time NBC claimed, well, they couldn't corroborate Broaddrick's accusations so it didn't air until February.   Now, while all of this was going on, at the time our colleague Brit Hume here on the Fox News Channel and his panelists, well, they actually were wearing Free Lisa Myers buttons on air to encourage NBC to run the interview. Then in 2016, NBC correspondent -- this was just last year -- Andrea Mitchell, she falsely tried to claim that Broaddrick's claims had been discredited following an interview that I did with candidate Trump.

Now, The New York Times also jumped into attack Clinton's accuser. Now, check out this headline from an op-ed. \"New York Times: Monica the marketer changes history script.\" That piece goes on to mock all the ways that Monica Lewinsky in the future would be able to capitalize from her affair with Bill Clinton.  And finally, here's worst enabler of them all, Hillary Clinton herself, who did everything within her power to smear, slander, besmirch all of her husband's accusers. In 1992, when it all got started, Gennifer Flowers announced she had a 12 year affair with Bill Clinton. Well, Hillary and Bill, they raced to CBS and \"60 Minutes,\" why? To trash her character. And then later, Hillary attempted to smear Flowers when telling Vanity Fair, quote, well, \"If we had been in front of a jury I would say, 'Ms. Flowers, isn't it true that you were asked by the AP in June of 1990 and you said no? Weren't you asked by the Arkansas Democrat and you said no?' I mean I would crucify her.\" Wow. Bill of course later ended up testifying under oath, yes, Gennifer told the truth. He did have a sexual relationship with Gennifer Flowers.  And in the case of Monica Lewinsky, well, Hillary's friend, Diane Blaire wrote in her journal that Hillary called the young White House intern, in her young 20s, a narcissistic Loony Tune. And then there's Kathleen Willey who accused Bill Clinton of groping and grabbing and fondling and touching and kissing her against her will. Well, she later said that Hillary enabled Bill's horrific behavior.   Juanita Broaddrick said that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her after she was allegedly raped by Bill Clinton. And we can't forget how Hillary Clinton blamed all of this, all of it, they're all in a vast right wing conspiracy.  Remember this.",

I think there is an enormous difference between Harvey Weinstein, who clearly is a sexual predator, and who clearly was exploiting his position of power and President George H.W. Bush, who is in his 90s in a wheelchair. And I think we have all these things coming together because of the infantile stupidity of our news media. As though they are all the same problem. Now the topic is an important topic. And finding a way to have not just a work place, but to have a community where people are not being harassed or being preyed upon, I think that's important. Finding with the rules ought to be, and I commend Speaker Paul Ryan, who immediately responded by talking about getting mandatory training in the house.

Now Solomon has boiled down the newest revelations in a piece for the Hill detailing the five new revelations. First, Russia saw its purchase of uranium one as part of a larger strategy to dominate global uranium markets, including making the United States more dependent on Moscow's nuclear fuel. Great. It is our uranium. Next, uranium one did export some of its U.S. uranium ore. Then, the FBI informant does have information to share with congress about Rosatom's uranium one purchase. Next, the FBI did have evidence that Rosatom officials were engaged in criminality while before the Obama administration approved their purchase of uranium one. And finally, justice officials, they trusted Campbell, he is the informant, enough to keep them working undercover for six years and to pay him more than $51,000 once convictions were secured. Here with reaction, investigative reporter Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett is with us. Sara, let's start with you because you also had a piece. You call it a treasure trove now of information. I only thought it was for years, it's six years the informant worked for the FBI.

Now, for decades, the incredibly liberal left wing news network has been covering for both Bill and Hillary Clinton. This effort has been led by NBC News Chairman Andy Lack is his name and he ran the company in the late 1990s. The very same time that Juanita Broderick accused President Bill Clinton of rape. And as the Washington Post reported, NBC sat on that interview with Broderick for at least a month saying the story wasn't corroborated at that time. They finally aired it in February of '99. Our challenge to Andy Lack, NBC News, simple air the interview with Juanita Broderick in its entirety on NBC and primetime. Let the people in this country see and hear and decide for themselves what former President Bill Clinton is accused of doing. Certainly going to be better than those \"Dateline\" reruns ad nauseam that you play. NBC News, Andy Lack, are you going to give them the proper platform that you sat on or is Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's reputation still that important to you? They don't have power anymore. That is all the time we have left this evening. This show will never be the mainstream media. We are not the destroy Trump media, we're fair and balanced. Thank you for being with us.

      "utterance": "All right. Thanks, Mark. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. A massive new Democratic scandal is developing tonight. That is in fact, Congressman Bob Brady is being investigated over the FBI on allegations that he bribed his 2012 primary opponent to drop out of the race and for later lying to investigators. Also tonight, the liberal establishment is being rocked by a new wave of sexual misconduct allegations. Plus, the reckoning continues for the Clintons. Right here we will expose the bigot enablers of Bill's predatory behavior over the year. That is tonight's breaking news opening monologue. We start tonight, liberal media lion Charlie Rose has now been fired by CBS, PBS and Bloomberg TV. They have all cut ties to the anchor after the numerous damning bizarre sexual misconduct accusations. ' Now, the original allegations are coming from a Washington Post report where eight women are accusing Rose of inappropriate sexual behavior. This behavior includes making unwanted sexual advances, lewd phone calls, prancing around naked in front of people that were accusers, but also strangers, and even groping them. In a statement to The Washington Post, Rose did apologize for his inappropriate behavior. He says he was mistaken for pursuing what he thought were shared feelings. And earlier tonight, more accusers in fact have come forward. CBS News is now reporting that three more women who work at the company are also accusing Rose of unwanted sexual contact. And also tonight, the House Ethics Committee is investigating Democratic Congressman John Conyers after he admitted that his office paid out $27,000 of taxpayer money to settle a harassment complaint from a former staffer. The staffers says she was fired after rejecting the lawmaker sexual advances. However, Conyers, he denies that claim. And today, the congressman and his office put out a statement confirming the settlement, but it said, quote, \"The amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment.\" Conyers still has some explaining to do, because according to the same bombshell report from BuzzFeed, other staffers have accused Conyers of requesting sexual favors and inappropriate touching, and one aide says her job was to use your taxpayer dollars to fly in women she assumed Congressman Conyers was having an affairs with. And BuzzFeed is also reporting tonight that a new accuser is speaking out about Conyers saying that she faced daily sexual harassment from the Democratic congressman that included unwanted touching. Now, Congressman Conyers, he is saying he will cooperate with the ethics investigations. Look, I don't agree with the word this guy has ever said over the years, but like everybody else, he is denying it. He's been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, and as of now with his denials he deserves the presumption of innocence. Every American as I've been saying is entitled to that. I remain one of the few people on the air in the media that are consistent. Also, Democratic Congressman Conyers isn't alone when it comes to sexual misconduct allegations. Two women have also come forward to accuse Senator Grope, Al Franken, of inappropriately touching them. Senator Franken is now owning up to those allegations, most likely because there is photographic evidence. Remember radio host Leanne Tweeden released this photo where Franken is seen groping her while she was actually sleeping while they were both on a 2006 USO tour. And another woman put out this photo where she is alleging that Senator Franken grabbed her behind while taking a picture back in 2010. And as we've been telling you, Senator Al Franken has a long history of making all kinds of lewd and sexually offensive jokes, including one about actually drugging and raping Leslie Stahl, of course she's a cohost of \"60 Minutes.\" Also tonight, we have new photos that have been uncovered. They show Franken groping Arianna Huffington during a 2000 photoshoot. And here you can see Franken grabbing Huffington's breasts. And the second photo shows Franken touching her behind. And Arianna Huffington is rushing to Franken's defense tonight and saying they were just having fun in that people shouldn't be offended by the photos. Now, the rest of the mainstream media won't tell you this, but this kind of gross behavior is part of a pattern when it comes to Al Franken. Take a look at this photo from 2000. Franken is seen right there inappropriately touching Joy Behar while they are on the red carpet together. And just like Huffington, Behar shares his politics and she is downplaying the photo and defended Franken's actions. Look, I've known Arianna for a long time. She and Joy Behar, if they don't think anything is wrong with that, that is their choice. But from the outside, it looks kind of creepy and it's probably something most people would think as well. I think many people will look at all of these photos find that type of behavior beyond offensive. And what we are now seeing in Franken is a pattern. Al Franken, Leanne Tweeden, she is asleep when he did that to her. And she rightfully was offended. Also tonight, yet another sexual misconduct scandal is now rocking Hollywood. This time from the chief creative officer and founder of Disney's Pixar, and a huge Democratic donor, John Lasseter. And according to the Hollywood reporter, Lasseter is now taking a leave of absence for what he is calling, quote, \"missteps,\" but others are calling it a pattern of unwanted grabbing, hugging and kissing. And also in other news tonight, the president has weighed in on the Alabama Senate race with Roy Moore. Let's take a look at what he had to say."

It's terrible on the border, it's terrible on the military. Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn't happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. You were talking about -- he said 40 years ago this did not happen. Roy Moore denies it. That's all I can say, he denies it. And by the way, he totally denies it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And as the White House has been saying all week, President Trump, well, he is going to let the voters of Alabama decide the fate of Judge Roy Moore in light of Moore's vehement denials and repeated denials. And finally, as we promised to do last night, tonight we are naming names. We are exposing the people who have covered up for the Clintons for 30 plus years and made excuses for all of their behavior, all while attempting to discredit and utterly destroy all of his accusers. Let's start with the raging Cajun James Carville. Now, he ran Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, one of the fiercest defenders of Bill's sexual transgressions. For instance, Carville made this infamous comment about Paula Jones, who sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Quote, \"If you drag $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you were going to find.\" And it was Carville who also slammed Jones by saying her lawsuit was, quote, \"all about money, plain and simple, and a healthy dose of right-wing politics.\" Now, the Jones case was a lot more serious than Carville ever claimed because Clinton did end up paying over $850,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Next, former Clinton senior advisor, now ABC, Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos, he wrote in his memoir, that in 1991 Hillary Clinton said \"we have to destroy her when\" describing one of Bill's accusers. He also helped oversee the Clinton campaign war room, all in order to deal with what some on the campaign we're referring to as bimbo eruptions. And then in '99 after he left the White House, well, George Stephanopoulos confessed to NPR that he put aside his doubts on Bill Clinton, why? Because he believed in the future president's message and because he was an ambitious guy and he wanted to work in the White House. Next up, NBC. Well, that's the network that helped protect the Clintons for decades. In January of '99 NBC news reporter Lisa Myers taped the first exclusive interview with Juanita Broaddrick. I had the second. Remember Juanita Broaddrick accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978. And as The Washington Post reported at the time, instead of airing the interview, NBC News President Andy Lack, he's still on the job, and other top executives, well, sat on that interview for over a month, and at the time NBC claimed, well, they couldn't corroborate Broaddrick's accusations so it didn't air until February. Now, while all of this was going on, at the time our colleague Brit Hume here on the Fox News Channel and his panelists, well, they actually were wearing Free Lisa Myers buttons on air to encourage NBC to run the interview. Then in 2016, NBC correspondent -- this was just last year -- Andrea Mitchell, she falsely tried to claim that Broaddrick's claims had been discredited following an interview that I did with candidate Trump. Watch this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Again, NBC was so offended by that. They later edited the online version of that clip to remove Andrea Mitchell using the word discredited. Now, The New York Times also jumped into attack Clinton's accuser. Now, check out this headline from an op-ed. \"New York Times: Monica the marketer changes history script.\" That piece goes on to mock all the ways that Monica Lewinsky in the future would be able to capitalize from her affair with Bill Clinton. And finally, here's worst enabler of them all, Hillary Clinton herself, who did everything within her power to smear, slander, besmirch all of her husband's accusers. In 1992, when it all got started, Gennifer Flowers announced she had a 12 year affair with Bill Clinton. Well, Hillary and Bill, they raced to CBS and \"60 Minutes,\" why? To trash her character. And then later, Hillary attempted to smear Flowers when telling Vanity Fair, quote, well, \"If we had been in front of a jury I would say, 'Ms. Flowers, isn't it true that you were asked by the AP in June of 1990 and you said no? Weren't you asked by the Arkansas Democrat and you said no?' I mean I would crucify her.\" Wow. Bill of course later ended up testifying under oath, yes, Gennifer told the truth. He did have a sexual relationship with Gennifer Flowers. And in the case of Monica Lewinsky, well, Hillary's friend, Diane Blaire wrote in her journal that Hillary called the young White House intern, in her young 20s, a narcissistic Loony Tune. And then there's Kathleen Willey who accused Bill Clinton of groping and grabbing and fondling and touching and kissing her against her will. Well, she later said that Hillary enabled Bill's horrific behavior. Juanita Broaddrick said that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her after she was allegedly raped by Bill Clinton. And we can't forget how Hillary Clinton blamed all of this, all of it, they're all in a vast right wing conspiracy. Remember this."

Because they made this all possible. Whether it was covering for Ted Kennedy. Whether it was covering for Bill Clinton. They've created this mantra for 30 years. It's just sex. It's okay. It's private, don't worry about it. This created a culture of permissiveness. As a result, the political side of the aisle that says, we are for women, we support the victim. They have completely hollowed out their own moral standing. And I want to see a reckoning right now, I want to see the real feminists get out on the street.

So, you have all of these cases, in some cases the sexual harassment cases, mistreatment of people cases. And some people admit it. And then you have instances where they do not, and then we are hearing $15 million of taxpayer money was paid out by members of Congress. Shouldn't the American people, they don't want to pay it themselves, shouldn't we know who's money, who is paying what, where and how?"

We are learning a lot of stuff that is a huge surprise. I don't see why if it's a personal offense -- I don't see why the taxpayers ought to pay a penny. And I think that is something to look at carefully in terms of where have the taxpayers money gone to cover up incidents look like this. But I also want to take just a minute, Sean, and maybe this makes me, you know, an outlier, or somebody who is out of touch with the times. I think there is an enormous difference between Harvey Weinstein, who clearly is a sexual predator, and who clearly was exploiting his position of power and President George H.W. Bush, who is in his 90s in a wheelchair. And I think we have all these things coming together because of the infantile stupidity of our news media. As though they are all the same problem. Now the topic is an important topic. And finding a way to have not just a work place, but to have a community where people are not being harassed or being preyed upon, I think that's important. Finding with the rules ought to be, and I commend Speaker Paul Ryan, who immediately responded by talking about getting mandatory training in the house. I think Senator McConnell is taking the same position in the Senate. I think we deserve to know the American people, who did the money get paid out to, and who paid for it, and why is the taxpayer on the hook for any of this?

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",

We've had a very long tradition in America going all the way back to the Boston massacre in the 1770s that you are innocent until proven guilty. And that you have the right of a presumption of innocence. And I think, again, if you have somebody like Harvey Weinstein, who now has so many names out there that it's almost inconceivable that he isn't guilty of a substantial amount of stuff, so you start getting this. Somebody remembered that 12 years ago they felt bad. Well, I don't understand the standard that goes into that. And then, how do you prove what really happened, and how do you prove whether or not somebody really meant to do something negative? And I do think we've got to take a deep breath here and not have the hysteria allow us to start destroying people randomly so that you then set up targets where anybody who wants to can get even by suddenly remembering something that happened 20 years ago."

Last- minute allegations thrown out there on the eve of a Senate hearing, or on the eve of an election in October. Surprise, George W. Bush. The weekend before that election with Al Gore, the DUI came out. So, in the whole year and a half prior, nobody knew about that? That wasn't planned? That wasn't a last-minute October surprise? To influence voters, where if somebody doesn't really have a chance to help themselves or prove they are grown beyond an instance like that?"

    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's part of it. And part of it as manipulation of the public by liberal news media trying to make a point. Part of it is, I think that you've got to look at some of these things and ask yourself, why are they coming up now, what is the evidence. And again, was it a situation that in fact was basically innocent, but is now subject to misinterpretation? When I see people who weren't particularly offended ten or 12 or 15 years ago, but suddenly there is now this hysteria and so they decide they are going to join the lynch mob and they got their story to tell, I just think we as a country ought to take a deep breath and think carefully. And again, I say this, you know, whether it's about my wife, my two daughters, my granddaughter, for that matter my grandson. Because remember, you have many instances now of sexual harassment that involves men as well as women. I think all of us want to protect the innocents, but we also have to remember that the innocent may be on both sides of that equation, and is not automatically clear that a charge is the same as that conviction."

Sara Carter is referring to it as a treasure trove of information, proving -- that is where the bribery and the kickbacks and extortion and money laundering all took placed. Proving that that all happened. And yet that was 2009, before the approval of uranium one. It seems to now be cascading, the floodgates seam open. How far should this go?

You have an FBI source who apparently was ignored deliberately by the Obama administration, who is out there saying wait a second, guys, look at all this evidence. I don't understand how the house and senate can avoid having in-depth weeks of hearings taking this whole thing apart, bringing in subpoenaing everybody, making public all the information about the Clinton foundation, about Bill Clinton's personal earnings. How many different ways with the Clintons making money out of this? And does anybody really believe all this was innocent? I mean, I think it's astonishing -- by the way, it goes beyond the Clintons.

Now Solomon has boiled down the newest revelations in a piece for the Hill detailing the five new revelations. First, Russia saw its purchase of uranium one as part of a larger strategy to dominate global uranium markets, including making the United States more dependent on Moscow's nuclear fuel. Great. It is our uranium. Next, uranium one did export some of its U.S. uranium ore. Then, the FBI informant does have information to share with congress about Rosatom's uranium one purchase. Next, the FBI did have evidence that Rosatom officials were engaged in criminality while before the Obama administration approved their purchase of uranium one. And finally, justice officials, they trusted Campbell, he is the informant, enough to keep them working undercover for six years and to pay him more than $51,000 once convictions were secured. Here with reaction, investigative reporter Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett is with us. Sara, let's start with you because you also had a piece. You call it a treasure trove now of information. I only thought it was for years, it's six years the informant worked for the FBI. But these were years long before CFIUS went ahead, that nine separate agencies who approve this deal, and we still import uranium. That is the crazy part.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity,\" so just when he thought the Democrats couldn't be involved in any more scandals, Fox News tonight confirming that the FBI is investigating Pennsylvania Congressman Bob Brady for allegedly paying off his Democratic primary opponent in 2012 and then lying to federal investigators. Not a good idea. According to the charges, Brady secretly paid 90 grand for his opponent Jimmy Moore to drop out of the race. And Moore and his former campaign manager had already pled guilty to concealing the payments. Additionally, two aides for Brady have been indicted. Sounds like Democrats level rigging elections more than anything else. We reach out to Brady's attorney for comments, shockingly we haven't heard back. Here with reaction, Salem, national syndicated radio host, Larry Elder. Fox News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. Hillary rigged the elections in the primary. According to Donna Brazile. She tried to rigged it with the Fusion GPS propaganda lie dossier, about hookers in a Rich Carlton where Trump in Moscow, Geraldo and what is it with Democrats rigging elections now?"

He is the ranking member of the committee on house administration. He is the biggest ward healer, old-style Gregarious, 6'2\" Irish Italian son of a cop, back slapper, very popular, but he feared an opponent running in a plurality black district, a black man running, so he engineered a scheme allegedly, or some believe, he is not charged yet, he just had a search warrant executed against him. Engineered a scheme whereby they could just give this man 90 grand so they created fake businesses, they try to launder the money. Three of his associates were involved. One has already turned state evidence and he is in trouble, Sean."

How about Harry Reid going to the floor of the senate in the 2012 race and saying the word on the street is that Mitt Romney hasn't paid taxes. Then when Harry Reid retired he was asked about this by CNN and he said well, he didn't win, did he? How about Donna Brazile getting the debate questions to Hillary ahead of time? I mean, come on. Democrats cut corners, shockingly."

The Republicans are the principal engineers of the gerrymandering, the rigging these districts so they get a maximized the impact of the staple. There's plenty of sleaze to go around. What is interesting in this case, is this is truly one of the giants of the Homestyle Democratic urban machine. Philly is rotten. Since 2000, 30 plus Democrats have been indicted, jailed, the other Congressman is in jail now. This is a house of cards."

What about the hypocrisy? What about Kathleen saying that Bill Clinton basically did something inappropriate in the oval office and then a couple days later one of the nation's top feminist, Gloria Steinem writes a piece in \"The New York Times\" that says well, even if you believe what she says, it's not sexual harassment, because when she told him to stop, he stopped. Are you kidding me? This is the way the left twisted themselves to defend the Clintons."

      "utterance": "We all know the news media in this country is abusively biased. I have a special challenge for NBC News. They lead the pack. Now, for decades, the incredibly liberal left wing news network has been covering for both Bill and Hillary Clinton. This effort has been led by NBC News Chairman Andy Lack is his name and he ran the company in the late 1990s. The very same time that Juanita Broderick accused President Bill Clinton of rape. And as the Washington Post reported, NBC sat on that interview with Broderick for at least a month saying the story wasn't corroborated at that time. They finally aired it in February of '99. Our challenge to Andy Lack, NBC News, simple air the interview with Juanita Broderick in its entirety on NBC and primetime. Let the people in this country see and hear and decide for themselves what former President Bill Clinton is accused of doing. Certainly going to be better than those \"Dateline\" reruns ad nauseam that you play. NBC News, Andy Lack, are you going to give them the proper platform that you sat on or is Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's reputation still that important to you? They don't have power anymore. That is all the time we have left this evening. This show will never be the mainstream media. We are not the destroy Trump media, we're fair and balanced. Thank you for being with us.
