And at last check, they were about 150 miles from Mexico's Southern border. But several hundred caravan members have broken away. Either getting on buses or hitching rides and have arrived at the Mexico border though it is unclear if they'll try to enter Mexico alone or wait for the mass crossing. Mexican police and military are there waiting for the migrants, and the Mexican government has said anyone without a passport, visa or other documents will be turned away or detained. But those on the grounds say, few if any of these migrants have documents, which indicates it could be a standoff. Except, all that separates Guatemala from Mexico are two bridges and a river.  Mexico is not going to harm these people, and historically, Mexico has shown little ability to stop migrants from crossing. So, experts say, by Friday, a lot of this caravan could be in Mexico about 1,800 miles from the U.S. border.   Though, we should note that our chief White House correspondent John Roberts just put into urgent that Mexico and the United States have come to terms saying, that they will try to put more shelters along the Central American Mexico border. And that now, Mexico will allow people who actually make it into the United States to turn back and come into Mexico.  Those are both new. Now, the president has issued a buck stops here tweet saying, and I'm quoting, \"I must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught, and if unable to do so, I will call up the U.S. military and close our southern border.\"  The president, said another tweet blaming Democrats for what he calls an assault on our country. And clearly, this has become a hot political issue. With Congressman Mike McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, saying, \"We have to secure that border once and for all.\" And while there's a huge focus on this 4,000 person caravan, the Border Patrol says, 4,000 migrants, cross into the U.S. every four days. And because of the current political climate, here is what happens to migrants with children. Listen.",

And new CCTV stills released by Turkey put him at the consulate the day of Khashoggi disappearance apparently entering shortly before Khashoggi leaving soon after. This mounting evidence has led Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to finally announce that he will skip a major investment conference in Saudi Arabia later this week following other prominent politicians and business leaders who have also pulled out. It is being seen as the first rebuke of the Kingdom by the Trump administration. As for the Saudi investigation, well, details still remain slim but it's claimed by Saudi Arabia that all of the suspects in the case have now been interrogated in Saudi Arabia. And sources say that one suspect was actually visiting New York the day Khashoggi disappeared while the other claims that he -- that one of them died a couple of years ago. So holes apparently in the story. And one other name now cropping up is General Ahmed al-Assiri. He's a two-star general who's a vice president of Saudi intelligence. There are now reports that he may have been the man who ordered the interrogation of Khashoggi. And of course that would fit into the narrative of Saudi Arabia that we've been expecting for a while that this was an interrogation got wrong, may have been sanctioned by Mohammed bin Salman but it wasn't intended to end in murder. And of course, we heard President Trump earlier today saying that anyone found responsible would face severe consequences. Martha?",

She said, \"I just have to make up my mind that yes, I was going to get out of bed, and yes, I was going to go for a lot of long walks in the woods.\" And she goes on to say, \"I was going to see my grandchildren and spent a lot of time with my family and my friends.\" And I think a lot of people, you know, believe that maybe that was the case, Guy, that she was going to leave politics.

And the doctor said to me, she looked at me for about 30 seconds and she said, you are going to go get tested. You need a biopsy. And I said OK, and I pulled up my calendar and I said, next Tuesday looks great. And she said, no, no, you're doing it right now. Right now. So, I went and I got the test, four days later I'm in the office here at the 1211 Avenue in the Americas, my doctor calls me and she says your test results are positive. She doesn't say you have breast cancer, that was for me to ask. I asked her do you mean I have breast cancer? And she said, yes you do. So, it took me a really long time to understand this and to accept it. And I actually went through, you know, the mastectomy, I went through several treatments of chemo before I actually embraced the diagnose. It took me so long.

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. The caravan is roughly 4,000 people. Mostly Honduran, some Salvadorans making the way through Guatemala. And at last check, they were about 150 miles from Mexico's Southern border. But several hundred caravan members have broken away. Either getting on buses or hitching rides and have arrived at the Mexico border though it is unclear if they'll try to enter Mexico alone or wait for the mass crossing. Mexican police and military are there waiting for the migrants, and the Mexican government has said anyone without a passport, visa or other documents will be turned away or detained. But those on the grounds say, few if any of these migrants have documents, which indicates it could be a standoff. Except, all that separates Guatemala from Mexico are two bridges and a river. Mexico is not going to harm these people, and historically, Mexico has shown little ability to stop migrants from crossing. So, experts say, by Friday, a lot of this caravan could be in Mexico about 1,800 miles from the U.S. border. Though, we should note that our chief White House correspondent John Roberts just put into urgent that Mexico and the United States have come to terms saying, that they will try to put more shelters along the Central American Mexico border. And that now, Mexico will allow people who actually make it into the United States to turn back and come into Mexico.  Those are both new. Now, the president has issued a buck stops here tweet saying, and I'm quoting, \"I must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught, and if unable to do so, I will call up the U.S. military and close our southern border.\" The president, said another tweet blaming Democrats for what he calls an assault on our country. And clearly, this has become a hot political issue. With Congressman Mike McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, saying, \"We have to secure that border once and for all.\" And while there's a huge focus on this 4,000 person caravan, the Border Patrol says, 4,000 migrants, cross into the U.S. every four days. And because of the current political climate, here is what happens to migrants with children. Listen."

But this issue, the one thing that unites everybody on this issue is that we have to stop the problem. And there are complex parts of it, and there are -- and it's not -- obviously, it's not easy because these people in Congress haven't been able to do it in decades, neither party has done it.

Republicans don't want to support this wall because they know it's a waste of money and that's not going to work. The Republicans aren't campaigning, supporting the Trump policy of separating children from their families because it's immoral, international -- this national tragedy for us to be part of that."

You've got 7 million jobs open in this country. They write that we've likely avoided the recession that would have happened. They believed at The Wall Street Journal editorial page that if Hillary Clinton had won, U.S. growth is driving the world economy. And they say, \"The question that is too much below the surface for next month's election is whether Americans want to continue this prosperity.\"  And they point out, Robert, that it won't -- it's not necessarily guaranteed, because -- you know, we've seen in the past that Democrats Nancy Pelosi -- you know, put through a short-term stimulus program under George Bush.

And new CCTV stills released by Turkey put him at the consulate the day of Khashoggi disappearance apparently entering shortly before Khashoggi leaving soon after. This mounting evidence has led Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to finally announce that he will skip a major investment conference in Saudi Arabia later this week following other prominent politicians and business leaders who have also pulled out. It is being seen as the first rebuke of the Kingdom by the Trump administration. As for the Saudi investigation, well, details still remain slim but it's claimed by Saudi Arabia that all of the suspects in the case have now been interrogated in Saudi Arabia. And sources say that one suspect was actually visiting New York the day Khashoggi disappeared while the other claims that he -- that one of them died a couple of years ago. So holes apparently in the story. And one other name now cropping up is General Ahmed al-Assiri. He's a two-star general who's a vice president of Saudi intelligence. There are now reports that he may have been the man who ordered the interrogation of Khashoggi. And of course that would fit into the narrative of Saudi Arabia that we've been expecting for a while that this was an interrogation got wrong, may have been sanctioned by Mohammed bin Salman but it wasn't intended to end in murder.

I got the same response from the Minister of Interior and it really wasn't until I talked with Prince Saud, the Foreign Minister that I got someone who was willing to admit that there were Saud is involved.

And here's FBI sworn affidavit with very specific allegations and corroborating evidence and then when he's confronted with it, what does he do, he lies about it.  Justice Department step puts back to and says no, no, buddy. What you're saying is demonstrably false. That's legalese for lying. What kind of guy when he's confronted allegation lies about them? So he's desperate."

But in the Monmouth poll it says that a lot of the people who are for Menendez are doing it because of their views about Donald Trump. Fifty six percent say that. And you are right, that a lot of them are aware of these charges. Well, they are not aware of the allegations and also let's think about it, here it is the irony of this whole situation. Senator Schumer who is buying and selling Senator Menendez, he is bought and sold here. His future is going to be so partisan as he is already been. But think about it, it was Dr. Sal Melgen, Menendez's self-proclaimed best friend, 67 felony convictions for defrauding Medicare. He is one who gave into Schumer's PAC in the first place. Now the money is coming to New Jersey. If the polls weren't in the dead heat that we see in our numbers, why would Schumer put three million in television ads this week? Eleven -- eight million in total I think an outside money against me. The momentum is so clear."

You got somebody who is under serve the people of New Jersey for 25 years. New Jersey is dead last. We get the least back from Washington corrupt, ineffective and hypocritical. That's the story.

I have immense respect for many of the things that she has done in her life and her career. But if her goal is to help the Democratic Party, the media tour, the comments particularly about Me Too and sexual assault, it's not helping. It is a distraction at a time, what, 19 days out from the midterms where Democratic candidates are looking to the future not the past and she is the past."

I mean, she was asked about Bill Clinton, her husband, and she said that it was -- you know, not OK, but she said that it wasn't a Me Too because Monica was an adult. When most of the people or many of them involved in the situation are of course adults as well. Here's a quote that she says in her first interview after she lost the election. This was to the New York Times. She said, \"I just have to make up my mind that yes, I was going to get out of bed, and yes, I was going to go for a lot of long walks in the woods.\" And she goes on to say, \"I was going to see my grandchildren and spent a lot of time with my family and my friends.\" And I think a lot of people, you know, believe that maybe that was the case, Guy, that she was going to leave politics.

It is terrific. You've been amazing. Your comments about civility were spot on, you are totally helping your party and what America is craving is a third Hillary Clinton presidential run. Go for it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think the focus, I mean, all joking aside, what Guy said is very instructive. Because Republicans are the ones who think she helps them by being out there and then you hear from Democrats particularly these Democrats running in this election. Many of whom are first-time candidates, they are looking to create and build a Democratic Party of the future that is looking at how to be President Trump in 2020 that it's formulating an economic message that can work. That it's not trying to replicate, quite frankly the mistakes that Hillary Clinton and her campaign made. And so, again, I hate to say this, I don't like dumping all over her because I think she has been a historical figure in many ways, the first female major party candidate, that is amazing. But part of being a public servant is knowing when it's time to move on for the good of the causes that you support and I think that's where we are with Hillary."

Some of them are still underground. And a lot of them, of course, the cast and crew who bravely put their names and reputations and career on the line to tell the truth about what happens in Philadelphia. It was an absolute horror. It was a massacre on the size and order in proportion and the barbaric nature of some of the worst serial killers in America. And of course, what's odd, Martha, is that most of the media and Hollywood often have this grotesque fascination with serial killers. They are even deified in pop culture but nobody wanted to talk about Kermit Gosnell, in large part justice fail to mention, because they don't want to shed any negative exposure on abortion. Even though this man committed atrocities against minority women, poor women in inner city Philadelphia. He murdered dozens, if not hundreds of born alive babies and there were casualties that included a Bhutanese refugee pregnant mother, Karnamaya Mongar.

You know, even in the lead up to the premiere, you had Facebook banning promotion of ads.

Now just before that, six months before that I had felt something strange in my right breast and I went and got a mammogram and it came out clean. So, I was very excited about that. I went back to work. I was working on a book. The book came out which is on a four-letter word and I was promoting it and while I was promoting it, I felt this all over again. So, being probably not very smart I promoted the book for a week and then I went to my doctor. And the doctor said to me, she looked at me for about 30 seconds and she said, you are going to go get tested. You need a biopsy. And I said OK, and I pulled up my calendar and I said, next Tuesday looks great. And she said, no, no, you're doing it right now. Right now. So, I went and I got the test, four days later I'm in the office here at the 1211 Avenue in the Americas, my doctor calls me and she says your test results are positive. She doesn't say you have breast cancer, that was for me to ask. I asked her do you mean I have breast cancer? And she said, yes you do. So, it took me a really long time to understand this and to accept it. And I actually went through, you know, the mastectomy, I went through several treatments of chemo before I actually embraced the diagnose. It took me so long. I'm such a glass half full person and I thought I'm going to grin I'm going to bear it. And I'm just going to work my way, head down walk my way through this, and I hit a wall one day.
