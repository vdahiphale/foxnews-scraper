The surveillance was an application for Trump Campaign Aide, Carter Page, was made in October 2016, just days before the presidential election, allowing the government to collect his phone records, e-mails and text messages. Under the statute because the bar is so high for the U.S. government to spy on the U.S. citizen inside the United States. The warrant had to be renewed every 90 days. Former FBI Director James Comey, Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and the current Deputy Attorney General and Trump Appointee Rod Rosenstein among others, signed off on the renewals. The question is whether Rosenstein who is charged with all things Russia with boss' recusal, would support a second special counsel that would investigate Rosenstein's own actions and decisions.

So, bias is one thing, animus is another; it is possible for that animus to impact your decision-making. Look at what Strzok himself said, he had no interest in participating in an investigation that would exonerate Donald Trump.

It's clear that a combination of Congress and the Inspector General, Mr. Horowitz, can investigate these types of claims, I think that however, there are two good arguments for the appointment of a special counsel. One, in this letter and one that's not. The one in the letter is that it's certainly true that Horowitz cannot really exercise jurisdiction over people like James Comey and others who have left the Justice Department. That's a very good point, there's a lot of witnesses that would fall into the purely voluntary cooperation category. And you might need more than voluntary cooperation.  The other reason is that we are a nation divided. Half of the people in this country believe that the FBI is biased and was targeting Trump and Republicans, the other believes that there was something criminally wrong about the Trump Campaign in Russian interference, both have raised legitimate concerns. We're not going to get past this. We're not going to get out of this quagmire until we can offer the American people an independent review -- and I don't think Congress at this point is going to offer that. I think that congress, there's so much infighting, so many leaks, so many spins. I don't see a point which the American people are going to say, all right, I get it, I think I know the facts here. So, that does weigh heavily here.

There should not be this cross pollination between people who are witnesses, and that's why we build what's called a wall around witnesses to say, this is off -- really off the table, you cannot talk to others, particularly the president, in this type of investigation.

But the reality is, Democratic enthusiasm, and is a share of the primary electorate was up, and it was -- the last time we saw this level in Texas for the percentage of the electorate that were Democrats, was 2006. And 2006 was a no fun year for Republicans, so Democrats are looking at some Senate or some House pickups in Texas, and I think that it's indicative of whether --",

Remember the 13 minute phone call to the FBI from a family friend who was desperate. She said that she was sure that Nikolas Cruz was 'about to explode.' His mother had just passed away. The agent who took that call, it turns out, actually did link that Nikolas Cruz in that warning to the prior tip that we told you about on a YouTube video from Cruz, another Nikolas Cruz saying that I'm going to be a professional school shooter. So despite the fact that this call center in West Virginia for the FBI was able to put these two different tips together with the same man, the agent and supervisor did nothing, telling Congress today 'we decided to not pursue the matter further and the case was closed.' That stunning admission comes as two survivors say that they plan to sue the FBI along with the school and the sheriff's office for what they call callous and negligent inaction. Earlier today, a grand jury indicted Nikolas Cruz on 17 counts of first degree murder and 17 counts of premeditated murder. The charges make him eligible for the death penalty. Prosecutors have yet to indicate whether or not today will seek it. It is rare that we get to hear from a person who was able to stop a mass shooting at a school, but my next guest did exactly that.  It was 14 years ago, at an upstate New York high school, 16-year-old John Romano showed up at school that day with a 12-gauge shotgun and pockets full of ammunition. A New York Times reporter put it best, writing \"the attack here could have been much worse if not for the intervention of the assistant principal, John Sawchuk who wrestled Mr. Romano to the ground.\" Anyone was killed or seriously hurt, and now in a letter that the young man wrote from prison, the shooter is thinking Mr. John Sawchuk, calling him a hero who that I owe my life to.

And at that point, I thought that it was going to be over with. And he was not dropping the gun, and the teacher who was coming down the hallway, I was asking them to come and help me. And John started to level the gun, and I was pushing the gun down. He was pushing it up and then he fired a shot and the teacher was hit in the leg and we got jolted back and then we started to struggle. And it was bumping into walls and just terrifying.",

The Congressman make the argument, there is a potential and actual conflict of interest. The surveillance was an application for Trump Campaign Aide, Carter Page, was made in October 2016, just days before the presidential election, allowing the government to collect his phone records, e-mails and text messages. Under the statute because the bar is so high for the U.S. government to spy on the U.S. citizen inside the United States. The warrant had to be renewed every 90 days. Former FBI Director James Comey, Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and the current Deputy Attorney General and Trump Appointee Rod Rosenstein among others, signed off on the renewals. The question is whether Rosenstein who is charged with all things Russia with boss' recusal, would support a second special counsel that would investigate Rosenstein's own actions and decisions.

I want to look at the process and the procedures, and whether or not the bureau handled things the right way regardless of what kind of case it is.

Michael Horowitz is fantastic, he is great for looking at matters within the department, but he has no jurisdiction over witnesses who have left. You just mention Jim Comey and Andy McCabe, they're both gone, Jim Rybicki is gone. There are -- Loretta Lynch is gone, Sally Yates is gone. There are 24 witnesses that I've identified, and Michael Horowitz would not have jurisdiction over, and you can't compel their attendance and their testimony. Martha, that says nothing about the State Department angle or Fusion GPS or anyone not in the department.

I would hope that every American would ask the FBI: if you have evidence of a crime, two months before you interview the target of the investigation, why have you already concluded you're not going to go forth? That is a fair question whether you're a Republican, Democrat, or Bull-Moose Party. Every American should want to have confidence in the FBI and DOJ."

So, clearly, had problems with a lot of people, but hated Donald Trump. And what's important about that is one of them had signed up to investigate Donald Trump while the other was a lawyer. So, bias is one thing, animus is another; it is possible for that animus to impact your decision-making. Look at what Strzok himself said, he had no interest in participating in an investigation that would exonerate Donald Trump. This is a counterintelligence expert who doesn't want to participate in investigating what Russia did if it does not result in the indictment of Donald Trump. That is in unprecedented level of animus."

      "utterance": "I would think that it would be difficult. It's clear that a combination of Congress and the Inspector General, Mr. Horowitz, can investigate these types of claims, I think that however, there are two good arguments for the appointment of a special counsel. One, in this letter and one that's not. The one in the letter is that it's certainly true that Horowitz cannot really exercise jurisdiction over people like James Comey and others who have left the Justice Department. That's a very good point, there's a lot of witnesses that would fall into the purely voluntary cooperation category. And you might need more than voluntary cooperation. The other reason is that we are a nation divided. Half of the people in this country believe that the FBI is biased and was targeting Trump and Republicans, the other believes that there was something criminally wrong about the Trump Campaign in Russian interference, both have raised legitimate concerns. We're not going to get past this. We're not going to get out of this quagmire until we can offer the American people an independent review -- and I don't think Congress at this point is going to offer that. I think that congress, there's so much infighting, so many leaks, so many spins. I don't see a point which the American people are going to say, all right, I get it, I think I know the facts here. So, that does weigh heavily here. But at the end of the day, I think that a strong argument can be made that there's not a compelling need as long as Congress and the inspector general both pursue these questions."

There should not be this cross pollination between people who are witnesses, and that's why we build what's called a wall around witnesses to say, this is off -- really off the table, you cannot talk to others, particularly the president, in this type of investigation. So, it is problematic. But that's an example of what has long concerned me about the lack of control and discipline. Those types of slips are making, are prolonging this investigation, fueling allegations when we still don't have a clear crime that is linked to the president."

But the reality is, Democratic enthusiasm, and is a share of the primary electorate was up, and it was -- the last time we saw this level in Texas for the percentage of the electorate that were Democrats, was 2006.

Bush is that he endorsed Trump. His father was out at that point, but he endorsed Trump; he's a Trump-Bush, if you will. I don't know if that's a kind of plant, but that's an interesting story. But the main thing is, Martha, as you know, because you do this every night, how many stories are there between now and November? How many things will happen at the White House? How many policy issues will be discussed? How many policies will be put forward? What kinds of controversies and conflicts we'll be getting? What kind of legislation will we get?

Qualcomm, based in San Diego has led the way to developing 3G, 4G, and now 5G technologies. And if it is acquired by Broadcom in the $117 billion hostile bid, the fear is that the U.S. would automatically be less competitive in the overall telecommunications input structure. In other words, once Broadcom gobbles up Qualcomm, experts believe China would fill that void with Huawei, its own telecom equipment giant, and that they argue would undermine U.S. efforts to stay ahead of China in the development of 5G.

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight, a chilling admission from the FBI on the three week anniversary of the Parkland school shooting. Remember the 13 minute phone call to the FBI from a family friend who was desperate. She said that she was sure that Nikolas Cruz was 'about to explode.' His mother had just passed away. The agent who took that call, it turns out, actually did link that Nikolas Cruz in that warning to the prior tip that we told you about on a YouTube video from Cruz, another Nikolas Cruz saying that I'm going to be a professional school shooter. So despite the fact that this call center in West Virginia for the FBI was able to put these two different tips together with the same man, the agent and supervisor did nothing, telling Congress today 'we decided to not pursue the matter further and the case was closed.' That stunning admission comes as two survivors say that they plan to sue the FBI along with the school and the sheriff's office for what they call callous and negligent inaction. Earlier today, a grand jury indicted Nikolas Cruz on 17 counts of first degree murder and 17 counts of premeditated murder. The charges make him eligible for the death penalty. Prosecutors have yet to indicate whether or not today will seek it. It is rare that we get to hear from a person who was able to stop a mass shooting at a school, but my next guest did exactly that. It was 14 years ago, at an upstate New York high school, 16-year-old John Romano showed up at school that day with a 12-gauge shotgun and pockets full of ammunition. A New York Times reporter put it best, writing \"the attack here could have been much worse if not for the intervention of the assistant principal, John Sawchuk who wrestled Mr. Romano to the ground.\" Anyone was killed or seriously hurt, and now in a letter that the young man wrote from prison, the shooter is thinking Mr. John Sawchuk, calling him a hero who that I owe my life to. We are now with former principal, John Sawchuk. Good to have you here on the program tonight."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I was actually in a classroom at the time observing a teacher's lesson, and I heard what I thought was an explosion in the hallway. And everyone in the class looked at me and I said, everyone just stay here, we'll be right back. I'm sure that it is nothing. And I thought that it was nothing. And as I said before, it was 2004 was a silly age of innocence. And I did not think that it was a shot, I thought that there might've been an explosion. There was a lot of smoke in the air, and a teacher popped his head out and I told him, hey, come out with me, we will check this out. So prior to that, the shooter had shot at a student who went down a hallway, but did not run past me. So I did not see him run past me, so I ran around the corner and happened to run into John Romano as he had his back to me. And he was looking into a classroom, and I kind of got behind him. And at that point, I thought that it was going to be over with. And he was not dropping the gun, and the teacher who was coming down the hallway, I was asking them to come and help me. And John started to level the gun, and I was pushing the gun down. He was pushing it up and then he fired a shot and the teacher was hit in the leg and we got jolted back and then we started to struggle. And it was bumping into walls and just terrifying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. And what did you think when you sent this note, saying that you were a hero and then to saved not only all of those people at the school but you saved him as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAWCHUK",
      "utterance": "I was kind of taken back. I never heard anything like that before, but it made me feel good to hear that he was regretful, because he did a lot of damage, a lot of damage to people, to our kids come, to our teachers. I was a little taken aback by it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "When you watch everything going on and you see what happened in Parkland, having been through your experience, what would you tell everyone listening tonight about what you think is really wrong here? And what needs to be fixed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAWCHUK",
      "utterance": "I think enough people need to say that enough is enough. How many more times do we have to go through this? There needs to be, with what is happening in Florida right now with those kids, it needs to spread to the rest of the country. It is the only way that things are going to change. And people right now are laying low. They are laying low until the smoke clears, and it is going to be back to normal. And we really need to have a national movement. When there is more security when you visit a corporate to building then there is in schools, there is something wrong with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you think that the schools need to be hardened, and what about families and people? What would have changed John Romano's story, do you think, if someone had known what he was about to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAWCHUK",
      "utterance": "Well, when you talk about hardening schools, I think that there are things that you can do that we did, that schools need to invest and communities need to invest in. We were very lucky. One of the positive things that came out of it was that I worked in a great community that understood the need for safety. It is our number one job, and you have to invest in that. That is money. Schools are underfunded. There are many things that schools can do that we did. We hired what we call security supervisors, which were ex-law enforcement. They were outstanding, full-time police officers that are in the building with us and working with us on a daily basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And they were armed, I assume. Were they armed? Mr. Sawchuk, those people that you hired, they were armed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAWCHUK",
      "utterance": "The police officer was armed, the security supervisors were not. But they were high level, ex-high-level law enforcement that provided us with outstanding experiences that I would never have. I am an educator. I'm not law enforcement. But all of those experiences help build your community a safety."

He thinks it is a winning idea. But what about Jesse Watters, what does Jesse think, and is it OK with Jesse if I wear makeup, when we come back."

Beauty brought to you by David Beckham, the former soccer star changing the game when it comes to grooming from hair products and beard oils and moisturizers and eye balms. David Beckham is launching his own line of cosmetics for men. Will guys buy it?

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It cost me $32. I don't know what it does, but I like the sound of it. It is like coffee for the eyes. So I paid a lot of money for it, some of the stuff I cannot do, like the beard oil. This is like five days right here, Martha. I cannot grow a beard. And it is a little bit expensive. The shampoo is $32, but you spend three times that on your shampoo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, probably. But I do foresee a world where they sell actual makeup for men and regular guys who are in that category that you mentioned. Because I think when you look at David Beckham, when you wear make up all time on the show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do, and it takes a long time. I don't take it off if I am going out to dinner later, because I want to stay looking good. Without the makeup, it is a mess. But they know men, because you guys are really picky and social media is competitive, so we have to look the best we can."
