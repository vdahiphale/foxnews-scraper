Most of them have gone to college and got a degree in Gender Studies or whatever they get degrees in these days and that's what they do. I've got to tell you when I got -- when I realized that, when I was done playing and I looked back on that, I think about these guys that are -- they've got four-year degree from BU and they've got a journalism degree and they're standing in front of a kid who's 21 years old, doesn't speak English from the Dominican and he's making $15 million a year and they're taking home, you know, $1,500.00 a month after tax or whatever and there was some bitterness. You can always see in the writing."

There were a lot more liberals in the booth and ESPN was -- I mean, I had people literally come up to me. It's almost like being a member of the underground railway, I guess. They would come up and say \"Hey, listen I agree with your political views, so keep it up.\" Like, no one can hear them say that and it turned out to be true. There were no -- almost no outwardly concert -- except for me at ESPN and they made that end pretty quickly, so ..."

You see like at the NFL at the highest levels, they cave to the left and also Conservatives don't use sports to make statements. You know, you just said, you're competitive, you're an athlete. You do your thing. You go home or you do your commercials or whatever you do. Could the problem be that for progressivism, witting or unwitting, whatever the format is, whatever the forum is. Sports -- we're going to devour it with our ideology. That's my sense of this. Whatever is out there, we have got to superimpose and project our ideology."

They've managed to marginalize me in many ways for things I've never done, but when I think about it, like I said, if General Flynn is not off-limits, if Hillary Clinton can give access to our uranium to the Russians and not be held accountable, then the justice system is broken horribly."

It's very, very difficult. He was handed a real bad hand there. He's accused of going soft on Russia, yet he's tougher on Russia than Obama has ever been. I really like what he's doing with China, which has been stealing our technology and is expanding militarily in so many ways. I wish our media would focus on some of that and he's reversed the Obama administration's policy vis a vis Iran, which is a terrorist state that has killed American soldiers, which obviously is building ICBMs not for Tel Aviv, but for Los Angeles. But they're grave threat is -- they are on a grave threat to us, too and yet he's not given a lot of credit for what he's doing in foreign policy, which is essentially Reaganism and they attack Reagan, too and Reagan was very, very successful. What do you make of that?"

But I've got to tell you, on the foreign policy side, I think, I was struck by a couple of things. When he was running and he -- when he was interviewing people for his Cabinet, he was talking about people for his Joint Chiefs and I can't remember the General's name. I want to say it was Flynn, but it wasn't. It was somebody else. He said that he came away with an impression of President Trump that he didn't go in with. He said, \"A lot of times I view people and their intelligence by the questions they ask rather than the questions they answer, and the questions he asked me were just brilliant,\" and you know, I'll take his word that they were that. I think he's getting advice from the people in -- his inner circle is smaller than any President in our lifetime."

      "speaker": "SCHILLING",
      "utterance": "If your foreign policy is not America first, what is it? China first? I mean, part of the reason I was so distraught over the eight years of Obama is -- whoever was President this time, hopefully it was a conservative, he was going to have to unravel the kowtowing and the bending and the kissing of butt globally that the administration did, apologizing. I mean, our soldiers are buried on foreign territory all over the world and I don't know of any foreign soldiers that are buried on our ground that helped us get what we got now."

He came in and said, \"I didn't vote for a Nolan Ryan.\" Proud and I said, \"What do you mean you didn't vote for Nolan Ryan?\" He said, \"No, if Don Sutton didn't get in unanimously, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve.\" And he wrote a huge article on it. And I said, \"So you didn't vote for Nolan Ryan so you could get content because you're too lazy to go out and get it yourself.\" And you realized that this is -- you're being asked to pass judgment on a career you have no business giving comment on, but anyway.

I want to win the Roberto Clemente Award, which is -- because Roberto Clemente is my dad's favorite player and I want to retire having all of the teammates that wore my jersey say, \"If I had a game to pitch, win or lose, life or death, I would want him on the mound.\" In 2001, I won the Roberto Clemente Award which is still the highlight of my career. A quick story, my dad, I went to one game as a fan in my lifetime -- in my lifetime. It was Roberto Clemente's final game in 1972. He doubled off John Madden like for his 3,000th hit and he died in the plane crash not long after. The first time I ever saw my dad cry, but that -- that he meant the world to my dad, so he meant the world to me and I got to meet the Clemente family, which was the greatest thrill of my life."
