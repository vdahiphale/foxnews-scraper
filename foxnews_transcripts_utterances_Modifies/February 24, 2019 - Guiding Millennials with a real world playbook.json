Then suddenly we are, no, we don't know when it's coming out, but it's not going to be this week. And, secondly, what do your sources in the White House say? How worried are they really about the Mueller report? JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So, on the first point, I think what you're seeing is some wishful thinking on people's parts. We've been living with the Mueller investigation for quite some time. And there are signs that it is drawing to a conclusion, in part because Mueller has handed off some of these investigations, some people on his team are moving on to other jobs. But the reality is, you know, we're not going to know when this investigation is done until it is officially done and Mueller tells Barr, the new attorney general, that he's done. I think it's important to note that when that happens, that actually kick- starts another process, which is to figure out what becomes public. So that is not actually the end of this. In terms of your second question, you know, there is some real anxiety in the administration about this report because it's just such an unknown. They are fairly confident that there's going to be nothing in the report that directly ties President Trump to Russia in terms of a phone call saying let's coordinate, some type of real smoking gun. But there are other areas where they have a lot less certainty that relates to the question of obstruction around the firing of James Comey. Also this Trump Tower meeting that happened where Don Junior was present there. Anything that involved the president's family, his kids in particular, is of real concern. And, again, it is such an unknown. They -- they think they know what Mueller has based on conversations with lawyers who have represented people who have had conversations, but it -- but it remains a bit of a black box for them.",

What's happened there is a tragedy. There were five or six or eight killed yesterday, but there have been hundreds and hundreds killed from starvation over the past weeks and months. Millions of people having to flee their homes, 3 million people had to leave, 10 percent of the Venezuelan population.

We hope we'll make a substantial step along the way. I spent a lot of time with Chairman Kim. My team is on the ground today, continuing to flush out paths forward to develop a road map for a path forward between the two countries. And we are determined to achieve that. It's important for the world's security. The U.N. Security Council has demanded, not the United States, but the U.N. Security Council has demanded that Chairman Kim give up these weapons systems.

The previous administration's policy, right, which was test -- allow the North Korean to test; pray -- pray they'd stop, and then, cower when they threaten us, right? Test, pray and cower has been upended by President Trump. We put real economic pressure on the North Koreans. We've built out a global coalition. One of the critiques is that we go it alone. We've built up the world's coalition to communicate to Chairman Kim that that was the time, now's the moment, and I hope we'll make real progress on that this week."

I've watched our team understand the messages that the two leaders have provided. And now, we're going to get to have a second summit where the two leaders can sit and have a frank, candid discussion, explore options and I hope achieve what the ultimate end state is, creating a brighter future for North Korea and reducing the threat of the United States from the nuclear weapons that are today in North Korea."

The president has made very clear that the achievement of destroying the caliphate both in Syria and in Iraq, we forget Mosul, people forget Raqqa. This is an enormous accomplishment of our administration and our partners in the region and we are very proud of that. Millions of people liberated from the terror of ISIS. Our president has also been very clear that this is -- the threat from radical Islamic terrorism, it's real. It continues. And we've got to continue to fight it. The announcement this week that we're still going to have a residual footprint inside of Syria makes sense in the context of our mission statement and the tactics will change as time goes on. We'll use different tactics in different parts of the world to fight back against radical Islamic terrorism. President Trump is committed to doing it."

So, no, I think -- I think he has weaker today and every day that the United States and its allies -- what's interesting to me is that this was led by the Lima Group. This was led by the Organization of American States. The president receives a phone call before he takes action from Justin Trudeau.

But I thought you were on target and raising the question with Secretary Pompeo about U.S. military intervention. We can have CIA and other people go in there and try to undermine them, but at some point, I think the American people say, why is it our job? Intervention in this area, I said, has not -- does not have a good track record and it also broaches the possibility that the U.S. would actually put military forces in to oust Maduro. This doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense with the public in terms of our foreign policy.

There might be more talk about denuclearization but the idea that they would come out with something signed specific with dates and verification is probably pretty low. The other thing you do here is that there is some concern that the president, because he knows that the takeaway from the first summit was that it was vague, that there wasn't anything particularly specific, that he could get in a room with Kim and make some type of concession that goes against what his advisors wanted to do, that he could be so eager to strike some kind of deal that he could give something up. I think that is a real concern, particularly if you look at -- I know we will talk about this later, some of what will be happening in Washington while he is abroad.

They were launching missiles indiscriminately, some of which they were testing could hit the Continental United States. Clearly, we cannot ignore that, and so, you basically have to go paths at that point. You could approach the brink of war, or you could do what President Trump has been doing, which is engaging directly with Kim. And I think -- you know, no question, there has not been the concrete signed agreements out of the first Singapore summit, and probably won't be out of this, but, you know, what's not happening is they are not sending missiles, they are not testing missiles. They are not sort of broaching that brink of war type fever that we were at for the first year of his presidency and I think that in and of itself is great progress."

We don't have an agreement upon the process, what comes first, denuclearization, or sanctions relief? And so, they really are -- they've had one summit but let's not kid ourselves, we are at the beginning of a process. We are not deep into the process. And we're going to face an issue here where what kind of concrete steps are the North Koreans going to take? Sure, they are not sending missiles over Japan and they are not testing nuclear weapons, but maybe they don't need to test. We know they've got operative nuclear weapons and we know they've got the ability to send missiles. Whether they can marry the two together we don't know. But what concrete steps are we going to take? In one of the key things that I think people are looking at when I talk to people in the foreign policy areas, the facility at Yongbyon, which is the only facility from which they derive fissile material, three elements they need for nuclear weapons and the question is, a test of seriousness is whether or not they will decommission Yongbyon and make it under an international inspection regime."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, like a lot of people, anxious to see what Special Counsel Robert Mueller has found in almost two years of investigation. And we're back now with the panel. Well, Julie, first of all, explain to our viewers and to me why we get all these reports last week, the Mueller reports is coming out Friday, no it's coming out this week. Then suddenly we are, no, we don't know when it's coming out, but it's not going to be this week. And, secondly, what do your sources in the White House say? How worried are they really about the Mueller report? JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So, on the first point, I think what you're seeing is some wishful thinking on people's parts. We've been living with the Mueller investigation for quite some time. And there are signs that it is drawing to a conclusion, in part because Mueller has handed off some of these investigations, some people on his team are moving on to other jobs. But the reality is, you know, we're not going to know when this investigation is done until it is officially done and Mueller tells Barr, the new attorney general, that he's done. I think it's important to note that when that happens, that actually kick- starts another process, which is to figure out what becomes public. So that is not actually the end of this. In terms of your second question, you know, there is some real anxiety in the administration about this report because it's just such an unknown. They are fairly confident that there's going to be nothing in the report that directly ties President Trump to Russia in terms of a phone call saying let's coordinate, some type of real smoking gun. But there are other areas where they have a lot less certainty that relates to the question of obstruction around the firing of James Comey. Also this Trump Tower meeting that happened where Don Junior was present there. Anything that involved the president's family, his kids in particular, is of real concern. And, again, it is such an unknown. They -- they think they know what Mueller has based on conversations with lawyers who have represented people who have had conversations, but it -- but it remains a bit of a black box for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to -- I want to pick up with the -- the -- one of the first point you made, which is after Mueller gives up his report, he gives it to William Barr, the new attorney general.

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "A -- of not following that. But you've also got the fact that for the last two years House Republicans, particularly the Intel Committee, were pressing -- pressing the FBI to turn over a lot of information. It didn't like the FISA warrant. Isn't it going to be a little hard now to turn off that spigot if House Republicans or Barr or the president said, oh, no, we can't share this information?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",

And this rule was promulgated by Janet Reno after the expiration of the independent counsel statue in 1999. It's been enforced ever since then. I'd make the argument this. I -- I thought it was absolutely dreadful. It was unsancted -- the sanctimonious Jim Comey blasting Hillary Clinton after -- after him declining to indict her. He had no authority to make that decision, incidentally. That was a decision that should have been made at DOJ. But having made that decision, taking it unto himself the power to do that, the -- then deciding not to indict her and then trashing her was -- it was a bad for -- this is several hundred years of American jurisprudence tossed out."

If they -- if they -- if they decline to indict the president because presidents should not be indicted while they're in office, that's the one thing that might need to be made public because that would need to be taken into consideration by Congress, which holds the ultimate power of impeachment. But short of that, I don't think that they should make anything public because that's not what we should do in our system. Comey showed why that was wrong."

This very day that President Trump sits down with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam. We asked you for questions for the panel about that and Barry Zalma tweeted this, why does the Congress have no respect for the president? Josh, how do you answer Barry about the decision by the House Oversight Committee to hold a hearing with Michael Cohen, who's clearly going to say bad things about the president, right in the middle of a summit?"

I mean there used to be, not so long ago, this agreement when a president was overseas that you help -- you hold fire on domestic political disputes. This one is absolutely the highest rung on the ladder of a political dispute. We're talking about a former aide to Mr. Trump, who -- who has proven time and again is very interested in trying to harm him politically, just at a moment when the president is sitting down for something that can only be described as of top national interest for the international security of our country. So I think it's absolutely ridiculous. One point I wanted to make in reference to whether this is public or not, we're not dealing with an intern escapade here as we were in the '90s with the Starr report. We're dealing with some sensitive information about a state actor of Russia in theory --"

He was the president's confidant, his fixer. And he's going to be talk about things like payoffs, potentially criminal activity I mean directed to involve himself at the president's -- at the president's will. So I think it is damaging. But, remember, Michael Cohen was scheduled to have appeared much earlier. He delayed it. And this is just a consequence of that delay.
