As you know, two top agents removed from Mueller's Russia investigation exchanged tens of thousands of texts, many of them disparage President Trump who they were investigating. According to two lawmakers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page also spoke of a secret society formed at the FBI after Mr. Trump's election:",

I've been at the White House at a time when there were emails that were on a server that went missing, and it's there was a technical problem. They didn't know where they were, and it caused a huge hullabaloo for a long time. They ultimately were found. And I think that the FBI having the tools it has probably will be able to find them. And Richard Berg, the senate intelligence committee chairman, he says that he doesn't think there was anything nefarious, that it was technical. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. I don't know. And then you have the point that -- the email you just read or the text where he says -- Strzok says I don't really think there is any there, there.

If you have FBI agents texting about brushing up on Watergate and impeachment right after Trump's election and you had a talk about secret society between the FBI agent and justice officials who were the same people talking about creating an insurance policy to protect the country against the election of Donald Trump, that seems pretty sketchy to me. And these are the same people who are now working on the Mueller team before they were fired. Now, also, the counterintelligence and counterespionage agent on the FBI was tapped to be in the Mueller team and the first thing that come to his mind is there's no there, there. There's no collusion. I mean, that says a lot because that's his job. That's his wheelhouse right there. And so, he gets put in that position. They don't really find any collusion so far, and now it looks like an obstruction of justice case that they're making. And who is the chief witness for obstruction of justice? It's James Comey, the best friend for Robert Mueller. So, he illegally leaks the memo to his buddy the professor, you know, a few blocks away at Columbia. And now, Comey hires his buddy the professor to represents him as his personal attorney. So that locks down the professor's testimony very cagy. And then, all of a sudden the FBI texts go missing? The FBI, their entire job is to retain intelligence, and then they lost the intelligence from a critical time period when this investigation began? It doesn't make sense. And then today, the chief of staff or James Comey, and the current FBI director resigns all of a sudden. I'm willing to make a little bit more of it than Dana Perino.

Surely, he had a perfect reason for leaving everyone in a panic. Was the surf just too inviting to leave? Well, finally he confessed: He didn't know his Twitter password. So think about that: Here's a state governor who thinks he can only communicate by Twitter, which raises the question, is the state run by teenagers?",

It's gone now. But you don't need a password to stand in front of a camera and repeat \"False alarm, go back to bed.\" But apparently, Hawaiian governance is amateur hour. A state run by Democrats who not only have a hard time logging onto Twitter but also reality. Which reminds me, maybe think twice about ripping Trump over his tweets. At least he knows how.

As you know, two top agents removed from Mueller's Russia investigation exchanged tens of thousands of texts, many of them disparage President Trump who they were investigating.

You don't know what the context is, and there are people that are pushing a particular agenda that might say, well, this obviously means this. It could actually mean something else. We don't know. I've been at the White House at a time when there were emails that were on a server that went missing, and it's there was a technical problem. They didn't know where they were, and it caused a huge hullabaloo for a long time. They ultimately were found. And I think that the FBI having the tools it has probably will be able to find them. And Richard Berg, the senate intelligence committee chairman, he says that he doesn't think there was anything nefarious, that it was technical. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. I don't know. And then you have the point that -- the email you just read or the text where he says -- Strzok says I don't really think there is any there, there. That would seem to support the president's position that there is no collusion. So, it's just really very much all over the map.

If you have FBI agents texting about brushing up on Watergate and impeachment right after Trump's election and you had a talk about secret society between the FBI agent and justice officials who were the same people talking about creating an insurance policy to protect the country against the election of Donald Trump, that seems pretty sketchy to me. And these are the same people who are now working on the Mueller team before they were fired. Now, also, the counterintelligence and counterespionage agent on the FBI was tapped to be in the Mueller team and the first thing that come to his mind is there's no there, there. There's no collusion. I mean, that says a lot because that's his job. That's his wheelhouse right there. And so, he gets put in that position. They don't really find any collusion so far, and now it looks like an obstruction of justice case that they're making. And who is the chief witness for obstruction of justice? It's James Comey, the best friend for Robert Mueller. So, he illegally leaks the memo to his buddy the professor, you know, a few blocks away at Columbia. And now, Comey hires his buddy the professor to represents him as his personal attorney. So that locks down the professor's testimony very cagy. And then, all of a sudden the FBI texts go missing? The FBI, their entire job is to retain intelligence, and then they lost the intelligence from a critical time period when this investigation began? It doesn't make sense. And then today, the chief of staff or James Comey, and the current FBI director resigns all of a sudden. I'm willing to make a little bit more of it than Dana Perino. But she's always been more cautious."

It's like the Trump clip critics are relieving themselves in the wind and it feels good at the moment but then they end up all wet. There you go. Thank you. But the texts between these two FBI agents, it does reflect what we always knew and what we saw, a visceral and emotional reaction to Donald Trump.

We have a picture -- a picture of the Trump administration right now on its heels inviting to muddy up, dirty, discredit the FBI and Robert Mueller. Meanwhile, Mueller is having stepped-up activity and it's driving not only towards the possibility of collusion, but also towards obstruction of justice. And at this moment, what do you get?

And you know the line that came from the White House. This is about military, not about illegal immigrants and all that.

We're going to wait three weeks and we're going to come back to this and see what happened.

That's a fact. But at the same time, he drove off a cliff in order to achieve that. And I'm thinking to myself, who started the whole thing? It's President Obama.
