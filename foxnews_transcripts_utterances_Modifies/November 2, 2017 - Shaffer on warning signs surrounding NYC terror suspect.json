      "sentences": "So tonight, \"The Story\" begins in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Twenty-four hours from now the president will walk in the footsteps of every president since Kennedy, as he visits the USS Arizona. This is the gateway to the Pacific where President Trump will begin a hugely consequential trip to Asia where the threat for North Korea will be front and center. But first tonight. Breaking this evening, the FBI ramping up its search for answers in the New York terror truck attack. This as we are hearing for the first time from the wife of the suspect. Sayfullo Saipov's spouse and mom of three reportedly telling investigators that she is \"shocked and saddened and knew nothing about his plan.\"  Meantime, today, investigators swarmed the couple's Paterson, New Jersey apartment complex, knocking on doors, grilling anyone and everyone that may know something about him. And late this afternoon, New York City leaders, installing concrete barriers along the bike path where Saipov savagely mowed down eight innocent lives.  In moments, Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer joins me with his inside knowledge from sources close to this investigation. And Constitutional Attorney Jonathan Turley on one of the future and unapologetic suspected terrorist; how the courts will decide his fate? This is hugely controversial today. But first, we go to Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with new details on this investigation. Hi, Trace.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Martha. Tonight, investigators continue pouring over Sayfullo Saipov's social media footprints and electronic records. And we now know that along with 90 ISIS videos and nearly 4,000 of ISIS pictures and propaganda documents on his cellphone, authorities also found links to people who either were or are subjects of terror investigations. Remember, Saipov was interviewed by federal agents back in 2015 about possible ties of terror suspects, but a case against him was never open. Though, a handwritten note on the floor of the truck used in the killings stated that he carried out the attack on behalf of ISIS. Investigators are also combing surveillance video footage to reconstruct Saipov's movements in the weeks before Halloween.  We know he rented a Home Depot truck, eight days before the rampage so he could conduct a dry run so to speak, and repeatedly drive by the attack area to practice making turns. And now, Saipov's neighbors tell the L.A. Times, he frequently rented trucks but never appeared to move or haul anything. The Uzbekistan embassy says, in his home country, Sayfullo Saipov graduated college, worked as an accountant and had no criminal record. He also had no criminal record in the U.S. but did have a number of traffic violations in his work as a long-haul trucker. Saipov is a married father of three who often worked as an Uber driver. His wife, as you mentioned, was interviewed by authorities but claims she knew nothing. And the second person of interest that the New York Police were looking for has also been located, questioned, and released.  Finally, the Council on American-Islamic Relations or CAIR, says the mosque -- near Saipov's New Jersey home -- has been getting verbal threats, and the group is now calling on police to investigate.",

Look, Trace was completely correct, this individual essentially had a number of indicators that were observable; he was behaving in a peculiar matter that was not typical. Renting a truck and using that -- not doing what, it is clearly an indicator.  Another thing we have to remember, Martha, just for your audience to kind of think about the big picture. Al-Qaeda proposed this sort of vector of attacks back in 2010. ISIS perfected this, and there's been eight at least. And again, there's a pattern that should be examined and look for leading up to one of these. And the other piece of this which we had to accept is that this individual was on the scope of the radar of law enforcement back in 2015.   So, when you look at all of these things out there, these pieces now coming together to form this clear picture, it indicates that there should've been some level of warning. I don't buy for a minute, Martha, that his wife didn't know anything. And another thing too, about this mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, I've heard multiple politicians: Governor Cuomo and others say, you know, this is a lone wolf. This is not a lone wolf; this is now a pattern that's been tried-and-true by ISIS. And you know, while he doesn't have maybe a formal support network, the very mosque he was attending is the place where I suspect he was radicalized. Now one of the things notable, other folks talked about the fact that NYPD had a program to monitor these mosques for people being radicalized, now is turned off. So, these are all the things that were now coming together to show this clearly was preventable by the fact this guy was on the radar.",

When they saw this guy running around with what looked like weapons, they did the right thing and shot him.  And what's notable, which is good. You know, they don't shoot to kill, they shoot to put him down -- shoot center mass. They put him down and he lived, so the good news is, I think, we're going to -- be able to find out a lot more about how he was radicalized, who he's in contact with. But the weapons clearly, he meant -- he wanted it to be suicide by cop; he wanted to be shot, he wanted to be killed, he wanted to be a martyr.

There's also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. Death penalty!\" Here now, Constitutional Law Attorney, Jonathan Turley, joins me. Jonathan, always good to have you with us tonight. What do you make of what the president had to say there?",

Presidents have normally refrained, because it can complicate cases, it can create issues for trial, particularly in paneling a jury. So, (INAUDIBLE) courts have to go through extra steps when presidents hold forth in this way, particularly about talking about presumed guilt and sentencing. Now, having said that, I don't think that's going to make a lot of difference in this case. This is a case that, honestly, virtually devoid of any cognizable defense. He seems gleeful in admitting his guilt. There's so much evidence establishing guilt that the prosecution could probably present this case in 10 minutes and secure a verdict in about 10 more minutes. So, it will move relatively quickly. And for those that wanted it to go to Guantanamo Bay, I think they would be making a serious mistake. It would take much longer and more importantly, it would add appellate issues that he very well might prevail on.",

And I can tell you, the conviction rate is astronomical -- it's one of the highest conviction rates of any crime in the United States.

It limits mortgage interest deduction up to $500,000 on a home purchase -- that used to be in a million. Eliminates the state income tax deduction -- not popular in places like New York, New Jersey, and California. It increases the child tax credit to $1600. Reduces the tax bracket -- so now, there's 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and the 39.6 percent, this was in sort of mid-process concession. That will stay where it is for the wealthiest Americans. It doubles, and this the big deal, the standard deduction for individuals to $12,000 for families, it is $24,000 for some families that will take them out of paying taxes altogether, and for others, it will lower it considerably.

The bottom line is political magazine came with this excerpt from Brazile's new book where she recounts taking over the DNC in the summer of '16, and learning it was broke and being propped up by the Clinton camp. Because Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's team had quietly signed a deal with the Clinton camp, in which Clinton agreed to raise for the DNC to keep them afloat, basically, in exchange for her season control of the DNC strategy, their spending, and their personnel decisions. All of this happening was in private back in 2015, months before primary ballots were starting to be cast by Democrats while the DNC was publicly claiming, you remember, to Senator Bernie Sanders in the world that they were neutral. Brazile writing in this new book, \"If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have had control of party before the voters have decided which one they want to delete. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party's integrity.\" Now, the Brazile confession also has the air of someone trying to cleanse her own conscience.

He will seek to fortify our alliances with South Korea and with Japan, while engaging into a tug of war of global economic and military dominance with the Chinese leader who is emerging as the most powerful since Mao Tse- tung. President Trump has made in rows with President Xi by coaxing him to take some stronger actions to the U.N. to reign in North Korea. Still the Chinese leader makes clear his plan to challenge their neighbors by expanding territory into the South China Seas, dramatically ramping up military spending, and by demonstrating the large reach of their nuclear weapon capability to include all the U.S. bases in the Pacific as far as the U.S. mainland. North Korea its audacious smaller cousin is hotly pursuing the same bellicose goals. Kim Jong-un has levelled open threats to the U.S. and to the president in a way that we have not seen since the cold war. It is here at Pearl Harbor where the president begins his journey tomorrow night. A place that brings us back to the morning the United States was attacked by that era's Asian menace, Japan. The shocking attack killed 2,000 Americans and hurled the United States into World War II, in a fight to keep Germany and Japan from invading our shores and to stop their steady march around the world. Jolted out of sleep, literary, here, and figuratively on the U.S. mainland, the war came to America and we lunged back united to hang on to our brazenly threatened freedom and to protect our precious way of life. Today, 76 years later, a new threat looms. The people of Hawaii have been told not to panic but to prepare for the possibility of another attack this time from Kim Jong-un. The fear is real for Hawaii, and it is real from the continental United States. So it's fitting that the president will look back as he visits one of our most solemn memorials the USS Arizona which was hit and sunk taking 1,177 to their instant deaths. The first U.S. losses of World War II. He will look back and then forward as he meet first here with leaders of PACCOM, the pacific command that's based here at Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam which supports our air force and navy missions in the pacific. Here they serve as the westernmost protector of our country. Their allied responsibility covers 50 percent of the world's population, and 36 countries from this base. The strategic triangle of Hawaii, Guam and Alaska provide the forward sphere and the base of U.S. airpower presence. Just today, secretary of state Rex Tillerson's state department let pass the deadline on whether or not to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terror. Sources tell Fox that that decision will likely now come after the president trip to the region. After that earlier, National Security Adviser Henry McMaster said this.",

Twenty-four hours from now the president will walk in the footsteps of every president since Kennedy, as he visits the USS Arizona. This is the gateway to the Pacific where President Trump will begin a hugely consequential trip to Asia where the threat for North Korea will be front and center. But first tonight. Breaking this evening, the FBI ramping up its search for answers in the New York terror truck attack. This as we are hearing for the first time from the wife of the suspect. Sayfullo Saipov's spouse and mom of three reportedly telling investigators that she is \"shocked and saddened and knew nothing about his plan.\" Meantime, today, investigators swarmed the couple's Paterson, New Jersey apartment complex, knocking on doors, grilling anyone and everyone that may know something about him. And late this afternoon, New York City leaders, installing concrete barriers along the bike path where Saipov savagely mowed down eight innocent lives. In moments, Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer joins me with his inside knowledge from sources close to this investigation. And Constitutional Attorney Jonathan Turley on one of the future and unapologetic suspected terrorist; how the courts will decide his fate? This is hugely controversial today. But first, we go to Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with new details on this investigation. Hi, Trace."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Tonight, investigators continue pouring over Sayfullo Saipov's social media footprints and electronic records. And we now know that along with 90 ISIS videos and nearly 4,000 of ISIS pictures and propaganda documents on his cellphone, authorities also found links to people who either were or are subjects of terror investigations. Remember, Saipov was interviewed by federal agents back in 2015 about possible ties of terror suspects, but a case against him was never open. Though, a handwritten note on the floor of the truck used in the killings stated that he carried out the attack on behalf of ISIS. Investigators are also combing surveillance video footage to reconstruct Saipov's movements in the weeks before Halloween. We know he rented a Home Depot truck, eight days before the rampage so he could conduct a dry run so to speak, and repeatedly drive by the attack area to practice making turns. And now, Saipov's neighbors tell the L.A. Times, he frequently rented trucks but never appeared to move or haul anything. The Uzbekistan embassy says, in his home country, Sayfullo Saipov graduated college, worked as an accountant and had no criminal record. He also had no criminal record in the U.S. but did have a number of traffic violations in his work as a long-haul trucker. Saipov is a married father of three who often worked as an Uber driver. His wife, as you mentioned, was interviewed by authorities but claims she knew nothing. And the second person of interest that the New York Police were looking for has also been located, questioned, and released. Finally, the Council on American-Islamic Relations or CAIR, says the mosque -- near Saipov's New Jersey home -- has been getting verbal threats, and the group is now calling on police to investigate."

      "speaker": "SHAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think the details are slowly coming together and showing the picture which we've speculated on, but now it's being shown to be true. Look, Trace was completely correct, this individual essentially had a number of indicators that were observable; he was behaving in a peculiar matter that was not typical. Renting a truck and using that -- not doing what, it is clearly an indicator. Another thing we have to remember, Martha, just for your audience to kind of think about the big picture. Al-Qaeda proposed this sort of vector of attacks back in 2010. ISIS perfected this, and there's been eight at least. And again, there's a pattern that should be examined and look for leading up to one of these. And the other piece of this which we had to accept is that this individual was on the scope of the radar of law enforcement back in 2015."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So, when you look at all of these things out there, these pieces now coming together to form this clear picture, it indicates that there should've been some level of warning. I don't buy for a minute, Martha, that his wife didn't know anything. And another thing too, about this mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, I've heard multiple politicians",
      "utterance": "Governor Cuomo and others say, you know, this is a lone wolf. This is not a lone wolf; this is now a pattern that's been tried-and-true by ISIS. And you know, while he doesn't have maybe a formal support network, the very mosque he was attending is the place where I suspect he was radicalized. Now one of the things notable, other folks talked about the fact that NYPD had a program to monitor these mosques for people being radicalized, now is turned off. So, these are all the things that were now coming together to show this clearly was preventable by the fact this guy was on the radar."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, look, these guns -- one of the guns look completely real. The Crossman pellet gun looked like a real weapon. And this is one of those situations, Martha, where I don't know if people talk about it a great deal. Every single NYPD police officer has some level of counterterrorism training -- this is necessary. And so, these guys are trained to detect and react rapidly. So, they did the right thing. When they saw this guy running around with what looked like weapons, they did the right thing and shot him. And what's notable, which is good. You know, they don't shoot to kill, they shoot to put him down -- shoot center mass. They put him down and he lived, so the good news is, I think, we're going to -- be able to find out a lot more about how he was radicalized, who he's in contact with. But the weapons clearly, he meant -- he wanted it to be suicide by cop; he wanted to be shot, he wanted to be killed, he wanted to be a martyr. And it's good that they prevented him from being a martyr."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Thank you, Tony. So, there is a growing debate tonight about how authorities should prosecute Saipov. The president tweeted this earlier today: \"Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo, but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system. There's also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. Death penalty!\" Here now, Constitutional Law Attorney, Jonathan Turley, joins me. Jonathan, always good to have you with us tonight. What do you make of what the president had to say there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to say, I don't believe it is appropriate for the presidency talks about these types of cases. Presidents have normally refrained, because it can complicate cases, it can create issues for trial, particularly in paneling a jury. So, (INAUDIBLE) courts have to go through extra steps when presidents hold forth in this way, particularly about talking about presumed guilt and sentencing. Now, having said that, I don't think that's going to make a lot of difference in this case. This is a case that, honestly, virtually devoid of any cognizable defense. He seems gleeful in admitting his guilt. There's so much evidence establishing guilt that the prosecution could probably present this case in 10 minutes and secure a verdict in about 10 more minutes. So, it will move relatively quickly. And for those that wanted it to go to Guantanamo Bay, I think they would be making a serious mistake. It would take much longer and more importantly, it would add appellate issues that he very well might prevail on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, think about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, tried in this court system, Jose Padilla tried in this court system as well but he was designated an enemy combatant. Do you consider this suspect, we'll call him, an enemy combatant in this case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, enemy combatant status is often used in order to put them through a military tribunal. I've been a critic of the tribunals because I think they've been another failure -- very few trials have actually occurred. Their legal status is a bit fluid with the Supreme Court. You know, we have a system to try terrorists, I believe counsel and a couple of high-profile cases. And I can tell you, the conviction rate is astronomical -- it's one of the highest conviction rates of any crime in the United States. A case like this, there's not going to be much of a challenge for prosecutors. And while they can linger in appeal, these people are in jail, he'll never see another free day in his life, and he's a virtual led pipe sentence for the death penalty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, it's good that he's alive and that he can give investigators some indication of the way that he was radicalized, they can learn something about his background, hopefully. He's gleeful, apparently; he feels like he did a great job when he rammed his truck down in that bike pathway, and he feels good about that. He wanted to have ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room. I mean, you know, this guy is exactly what we need to -- you know, we need to find these people like him who are out there in the country and who want to do the same thing, Jonathan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. I think that most of the effort in the Department of Justice in these days is not necessarily going to be building a case of prosecution; that case, he built himself and it's really watertight. They're going to be doing these hops, getting farther and farther away from him to see his circle of friends. They're going to look at his friends; his wife could very well face allegations. Her case could be more of a challenge."

So, in the House version, those stay intact, you can still deduct up to 18,000 that can be contributed tax-free. It limits mortgage interest deduction up to $500,000 on a home purchase -- that used to be in a million. Eliminates the state income tax deduction -- not popular in places like New York, New Jersey, and California. It increases the child tax credit to $1600. Reduces the tax bracket -- so now, there's 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and the 39.6 percent, this was in sort of mid-process concession. That will stay where it is for the wealthiest Americans. It doubles, and this the big deal, the standard deduction for individuals to $12,000 for families, it is $24,000 for some families that will take them out of paying taxes altogether, and for others, it will lower it considerably.

It's not really a surprise that the primaries were rigged for Hillary Clinton, what is stunning is the new level of detail from an insider like Donna Brazile about the lying, and frankly, for a lack of a better word, the collusion was much deeper than we ever knew. The bottom line is political magazine came with this excerpt from Brazile's new book where she recounts taking over the DNC in the summer of '16, and learning it was broke and being propped up by the Clinton camp. Because Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's team had quietly signed a deal with the Clinton camp, in which Clinton agreed to raise for the DNC to keep them afloat, basically, in exchange for her season control of the DNC strategy, their spending, and their personnel decisions. All of this happening was in private back in 2015, months before primary ballots were starting to be cast by Democrats while the DNC was publicly claiming, you remember, to Senator Bernie Sanders in the world that they were neutral. Brazile writing in this new book, \"If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have had control of party before the voters have decided which one they want to delete. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party's integrity.\" Now, the Brazile confession also has the air of someone trying to cleanse her own conscience. Because remember, when she was at CNN, she got caught steering questions to Clinton before a candidate's form with Sanders after denying it to Fox. Listen."

And then, last March, Brazile misled about Clinton collusion telling Time Magazine, in reality, not only was I not playing favorites, the more competitive and heated the primary got, the harder the DNC staff work to be speciously be fair and beyond reproach. In all the months the Russians monitored the DNC emails they found just a handful of inappropriate emails with no sign of anyone taking action to disadvantage to Sanders campaign. That doesn't seem to be true. It also turns out Brazile reveals the man who help broker the fund raising deal between the DNC and the Clinton camp was Mark Elias. Yes, the same Elias who used Clinton and DNC funds to help fund that unverified dossier you heard Clinton talking about on the daily show a moment ago. By the way, Sanders today had no comments. Wasserman Shultz staff says she's proud of her work at the DNC. Martha?"

Juan, let me start with you, there may be a bit of an effort here by Donna Brazile to come clean on some of what was happening with the DNC that proves that Bernie Sanders really never had a shot given the financial control that Hillary took before the primary was even over. JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, I think that's right. I don't think anything that Donna has written is that big of shock. But what it is shocking is that it's very clear and she backs it up because she name names and describes the kind of fiscal crisis that the DNC was in that, obviously, the Clinton campaign was using the DNC as a surrogate, basically. They were just doing whatever they were told to do because they were under the financial control of the Hillary Clinton campaign. The bigger picture to me, Martha, is that an insider, a leading Democratic figure like Donna Brazile would take on the Clintons at this juncture. I think in the old days nobody wanted to mess with the Clinton machine."

And Donna Brazile being able to come out and talk about this. I want to put up a tweet from President Trump, now President Trump, he was the candidate back then, this was May 18, 2016, Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats, he wrote. The system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me. Kayleigh, what do you think about all this?"

I know Juan said this isn't shocking, but it is deeply shocking, particularly to New York Times reporter Ken Vogel who asked about this and the DNC said you're off face, this didn't happen. But what did happen was there's basically quid pro quo corruption. The DNC was having their debt dissolve by Hillary Clinton, and in return Hillary Clinton, of course, got to control the DNC. And not only that, they were silencing Democratic voters. And remember, fabricating stories about Bernie Sanders during the primary, their own candidate, when they floated the idea of calling him an atheist in Kentucky and Virginia. A False attacks on Bernie Sanders, he was not an atheist, he came out and said that, but they said that these fabricated stories to try to drown his candidacy. Their own candidate, let's remind everyone."

They've got no help from the DNC, that the database was terrible, that they were broke, I mean, so is that part of this story as well? I mean, is she going to argue that we've had to take over the finances because it was such a mess, or does that indicate that they were much deeper in much earlier on that she's willing to admit?"

He will seek to fortify our alliances with South Korea and with Japan, while engaging into a tug of war of global economic and military dominance with the Chinese leader who is emerging as the most powerful since Mao Tse- tung. President Trump has made in rows with President Xi by coaxing him to take some stronger actions to the U.N. to reign in North Korea. Still the Chinese leader makes clear his plan to challenge their neighbors by expanding territory into the South China Seas, dramatically ramping up military spending, and by demonstrating the large reach of their nuclear weapon capability to include all the U.S. bases in the Pacific as far as the U.S. mainland. North Korea its audacious smaller cousin is hotly pursuing the same bellicose goals. Kim Jong-un has levelled open threats to the U.S. and to the president in a way that we have not seen since the cold war. It is here at Pearl Harbor where the president begins his journey tomorrow night. A place that brings us back to the morning the United States was attacked by that era's Asian menace, Japan. The shocking attack killed 2,000 Americans and hurled the United States into World War II, in a fight to keep Germany and Japan from invading our shores and to stop their steady march around the world. Jolted out of sleep, literary, here, and figuratively on the U.S. mainland, the war came to America and we lunged back united to hang on to our brazenly threatened freedom and to protect our precious way of life. Today, 76 years later, a new threat looms. The people of Hawaii have been told not to panic but to prepare for the possibility of another attack this time from Kim Jong-un. The fear is real for Hawaii, and it is real from the continental United States. So it's fitting that the president will look back as he visits one of our most solemn memorials the USS Arizona which was hit and sunk taking 1,177 to their instant deaths. The first U.S. losses of World War II. He will look back and then forward as he meet first here with leaders of PACCOM, the pacific command that's based here at Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam which supports our air force and navy missions in the pacific. Here they serve as the westernmost protector of our country. Their allied responsibility covers 50 percent of the world's population, and 36 countries from this base. The strategic triangle of Hawaii, Guam and Alaska provide the forward sphere and the base of U.S. airpower presence. Just today, secretary of state Rex Tillerson's state department let pass the deadline on whether or not to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terror. Sources tell Fox that that decision will likely now come after the president trip to the region. After that earlier, National Security Adviser Henry McMaster said this."

And it's great to see you at that very sacred location in America, and is also one of the most beautiful places to visit in America. But it is very solemn, that to be sure. Yeah. This trip is crucial, very important like his Middle East historic trip, and once a year -- even more so because he has to reset the table here. What's been happening, and you mention in the introduction, China has moved somewhere between competitor and adversary, and they've been trampling on our allies national interest, eroding their sovereignty in the region for a number of years, and also at the expense of the United States. So he's got to -- number one, reassure that American leadership is back here and he's going to do that personally even though all of his leaders have already done it before him. And then secondly, he's got major economic issues here because he pulled out of the pacific trade agreements, and yet he wants increased trade with these countries and he wants to be that trade to be fair and balanced. And then the most important part of the trip certainly will be and it'll be center stage is when he goes to China. This is the most important bilateral relationship the United States will have in the 21st century. And they are on a very ambitious strategic course to replace the United States as the preeminent global power in the world. That is the mantle that Xi has been given by the communist party congress, and they're about that business. Job one will be to convince them to denuclearize North Korea. Job two will be to bring him back in to fair economic trade practices and stop the currency manipulation. And job three, will be to convince him to re-stake our claim as a Pacific power that we're not going to tolerate you eroding the sovereignty of our allies in the region and trampling over our national interest.

And that big power competition both Russia and China wants to change the international order that the United States and the west established because it's not in their national interests.
