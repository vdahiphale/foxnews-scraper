Now, once again, Democrats are guilty of what they accuse Trump of, whether we're talking Stacey Abrams in the 2018, Georgia governor's race; or Hillary in the 2016 presidential race. These people are always vindictive, sore losers. And seeing the writing on the wall, Pelosi knows that her party's about to get shellacked, because they're getting dragged down by a president who seems to be decomposing before our eyes. A second poll and as many weeks has Trump winning in 2024. The Harvard Harris poll has them up by a significant margin of six points. Now, look, any poll is just a snapshot in time, and it will make too much of it and it's very early. But I think this matters here, because in 2016 Trump led in just a handful of head-to-head match-ups against Clinton. Well, we all know how that turned out. But for 15 months now, voters have been witnessing Biden in action. And they're not living in the wreckage of his policies. And we know they're miserable. These polls are just showing us that Americans genuinely are regretting their votes for Joe Biden. Now, things are so bad for the White House that Donald Trump kicked off Twitter and Facebook is more influential in many ways than the Liberals currently in power.

It's an epic failure. The Ugly Truth is the self-proclaimed defenders of democracy hate our system. And they also hate most of the voters. They want the entire Electoral College scrapped. They want to pack the court. They support justices who disregard the plain language of the Constitution. And for all their tough talk against autocrats like Putin, they prefer their own brand of autocracy, where only they and their big tech oligarchs, not the voters, get to decide who's worthy. Worthy of being heard and worthy of running for office. In fact, unless they're Republicans like, I don't know, Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney, Democrats don't really think you should exist at all. Now, remember their mantra. Conservatives are a threat to democracy. Trump's puppets are Putin's puppets. They're all insurrectionist and racist and anti-LGBTQ, and just mean people who want to burn up the planet, gun nuts trying to drive their huge trucks to complain at school board meetings. It's so stale. It's so it's insipid. None of it is landing with the public. The voters are not worried about January 6. They're worried about $6 a gallon gas. They're not stressed so much about climate change. They're stressed about crime. It's all unraveling at home. And Biden's team thought they'd boost his popularity by sending him to Poland. So they're so desperate now for traction, they're even going back to the character assassination that Biden took part in 31 years ago. Spurious attacks on Justice Clarence Thomas. Now, this time, they're using his wife's personal activism against him. This is both ludicrous and pathetic. More on that travesty later in the show. The left has been trying to cancel Trump since about 2015. And they're still trying today. Now if he doesn't run, they'll do the same to any Republican candidate who steps in to try to fill that void. You already see what they've tried to unleash against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, lie about his parental rights legislation, lie about his COVID record, even tried to criticize them when he was with his wife at her last chemotherapy appointment. How low can they go? But the better question is, how low could Joe go in the polls? And how long will vulnerable Democrats in choppy waters tie themselves to the sinking anvil? And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now in studio, it's so great to see him, is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, I think they've run out of ideas. They've run out of strategies, and they're going back to the old playbook. Smear and try to, I guess, just cancel people with whom they disagree.",

You and I both clerked at the Supreme Court. We've seen what they want justices to do. They want nine unelected lawyers to mandate every policy outcome in the country. On a question of life, in the next couple of months, the Supreme Court may well overturn Roe vs. Wade, sending the question of abortion back to the states. The Democrats don't want the voters to have that right. They want to say, you have no right to make decisions like that. It's five lawyers in robes in Washington. They don't believe in democracy. And if you look, they know their ideas are unpopular. It's why they hide from what they believe. How many Democrats talk about gun control?

And in this document, we find some startling revelations. First, Pfizer's own trail showed that those who were previously infected were protected from severe disease. Who else told you that two years ago? In other words, natural immunity was known to these vaccine makers and still remained taboo to discuss. Secondly, and perhaps more alarming given what we just heard from Pfizer's CEO, the vaccine was actually increasing the chances that you got COVID in the seven days following the inoculation.

Now, once again, Democrats are guilty of what they accuse Trump of, whether we're talking Stacey Abrams in the 2018, Georgia governor's race; or Hillary in the 2016 presidential race. These people are always vindictive, sore losers. And seeing the writing on the wall, Pelosi knows that her party's about to get shellacked, because they're getting dragged down by a president who seems to be decomposing before our eyes. A second poll and as many weeks has Trump winning in 2024. The Harvard Harris poll has them up by a significant margin of six points. Now, look, any poll is just a snapshot in time, and it will make too much of it and it's very early. But I think this matters here, because in 2016 Trump led in just a handful of head-to-head match-ups against Clinton. Well, we all know how that turned out. But for 15 months now, voters have been witnessing Biden in action. And they're not living in the wreckage of his policies. And we know they're miserable. These polls are just showing us that Americans genuinely are regretting their votes for Joe Biden.

They want to pack the court. They support justices who disregard the plain language of the Constitution. And for all their tough talk against autocrats like Putin, they prefer their own brand of autocracy, where only they and their big tech oligarchs, not the voters, get to decide who's worthy. Worthy of being heard and worthy of running for office. In fact, unless they're Republicans like, I don't know, Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney, Democrats don't really think you should exist at all. Now, remember their mantra. Conservatives are a threat to democracy. Trump's puppets are Putin's puppets. They're all insurrectionist and racist and anti-LGBTQ, and just mean people who want to burn up the planet, gun nuts trying to drive their huge trucks to complain at school board meetings. It's so stale. It's so it's insipid. None of it is landing with the public. The voters are not worried about January 6. They're worried about $6 a gallon gas. They're not stressed so much about climate change. They're stressed about crime. It's all unraveling at home. And Biden's team thought they'd boost his popularity by sending him to Poland. So they're so desperate now for traction, they're even going back to the character assassination that Biden took part in 31 years ago. Spurious attacks on Justice Clarence Thomas. Now, this time, they're using his wife's personal activism against him. This is both ludicrous and pathetic. More on that travesty later in the show. The left has been trying to cancel Trump since about 2015. And they're still trying today. Now if he doesn't run, they'll do the same to any Republican candidate who steps in to try to fill that void. You already see what they've tried to unleash against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, lie about his parental rights legislation, lie about his COVID record, even tried to criticize them when he was with his wife at her last chemotherapy appointment. How low can they go? But the better question is, how low could Joe go in the polls? And how long will vulnerable Democrats in choppy waters tie themselves to the sinking anvil? And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now in studio, it's so great to see him, is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, I think they've run out of ideas.

On a question of life, in the next couple of months, the Supreme Court may well overturn Roe vs. Wade, sending the question of abortion back to the states. The Democrats don't want the voters to have that right. They want to say, you have no right to make decisions like that. It's five lawyers in robes in Washington. They don't believe in democracy.

We all told him, this was the case. The laptop was real. The eyewitness was real. The documents, the emails were real. 10 percent for the big guy was real. It was accurate. Everyone knew this. Just big tech and big media and the Democrat party, all colluded along with 51 former Intel people, all colluded to keep this information from the American people just days before the most important election we have. So, yes, Hunter Biden took millions from folks in Russia, the wife of the mayor of Moscow, took millions from Ukrainian energy company and took millions of dollars from companies with connections to the Chinese Communist Party. It was all true. It was all accurate. It was all real. We just got to highlight it, because the American people are so fed up with this administration. They got to know all the facts.

Kamala, that same poll has her losing to Donald Trump by 11 points in a hypothetical matchup. So, her plans for a course correction don't look like they're going to help with much. \"The L.A. Times\" reports that \"Harris, in her toughest hour, is keeping a, quote, \"tighter circle,\" one that occludes her husband Doug Emhoff, and sister Maya Harris. Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator and host of \"The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast.\" Dinesh, the article also notes that Harris believes that her race and gender are the reasons for unpopularity.

And there are subjects and verbs and objects involved. But you can listen for minutes on end, and then realize that she has done absolutely nothing. How it's possible to do that is itself a kind of talent, I guess. But I think with Kamala Harris, public incoherence has obviously now become -- we know with Biden, he can stumble and he can stutter, but you can pick up his meaning. He's angry, he's cranky, he's illogical, but he's conveying what he's trying to convey.

By the way, the party of lynching was the Democrats. FDR, for example, was able to cement his alliance with southern Democrats by blocking antilynching laws. All of this, of course, is completely swept under the rug. But to me, today, passing federal laws against lynching is like passing federal laws against which burning or federal laws against cannibalism. I suppose theoretically you could say it's occurring somewhere someplace, but this is hardly a national or social problem. So there is a certain kind of dementia, I think, here, in not only doing this, but then patting yourself on the back as if you're taking a courageous moral stance."

So he is trailing Trump by six points. Kamala Harris is trailing Trump by 11 points. But they are in a pickle. If he decides that he can't run or he's not going to run, probably won't run, it's going to be very difficult for them not to open the door to allow her to run. She's obviously going to claim racism and sexism. And yet, she's wildly unpopular, and no sense that she's going to change course to make herself more popular. So the Democrats are in a complete pickle, and these leaves, what, Pete Buttigieg, as Ted Cruz just said, or maybe what's his face in Texas whose name I always forget who is running in Texas -- yes, Beto O'Rourke. I always forget his name. I'm having a Joe Biden moment. So Beto O'Rourke, I guess Amy Klobuchar. But she's never going to let that happen.

And in this document, we find some startling revelations. First, Pfizer's own trail showed that those who were previously infected were protected from severe disease. Who else told you that two years ago? In other words, natural immunity was known to these vaccine makers and still remained taboo to discuss.
