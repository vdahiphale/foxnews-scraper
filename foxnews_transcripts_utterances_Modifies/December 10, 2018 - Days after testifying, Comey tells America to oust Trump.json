You don't have a duty to give all the information to the FISA judge when you're going to go get a warrant to go spy on a fellow American citizen? That was his response, and he's the top guy at the FBI. That was scary when we saw that.

We should give the information.\"  But the fact that he doesn't believe there is a legal duty to present all evidence to the FISA Court. So, he didn't really think there was a legal duty to tell the court who paid for the document?

I did not intend to single out any individual or group.\" But the reaction on social media was largely supportive of Murray with people responding to USA Today's articles saying things like \"can someone organize a boycott of USA Today?\" And \"they didn't surface, you dug them up.\" And that USA Today was \"using dumb crap he tweeted when he was 15 to ruin the greatest achievement of his life.\" The response to Kyler Murray was also positive like this quoting again.  You were a child. The media is despicable and I am sorry you have to deal with their witch-hunt. And this, \"no need for an apology 14, 15-year-old guys say and do stuff that is mind-boggling in reflection.

And the Medicare regulations and Medicaid regulations say you have to. So, the regulations being challenged, the Louisiana wanted to argue the Supreme Court, we should be able to spend our money how we want. And the appeal process is to ask the Supreme Court for permission to hear the appeal. Four justices is all it takes to require all nine to hear the appeal. In this case, only three voted yes. The three you mentioned, Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch. And six voted no. So, the right to life community today is all a bother. Wait a minute. We thought Brett Kavanaugh was one of us. And I have to say the right to life community, Brett Kavanaugh may very well be one of you, but on the court, he is going to make a decision based on the law. I wish he would have voted yes. I would have been with the state of Louisiana. I don't think like the president that the state should have to spend tax dollars on Planned Parenthood but there are a lot of reasons aside from ideology while just justices vote not to take a case. This is not the right case to take. We have other cases that are more important and more timely right now. This is a very technical issue about the standing of a person to sue a state. This is not on the merits of whether or not Louisiana must spend this money. When you vote not to take the case you don't give reasons why you are not taking it so we don't know what Justice Kavanaugh was thinking. But I'm suggesting to the people who are pro-life they should not assume he is a trigger to them. They should assume that he is doing what he believes is the right thing under the law.",

You don't have a duty to give all the information to the FISA judge when you're going to go get a warrant to go spy on a fellow American citizen? That was his response, and he's the top guy at the FBI. That was scary when we saw that. I thought it was a great question that John asked, and that was his first response. \"I don't think there's a legal duty.\" He said, \"Certainly, we should do it. We should give the information.\"  But the fact that he doesn't believe there is a legal duty to present all evidence to the FISA Court. So, he didn't really think there was a legal duty to tell the court who paid for the document? He didn't think there was a legal duty to tell the court that the guy who wrote the darn thing had been terminated because he was out leaking information to the press.

Let's find out all the answers to important questions. Let's get the truth for the American people. But here we have the guys who are going to be running the committees in the next Congress already got the president tried and convicted, and going to prison. That is ridiculous.  That is unfortunate.

Jim Baker demoted then, left. Lisa Page demoted then, left. And deputy director of the counterintelligence, Peter Strzok was demoted then, fired. Those were the key people. We do know all that.

And so this is nothing to do with his abilities or inabilities, as much it is really trying to make sure that the president has someone that can move it forward. And you got to look at the chief of staff job, you know, historically, whether it's this president or any other president, the tenure of chief of staff's has not been a long four year or five-year process. And so, you know, it's a demanding job. It's a job that keeps you on call 24/7.

Some of the allegations they make are quite explosive, Martha. And as we just look at the contributions. Now, everybody is focused on the contributions for the Clinton Foundation and what has happened just in the last year. But if you look at it, you know, it has a you know, a very strong rise the minute she was selected as Secretary of State. It dipped down when she was no longer then, then rose again when she decided to run for president. So there's all kinds of allegations of you know, pay to play and that kind of thing.

They've turned over their documents not only to the FBI but they turned them over to the IRS. And you know, I've been led to believe that there is actually an ongoing investigation with the FBI even though DOJ is not independently confirming that.

Most were deleted hours after he won the Heisman but it didn't take long for outlets like USA Today to write articles saying Murray's \"memorable night also helped resurface social medias memory of several homophobic tweets\" leading Murray to issue an apology saying, \"I used a poor choice of words that doesn't reflect who I am or what I believe. I did not intend to single out any individual or group.\" But the reaction on social media was largely supportive of Murray with people responding to USA Today's articles saying things like \"can someone organize a boycott of USA Today?\" And \"they didn't surface, you dug them up.\" And that USA Today was \"using dumb crap he tweeted when he was 15 to ruin the greatest achievement of his life.\" The response to Kyler Murray was also positive like this quoting again.  You were a child. The media is despicable and I am sorry you have to deal with their witch-hunt. And this, \"no need for an apology 14, 15-year-old guys say and do stuff that is mind-boggling in reflection. I know I sure did. It's part of growing up. Congrats on the Heisman. Murray and the Oklahoma Sooners will face top-ranked Alabama in the college football playoff. If the Sooners lose, Murray is off to play major league baseball having already signed a multi-million dollar contract with the Oakland A's. And his controversy comes days after comedian Kevin Hart stepped down from hosting the Oscars after some anti-gay tweets surface from eight or nine years ago. Hart set on Instagram that he hadn't change -- or he had changed but didn't apologize though he eventually posted this tweeting \"I'm sorry that I hurt people.

I don't know a lot of people who haven't changed their opinions since there were 14 years old or don't regret dumb stuff they said when they were 14 or 15 years old.

And what needs to happen is that we all should be on the same team, which is team process, team due process. What we should care about is getting to the truth. And right now, in too many cases in too many colleges under the current regulation that is not happening. Because clients like mine are being subjected to what essentially amounts to a star chamber where they are not told that they are accused of, they are not given a hearing and they are not given any chance to question the people for making accusations and then subsequently they are expelled and branded rapists."

      "utterance": "Yes. And their life is basically over. You know, I've seen cases where the person goes to their new school that they work hard to get into it. And within days they are also ejected from that school because the word has now followed them of what happened at their prior school that they felt they were falsely accused of. This is from NARAL. They say the new rule from Betsy DeVos would require universities to allow accused sexual abusers to cross examine and retraumatize their victims. This is sickening. This is the kind of falsehood that is really poisoning this discussion. Is it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAZELON",
      "utterance": "Yes. That is not true. So how it would work is that both sides would have the right to cross examine each other through an adviser. So, we are talking about an indirect process that would presumably be subject to reasonable limitations. And that's not the only mistruth that is out there. Other organizations have claimed including the ACLU that these proceedings are going to favor the accused, which isn't true. All of the rights again are reciprocal and meant to benefit both sides."

      "utterance": "You know, it always seems to me when I look at these situations and I've interviewed, you know, a number of young men who have been in situations that they felt were completely unjust to them. You know, the problem is as you, I think so rightly say, you really need to strip away the sex of both of the people involved and just look at the evidence in front of the case and figure out who is the, who was wronged? Who was actually wronged?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAZELON",
      "utterance": "Right. And to do that what you need to do is have some way of testing the truth of the allegation. We don't in this country accuse, condemn and ban people based on the untested allegations. That's just an undemocratic principle. That is not the way our country is supposed to work."

    {
      "speaker": "BAZELON",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, I'm not completely embracing every single suggestion. I think there is absolutely room for improvement here. My point is that the due process protections are completely in line with case after case of courts reversing what schools have done, reversing expulsions because they say the students were denied any semblance of a due process. However, there is plenty of room for improvement. So, for example, there should be some redefinition of what constitutes sexual assault. I think the DeVos definition is unduly narrow. I also think it's incredibly important that we collect data on race and socioeconomic class. Because in my experience and the experience of my colleagues, it is people of color upon whom these punishments fall the hardest. And yet, because the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education doesn't collect data and doesn't count, we don't know empirically know what's going on."

Opting not to hear a case that called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood in some state Medicaid programs in Louisiana. Chief Justice John Roberts also voted against hearing that case but conservative justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch criticized the move by Kavanaugh. Joining me now is Judge Andrew Napolitano. Fox news senior judicial analyst. Judge, good to see you on this Monday everything."

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Well, this is the state of Louisiana lost in the lower courts as to whether or not the state has to use the state funds to fund Planned Parenthood. And the Medicare regulations and Medicaid regulations say you have to. So, the regulations being challenged, the Louisiana wanted to argue the Supreme Court, we should be able to spend our money how we want. And the appeal process is to ask the Supreme Court for permission to hear the appeal. Four justices is all it takes to require all nine to hear the appeal. In this case, only three voted yes. The three you mentioned, Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch. And six voted no. So, the right to life community today is all a bother. Wait a minute. We thought Brett Kavanaugh was one of us. And I have to say the right to life community, Brett Kavanaugh may very well be one of you, but on the court, he is going to make a decision based on the law. I wish he would have voted yes. I would have been with the state of Louisiana. I don't think like the president that the state should have to spend tax dollars on Planned Parenthood but there are a lot of reasons aside from ideology while just justices vote not to take a case. This is not the right case to take. We have other cases that are more important and more timely right now. This is a very technical issue about the standing of a person to sue a state. This is not on the merits of whether or not Louisiana must spend this money. When you vote not to take the case you don't give reasons why you are not taking it so we don't know what Justice Kavanaugh was thinking. But I'm suggesting to the people who are pro-life they should not assume he is a trigger to them. They should assume that he is doing what he believes is the right thing under the law."

They are certainly not putting forth Michael Cohen and vouching for his credibility. He just pleaded guilty to lying under oath. For them to have said this, and this is a very sophisticated federal prosecuting office, the most highly regarded in the country once headed by Rudy Giuliani and (Inaudible). Once headed by James Comey. For them to have said that, they must have had some corroborated evidence for it. Because they can't ethically tell something to a federal judge they can't prove."

And helped him and got a sense of where he was going with it and what he wanted to do with it. And then when we were given the final prognosis and knew the end was coming, he entrusted me to finish it for him.

But along with being hard, I knew that it was what I needed to do. And it felt like the right thing to do.

And to him that was the most precious thing was what we had. And you know, that wasn't to be mixed up with the rest of it. But and it was something that I dealt with too, of figuring out how much to share in this book. But I decided looking to his example of how he spoke about his father and realizing that it's different when you are raising someone who is going to grow into the words that you've said versus someone who is left and who you want to honor and celebrate and let the world know about, which was--"
