President Trump has reported to have said last year that journalists should have been jailed to force them to reveal their sources, quote, \"these people should be executed. They are scumbags.\" Let me take a stand here and say I'm very strongly against the execution of journalists. Former national security adviser charges that his one-time boss did improperly pressure Ukraine as Democrats charged during impeachment and that he asked Chinese President Xi for help getting re-elected. While the Trump Justice Department is suing to block the book, a federal judge refused yesterday to issue an injunction.  Bolton and his publisher simultaneously leaked copies to New York Times and Washington Post, placed an excerpt in The Wall Street Journal and taped an interview airing tonight with ABC's Martha Raddatz.",

But it reveals a Bolton that I think vindicates a lot of assumptions that his critics have had about him for a long time, someone who is very catty, someone who never let's go over grudge. Basically, you have meeting notes. And then you have John Bolton's description of why he was right and everyone else was wrong. As David Ignatius at the Washington Post put it, he can't go 12 pages without criticizing Jim Mathis. He criticizes Nikki Haley. He criticizes everyone around him. Bolton is always confident that he's 100 percent the right and honorable person in the room.  And I think people can, you know, take away from this book what they will about his attitude towards the president who frequently questions his assumptions, and really didn't want to go along with the agenda that he has. Is this a big story? Yes, but I also think that it's a big story about the fact that the president even hired him in the first place, someone so inconsistent with the approach that he had when he was in running in 2016.

And so I think the press, if you're on the left and you don't believe -- and you believe that President Trump could have said, yes. China, help my re-election. Yes, I support concentration camps. Then that is the angle that you're going to go with. And if you're on the right, you're going to say, well, look, John Bolton was fired. It's, you know, sour grapes. You know, he's an opportunist. He got a $2 million advance. We need to take what he says with a grain of salt. The American public, I think, is in those same two camps as well. What we are missing from the analysis is an analysis.

I think in this instance, though, it's probably a good idea for to president at least try to refute some of the claims Bolton is making rather than saying absolutely nothing. He has got members of his administration, not just Pompeo but saying they were in the room with Bolton. And none of these things that Bolton is claiming happened.   I think the president should also come out and say whether this is true or to try to push back without the insults. But at this point, this is all baked in with the president.

There are actually numerous factual problems in the book, from my perspective, including basic things like the spelling of Congressional members' name and things like that that would have thought would've gone over with a fine-tooth comb that indicate potential problems underneath it. I do think that this is a book, though, that deserved to be published. It deserves to get out there.

They had a more altruistic goal and they're doing it -- putting themselves in harm's way for the greater good.

Then the rally, but one is indoor, one is outdoor. You know, people are waiting masks outside. There's no requirement for the masks on the inside. So there are aspects to have media recognizing that they are getting called out. And they are trying to address it which I find interesting.",

President Trump has reported to have said last year that journalists should have been jailed to force them to reveal their sources, quote, \"these people should be executed. They are scumbags.\" Let me take a stand here and say I'm very strongly against the execution of journalists. Former national security adviser charges that his one-time boss did improperly pressure Ukraine as Democrats charged during impeachment and that he asked Chinese President Xi for help getting re-elected. While the Trump Justice Department is suing to block the book, a federal judge refused yesterday to issue an injunction. Bolton and his publisher simultaneously leaked copies to New York Times and Washington Post, placed an excerpt in The Wall Street Journal and taped an interview airing tonight with ABC's Martha Raddatz."

Ben, I know you're not a fan of John Bolton.

But it reveals a Bolton that I think vindicates a lot of assumptions that his critics have had about him for a long time, someone who is very catty, someone who never let's go over grudge. Basically, you have meeting notes. And then you have John Bolton's description of why he was right and everyone else was wrong. As David Ignatius at the Washington Post put it, he can't go 12 pages without criticizing Jim Mathis. He criticizes Nikki Haley. He criticizes everyone around him. Bolton is always confident that he's 100 percent the right and honorable person in the room. And I think people can, you know, take away from this book what they will about his attitude towards the president who frequently questions his assumptions, and really didn't want to go along with the agenda that he has. Is this a big story? Yes, but I also think that it's a big story about the fact that the president even hired him in the first place, someone so inconsistent with the approach that he had when he was in running in 2016. And I think that that raises a lot of question marks about the team that he has."

It's about whether or not individuals believe that President Trump could have done or said the things that John Bolton said that he did in his book. And so I think the press, if you're on the left and you don't believe -- and you believe that President Trump could have said, yes. China, help my re-election. Yes, I support concentration camps. Then that is the angle that you're going to go with. And if you're on the right, you're going to say, well, look, John Bolton was fired. It's, you know, sour grapes. You know, he's an opportunist. He got a $2 million advance. We need to take what he says with a grain of salt. The American public, I think, is in those same two camps as well. What we are missing from the analysis is an analysis. We are not seeing critical thinking and critical analysis of this book and its contents in the press."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, by the way, putting out a statement saying he's a traitor who is spreading lies and half-truths. But when the president tweets that Bolton is a wacko, a disgruntled boring fool. Let's see, a liar, an incompetent, a sick puppy, and yesterday despicable.

And in this instance, a book like this is obviously going to drive someone like President Trump completely batty. And he's showing it on Twitter. I think in this instance, though, it's probably a good idea for to president at least try to refute some of the claims Bolton is making rather than saying absolutely nothing. He has got members of his administration, not just Pompeo but saying they were in the room with Bolton. And none of these things that Bolton is claiming happened. I think the president should also come out and say whether this is true or to try to push back without the insults. But at this point, this is all baked in with the president. He does get down the dirt with people. He fights back pretty hard. His base loves it. So nothing new here with the way he's responded."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think it does go too far. I think the president, though, is you know always works at 11. I think John Bolton does, too. And my big question about this book I think the better position to take with this would be to put forward people refuting the claims that he makes in the book. There are actually numerous factual problems in the book, from my perspective, including basic things like the spelling of Congressional members' name and things like that that would have thought would've gone over with a fine-tooth comb that indicate potential problems underneath it. I do think that this is a book, though, that deserved to be published. It deserves to get out there. And people can assess in future administration will assess whether they can trust John Bolton as someone who they can bring back in the government in the future. I kind of think that this is him going on a path that doesn't allow that sort of thing to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, the book is number one on Amazon. Capri, my real feeling is that the Justice Department suit wasn't really serious about blocking publication because it didn't include the publisher, Simon and Schuster, as a defendant. And I think it's more aimed at the president trying to make sure that the proceeds from the book are frozen and John Bolton doesn't make a dime on this book, your take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "I totally agree with that, Howard. And we've seen this in previous instances with, I believe for example, the author that wrote the book about SEAL Team Six. You know, the book was not blocked, but that individual had to give the proceeds back. And I think that by in large a lot of people, Democrats and Republicans alike, see this John Bolton book as essentially as a cash cow for John Bolton or else he would have testified if he was this, you know, concerned and had all of this information. He would have testified without a subpoena. This is the kind of criticism we are hearing from people like Adam Schiff and Speaker Pelosi. And so I think that President Trump is trying to hit John Bolton where it hurts and that's in the pocketbook."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And Susan, the judge also said, well, the horse is out of the barn as far as the book. I mean, here it is.

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "It's all out there. All, you know, all the juicy parts have been fully exposed and written about and chewed over by everybody. We have all seen it. I guess it would be on principle now to continue this to try to block the book and to set a precedent, I guess, for future books that others might try to write about the president. I think that's an important point here, too. There have been a string of officials that have come out of the White House with negative things to say about the president. And Bolton is setting a pattern here where, you know, you can make a lot of money if you write a book about President Trump while he's still in office."

Now, it so happens that Friday night Attorney General Barr fired the U.S. Attorney right now, Geoff Berman, who is a Trump appointee by the way, not an Obama hold-over. Berman refused to go. President yesterday said you're fire. Now, he's going to be out of there. The New York Times says this is a crisis, because the southern district, of course, in New York, is it a crisis?"

Most of the coverage was sort of in line with this New York Times headline. Trump rally fizzles as attendance falls short of campaign's expectations. And I have a sense the pundits are sort of enjoying this."

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, they are. I mean, I think the media got what they wanted out of this. They spent the past couple of weeks putting all types of scary headlines out here about how this event was going to be a super spreader. What's interesting, Howie, is I was actually at the last Trump rally that he had before all of this happened in South Carolina. He had roughly the same amount of people there that he actually had in Tulsa last night in terms of that arena. This is kind of a normal size for them. But I think that the campaign made a mistake in terms of boosting up the expectations that they had for the size of this event beforehand. And, you know, frankly, the president looked a little rusty to me in terms of his ability to connect with the crowd. He does, you know, enjoy these events but he always wants to have kind of dominant show of force in terms of his supporters. I think the media got what they wanted here and scared a lot of people away."

And I think Ben is absolutely right that, you know, the way the media has covered the president's rallies even prior to the pandemic. It's always been about whether he can bring in a big crowd, the size, the energy, the way he draws from the crowd. And so as of yesterday, the story kind of shift a little bit because there were these huge expectations. They thought there were going to be a million people. It turns out that there was some high jinx (ph) going on where people were buying up tickets in -- or making phoney reservations to go to the rally. And I think the pandemic issue is another thing that the press really we wanted to cover here. How many people were going to show up to go to an indoor rally? This is not an outside protest. It's an indoor rally in the middle of a pandemic."

The president earlier in the week had blamed the far left fake news media for trying to COVID-shame him on the rallies. And then during protests in the wake of George Floyd's death, you heard very little of the Coronavirus and almost all you heard about the Oklahoma rally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "Right. This is a really interesting dichotomy, I think. And I think that there are two things going on. One, I think that there are aspects to the media whether they are -- you want to call them mainstream media or the left-leaning media that basically have made a moral judgment call here that the rally -- President Trump's rally is about President Trump and is a selfish action to bring people in to fuel his ego, whereas the people that were going out to protest. They had a more altruistic goal and they're doing it -- putting themselves in harm's way for the greater good. I noticed actually that CNN is very sensitive to the fact that they were getting called out on this kind of dual coverage. And both Brianna Keilar and I believe also Jake Tapper actually mentioned this, saying I know the people are going to say that we are covering the protests differently. Then the rally, but one is indoor, one is outdoor. You know, people are waiting masks outside. There's no requirement for the masks on the inside. So there are aspects to have media recognizing that they are getting called out. And they are trying to address it which I find interesting."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I'm concerned of mass gatherings of all kinds, whether they're protests or at the rally. All right, quick back and forth here, Ben. Vice President Pence said a couple of days in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. The media tried to scare the American people on the virus. It's been a success, a cause for celebration, not the media's fear-mongering. Do you think the media has been fear-mongering about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we've seen both sides of this. We've seen both the downplaying that was you're responsible. And the fear-mongering that's irresponsible. You know, to the point that was just made by Capri, you know, think about the fear-mongering we saw from the media from all these other outdoor events, you know, beaches reopening and the like. That have clearly been shown to be kinds of super spreaders that they were saying at one point. I do think that we can be optimistic about a lot of things. But we still have to take this seriously. And so Pence is obviously making an argument that none of the rest of the media's going to run with. But on the fundamentals, he's actually right here."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. A Wall Street Journal report a fact check, some of Pence's in the journal op-ed. Capri, just briefly, how is it fear-mongering or is it fear-mongering when 121,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 and states right now are seeing their highest seven-day averages?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",

Ultimately, I think Americans, you know, need to be making their own decisions that are the best in the public health. As far as Vice President Pence, he was really lambasted particularly on the left for having to post box and others with this op-ed basically saying that he was irresponsible and, you know, sending Americans to slaughter at COVID-19. I myself, you got to be careful. Wear your mask, all that stuff, but that's just me."

The media are lying to you about everything, including the riots. But Google never actually imposed a penalty. And we are back with The Federalist, Ben Domenech. Do you see Google as being all too willing to stick it to a conservative website? And given the way it dominates the online end market, how seriously would this have damaged The Federalist if Google had imposed this financial penalty?"

We've been warning for years about the kind of silencing and de-platforming effort that we have seen happen in American academia. Now, as expected, that has migrated into the halls of the most powerful media corporations. And in the case of Google, the most powerful company in the world. In this story, we saw a left-wing reporter at the behest of a left-wing organization, a foreign left-wing organization, trying to get The Federalist de-platformed for our content. Now, as happens, because we were able to intervene in different ways, pushed back against it. This didn't end up playing out. But it got a lot closer than you'd expect. And it shows how easily these tech giants can be manipulated by leftist activists who don't believe that you should have any platform for an alternative view."

Look, I think this is just a huge warning. And the reaction that we've seen from politicians, both on the left and the right to this, has been one of significant frustration and concern about these new ramifications for potentially lots of different media outlets that survive thanks to the Google ad platform. I think you are going to see additional questions about this brought in hearings that Google participates going forward. Attorney General Barr spoke about it with Maria Bartiromo this morning, their own concerns about Section 230 reform, potentially opening up a lot of the aspects of this. I think that we are going to see a real reaction from government. And this was a warning shot for everybody who has views contrarian to the existing corporate media narrative."

It sort of has this -- I wouldn't even call it a loophole, I would call it a gaping hole that says an officer can use a chokehold if and when they feel life their life is in danger. And the problem with that doctrine is this. It is every time we've seen these cases come up, whether it be the case of Alton Sterling, whether it be the case of Eric Garner, whether it be the case of George Floyd, whether -- all of these cases, you hear officers repeat over and over again, well, I felt like my life was in danger. I think one of the other cases I didn't mention, the case of Laquan McDonald where there were multiple officers and one young man with a knife, right? And so there were multiple officers.

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Two Supreme Court rulings, both of them setbacks with the Trump administration, got huge coverage this week. Much of the media focus is on Trump appointing Neil Gorsuch, who went against the president on a gay rights ruling. As did John Roberts, who also wrote the decision saying the administration didn't take adequate steps to end the DACA program, which has protected the dreamers from deportation. The president ripped these rulings, calling them \"shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.\""

      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Just like in the case of Obamacare, it was Chief Justice John Roberts joining the four liberals on the court to make a highly technical, ridiculous to me argument that benefited the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And the president made it personal, tweeting, \"Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me?\" Kat Timpf, some conservative commentators are really harsh at personally criticizing Neil Gorsuch and John Roberts. Didn't they pledge to review everything on case- by-case basis? Roberts called it balls and strikes. Should pundits be sort of slamming them as betraying the cause when they're supposed to act as justices?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPH",
      "utterance": "Right. The Supreme Court is not supposed to be political one way or another. They are not supposed to like you or not like you. It's not supposed to be about that. But again, the whole discussion was political on someone who stands with dreamers. These people are not criminals. They came here as kids, illegal entries and misdemeanor, but they came here as kids. If your parents say you're moving, you got to move, right? But then at the same time you look at it, this was done by executive order, why couldn't it have been done by executive order? So if you keep the focus on the actual law, it would be better than making it so political, the way that we see both sides doing when we discuss these things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. The case began with much-criticized Obama executive order. Richard Fowler, aren't the media which largely support gay and transgender rights as well as the dreamers kind of impressed with Gorsuch and Roberts because they voted the way that they prefer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I'm after if the media supports and doesn't support them. I think the media is covering where the American people are. I think if you look at both of these issues and you were to do a poll amongst majority of Americans, they would say they're in support of gay folks, LGBTQ Americans not being fired from their jobs and protected by the law. And they are also in favor, as Kat just pointed out, for dreamers who came to this country in no fault of their own staying here. But if you read the rulings, right, of Justice Roberts in the DACA case, he is very clear this is not about the political nature of DACA, this is about how this administration operated. And the media, I think, has missed that coverage, because this is a larger problem, whether it's John Bolton's book, whether it's other issues. The problem here is how Donald Trump and his administration operate. Do they abide by the law? Do they follow the rules? And a lot of times they don't. And this is why the Supreme Court ruled against them in this particular case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It is true this was a procedural ruling. Trump actually said it was kind of a victory because they just have refile the paperwork. But it was a setback. No question about it. Kat, immigration kind of faded as a hot political issue. Do you think the media now going to seize on this and try to make the fate of the dreamers and immigration more broadly a hot campaign issue going into the fall?"
    },

      "speaker": "TIMPH",
      "utterance": "It may. I never try to guess anymore because things change so quickly. But I think that part of the confusion --"

      "utterance": "Take a guess."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPH",
      "utterance": "-- also comes from some of the reporting. New York Times first headline on this was that Supreme Court says Trump can't end DACA, and then it was changed to can't immediately end DACA. So it was more complicated. We got to focus on the law and not just political."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Richard, you talked about the dreamers and the media loves this controversy. But I think the reason this may not go on forever is that nobody actually really, whether it's Donald Trump or the Republicans and Democrats, wants to kick 700,000 to 800,000 dreamers out of the country. As you say, they were brought here as kids, it wasn't their decision, you can certainly criticize the parents for breaking the law. I wonder how much that is reflecting in the coverage. I mean, Trump ended the program but he says he wants to forge a compromise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I hope there's a compromise and I hope nobody wants to kick these 700,000 almost Americans out of this country. But let's be very clear. This president tweets every single day law and order. And here lies the problem, he's a hypocrite because he doesn't abide by the same law and orders that he tweets about because if he did, then his decision on DACA would have stood, right? If he did, we wouldn't be having every time we go to Supreme Court ruling against the president because he's chosen not to follow the rules even though he's asking the American people to follow those rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kat, I got about 20 seconds. I don't think it makes the president a hypocrite that he tried to end the program that was imposed by executive order, and of course the Supreme Court has final say. Quick thought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPH",
      "utterance": "I think that for the dreamers, they need the protection to be done - - that can only be done through Congress. I think they should legislate something here rather than get in these political fights over executive order here, executive over there. It didn't make sense. He couldn't undo it but Obama could do it."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "-- that the courts have to act as legislators. I got to go. Richard Fowler and Kat Timph, thanks very much. Still to come, Trump campaign wants to help pick the debate moderators and Twitter clashing with the president again over a bogus CNN video. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It's no secret President Trump wasn't especially happy with the moderators of the 2016 debates who were tapped from NBC, ABC, CNN, and Fox. Now, The New York Times reports his campaign is asking the commission on presidential debates to let him and Joe Biden pick the 2020 moderators with each being able to veto a certain number from the other site. That's contrary to why the bipartisan commission was created to take politics out of such decision, so we will see. And the Trump campaign wants four debates, not the usual three, the kind of a request that a challenger usually makes to get more exposure. Twitter has again slapped a warning label on a presidential post in which Trump used obviously doctored video to take a whack at CNN and the media."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Twitter said this violated its policy against manipulated media. Now, both Facebook and Twitter then removed the video on copyright grounds after complaint from a parent of one of the toddlers. CNN said it covered the original story which is very touching. It showed the two toddlers embracing each other and urged the president to be better. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the video when pressed by CNN's Jim Acosta."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, whether you find it funny or sad, Trump knows how to get attention. The fathers of those kids though are pretty upset. ABC News has suspended top executive Barbara Fedida after Huff Post reported she made a series of insensitive and sometimes racist comments. The site says that during contract talks with GMA anchor Robin Roberts, for example, Fedida said it wasn't as if the network was asking her to \"pick cotton.\" Huff Post also reports that Fedida said of Candice Gibson, then a network anchor, who is black, that ABC spends more on toilet paper than we ever would on him. And because of Fedida, the network has said to have spent millions of dollars on settlements with former stars and staffers."
