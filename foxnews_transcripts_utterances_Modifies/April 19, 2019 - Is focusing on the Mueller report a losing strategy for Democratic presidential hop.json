New York is one of the most corrupt places in the English-speaking world. You can imagine the qualities you would need to possess in order to run a place like that.  Andrew Cuomo has those qualities and he figured he could ride them all the way to the White House, but that didn't happen. Instead another New Yorker became President. This enraged Andrew Cuomo. He's been mad ever since.",

Trump is bad and orange, therefore, he is also a traitor who works for Putin.   Cuomo made that point on Twitter quote, \"Trump is now aiding and abetting Vladimir Putin, a Russian dictator and trying to cover up Russia's interference in our elections,\" end quote. \"Aiding and abetting, a cover-up. Call the police. Russians are here.\"  Andrew Cuomo appeared to believe all of this and many people did. Imagine how those people must have felt yesterday. For more than two years, they waited for their prosecutor God to deliver them from their Orange Babylon. When the day finally came, the joke was on them. It was all a hoax. There was no collusion.   Andrew Cuomo and a lot of people like Andrew Cuomo suddenly looked pretty stupid. Luckily, Andrew Cuomo knows people. New York is like that. His little brother works at CNN. That's not really surprising, actually. Lots of people at CNN have close ties to the Democratic Party including the guy who runs the place, Jeff Zucker. Zucker has often said that he may run himself for office as a Democrat. So if you want to know what Democratic Party functionaries are thinking, just flip on CNN. Well last night, pretty much everyone on CNN seemed upset by the Mueller report. Andrew Cuomo's little brother looked especially agitated. He'd heard people criticizing CNN. He doesn't like that. It shouldn't be allowed.",

When the Governor's little brother suggests that you do something, it's wise to pay close attention, if you know what's good for you.  So repeat after me, CNN was never wrong. CNN got it right. CNN is the most trusted name in news. Good. The Governor's brother likes it better when you talk that way. If only everyone was so obedient. Because let's be honest, not everybody is that obedient. Some people are still going to point out that CNN did strictly speaking get the biggest story of the decade completely and utterly and flamboyantly wrong. People will say that no matter how many barbells its anchors lift, because it's undeniably true.   And it wasn't just CNN. Virtually the entire news media did the same thing. This was failure on an unprecedented scale. The Russia hoax wasn't simply part of what the media covered, often it was all they covered for years. The numbers are remarkable. Over the first 60 days of 2018, just to pick it almost at random, the evening news shows that the broadcast networks spent more than twice as much time talking about the Russia hoax as any other topic. Print -- even more profound. Since the 2016 election, to give you just one measure, more than a 150,000 Americans have died from drug overdose. That's far more than the number of Americans killed during the entire Second World War in the Pacific.  Guadalcanal, Okinawa, Taroa, Iwo Jima -- those battles took fewer American lives than opioids did over an even shorter period, and yet somehow, \"The New York Times\" barely noticed any of this.  During the same period that this number -- 150,000 people were dying, \"The New York Times\" wrote more than twice as many stories about the Mueller investigation. That mattered more to them. At \"The Washington Post,\" the ratio is even starker.  Last year, Jeff Bezos' newspaper ran 4,319 articles about the Russia investigation. At the same time, it ran only a little more than a thousand that even mentioned the opioid crisis. America's shrinking middle class?  About a total of a 119 mentions. They just didn't care and they weren't pretending otherwise, they don't care. Cable news was as you know, even worse -- all Russia, all the time for years to the exclusion of everything else including obviously the truth.  Relentless, repetitive, calculatingly dishonest -- the very definition of propaganda. That's what they did and now they can't stop. They've been doing it too long.   Watch them test drive their new talking point. See if you can identify which word the DNC has told them to use.",

The Mueller report has revealed that the Trump dossier was what we thought it was from day one, a lie.  Some of the lies may actually have come from Russia just for the sake of causing chaos in this country because irony knows no bounds in this story.  BuzzFeed probably knew that but didn't care, so earlier this year, they said they had succeeded where thousands of other reporters had failed.  They said they had seen documents proving that the President had ordered his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. That would be obstruction of justice. Hands down, that would be an impeachable offense. But it didn't happen either. The Mueller report debunked that, too. What is going on here exactly? Michael Tracey is an independent journalist. He joins us tonight. Michael Tracey, I don't want to pile on BuzzFeed because I don't think they're the only offender here, but that one story they ran because it was so vigorously defended by their editor-in-chief including twice on this show is worth thinking about. I mean, do we know conclusively that it was wrong now? As of right now?  MICHAEL TRACEY, INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST; As pitiful as it sounds, Tucker, BuzzFeed, I think actually does deserve some credit for acknowledging after four months after it became totally untenable that the story could in any way be perceived as accurate. They finally came out within the past 24 hours or so and declared essentially that had been retracted. I think, yes, we do know now with almost absolute certainty that the story was not true because Robert Mueller came out and said quoting Michael Cohen that he had not been directed by Donald Trump to lie to Congress. In fact, Mueller added that Cohen had been instructed by Donald Trump to cooperate so not only had the core thesis of the story been undermined, the total opposite had been proven true according to Mueller at least who was supposed to be this savior figure that everybody in the media elite was trusting to propound the absolute truth as to the genesis of all this. But I think the thing that's really crucial to bear in mind about the broader Trump-Russia saga and the media's relationship, too is that Trump Russia has come more to resemble an article of religious faith than a set of journalistic political or legal claims.",

They would want to talk about it. Look, we spent $30 million over the past couple of years, turned the country upside down and now, we have this wonderful answer which is our President is not the traitor and so, instead of being able to move forward where Democrats are focused on this sort of fool's gold -- at least some of our nominees or prospective nominees are -- because of this reason. Of the media, of the primary voters wanting it, right? It's the catnip. But really what's the argument now? Now that collusion is gone, what's the argument for obstruction? It's really, okay, maybe Trump wasn't a Russian traitor, but he was awful cranky for the past two years and he did some naughty things. So he should just kept his mouth shut and took it in the chin while the media tore him down, called him a traitor. Former FBI and CIA directors insisted he was a traitor and engaged in treasonous activity. That doesn't sell to independent voters. That doesn't sell to Republican voters and it certainly doesn't sell to people like me. So if in fact, we get this same garbage that we've gotten for the past two years, an inability to move on because the media won't allow it, right, they're making way too much money on this, too many clicks and advertisers feeding this garbage. Then we're going to have a serious problem in 2020 not as Democrats, but in fact as a country because, Tucker, we're not going to be talking about the things that most people care about. How do we reduce the cost of healthcare? How do we make sure that we have a thoughtful immigration policy that stops these thousands of folks coming over? I mean that's the stuff that most of us want to talk about, right, and as a part of that, we can say, \"Look, Trump has done some great things.  Democrats acknowledge that. Let's talk about China, hold them into account or NATO holding them to account,\" but is Trump fundamentally the kind of leader we need? All right, so we can come to an agreement or disagreement on that, but that's I think the kind of conversation this country wants to have, not more of this collusion stuff, well it's there even though Mueller didn't find it or hey, you know actually obstruction is really important even though there's no underlying crime, even though it's a hoax, right?",

Cuomo made that point on Twitter quote, \"Trump is now aiding and abetting Vladimir Putin, a Russian dictator and trying to cover up Russia's interference in our elections,\" end quote. \"Aiding and abetting, a cover-up. Call the police. Russians are here.\"  Andrew Cuomo appeared to believe all of this and many people did. Imagine how those people must have felt yesterday. For more than two years, they waited for their prosecutor God to deliver them from their Orange Babylon. When the day finally came, the joke was on them. It was all a hoax. There was no collusion. Andrew Cuomo and a lot of people like Andrew Cuomo suddenly looked pretty stupid. Luckily, Andrew Cuomo knows people. New York is like that. His little brother works at CNN. That's not really surprising, actually. Lots of people at CNN have close ties to the Democratic Party including the guy who runs the place, Jeff Zucker. Zucker has often said that he may run himself for office as a Democrat. So if you want to know what Democratic Party functionaries are thinking, just flip on CNN.

CNN is the most trusted name in news. Good. The Governor's brother likes it better when you talk that way. If only everyone was so obedient. Because let's be honest, not everybody is that obedient. Some people are still going to point out that CNN did strictly speaking get the biggest story of the decade completely and utterly and flamboyantly wrong. People will say that no matter how many barbells its anchors lift, because it's undeniably true. And it wasn't just CNN. Virtually the entire news media did the same thing. This was failure on an unprecedented scale. The Russia hoax wasn't simply part of what the media covered, often it was all they covered for years. The numbers are remarkable. Over the first 60 days of 2018, just to pick it almost at random, the evening news shows that the broadcast networks spent more than twice as much time talking about the Russia hoax as any other topic. Print -- even more profound. Since the 2016 election, to give you just one measure, more than a 150,000 Americans have died from drug overdose. That's far more than the number of Americans killed during the entire Second World War in the Pacific.  Guadalcanal, Okinawa, Taroa, Iwo Jima -- those battles took fewer American lives than opioids did over an even shorter period, and yet somehow, \"The New York Times\" barely noticed any of this. During the same period that this number -- 150,000 people were dying, \"The New York Times\" wrote more than twice as many stories about the Mueller investigation. That mattered more to them. At \"The Washington Post,\" the ratio is even starker. Last year, Jeff Bezos' newspaper ran 4,319 articles about the Russia investigation. At the same time, it ran only a little more than a thousand that even mentioned the opioid crisis. America's shrinking middle class?  About a total of a 119 mentions. They just didn't care and they weren't pretending otherwise, they don't care. Cable news was as you know, even worse -- all Russia, all the time for years to the exclusion of everything else including obviously the truth.  Relentless, repetitive, calculatingly dishonest -- the very definition of propaganda. That's what they did and now they can't stop. They've been doing it too long. Watch them test drive their new talking point. See if you can identify which word the DNC has told them to use."

It was full of salacious and grotesque allegations none of them had been verified. So we asked BuzzFeed's Ben Smith to come on our show and defend why would you run something like this?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"It's not gossip, it's an official briefing,\" as much as we appreciate him coming on the show, bogus. The Mueller report has revealed that the Trump dossier was what we thought it was from day one, a lie. Some of the lies may actually have come from Russia just for the sake of causing chaos in this country because irony knows no bounds in this story.  BuzzFeed probably knew that but didn't care, so earlier this year, they said they had succeeded where thousands of other reporters had failed.  They said they had seen documents proving that the President had ordered his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. That would be obstruction of justice. Hands down, that would be an impeachable offense. But it didn't happen either. The Mueller report debunked that, too. What is going on here exactly? Michael Tracey is an independent journalist. He joins us tonight. Michael Tracey, I don't want to pile on BuzzFeed because I don't think they're the only offender here, but that one story they ran because it was so vigorously defended by their editor-in-chief including twice on this show is worth thinking about. I mean, do we know conclusively that it was wrong now? As of right now? MICHAEL TRACEY, INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST; As pitiful as it sounds, Tucker, BuzzFeed, I think actually does deserve some credit for acknowledging after four months after it became totally untenable that the story could in any way be perceived as accurate. They finally came out within the past 24 hours or so and declared essentially that had been retracted. I think, yes, we do know now with almost absolute certainty that the story was not true because Robert Mueller came out and said quoting Michael Cohen that he had not been directed by Donald Trump to lie to Congress. In fact, Mueller added that Cohen had been instructed by Donald Trump to cooperate so not only had the core thesis of the story been undermined, the total opposite had been proven true according to Mueller at least who was supposed to be this savior figure that everybody in the media elite was trusting to propound the absolute truth as to the genesis of all this. But I think the thing that's really crucial to bear in mind about the broader Trump-Russia saga and the media's relationship, too is that Trump Russia has come more to resemble an article of religious faith than a set of journalistic political or legal claims."

It's mind-boggling and I almost don't even know how to react to them at this point because they're not amenable to reason anymore.

They would want to talk about it. Look, we spent $30 million over the past couple of years, turned the country upside down and now, we have this wonderful answer which is our President is not the traitor and so, instead of being able to move forward where Democrats are focused on this sort of fool's gold -- at least some of our nominees or prospective nominees are -- because of this reason. Of the media, of the primary voters wanting it, right? It's the catnip. But really what's the argument now? Now that collusion is gone, what's the argument for obstruction? It's really, okay, maybe Trump wasn't a Russian traitor, but he was awful cranky for the past two years and he did some naughty things. So he should just kept his mouth shut and took it in the chin while the media tore him down, called him a traitor. Former FBI and CIA directors insisted he was a traitor and engaged in treasonous activity. That doesn't sell to independent voters. That doesn't sell to Republican voters and it certainly doesn't sell to people like me. So if in fact, we get this same garbage that we've gotten for the past two years, an inability to move on because the media won't allow it, right, they're making way too much money on this, too many clicks and advertisers feeding this garbage. Then we're going to have a serious problem in 2020 not as Democrats, but in fact as a country because, Tucker, we're not going to be talking about the things that most people care about. How do we reduce the cost of healthcare? How do we make sure that we have a thoughtful immigration policy that stops these thousands of folks coming over? I mean that's the stuff that most of us want to talk about, right, and as a part of that, we can say, \"Look, Trump has done some great things.  Democrats acknowledge that. Let's talk about China, hold them into account or NATO holding them to account,\" but is Trump fundamentally the kind of leader we need? All right, so we can come to an agreement or disagreement on that, but that's I think the kind of conversation this country wants to have, not more of this collusion stuff, well it's there even though Mueller didn't find it or hey, you know actually obstruction is really important even though there's no underlying crime, even though it's a hoax, right?"

      "speaker": "GENTRY",

For many, many, many years the culture at CIA and elsewhere in the Intelligence Community was that current and former officials kept their personal political views at home. So they were expected to have political opinions, but they kept them at home. And former senior officials who wrote memoirs wrote them in relatively objective kinds of ways even when they had very, very difficult relationships with Presidents so there were over time lots and lots and lots of examples of difficult relationships. Usually, the intelligence people said, \"We're subservient here. We work for the President. We're going to bite our tongues. We're going to try to make this work.\" So in 2016 though, you had a fundamentally different situation. You had a case where senior officials said, \"I believe that Mr. Trump is wrong on issues and I'm going public to criticize him.\" So a fundamentally new phenomenon."

I really think the Democratic probe Clinton bias comes out in this report if we had 13 out of the 19 prosecutors there, very strongly in support of Hillary Clinton you'd know that just by reading these pages. You know, I was on Page 61 of this report where they recounted a Russian named Henry Greenberg giving me a call and offering me dirt on Hillary Clinton. They went through this whole escapade and said it had nothing to do with Russian interference, but nowhere in that one page of the report did they mention that Henry Greenberg had been an FBI informant for 17 years. They somehow missed that fact in that report. And other things were hinky about the page on me and I've got to believe as somebody who is kind of marginal in this investigation, can you imagine the mischief they were up to with some of the star players?"

When I interacted with the guy and then I saw how curious the Mueller team reacted when we talked about it, in my interrogation, I hired a private investigator to look into this guy and he found sworn affidavits in Federal court in California where this guy came up as a 17-year FBI informant. He spent ten years in jail in Russia, three years in jail in the United States for gun crimes and he was only here on FBI informant visas and I actually have copies of 14 of those FBI informant visas up at democratdossier.com including the name and telephone number of his FBI handler, but for some reason that just went -- you know, slipped through the fingers of the Mueller investigation."

CNN let him come on all the time as much as he wanted, 65 times in less than two months. Officially, he was just a creepy lawyer for a troubled woman he turned out to be taking advantage of, but CNN made him much more than that. They made him into a Russia expert. True. Watch."

How do you think he's going to handle someone like myself for Bob Mueller asking questions? It would be an absolute disaster for him and he knows it. Donald Trump does not want to sit down and have to answer any questions under oath and if I was in his shoes, I probably wouldn't want to do that either in light of the facts and the evidence. I think that this shows that the President has significant potential criminal liability for felonies associated with campaign finance violations as well as potential money laundering violations. Mr. Trump will not serve out his term, no way, no how. He will be forced to ultimately resign. Why am I on CNN so much and why are you giving him so much airtime? Well, guess what? This is why."

And by the way, you're stealing millions from some guy in a wheelchair who got a settlement that you're taking from him without his knowledge.\" No one ever said anything like that because he was saying exactly what they wanted him to say. So they let him say anything and he did. And they never told their viewers that really, you should not take this guy's word as valuable on subjects he clearly knows nothing about. So from the point of view of normal people, CPL was an obvious fraud from day one, but in the end, his behavior was less shameful than that of ordinary reporters on CNN. Because they have inherent credibility and for years, they built up a fantasy world for their viewers, letting them believe that impeachment and indictments and a treason conviction were almost here, just around the corner for the big orange tyrant. They gave each other Pulitzers and other fake prizes honoring their commitment to the First Amendment even as they made other people who didn't agree with them, \"Shut up. Take that man off the internet.\" \"Oh thank you for my First Amendment prize.\" They are so corrupt. Now, the Mueller report has among other things exposed their work for the travesty at what it was and their response to it? No. Nothing to see here. CNN is quite pleased with itself."

I mean, I want to do your bidding Mr. Zucker, but I can't say every dumb thing you tell me to say because no one will believe me anymore.\" Why does nobody do that? JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, \"THE HILL\": I think I'd say I have an Easter egg hunt that I really have to get to, Tucker, if that were to happen.  Yes, look Pulitzers were won as you said, right, and the Pulitzer Board described the reporting this way and this is Pulitzers around reporting around Russia collusion, okay, \"Deeply sourced relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect transition team and his eventual administration.\" Pulitzers for what the Mueller report said -- and remember, Robert Mueller is sainted.

Everything would go off a cliff in terms of ratings, in terms of clicks and we're already seeing it at CNN. Just yesterday, when the Mueller report drops, two years -- all of that highly anticipated talk around what's going to be in that report and they couldn't even average 1.2 million viewers.

You explain to me how the BuzzFeed story, Tucker that Michael Cohen was ordered to lie to Congress by President Trump, was that proven out? I'm curious. And has Ben Smith from BuzzFeed apologized for that report? That the Mueller report has now completely and totally debunked? No, of course not and that's the whole problem here in the end, Tucker. Contrition and the complete lack of it for all the things that were wrong. Let's face it. What the whole ball game was, it was collusion between Trump and Russia and that was the reporting, the primary part of it and that's what everybody got wrong. Forget about everything else, that was the whole ball game."

I thought we were investigating Russian collusion? I'm not sure that's what Mueller was doing. I think what he was doing, to quote, Mark Levin this morning, he was writing an op-ed for $30 million."

This is documented fact. Anybody can look it up on the inter-web out there to make a joke of it. You can check it out yourself. But again, nowhere in the Mueller report are those relationships mentioned.  It's basically a Jack Ryan story told to make you believe Trump colluded with the Russians so they can get a roadmap for impeachment. That's what it is. Well, yes, which is incredible. Story number one is -- listen, how did the media -- how did they blow this?  The American media was completely humiliated, Tucker. They got the story totally backwards from the start. They told us collusion was real and the spy scandal was fake. We were all conspiracy theorists. The story was actually the spying scandal is very real and collusion was fake and one quick thing and I know we're running out of time here, but I find that ironic that they keep patting themselves on the back for getting minor details of the story right. It's like going to a bank robbery reporting on a bank robbery that never happened and then celebrating that you got the call over the car the guy left in right and patting yourself on the back like Jim Acosta.
