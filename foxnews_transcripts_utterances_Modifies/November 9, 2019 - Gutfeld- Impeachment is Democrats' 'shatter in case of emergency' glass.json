The proposal includes a charge for the first time ever for those seeking asylum. Citizenship fees would increase more than 60 percent from $750.00 to $1,170.00. It could reach 83 percent for some applicants. Asylum seekers would also be charged for $50.00 for applications and $490.00 for work permits. Critics say it's a wealth tax on becoming a U.S. citizen. Meantime, a gender reveal stunt being blamed for a plane crash in West Texas. A pilot was flying at a low altitude to dump 350 gallons of pink water. But after the water was dumped, the plane got too slow and stalled. No serious injuries were reported. The incident happened in September. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Back to Greg Gutfeld."

But in general, I'm actually very early. And that's, you know, the reason why the people who are late all the time, if you're late all the time, it's just that you don't care."

      "utterance": "Some do say that."
