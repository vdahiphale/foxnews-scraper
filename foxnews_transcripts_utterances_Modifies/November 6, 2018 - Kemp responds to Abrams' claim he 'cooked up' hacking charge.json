We're going to take you live to Georgia where the race for governor is getting very dirty, charges of racism and accusation of voter hacking. This race kind of has it all. And Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp joins us later on the show. Plus, Congress' balance of power could flip tomorrow night. Ed Henry breaks down the key midterm races.  And coming up, we will take you live to the Trump rally there in Missouri. He and Rush Limbaugh will hit the stage in just moments. But first, protecting your future, preserving America, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  All right, election day, can you believe it's finally upon us? So, it's important to focus on what we know to be true about the choice that millions of you will make tomorrow. While we often hear that all politics is local, there is just no getting away from the fact that Trump's policies are on the ballot.  And that should mean Republicans should do very, very well tomorrow night. And whether or not you applaud the president's tweets or his tone, there is no debating that his policies have been reaping huge benefits for the American people. The U.S. added 250,000 jobs in October, blowing away the 180 that were predicted. Unemployment, another record low at 3.7 percent. Wages were up a robust 3.1 percent -- that's music to my ears. As for those manufacturing jobs, you know those things that Obama said were never coming back. Well, they are and with a vengeance.  Even the most left leaning \"PolitiFact\" hd to admit this. Well, then there is trade. Remember when Obama promised to renegotiate NAFTA?",

Seventy- one percent say the economy is good or excellent, that's up from 60 percent in August.  And Americans feel better about their future. More money in their pockets. Less job insecurity. And on judges, the president has hit home run after home run with the help of course of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley. He's had two stellar Supreme Court justices confirmed and the 29 circuit court judges with many more to come. This may indeed be his most important legacy item.   On immigration, well, the president has been hobbled by Congress. Remember when he offered Democrats a compromise that included legal status for 2 million last February? They rejected his offer. Referring instead to, well, politics as usual, because they preferred to keep the political issue alive. As for the waves of migrants making their way towards the United States? The president is 100 percent correct. We must take a firm stance and we must call on the military. He did that. But the Democrats say, don't worry. Be happy.",

Well, folks aren't voting over foreign policy but it is worth noting that the president has not gotten us into any stupid wars so young people should love that.

We're going to take you live to Georgia where the race for governor is getting very dirty, charges of racism and accusation of voter hacking. This race kind of has it all. And Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp joins us later on the show. Plus, Congress' balance of power could flip tomorrow night. Ed Henry breaks down the key midterm races. And coming up, we will take you live to the Trump rally there in Missouri. He and Rush Limbaugh will hit the stage in just moments. But first, protecting your future, preserving America, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. All right, election day, can you believe it's finally upon us? So, it's important to focus on what we know to be true about the choice that millions of you will make tomorrow. While we often hear that all politics is local, there is just no getting away from the fact that Trump's policies are on the ballot. And that should mean Republicans should do very, very well tomorrow night. And whether or not you applaud the president's tweets or his tone, there is no debating that his policies have been reaping huge benefits for the American people. The U.S. added 250,000 jobs in October, blowing away the 180 that were predicted. Unemployment, another record low at 3.7 percent. Wages were up a robust 3.1 percent -- that's music to my ears. As for those manufacturing jobs, you know those things that Obama said were never coming back. Well, they are and with a vengeance. Even the most left leaning \"PolitiFact\" hd to admit this. Well, then there is trade. Remember when Obama promised to renegotiate NAFTA?"

Seventy- one percent say the economy is good or excellent, that's up from 60 percent in August. And Americans feel better about their future. More money in their pockets. Less job insecurity. And on judges, the president has hit home run after home run with the help of course of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley. He's had two stellar Supreme Court justices confirmed and the 29 circuit court judges with many more to come. This may indeed be his most important legacy item. On immigration, well, the president has been hobbled by Congress. Remember when he offered Democrats a compromise that included legal status for 2 million last February? They rejected his offer. Referring instead to, well, politics as usual, because they preferred to keep the political issue alive. As for the waves of migrants making their way towards the United States? The president is 100 percent correct. We must take a firm stance and we must call on the military. He did that. But the Democrats say, don't worry. Be happy."

And then they will make emotive arguments to just waive everyone in, hoping to welcome thousands of undocumented Democrats into the country. Here is Trump's midterm report card as I see it, my friends. Job creation, he gets A. Trade negotiations, A-, we still have work to do with China. Public confidence and optimism, definitely an A. Healthcare, B-, still got a lot of work to do there and communications issues. Judges, A. Immigration, B+. Well, folks aren't voting over foreign policy but it is worth noting that the president has not gotten us into any stupid wars so young people should love that.

He has the ability to rally the base, get out voters and support candidates who frankly the smart Republican candidates area the ones who have fully embraced him, stood by his side. And the signal is, look, if you want to continue this extraordinary record of achievement that Donald Trump and the Republican Congress has delivered to the American people, both in terms of a stronger economy and a stronger international position, vote for those Republican candidates even if you do not like particularly you member of Congress, just do it because this president needs backup."

They like Article I having a superiority to Article II and they like (inaudible) 51 ambition -- counter reacting ambition. I think that's what they're going to go out and vote for tomorrow. They're going to vote for a check because look, there are things -- I'm sure there are a lot of good things. You are a very easy grade (ph). I wish I had you in law school.

And this president has to fight that at every single turn. And that's why you see him underwater because people hear this incessant noise from the mainstream media, the liberal biased media every day.

Then campaign started to talk of blue wave, hammering about the president putting himself front and center. But it's closing with elite pundits now hedging of whether Democrats will even take the House as Republicans are poised to perhaps increase the majority in the Senate. Th president doing what he promised, no-stop (inaudible) all weekend. Three more rallies today, packed houses in Ohio, Indiana, and now Missouri. All three have big Senate battles. The closing argument about Kavanaugh, the caravan but also the economy. You were just talking about it. Look at this ABC/\"Washington Post\" poll, 65 percent of the public has a positive view of the economy up from 51 percent just before the inaugural. Highest level of optimism since 2001. The president said these rallies, if Democrats score big wins, they will take a wrecking ball to the recovery. Well the president also said he's bullish about gaining seats in the Senate. GOP currently has a 51 to 49 edge. Interesting when it comes to the House, top prognosticators like Nate Silver of 538.com, now hedging, saying Democrats are clear favorites to win the house, but it's not for certain. And his models show a wide range for how many seats the Democrats may pick up. They need to flip 23 seats to take the majority, listen."

We are looking at numbers of about -- over 100 million people may vote in this midterm election.

Look, I actually stood in the campaign headquarters with then candidate Trump, and we were looking at those early exit polls, and it was a gut punch saying we definitely going to lose. After hearing all day the Nates of the world and every negative pollster telling we were 100 percent certain going to lose. And of course we won. That's where we are headed tomorrow.

The press and the public can go watch that. All this nonsense of voter suppression is absolutely ridiculous. Minority participation is up 23 percent in the great state of Georgia. There's a million more people on our voter rolls now than when I took office. I created an online system when Georgians can register to vote 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Stacey Abrams voted against that legislation. And if you look back, every two years these same things, these same type of charges have happened from her local groups that are supporting her extreme agenda. She's trying to distract from the record that she wants people who are here illegally to vote for her and be part of the blue wave. They even sued us over that. When we called them out in the lawsuit as to how ridiculous that was, they withdrew the complaint, and then they were suing us to do something that we already do. This is the 11th hour tactics of them. I am doing my job, Laura. I have a duty to keep elections in Georgia secure, accessible, and fair. And that's exactly what we are doing."

I think that's what Georgians want. They want a governor that's going to build off of us being the number one state for business in the country six years in a row. That was announced today by Governor Deal. I'm proud to have the governor's support as well as former Governor Sonny Purdue. We've had a great run of Republican leadership over the last 16 years.

But that narrative is based largely on national polls. So have pollsters made enough adjustments since 2016 to right their wrongs, or are we in store for another night of surprises? For answers, let's bring in two prominent members of the polling field, John McLaughlin, CEO of McLaughlin Associates, and Tom Bevan, publisher and co-founder of Real Clear Politics.

And we were sending it around to five or six different cities a day. And that Sunday when we went through the analytics with Jared, like we could win, but we need a good turnout on Tuesday. Do you know what? Same thing tomorrow. If we don't have a good turnout, there's 35 million votes cast, and it could be 100 million. But if we don't have a good turnout, we lose. And right now, by the way, on Tom's website, there were all these Senate races today, Nevada, Florida, Missouri, Indiana. You had each different pollster saying in the media that one would say the Republican are going to win, one would say the Democrats are going to win. Some of them are going to be wrong.

But there's also data out there that supports the idea that Republicans could still have a pretty good day tomorrow. But it's whether the pundits have been willing to acknowledge that data and look at that data.

      "utterance": "That was Olivia Munn, who went to the big celebrity room. I think we have another clip of Ben Gleib, who is the founder of this thing. But here's how this works, Laura. They had a phone bank, you call in and promised to vote, and then a celebrity calls you back. Who are these people that need to call -- they are not even raising any money. Can you raise money for a charity maybe while you're at it? You've got the celebrities there, you got the phone bank."

If more Americans are doing better, Hollywood doesn't care, they don't give a rip because it is about Trump. They want to get rid of Trump."
