So, I -- it was too much to expect president empathy -- I thought that was always a joke -- but instead we got commander in callousness. Biden and company and all of these Democrats have displayed a real total lack of respect and regard for the American people. It's the same rubes and red necks and the fly over folks but they are looking at, you know, they are dishing out Washington bio waste.  They are looking at the American people and telling demonstrable lies over and over and over again. And anybody who has the capability of hearing and seeing knows that they are being lied to. And this, like yesterday, couldn't have gone better. And I think one of the reasons that Milley, General Milley and Secretary Austin did only took three questions today is because they are trying to avoid being put in a situation where they have to either lie for the president or tell the American people the truth.

And we know that again, they were trying to paint a picture to the American people, that was not true.

Just bear with me. I have a whole theory about this. So, I think the whole planning for this withdrawal if you can actually call it that started with the end result. Joe Biden on the 20th anniversary of September 11th wanted to have a one-man ticker tape parade. It was a publicity stunt and they literally -- not literally, figuratively wrote the speech for that day before the withdrawal even began. It was all getting the troops out. Why did they start the troop withdrawal before civilians before our allies and friends before even the diplomats in the country? So, they were doing it backwards.

And I worry they are not even strong enough.  Because what's going on is, we are creating a pseudo reality. We are passing off on the American people a reality that does not exist, and it's not limited to this story. We have overplayed COVID fears far beyond what the rational fear is for the average human being out there. We have convinced people out there that unarmed black men are being gunned down in the street by cops and now we are suggesting that Afghanistan was a success. These are false realities. They are pseudo realities. They do not exist. And the reason they are being passed off in the American people is to accumulate people for the one that is telling the lies.

So, I -- it was too much to expect president empathy -- I thought that was always a joke -- but instead we got commander in callousness. Biden and company and all of these Democrats have displayed a real total lack of respect and regard for the American people. It's the same rubes and red necks and the fly over folks but they are looking at, you know, they are dishing out Washington bio waste. They are looking at the American people and telling demonstrable lies over and over and over again. And anybody who has the capability of hearing and seeing knows that they are being lied to. And this, like yesterday, couldn't have gone better. And I think one of the reasons that Milley, General Milley and Secretary Austin did only took three questions today is because they are trying to avoid being put in a situation where they have to either lie for the president or tell the American people the truth. And the most dangerous thing to me is Joe Biden clearly is acting like a one-term president.

      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "Well, I just -- James Freeman in the Journal wrote a column about this, the use of, by Biden, of the word perception over and over again. And it kind of goes back without us talking about before. That the perception bids out reality. That was the most important to him. So, it was lies over lies. And we know that again, they were trying to paint a picture to the American people, that was not true. Because that State Department cable that was sent in the middle of July called for the State Department to use tougher language in describing the atrocities being committed by the Taliban. Just bear with me. I have a whole theory about this. So, I think the whole planning for this withdrawal if you can actually call it that started with the end result. Joe Biden on the 20th anniversary of September 11th wanted to have a one-man ticker tape parade. It was a publicity stunt and they literally -- not literally, figuratively wrote the speech for that day before the withdrawal even began. It was all getting the troops out. Why did they start the troop withdrawal before civilians before our allies and friends before even the diplomats in the country? So, they were doing it backwards. They were letting the end dictate the path of getting out. All it mattered was the troops on the ground and right now, because again, they think the American people are stupid they're trying to put Vaseline on the lens of history thinking it will fade."

And I'm going to pick up where Dagen left off because this is the big story to me. Sometimes we use words like spin or political optics or even lies sometimes. And I worry they are not even strong enough. Because what's going on is, we are creating a pseudo reality. We are passing off on the American people a reality that does not exist, and it's not limited to this story. We have overplayed COVID fears far beyond what the rational fear is for the average human being out there. We have convinced people out there that unarmed black men are being gunned down in the street by cops and now we are suggesting that Afghanistan was a success. These are false realities. They are pseudo realities. They do not exist. And the reason they are being passed off in the American people is to accumulate people for the one that is telling the lies.

Again, imagine if this was coming from Trump, this would be the biggest story ever. I wonder if this is being covered actually at all. So here is the thing. My question is, was the lie meant to help us, because sometimes politicians have to -- leaders have to lie to help their country. We know that. Or was it to help him? Was the lie designed to convince people to stop being against this fast pullout, to cooperate with what Joe wanted. Because that's really bad. If a general said hey, we leave this place, it's going to collapse in days. And Joe goes like, no, we have the Taliban on the ropes according to the Afghan president. That's the problem. Because in that lie prevented anyone from mounting an alternative to this disaster. We could've still had the withdrawal. It could've been differently. Obviously, it could have been done differently.

It's clear that whenever she is out front, she does hurt. She is a liability to the administration. But if I'm Kamala Harris I'm saying, well, I wasn't a liability for you, Joe, I guess when you need to get elected.

She wasn't great in the primary debates, she wasn't polling well, she couldn't raise money, she had to drop out. So, while she was a good fit on the ticket, whether she can be a good leader and manage things, well, it's a totally different question. And so far, she's gotten the worst assignment, which is the border. And so, that's going to be a difficult thing for any vice president because it's an unsolvable problem. She's probably going to be a professional tiebreaker given what's going on in the Senate. That's what she's going to do in Washington is go up there and break ties whenever it matters.

And the other thing is the cruelty of the -- of the, you know, the cavalier, well, don't go to the hospital then if you -- if you were that arrogant and not get vaccinated. But in terms of the first, you know, the CDC is advising people, if you're unvaccinated don't travel."

When you listen to the cruelty of Don Lemon right there who you're absolutely right, has managed to wonderful concoction of being stupid and mean at the same time, then you are looking at a very dangerous person, a dangerous mindset that is getting increasingly, increasingly common out there, Geraldo. And now, to your other point about whether or not the unvaccinated pose a threat to other people. In particular, you point out children. That's not true. That is false. What we now know, the data shows, is that vaccinated people transmit COVID at almost the same level of unvaccinated. What the vaccination provides you is protection against severity of illness. It doesn't seem --"

But listen, the folks who were supportive of Governor Ron DeSantis and what he's done down in Florida, and he's got plenty of critics, but his team will say, look at the percentages. If you berate people versus in Florida, it's a very open situation, don't go there if that's not your cup of tea. 68 percent of people over the age of 12 there are vaccinated. Here in New York where if you don't have your vaccination card, you can't go to restaurants and gyms and that kind of thing, 65 percent. And they're constantly berating people here. So, I don't think that you win people over to your argument by, you know, saying things about them and insulting them in the way that Don Lemon is choosing to do. Maybe the Florida-New York comparison is worth a look on that front."
