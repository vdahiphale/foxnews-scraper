Conservative commentator, Ben Shapiro, he just delivered a controversial speech, that means it's any speech, at the University of Connecticut campus. The speech sent leftists into fits. Frothy fits of frenzy. He joins us exclusively to tell us what happened.  And an intensifying showdown tonight between the Justice Department and the House Intel Committee over the release of that classified FISA memo. An Intel Committee member, Peter King, is here to react.  Plus, as the president says, he is ready to talk with Bob Mueller under oath. Longtime Trump confidant, Roger Stone, says speaking with Mueller would be a trap for the president. He joins us to explain why.  But first, accountability in the special counsel's office and a press that just doesn't care. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. As soon as Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel in the Russia investigation, politicians rushed to cover him with a blanket of invincibility.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, \"THIS WEEK\"/ABC, AUG. 6, 2017 : Have you seen anything in this investigation that would suggest that Robert Mueller has a conflict?",

      "sentences": "In other words, President Trump, don't you dare even think about coming close, even sort of maybe kind of firing Mueller. A few months later Congress rushed into propose legislation to insulate the special counsel from executive branch interference or termination.  Republican pro-amnesty senator, Tom Tillis, along with liberal Delaware Senator Chris Coons introduced a bill that would allow Mueller to challenge any removal in court. Senator Lindsey Graham and Cory Booker, wonder twin powers activate, they went even further. They sponsored a bill that would prevent the firing of Mueller.   Apparently, he so perfect he could never be fired. Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were properly skeptical about the constitutionality of any such moves such as that. Remember, Mueller worked for the executive branch, after all. I have a question, why can't all federal employees challenge their firing? Of course, this would be absurd. Now setting aside whether it would be politically smart for president Trump to fire Mueller, and it wouldn't be smart.  He is the head of the executive branch and Congress has no business interfering with eve of the firing or the hiring decisions of the executive branch. All they have is the confirmation process, senate confirmations. Otherwise, stay out of the business. So, my question is why were these senators so eager to build up Mueller and his team, and they were so eager to insulate them from executive branch oversight and ultimately perhaps termination?  Thank God, we have diligent congressmen who do take their oversight responsibility seriously. I'm talking about Congressmen Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz, Trey Gowdy, Robert Goodlatte and Peter King, who will join us in just a few moments.  You don't want to miss this segment. Their determination to see that this investigation doesn't turn into some kind of star chamber. It's already turned up incredible thing so far. Missing or discussed thumb drives. Talk of deleting text messages. Talk of creating insurance policies against Trump. Maybe even secret societies in the FBI. Meetings convened outside of the FBI, and of course, all those missing texts that they may or may not be reconstructing. And by the way, speaking of these texts between Peter Strzok and his gal pal, Lisa Page, we heard this today from the DOJ spokeswoman.",

Well, I'm just glad the Democrats are finally, finally supporting law enforcement! The FBI, you can never question them.   Let's look back now. For years the left has indulged groups like Black Lives Matter, the ACLU and Care, who reflexively impugn the integrity and character of police. Anytime somebody catches one of those unpleasant cell phone videos the police are too aggressive, they are racist, their anti- Muslim. You know the drill.  But now that Mueller, state versus federal, but Mueller is targeting Trump. Law enforcement, you can't question them. They can't do any wrong. If they should never be fired, they shouldn't even be questioned. Now one would think that the media, some in the media would have a little bit of curiosity about, I don't know, the conflicts of interest in the special counsel's office. If they distrust law enforcement and investigators on the state level so often, why do the feds get a pass?  Well, there is without a doubt a deep-seated animus, and that is putting it mildly, toward the president by key members of the Mueller investigative team, and rather than confront the growing evidence, the left, they start demonizing members of Congress.  And anyone, frankly anyone, who dares to question the methods and the motives of the Obama Justice Department and now the Mueller gang. The black cloud that hangs over this Russian investigation, let me tell you this, it wasn't created by Fox News. It certainly wasn't created by talk radio. None of us hired Jeannie Reed, who previously worked for the Clinton Foundation and represented Obama's national security advisor, Ben Rhodes.  I will tell you this, Fox News and talk radio did not appoint Andrew Weissmann. A Democratic donor, he praised Sally Yates in that letter when she was fired by the president. I don't think Fox News and talk radio appointed Peter Strzok either. I will tell you this, no amount of scapegoating is going to make this any better. Now Robert Mueller could be the greatest guy, the smartest guy ever, but if the man cannot oversee his own team and remove the partisans, then you have to conclude he is either in over his head, or he's just not good for this role, or his negligent in his duty.   And that will compromise the ultimate findings of this investigation, whatever they may be. I also want to say this. Trump's team made some mistakes early on. I do not think, and I've said this before, it was smart to fire Jim Comey when needed, and it wasn't wise to talk to Lester holt about the decision to fire Jim Comey.  And if the story is true, well, it probably would not have asked acting FBI Director McCabe how he voted in the election, I wouldn't have done that either. The president has to be extra mindful given the fact that he had already kicked off the intel community with his promise of reforms, and of course some of his criticisms. You kick that deep state hornet's nest and you are liable to get stung really bad. Today, the president told reporters, hey, I'm happy to talk to Mueller.",

Conservative commentator, Ben Shapiro, he just delivered a controversial speech, that means it's any speech, at the University of Connecticut campus. The speech sent leftists into fits. Frothy fits of frenzy. He joins us exclusively to tell us what happened. And an intensifying showdown tonight between the Justice Department and the House Intel Committee over the release of that classified FISA memo. An Intel Committee member, Peter King, is here to react. Plus, as the president says, he is ready to talk with Bob Mueller under oath. Longtime Trump confidant, Roger Stone, says speaking with Mueller would be a trap for the president. He joins us to explain why. But first, accountability in the special counsel's office and a press that just doesn't care. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. As soon as Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel in the Russia investigation, politicians rushed to cover him with a blanket of invincibility. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, \"THIS WEEK\"/ABC, AUG. 6, 2017 : Have you seen anything in this investigation that would suggest that Robert Mueller has a conflict?"

      "utterance": "In other words, President Trump, don't you dare even think about coming close, even sort of maybe kind of firing Mueller. A few months later Congress rushed into propose legislation to insulate the special counsel from executive branch interference or termination. Republican pro-amnesty senator, Tom Tillis, along with liberal Delaware Senator Chris Coons introduced a bill that would allow Mueller to challenge any removal in court. Senator Lindsey Graham and Cory Booker, wonder twin powers activate, they went even further. They sponsored a bill that would prevent the firing of Mueller. Apparently, he so perfect he could never be fired. Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were properly skeptical about the constitutionality of any such moves such as that. Remember, Mueller worked for the executive branch, after all. I have a question, why can't all federal employees challenge their firing? Of course, this would be absurd. Now setting aside whether it would be politically smart for president Trump to fire Mueller, and it wouldn't be smart. He is the head of the executive branch and Congress has no business interfering with eve of the firing or the hiring decisions of the executive branch. All they have is the confirmation process, senate confirmations. Otherwise, stay out of the business. So, my question is why were these senators so eager to build up Mueller and his team, and they were so eager to insulate them from executive branch oversight and ultimately perhaps termination? Thank God, we have diligent congressmen who do take their oversight responsibility seriously. I'm talking about Congressmen Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz, Trey Gowdy, Robert Goodlatte and Peter King, who will join us in just a few moments. You don't want to miss this segment. Their determination to see that this investigation doesn't turn into some kind of star chamber. It's already turned up incredible thing so far. Missing or discussed thumb drives. Talk of deleting text messages. Talk of creating insurance policies against Trump. Maybe even secret societies in the FBI. Meetings convened outside of the FBI, and of course, all those missing texts that they may or may not be reconstructing. And by the way, speaking of these texts between Peter Strzok and his gal pal, Lisa Page, we heard this today from the DOJ spokeswoman."

There were reports, by the way, that the glitch that she referenced may have affected 35,000 FBI employees and all their cell phones. Different from what we heard a few days ago. But whatever the case, it prompts more questions now just about the basic competency of the FBI. Sorry, are we not even allowed to wonder what else Peter Strzok and Lisa Page said to each other about Trump, Flynn, Comey, and maybe even the old Hillary email investigation? I'm sure it wasn't all 50,000 texts of sweet nothings. By the way, I've noticed a pattern here, maybe you have as well.

Well, I'm just glad the Democrats are finally, finally supporting law enforcement! The FBI, you can never question them. Let's look back now. For years the left has indulged groups like Black Lives Matter, the ACLU and Care, who reflexively impugn the integrity and character of police. Anytime somebody catches one of those unpleasant cell phone videos the police are too aggressive, they are racist, their anti- Muslim. You know the drill. But now that Mueller, state versus federal, but Mueller is targeting Trump. Law enforcement, you can't question them. They can't do any wrong. If they should never be fired, they shouldn't even be questioned. Now one would think that the media, some in the media would have a little bit of curiosity about, I don't know, the conflicts of interest in the special counsel's office. If they distrust law enforcement and investigators on the state level so often, why do the feds get a pass? Well, there is without a doubt a deep-seated animus, and that is putting it mildly, toward the president by key members of the Mueller investigative team, and rather than confront the growing evidence, the left, they start demonizing members of Congress. And anyone, frankly anyone, who dares to question the methods and the motives of the Obama Justice Department and now the Mueller gang. The black cloud that hangs over this Russian investigation, let me tell you this, it wasn't created by Fox News. It certainly wasn't created by talk radio. None of us hired Jeannie Reed, who previously worked for the Clinton Foundation and represented Obama's national security advisor, Ben Rhodes. I will tell you this, Fox News and talk radio did not appoint Andrew Weissmann. A Democratic donor, he praised Sally Yates in that letter when she was fired by the president. I don't think Fox News and talk radio appointed Peter Strzok either. I will tell you this, no amount of scapegoating is going to make this any better. Now Robert Mueller could be the greatest guy, the smartest guy ever, but if the man cannot oversee his own team and remove the partisans, then you have to conclude he is either in over his head, or he's just not good for this role, or his negligent in his duty. And that will compromise the ultimate findings of this investigation, whatever they may be. I also want to say this. Trump's team made some mistakes early on. I do not think, and I've said this before, it was smart to fire Jim Comey when needed, and it wasn't wise to talk to Lester holt about the decision to fire Jim Comey. And if the story is true, well, it probably would not have asked acting FBI Director McCabe how he voted in the election, I wouldn't have done that either. The president has to be extra mindful given the fact that he had already kicked off the intel community with his promise of reforms, and of course some of his criticisms. You kick that deep state hornet's nest and you are liable to get stung really bad. Today, the president told reporters, hey, I'm happy to talk to Mueller."

An appearance of a conflict in a case this serious is enough to shake the credibility of the investigation and I'm not saying that everyone on the team is bad, I'm not saying that. But if the shoe were on the other foot and Hillary Clinton were being investigated by a bunch of Trump loyalists who had written terrible things about Hillary and couldn't stand Hillary and were texting their boyfriend about Hillary, you would be on their show going crazy about them and I would actually say you have a point there."

Bob Mueller is the smartest person around, like he is the smartest guy who ever lived apparently, but he had no problem bringing in these people who hate Donald Trump, they despise the man. I don't know how you can be independent in your thought process if you hate him as much as they did. Monica, got to get you in on this. Allen says they are professionals doing their jobs and I'm sure there are professionals in the investigation and the Democrats say this is much to do about nothing.

Please utilize the many campus resources available if you should want to talk through your feelings about this issue, including my office, the Cultural Center, Dean of Students.\" I want to go pay her a visit and say I've had a tough day today and I really need just a hug. I just need a hug. You look good. You look like you had fun tonight."

      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "It was fun. And I will say this, there is no more useless title on campus than chief diversity officer, whose entire job is just to pretend a bunch of people who are too weak need to actually defend a point of view."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right. Ben Shapiro, great to talk to you. By the way, the Department of Justice is demanding Congressman Devin Nunes not released a memo alleging surveillance abuses by the Obama-era FBI. I wonder why. House Intel Committee member and Ingraham fave, Peter King joins us with reaction next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Really quick addendum from the previous story we just covered. My friend Gordon, a freshman at UConn just said, \"I wasn't able to get into the Shapiro event either. Everyone wanted to go. More conservatives on campus than people think.\" Thank you, Gordon. By the way, the Justice Department is asking to see a memo reportedly outlining serious wrongdoing at the FBI and justice department under President Obama. House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes is taking steps to declassify the memo summarizing the findings of his Russian investigation. Well, a letter from the justice department charges that it would be extraordinary reckless tonight to release the memo without first giving the DOJ and FBI the opportunity to review it. Let's sort this all out with someone who's read the memo, Congressman Peter King of New York. I thought you were going to be here tonight with me, congressman, who serves on the intel committee. Great to see you. How are you doing?"

      "speaker": "REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I'm great. So, what does the justice department, the FBI, they're suddenly all squarely about the release of this memo? What goes on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "It was a four-page memo put together by a very talented professional staff on the committee, reviewed by all the Republican members, made available to all members of the committee and voted out of the committee last week to be made available to all the members of the House. The findings in here are very, very significant. Showing I believe the terrible mistakes or deliberate wrongdoing at high levels. And right now, the justice department -- and what Devin Nunes plans on doing because over 200 members of the House looked at it, only about 10 Democrats, by the way. And there is a climber by the public to see the memo. We're going to make sure there's nothing in there, any small item they make. We'll be able to sort to our method. And that is pretty much finished. That will be done and then we're going to vote this week on releasing it. At that stage, if we get a majority of vote, which we will, it will go to the president of the United States. He will decide if it can be made public or not. If it does, it'll be made known to the public. This letter for the justice department. Laura, listen, I have great respect for the FBI. I generally have great respect for the justice department. But we have gotten almost no cooperation from them, at all, over the last several months. We had to go to court to get documents we were entitled to. A long hard fight to get basic documents which we have an absolute right to see. And now, justice department, if we gave them this memo, what they would do is, it'd be passed out to all our friends in the media to tear it down before it even gets out there. Everything that's in that memo is from the justice department. Information we've found. There's no surprises there to them. They just want to be ready, I think, to attack it and they want to attack it. Make a preemptive attack on him. We're not going to let them. I understand. I have spoken to Devin. I've spoken to his staff people tonight and he fully intends to go ahead. We're not going to show it to the justice department."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Congressman, knowing what you know now, you've read the memo, you've seen the evidence so far, do you have faith as of now in the upcoming results of this investigation knowing what you know now and what you've seen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "Well, I've sat through. I don't know whether it's hundreds of hours -- I mean, I've been in there for probably 20 witnesses who have come before our committee and show me all of the major ones. I've sat there to seven, eight, nine hours. Again, all the big names you've heard about. I've been there for that. I have not heard one word yet indicating any collusion. Now, I don't know if Bob Mueller has anything else, but he's talking to many of the same people. So if they come out with any finding of collusion at all based on what I've heard, then I would say that they're not doing their job. But on the other hand, I think right now I believe the president's lawyers feel this is going in the right direction with all the improprieties that went on, the fact that this investigation, I believe, should never ever been started in the first place. I look upon it either intentionally or unintentionally as a political hit job. I mean, the facts here that you are the leading law enforcement organization in the world investigating a presidential candidate based on the flimsiest of evidence. I wouldn't even call it evidence. On the flimsiest rumors, that's what this was based on and that's a terrible precedent to set. You could do that to any candidate if you wanted to. When you bring the FBI into a political campaign, it's wrong."

      "utterance": "We have now have set up a wholesale operation between the White House and Capitol Hill to sully the reputation of good men and women who worked inside the FBI because of, as you noted, Howard, some emails. Yes, they're problematic, but let the appropriate authorities ferret that out. To do what they're doing, the end game they're playing right now, what they don't seem to understand, it could blow up in their face just as much as it could sully the FBI."

    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "We are talking about a handful of people at the top. The FBI is an outstanding organization. There are people at the top that who have not served the FBI well. And I would say the rank and file of the FBI appreciates what we're doing, they say are concerned. I mean, I've heard from retired FBI people who are shocked about what's coming out. And to me the emails, the text messages, that's so important. That's really just an indication of this investigation from the start. It should never have been started. It's based on a false premise and that's continuing right through and whether we're talking about the FBI, whether we're talking about John Brennan at the CIA and others. This to me has all been a concerted effort to go after Donald Trump. Listen, a lot of reasons you could disagree with Donald Trump, but to say that he was colluding with the enemy when there's no evidence there, to me is shameful. Now, I think it's significant that now it's being leaked to \"The New York Times.\" They're talking about obstruction of justice. About events that happened six months after the campaign was over. You can't tell if the Russians apparently colluded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's a cute trick. We noticed the leaking right as things started turning really good for Trump on the economy and the shutdown and then all the leaks came from the Mueller team. Congressman King, thank you so much. Great segment. And by the way, President Trump makes a crucial decision on how to deal with the Russian investigation, but Roger Stone says it's exactly the wrong move. He'll tell us why, right back after this break."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "As we mentioned earlier, President Trump said today he would be willing to answer questions from Special Counsel Bob Mueller. But Trump's longtime confidant and former advisor Roger Stone says it is a trap. Roger joins us from Fort Lauderdale to explain. Roger, I bet you love tearing the president just rift today about, oh, yes, no problem, I'll come and have a cup of coffee, unload my burden. How could this possibly be a trap, Roger? Mueller wants the best for the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROGER STONE, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, look, it's understandable why the president is confident. He knows he's done nothing wrong. But a first year law student would tell you that this is an obvious perjury trap that Robert Mueller is taking advantage of the president's loquaciousness, the fact that he's never a man who suffers from a paucity of words. And what is absolutely clear is that Mr. Mueller has no evidence of Russian collusion, so now we're all the way cycled back around to the dismissal of Mr. Comey. And he seeks to entrap the president in some kind of process crime, perjury, or obstruction. Therefore, the best advice that I could give the president, and I agree with Judge Andrew Napolitano on this, is that under no circumstances should he grant Mr. Mueller an interview. It's a suicide mission. It's a very clear perjury trap."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Under Lawrence Walsh's investigation of Iran Contra, Roger, the special counsel there, Walsh, agreed not to interview President Reagan in person, they submitted interrogatory. If the president responded to the written interrogatories and that's how it went down. Obviously here with the president of the star, special counsel, they had the videotaped testimony and so forth. So it's kind of a different precedent, but what if they agreed to a narrow pathway, a narrow perimeter where you're only going to ask about these two things. That's in a normal grand jury setting or a normal interview setting for a normal client, no lawyer would allow you to go in, they would say, OK. We're only going to -- we'll talk, but only about these two topics. What about narrowing the confines of the question?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STONE",
      "utterance": "Well, traditionally if the information can be gotten otherwise, the president would not be interviewed. A perfectly reasonable compromise to avoid a constitutional crisis would be for Mr. Mueller to submit written questions and for the president to respond to them in writing. I don't see how any reasonable person could disagree with that. But for the president to walk into the blade, as it were and to try to pretend that Mueller and his band of partisan pirates are just honest brokers, honest prosecutors just trying to ferret out the truth is disproved by everything we know so far. And now with an extraordinary number of text messages from the FBI going missing, I'm old enough to remember when 18 and a half minutes of Nixon's White House tapes went missing and the mainstream media and the liberals went insane. Where is that outrage today? If nothing, that proves the partisan nature of this inquiry and the fact that the Department of Justice under Rod Rosenstein, who I have advocated the president fire immediately for his conflict of interest, is not on the level."

But these are the same lawyers who urged him to waive executive privilege and turnover all records depending on the impartiality and the lack of bias of Robert Mueller. It is a foolhardy piece of advice. It is a suicide mission. Under no circumstances should the president grant Mueller a live interview. Clearly, there is a compromise. Let them submit questions in writing, let the president respond in writing."

Do you hear that, Lindsey? Well, the White House clarified that the citizenship offer would only apply to the 800,000 illegal immigrants enrolled in DACA and that they would have to meet certain conditions. Well, amnesty supporters welcome the president's statements. Senator Lindsey Graham was practically doing the Snoopy dance. There he is. He said today with this strong statement by President Trump, \"I have never felt better about our chances of finding a solution on immigration. Do not try to co-op this solution. Meanwhile earlier this week, we told you about HHS, how it's still using taxpayer dollars to shuttle illegal immigrants around the country after they cross the border. That's fun. A lawsuit now could determine whether the federal government has the right to force states to accept refugees for resettlement and whether the feds are responsible for the state, for this financial burden. The states that are accepting them. A lot of news on this front. And Don Barnett just published a report on that subject of the refugees for the Center for Immigration Studies. He joins us now from Denver. Don, there's so much immigration news. But let's focus for a moment on the refugee issue. I have friends up in Vermont and the Burlington area, and they say that people arrive in Burlington who are refugees and no one in that community is even told about it. They just kind of show up and they show up in the public schools and then the residents are the last to know. What's going on?"

And it's kind of the same latitude. And the maniacs and the Minnesota people, they're wild. I don't understand those people. I mean, I love them, but they're a little crazy. That's why I like them. It's a lot there and a lot there -- a lot of Somalis in both places. Omaha has a lot. Northern Virginia has quite a few refugees. Do they throw a dart at the map? How do they figure this out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Well, basically it's run by private nonprofits, and they set up shop in effect where welfare is the most generous, where jobs are available and housing is cheap. Now, in the case of Maine, most of the refugees that are in Maine arrive there after they arrive somewhere else. They first arrived in Atlanta and then they moved to Maine because it was better. Maine, interestingly enough, is a state that has tried to get out of refugee settlement. And has officially withdrawn."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They don't want any part of it. Welfare gains, housing. Huge cost to the state. I'm sorry to interrupt here, but when you think about the refugees from, let's say Northern Africa, and they are relocated to Minnesota or Maine or wherever the catholic charities, or whatever catholic -- or Lutheran group, they're getting money from the feds and they're so -- assimilation has got to be a little bit trying in certain states, in certain climates, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a very big issue. And the engagement with the refugee is very short. Three-eight months and it's simply inadequate. There is no assimilation. Assimilation is, as a matter of fact, not in the lexicon anymore. There's not even an attempt. They don't even pay lift service assimilation."
