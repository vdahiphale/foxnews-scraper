And if you think it's only in big cities, wait until you hear from one outraged mother. It's scary.  And Raymond Arroyo debuts what we're calling, freestyling Biden in \"Friday Follies.\"    But first, \"The Unholy Trinity,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Two months ago, President Trump was roundly ridiculed for making this observation.",

      "sentences": "Well, it turns out he was right. This wasn't some paranoid fantasy. There was a very real and vast conspiracy to unseat him, and now it's all laid out as clear as day in the pages of \"Time Magazine.\"   The article written by Nancy Pelosi biographer Molly Ball describes this effort as, \"a well-funded cabal of powerful people working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election. They were fortifying it. They believe the public needs to understand the system's fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America indoors.\"  Well, as you can see Ms. Ball, she wants to - got to cast this - the shadowy leftist has heroes of democracy. Well, indeed, one of the umbrella groups involved called itself the Democracy Defense Coalition. It's kind of catchy, right? But that's not what they were up to.   Now, this wasn't about protecting democracy, but about knocking out Trump using any means necessary. And tonight, we're going to lay out the three major players of this unholy anti-Trump trinity.  First, obviously, is big tech. Now, it's no secret, right, that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey are rabid leftists and supported Biden. We know that the mass censorship we saw in the run up to the election was part of a coordinated efforts, obvious.  But \"Time\" reports in November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election related falsehoods. It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement, says Vanita Gupta, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others.   Now, who is Vanita Gupta? Well, she's now Biden's Associate Attorney General over at DOJ, perhaps a reward for her good work on Zuck and Dorsey. Now, these meetings paid huge dividends for the Biden team, because in the months before Election Day, social media giants effectively became Joe's ministry of truth.   Big tech gleefully censored Trump's tweets and basically erased \"The New York Post\" bombshell on the Hunter Biden laptop and all the China connections from the internet. It was just gone, which of course gave the media cover to ignore it as just more Russian disinformation. That alone may have cost Trump the election. A Media Research Center, MRC poll from November found that 4.6 percent of Biden voters would not have voted for him had they'd been aware of the Hunter Biden scandal. Now, remember, Biden only beat Trump by 4.4 percent of the vote.    Now, of course, we can't leave out the fact that Zuckerberg was key to realizing the Left's dream of mass mail-in ballots. He donated $300 million to local election offices and to liberal activists masquerading as nonpartisan voter education efforts - it's a lot of coin. Those leftists then turned around and worked to expand vote by mail, and then enroll millions of voters.  Well, this brings me to number two, BLM. When it came to turning out voters at the polls, these Marxist radicals were indispensable. \"Time Magazine\" noting that the organizers who helped lead BLM wanted to harness its momentum for the election.  They created a force of \"election defenders during early voting and on Election Day they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a \"joy to the polls\" effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open, in their communities.\"  In other words, BLM, they were really loyal Biden foot soldiers. I seem to remember someone saying something about these six months ago or so.",

Now, back in September, we saw a lot of headlines like this one from CNN, \"Pro-business Chamber of Commerce is backing 23 vulnerable House Democratic freshmen for reelection.\" Now 18 of those Democrats voted in support of a $15 minimum wage, which has long been a goal of big labor and something that Chamber supposedly opposes.  Well, the Chamber's overture to pro-union Dems may have been greasing the skids for what came next. \"Time\" reports that about a week before Election Day, AFL CIO Advisor, Mike Podhorzer received an unexpected message. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk, agreeing that their unlikely Alliance would be powerful. They began to discuss a joint statement, pledging their organization's shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election.\"  Now, the chamber says this alliance was formed out of concern for economic disrupting civil disorder, but is that the real reason or was this about something else entirely? Like, ensuring there'd be access to cheap foreign labor, endless streams of people coming across the border.   Now, Trump kept labor markets tight by clamping down on work visas and securing our border. While, that's great for American workers, the Chamber of Commerce hated it. So did their corporate cronies. AFL CIO likes porous borders. It hurts their members, but they salivate at the prospect of bolstering their ranks and increasing their membership dues. That's all fine and dandy for them.  Biden's policies would give them that and we're already getting a glimpse of what our economic future will look like.",

Fortunately, and it's funny that the Speaker would use the words that she did, we do know what the people who wrote the Constitution were thinking, because they explained it in the Federalist Papers. And the Federalist Papers, it's very clear that the clause which they spent a lot of time writing concerning the removal of the president, was not a punishment, it was an emergency measure to remove from office a person who was a problem. And they left the courts to be the arbiter of whether somebody violated the law and should be punished beyond removing them from office.

Now, look no further than their pathetic track record in a State like California. Governor Gavin Newsom represented the future of the party within California, California dreaming all the way. But what has he actually done? California completely bungled the vaccine rollout, prioritizing illegal aliens and prisoners over seniors. Businesses and schools still closed. And violent crime is rising in the state's biggest cities. Unsurprisingly, Newsom's political future is in dire straits. The effort to recall him is expected to hit 2 million signatures by March 17th, half a million more than they need to trigger an election.

I can tell you, it is Democrats, it is independents. It is across the board. And he is not paying attention. He thinks just because someone has a \"D\" behind their name that they'll vote for him no matter what.

Also, as this weekend, so too does our series, on how the Black Lives Matter curriculum is infecting your school. And if you think it's only in big cities, wait until you hear from one outraged mother. It's scary. And Raymond Arroyo debuts what we're calling, freestyling Biden in \"Friday Follies.\" But first, \"The Unholy Trinity,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Two months ago, President Trump was roundly ridiculed for making this observation."

We were told repeatedly that it would take weeks, if not months, to determine the winner, to count the absentee ballots and to verify the results. My opponent was told to stay away from the election. Don't campaign. We don't need you. We've got it. This election is done. In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, it turns out he was right. This wasn't some paranoid fantasy. There was a very real and vast conspiracy to unseat him, and now it's all laid out as clear as day in the pages of \"Time Magazine.\" The article written by Nancy Pelosi biographer Molly Ball describes this effort as, \"a well-funded cabal of powerful people working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election. They were fortifying it. They believe the public needs to understand the system's fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America indoors.\" Well, as you can see Ms. Ball, she wants to - got to cast this - the shadowy leftist has heroes of democracy. Well, indeed, one of the umbrella groups involved called itself the Democracy Defense Coalition. It's kind of catchy, right? But that's not what they were up to. Now, this wasn't about protecting democracy, but about knocking out Trump using any means necessary. And tonight, we're going to lay out the three major players of this unholy anti-Trump trinity. First, obviously, is big tech. Now, it's no secret, right, that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey are rabid leftists and supported Biden. We know that the mass censorship we saw in the run up to the election was part of a coordinated efforts, obvious. But \"Time\" reports in November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election related falsehoods. It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement, says Vanita Gupta, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. Now, who is Vanita Gupta? Well, she's now Biden's Associate Attorney General over at DOJ, perhaps a reward for her good work on Zuck and Dorsey. Now, these meetings paid huge dividends for the Biden team, because in the months before Election Day, social media giants effectively became Joe's ministry of truth. Big tech gleefully censored Trump's tweets and basically erased \"The New York Post\" bombshell on the Hunter Biden laptop and all the China connections from the internet. It was just gone, which of course gave the media cover to ignore it as just more Russian disinformation. That alone may have cost Trump the election. A Media Research Center, MRC poll from November found that 4.6 percent of Biden voters would not have voted for him had they'd been aware of the Hunter Biden scandal. Now, remember, Biden only beat Trump by 4.4 percent of the vote. Now, of course, we can't leave out the fact that Zuckerberg was key to realizing the Left's dream of mass mail-in ballots. He donated $300 million to local election offices and to liberal activists masquerading as nonpartisan voter education efforts - it's a lot of coin. Those leftists then turned around and worked to expand vote by mail, and then enroll millions of voters. Well, this brings me to number two, BLM. When it came to turning out voters at the polls, these Marxist radicals were indispensable. \"Time Magazine\" noting that the organizers who helped lead BLM wanted to harness its momentum for the election. They created a force of \"election defenders during early voting and on Election Day they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a \"joy to the polls\" effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open, in their communities.\" In other words, BLM, they were really loyal Biden foot soldiers. I seem to remember someone saying something about these six months ago or so."

      "utterance": "The third anti-Trump force in this unholy trinity is, of course, big business. Now, back in September, we saw a lot of headlines like this one from CNN, \"Pro-business Chamber of Commerce is backing 23 vulnerable House Democratic freshmen for reelection.\" Now 18 of those Democrats voted in support of a $15 minimum wage, which has long been a goal of big labor and something that Chamber supposedly opposes. Well, the Chamber's overture to pro-union Dems may have been greasing the skids for what came next. \"Time\" reports that about a week before Election Day, AFL CIO Advisor, Mike Podhorzer received an unexpected message. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk, agreeing that their unlikely Alliance would be powerful. They began to discuss a joint statement, pledging their organization's shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election.\" Now, the chamber says this alliance was formed out of concern for economic disrupting civil disorder, but is that the real reason or was this about something else entirely? Like, ensuring there'd be access to cheap foreign labor, endless streams of people coming across the border. Now, Trump kept labor markets tight by clamping down on work visas and securing our border. While, that's great for American workers, the Chamber of Commerce hated it. So did their corporate cronies. AFL CIO likes porous borders. It hurts their members, but they salivate at the prospect of bolstering their ranks and increasing their membership dues. That's all fine and dandy for them. Biden's policies would give them that and we're already getting a glimpse of what our economic future will look like."

And give it back to those of us who want to empower Americans, not just manipulate them, and that's \"The Angle.\" Joining us now, and I'm delighted they're with us, Jesse Kelly, Host of the nationally syndicated \"Jesse Kelly Show,\" and also with me is Matt Walsh, Daily Wire Contributor and host of the \"Matt Walsh Show.\" Jesse, this was a - you haven't called it a conspiracy. It was actually really smart of the Democrats to do this. But it was obviously a collaboration of extremely powerful forces that don't always agree on every issue, but they agreed on one thing, they had to get rid of Trump. JESSE KELLY, HOST, \"JESSE KELLY SHOW\": Oh, yes, Trump was a system disrupter. And like you pointed out, it's not about Trump. It's about the American people. It's about anybody on the right - even slightly on the right, who believes in anything traditional about America, they have to be crushed. And Trump's presidency was a shock to the system, that's what I call these people who worked together, and they made sure that Trump was gone and now they're going to make sure that Trump never happens again. That's what's so scary, Laura. It's not about what they just did. It's what they're going to do for the next four years to make sure there's never another one. That's really bad right now."

Well, it's never been clear to me, where that privilege is coming from. It seems to me that privilege is all tribalistic. And if you are on the Left, then you, your tribe controls all of the major institutions. They're doing everything they can behind the scenes to elevate you and your politicians.

And now we find out that it looks like we're not going to go back to normal anytime soon, big shock. Again, Bloomberg - that Bloomberg article gives away the game. Saying, \"When will life return to normal? Seven years at today's vaccine rates.\" In other words, Jesse, they need more time for climate change, normalization, slow down, lower productivity, get people used to a lower standard of living for a cleaner planet. Seven years, that sounds about right."

It's not just what they're doing, is that they're bragging about what they're doing. We have people who openly lie to you and then tell you what's - and then demand that you say it's not a lie.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci now seems like he's just the professional scold - you can't go to Super Bowl parties, no weddings, no funerals, no fun, no graduation, maybe a Rose Parade in what 2027 or something like that.

It would actually take a lot of integrity and discipline to relinquish that power willingly, even for the best of people. Even the best person for them to give up that kind of power and to give it them takes a lot of integrity. And - but these are not people with integrity to begin with.

Now, the takeaway from experts and most of the lawmakers that were assembled was that this fight against domestic forces - domestic terrorist, extremists, would take 10 to 20 years. Now, how do they get at that number? They really couldn't say. Which brings me to the second shocking thing about this hearing, the fact that very few Republicans stood up and spoke out against this insanity.

And certainly, with - there would be no suggestion that they did anything to incite any of the actions. Certainly, there wasn't any anyhow. But here, when you have the President of the United States give a speech and says you should peacefully make your thinking known to the people in Congress, he's all of a sudden a villain. So you got to better be careful what you wish for. It's all prosecutors trick.

Because they could impeach Donald Trump if he was dead, because he's not in office, they could impeach Abraham Lincoln because he's also not in office. So they could go and erase him just like they were erasing his name off of the schools in San Francisco. Isn't that where Nancy Pelosi is from? Right? So that's just a - it's just a crazy argument. Fortunately, and it's funny that the Speaker would use the words that she did, we do know what the people who wrote the Constitution were thinking, because they explained it in the Federalist Papers. And the Federalist Papers, it's very clear that the clause which they spent a lot of time writing concerning the removal of the president, was not a punishment, it was an emergency measure to remove from office a person who was a problem. And they left the courts to be the arbiter of whether somebody violated the law and should be punished beyond removing them from office. So it is very specific in the Federalist Papers that the Framers of the Constitution expected that removal from office would be the only thing that would flow from conviction after impeachment."

Had that happen, he would have gone to court and he would have prevailed and now you would have real precedent just, because it happened and there was an acquittal, doesn't make it precedent."

And the reason Democrats are forcing an impeachment they know is going to fail is that they want to distract you. An Inconvenient fact, they have absolutely no idea how to govern. Now, look no further than their pathetic track record in a State like California. Governor Gavin Newsom represented the future of the party within California, California dreaming all the way. But what has he actually done? California completely bungled the vaccine rollout, prioritizing illegal aliens and prisoners over seniors. Businesses and schools still closed. And violent crime is rising in the state's biggest cities. Unsurprisingly, Newsom's political future is in dire straits. The effort to recall him is expected to hit 2 million signatures by March 17th, half a million more than they need to trigger an election. Joining me now is one of the leading Republican, California State Senator Melissa Melendez. State Senator, good to see you tonight. They're confident they have a shot of winning this recall election. However, could you just get another bad Democrat at the other end of this?"

But the last time a Democrat decided to run in a recall election to replace Gray Davis, that guy's political career was over before he could even blink his eyes. So I don't think we'll see that again. And Gavin Newsom better pay attention, because he seems to think that it's just Republicans who are upset with his leadership. It's not. I can tell you, it is Democrats, it is independents. It is across the board. And he is not paying attention. He thinks just because someone has a \"D\" behind their name that they'll vote for him no matter what. I have got news for him. that is the not the case anymore, because they are tired of being locked up. They're tired of losing their businesses, their kids being stuck at home in front of a computer all day long, teachers not teaching. They're done.

She's a good one to talk about hateful rhetoric. AOC was also, by the way, in her office about a block from the Capitol. It's amazing how they fabulate this stuff."

But who am I, who am I to say? Facts don't matter, though, Raymond, as you said. Her truth. When they do this, my truth, they always have to hit -- my truth is what matters.

In 897, Laura, there was something called the Cadaver Synod. A pope, Pope Stephen VI exhumed his predecessor, put the cadaver on trial, and guess what, they found a cadaver guilty, threw it in the Tiber. A few days later, they fished the bones out, miracles started happening. The people turned on Pope Stephen VI and threw him in jail. The lesson here is political retribution in after the fact trials rarely end up well. That should be a warning to a lot of people in this upcoming week."

This toxic curriculum isn't just relegated to Democrat strongholds like D.C. and New York City. It's also happening in places like Ames, Iowa, where the school district is holding its own BLM, quote, week of action, and parents there are up in arms. Joining me is now Eve Lederhouse, an Ames Community School District Parent who not exactly thrilled with the attempt to brainwash and indoctrinate her second-grade daughter. Eve, thank you for joining us. Did the school district include any input from parents or solicit it before they began spreading lock, stock, and barrel this propaganda?"

The black villages principle has a section in it that says disruption of the western prescribed nuclear family. That's a principle of this Black Lives Matter curriculum. So your daughter is supposed to be engaged in disrupting the nuclear family, presumably, I don't know, her own? I'm not following that."

And politics is the least of it. It's about sexual identity, which most parents actually want to have that conversation with kids before the second-grade teacher does. It's about how to organize a family. It's about what people think about issues such as intersectionality, which was something that, I guess, people learn at various classes in college, but now pushing this on second and third and fourth graders? What?"
