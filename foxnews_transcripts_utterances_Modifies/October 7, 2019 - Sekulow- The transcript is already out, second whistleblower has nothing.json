      "sentences": "Happy Monday.  Welcome to \"Hannity.\"   Buckle up, we're going to put this all in perspective.  I know many of you -- you might be worried about the ongoing political tornadoes and hurricanes out of the swamp in Washington, the mob and our corrupt media.  By the way, you should be.  It's repulsive what they are doing again after three years of lies and conspiracy theories. Now, I can't tell you exactly how it's all going to play out.  And likely may be the go-ahead and impeach President Trump over nothing.  Bill Clinton had 11 felonies in the Kenneth Starr report, nothing here.  We'll see.  But I can tell you this with confidence, I can tell you how this is going to end and it's going to end with the reelection of Donald Trump and in part, we are going to be able to thank them for what they did and their stupidity and their lack of concern for you, we the American people, and I can see the Republicans taking back the House, I could see Republicans increasing their majority in the U.S. Senate.  But make no mistake about it.  These are dangerous times for a constitutional republic.  By the way, God help us, if they ever did win with their $94 trillion Green New Deal, there are $36 trillion Medicare for all with no private insurance, yet, you see, that would destroy the greatest economy ever designed by man.  That's a clear and present danger.  Now, Democrats, they are compliant lapdog stenographers in the mob and the media, they are now willing to shred the Constitution, upend the rule of law, suspend any connection to truth, reality, objective truth, and, by the way, they will cast away all God-given common sense as assuming they might've had some in the beginning to subvert the will of you, we the American people. The root cause of this now going into another impeachment saga, it's not bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors.  They don't have any evidence of that. Instead, it is a psychotic hatred and rage against this president and, really, for those of us who put him in office and voted for him.  In other words, they never recovered from losing in 2016.  They thought they had this covered.  Make no mistake: they loathe, we, you the American people, we smelly Walmart shoppers.  I love Walmart.  We irredeemable deplorables. You know, we're Americans that cling to our God -- thank you.  Our guns, our bible, our religion.  They hate you, they hate me, they hate the president, and they look down on all of us, they think they know better and they want total control of your life, your decisions, and they'll tax you to death to get their scheme done.  They want to confiscate our money, they want everything free, free, free, for everybody.  Cradle to grave, womb to tomb, free Medicare, free higher education, free childcare, free paid vacation, free housing, free healthy food, free universal basic income whether you are willing or unwilling to work -- by the way, they will eliminate oil, gas, the combustion engines, eventually planes and cows.   And Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the real speaker of the House, now wants to provide -- this is the truth, welfare for illegal immigrants, including criminal illegal immigrants.  Those convicted.  Now, this would cause an economic devastation, the likes of which we, the U.S., the world has ever witnessed.  This is the greatest wealth producing system in the world. It would be turned into another socialist hell no different from Venezuela or Cuba.  In order to govern this country with an iron fist and carry out that socialist freedom of theirs, they must first reclaim power.  It's all about power. Now, you might say, we have an election in one year.  Why not let the American people decide?  Well, the answer to that is they don't want to risk another term of President Trump, so they feel like they've got to bludgeon it more.  It will backfire, but that's their thinking.   Instinctively, I argue they know they can't win with the people they have running.  Congressman Al Green said it best.  If he's not impeached, yes, he could get reelected, likely well.  Take a look.",

      "sentences": "If we don't impeach him, he will get reelected.  Now, what we have now been through the last three years, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, Stormy, Stormy -- it's now clear Democrats are fully prepared to up and the will of the American people by any means necessary.  They think they know better than we do.  And what -- by the way, the do-nothing Democrats, what have they done? What a compliment had they made in the last three years of Russia, Russia, to make you, we the American people more prosperous, to keep us more safe and more secure? They have done nothing.  This is all they have done for three years.  They want this post-constitutional America.  They want to stack the U.S. Supreme Court, eliminate the electoral college of California, New Jersey, New York and Illinois will decide every national election.  They want to get rid of a president because they don't like him and, by the way, even if he does something they like, they don't like him.  Now, that the left does fail to realize time and again is that -- well, we might be a redeemable deplorables that cling to our God, but we are also hardworking, logical, smart Americans and we weren't -- well, swamped out of the common sense God gave us.  We know what this impeachment inquiry is all about, nothing more than a political stunt. They tried this for three years now.  They have failed.  By the way, this time, they're not going to -- they're not going to put their faith and hope in another special prosecutor who, in the end, just let them down because there was no evidence.  We have all witnessed the left's insane, breathless, non-spot, three-year hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories, and their witch hunt.  The same people now, same agenda, just a different country.  It's Ukraine.  By the way, Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton the last election, yes, and, they admit it.   And, by the way, a DNC operative subcontractor met with Ukrainian official to get dirt on Trump.  Not telling that story either.  Now, we the people, we've been watching and witnessing this phony, fake outrage, this media circus, the character assassination, the smearing -- oh, the president, Justice Kavanaugh, we witnessed a 16-year-old high school kid get demonized on national TV for wearing a MAGA hat.  They assassinated his character. You, the American people, you've been witnessing the media mobs and they are a mob with a mop mindset, breathless hysteria, resulted in one fake phony story after another, one lie after another, every second of every day.  We got him, we got him, we got him -- no, you don't. The great irony in all of this, whatever accusations Democrats and the mob launched against the president, they end of being guilty of that very thing themselves.  How ironic.  This is why tonight, I want you to take a close look at this list.  By the way, those Democratic congressmen and women, they represent districts that President Trump carried in 2016.  Now, if you live in any of those districts, it might be important to remind your lawmaker that they work for you, and not doing anything in three years is not acceptable to you.  It's to allow the corrupt, cowardly, Adam, the Shifty, Schiff, literally run this thing, these people need to stand up to this post-constitutional coup attempt in their party and frankly I say defeat them. This is where you have the power, not them.  The radical far left extreme socialist in charge of the Democratic Party think they rule it all.  You will have the last say at the end of the day.  The Cowardly Schiff and AOC and Tlaib and Omar and Pelosi, speaker in name only, they get your way, the sanctity of your vote, the foundations of this great, prosperous republic will be destroyed, because they want to want to fundamentally, drastically reshaped America.   And Adam, the cowardly Shifty Schiff -- well, in particular, he is trying to con we the people with outright lies and fabrications.  Now, we know that the non-whistleblower whistle-blower, well, from the Ukraine call, worked with Schiff's office to craft the complaint.  In fact, Schiff's office encouraged the whistleblower to hire a lawyer, go to the inspector general. On national TV, the Shifty Schiff, well, he said, we have not spoken with the whistleblower but we'd like to.  That was a lie too.  Maybe that's why the fake whistleblower whistleblower failed to mention his contact with Schiff's office in the complaint.  And according to a report of our own Catherine Herridge, this non- whistleblower, and we have more because that was not panning out, we have tons of whistleblowers, will make them up, filing this complaint, left a blank -- a section which they could have disclosed, that congressional contact, they didn't use it.  Still no word why there was also an 18-day gap in between the president's call with Ukraine and the urgent report made to the inspector general.  Maybe the Cowardly Schiff has not been contacted by that point.  Maybe he knows the answer.  Maybe Schiff can also fill us in why the fake, phony non-whistleblower is reportedly a registered Democrat, hired to work in the Obama White House, went to his office of all places to file the complaint.  And maybe the cowardly shift can tell us how the president's phone calls with world leaders are now getting leaked again and again to the press -- Australia, Mexico, Ukraine, Australia again.  No other president in the history of this country has had to deal with this onslaught from a deep state bureaucracy swamped from within. Only Donald Trump and now we are seeing even more leaks from more whistleblowers.  There's no end to the whistleblowers that are not whistleblowers.  That didn't work out.  We'll find some more. They don't need to hear from anyone, by the way, because we have a transcript.  Doesn't matter what they think or how they interpreted hearsay information.   So, to Schiff or anyone in the swamp actually care, let's see, real national security ramifications, what if the president needs to talk to a world leader frankly about issues of war and peace?  Is that going to be spied on too?  Do they care about our diplomacy is now that it significantly impaired because of these leaks?  Clearly not.  Now, don't expect to get an honest answer from Schiff or any Democrat for that matter, and certainly don't expect your lying corrupt mob media to ever do their jobs.  The only thing they care about is taking down Donald Trump no matter what, undoing an election of we, the people. They are all proven liars, every one of them.  The same players, the same playbook, it's just a different country.  Now, it's Ukraine, not Russia. And I can't think of a single issue they didn't lie about.  Our own Gregg Jarrett points out, Schiff alone lied about Carter Page getting bribed by the Kremlin.  He lied about the dissemination about the dirty dossier.  Schiff lied when he claimed that the dirty dossier was not the bulk of information in the FISA application against Carter Page to spy in a candidate, a transition team and then the president.  And who can forget Schiff also lied repeatedly, alleging to have the damning evidence proving Trump-Russia collusion.  That didn't work out, did it?  As a matter of fact, for years, there he is, the cowardly Shifty Schiff, well, he's lied over and over and over again.  Frankly, not only censured, he should not be in charge of the intelligence community. Really?  This guy?  Take a look.",

We've known for some time, at least been publicly reported that the dossier, or the hiring of Christopher Steele, was initially on the behalf of one the Republican candidates and later on behalf of Democratic candidates.  That application and those renewals have been vindicated in substantial part by Carter Page's own words. Well, I certainly think he's acting like someone whose compromise and it may very well be that he is compromised or may very well be that he believes that he's compromised, that the Russians have information on him. According to Christopher Steele, a British -- a former British intelligence officer who has reportedly been held in high regard by U.S. intelligence, Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, CEO of the Russia gas giant Rosneft.  According to Steele's Russian sources, Page is offered brokerage fees by Sechin on a deal involving a 19 percent share of the company.   I hear what you want.  I have a favor I want from you, though.  And I'm going to say this only seven times and so you better listen good.  I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent and understand lots of it, on this and on that.",

      "sentences": "He is a liar.  He is a pathological -- frankly, congenital liar.   It's not just about the lies, though.  It's the complete and utter hypocrisy, his fellow Democrats, the media mob, they all do the same thing. Schiff alleged to have all the evidence, he's going to prove it.  Trump- Russia collusion, but he's the guy caught on tape trying to get dirt from somebody that sounds like a Russian that he thought was a Russian.  In fact, he took that direct call from two pranksters who claimed to have naked pictures of Trump, compromising materials on Trump.  He thought the Ukrainians with connections to Vladimir Putin.  And they -- does Vladimir know?  Yes, Vladimir know about compromising materials of naked Trump. His colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mark Warner, he's not even better.  Remember, after four separate investigations, no evidence of any collusion, including his own bipartisan probe in the Senate.  Warner still claims that Trump might've colluded with Russia anyway.  But at the very same time, whoopsy-a-daisy, Senator Warner was busy texting a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to get dirt on Trump.  Warner texting, wanting the oligarch to help set up a private meeting with none other than Christopher Steele without any of his Republican colleagues on the committee knowing what they're -- what they're doing or what they accused Trump of.  He actually texted the lobbyist for the oligarch, I would like to do a prelim call.  You, me, and no one else. And Warner also texting that he would rather have, not have a paper trail for his messages colluding with the Russians.  Senator indicating that he would be willing to travel abroad, to meet with Steele in order to get the dirt on Trump and Manafort.  Oh, what they're blaming Trump of.  Now, this is not a good look for someone claiming to disavow all foreign election interference, is it?  And he's not the only Democratic senator guilty of doing that which they are accusing Trump of, that Trump is innocent of several months ago.  In letters from Senator Menendez, Durbin, Leahy, the three Democrats threaten to withhold aid if the government of Ukraine stopped investigating Trump on the Trump-Russia side.  And just this month, in a meeting with Ukraine's new President Zelensky, well, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy reportedly threatened to cut off U.S. aid if the country open an investigation into Biden.  And don't forget, \"Politico's\" report about a DNC operative, this was January 11th, 2017, they wrote this, an operative working for the DNC, a contractor, working with Ukrainian government to get compromising materials to smear then candidate Trump to bolster and help Hillary.  Oh, collusion.  And according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the Clinton Foundation, wow, they've got more than $50,000 in donations from Ukrainian citizens than any other foreign country.  Imagine if Vice President Trump -- not Biden's son, let's say it was Hunter Trump, no evidence, no background in Ukraine or China, and did what Hunter did while his dad was vice president? But not a word on any of this from your corrupt mob in the media.  The only thing they do, the do-nothing Democrats, they only care about three years now get rid of Trump, nothing else, nothing else.  Meanwhile, look at the president.  He's been tirelessly working day after day, keeping his promises, improving the lives of we the people.  And we are seeing results, 7 million new jobs.  Look at your screen.  That is what the president has been able to accomplish despite the constant, unyielding resistance from the deep state, media mob, and the Democratic Party that does nothing.  Two originalist Supreme Court from the list he gave us.  Wages hit a post-recession high, jobless claims, the lowest since 1969, record low unemployment for African- Americans, Hispanic Americans, women in the workplace, and youth unemployment. We're energy dependent for the first time in 79 years and, you know, I can go on and on.  Promises made, promises kept.  This is what 2020 is really about.  You will have the final say, not them.  It's not a phony witch hunt, you know, center around a non-whistleblower whistleblower. Here with the reaction to this and also big news from the second circuit court today, we have President Trump's counsel, Jay Sekulow.  Also, the chief counsel for that Center for American Law and Justice. Sir, your reaction to this and on the court ruling?",

I think, look, they are now talking about a second whistleblower and my statement on that is, so what?  We've already released the transcript.  So, does -- is it really relevant what some other person who may or may not have heard the conversation thought about it? The transcript has been released.  It is out there in the public.  So, again, you know what?  They couldn't get Russia, they couldn't get obstruction, then it was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, and then there was a transcript that showed no quid pro quo, then it was a cover-up, except there was no cover-up because the transcript was released. Then it was the whistleblower, and what did the whistle-blower do?  The whistleblower said, well, no firsthand knowledge for most of it and then didn't bother to tell the inspector general that the individual was in conversations with Adam Schiff because, of course, Adam Schiff said, nobody, none of us had any conversations with the whistle-blower which ended up of course not being true.  So, now that we have a second whistle-blower -- again, the transcript out, it speaks for itself.  It is not an impeachable offense, period. Now, number two, U.S. Court of Appeals for the second circuit today recognized -- I want to read the -- I like reading the exact words of the order.  The case is, Donald J. Trump, plaintiff - appellant, versus Cyrus Vance, who is the district attorney for the county of New York.  We filed a motion seeking an order temporary staying the enforcement of a subpoena that was given to the president's accountants. What do they want?  Tax returns.  What do they want in California?  Tax returns.  What did the California say?  No tax returns.  That's not part of the qualifications for office. The House of Representatives basically extending their investigation through a local D.A.  The words of the subpoena verbatim, the words of the House subpoenas.  Verbatim.  Then what happens?   We go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the issue this order.  It is hereby ordered that a temporary administrative stay is granted pending expedited review by a panel of the court, a scheduling order will issue in the ordinary course.  The court also said because of the unique issues raised by this appeal, those unique issues, Sean, are the -- is really, at the heart of it, is the Constitution of the United States.

Joining us with more, the author of the brand-new book out tomorrow, \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History,\" FOX News contributor, legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, the author of another best seller, \"Defending Israel,\" Alan Dershowitz, is with us. Professor, we'll start with you.  You know what, do you see any bribery, any high crimes, any misdemeanors here, because nobody that I do -- you may not like -- you and I had our biggest fight ever over the Clinton impeachment.  It was pretty brutal.  And we made up since.  But when you -- when you go up, there are 11 specific felonies identified by the independent counsel at the time, the statute has changed.  That would be Kenneth Starr.  I don't see even a mention of a felony here. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"DEFENDING ISRAEL\" AUTHOR:  There are no impeachable offenses.  The constitution is very clear that you need bribery, treason, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  The most interesting issue, the one that Jay has brilliantly litigated is whether a state can investigate and prosecute a sitting president. I think the Second Circuit has just given us a clue as how it might decide that issue.  It said it was a very, very important issue.  The Constitution itself says that a president who has been impeached and removed can then be tried for a crime, but it strongly implies that he could not be tried for a crime and that would mean a state crime or a federal crime. Let's remember at the time of the Constitution, a vast majority of crimes were state crimes.  So I think in the end, a president can't be investigated or charged with a state or federal crime, while he is sitting and I don't think he could be impeached for the conduct that's been alleged in this case.",

      "utterance": "Happy Monday.  Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up, we're going to put this all in perspective.  I know many of you -- you might be worried about the ongoing political tornadoes and hurricanes out of the swamp in Washington, the mob and our corrupt media.  By the way, you should be.  It's repulsive what they are doing again after three years of lies and conspiracy theories. Now, I can't tell you exactly how it's all going to play out.  And likely may be the go-ahead and impeach President Trump over nothing.  Bill Clinton had 11 felonies in the Kenneth Starr report, nothing here.  We'll see. But I can tell you this with confidence, I can tell you how this is going to end and it's going to end with the reelection of Donald Trump and in part, we are going to be able to thank them for what they did and their stupidity and their lack of concern for you, we the American people, and I can see the Republicans taking back the House, I could see Republicans increasing their majority in the U.S. Senate. But make no mistake about it.  These are dangerous times for a constitutional republic.  By the way, God help us, if they ever did win with their $94 trillion Green New Deal, there are $36 trillion Medicare for all with no private insurance, yet, you see, that would destroy the greatest economy ever designed by man.  That's a clear and present danger. Now, Democrats, they are compliant lapdog stenographers in the mob and the media, they are now willing to shred the Constitution, upend the rule of law, suspend any connection to truth, reality, objective truth, and, by the way, they will cast away all God-given common sense as assuming they might've had some in the beginning to subvert the will of you, we the American people. The root cause of this now going into another impeachment saga, it's not bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors.  They don't have any evidence of that. Instead, it is a psychotic hatred and rage against this president and, really, for those of us who put him in office and voted for him. In other words, they never recovered from losing in 2016.  They thought they had this covered.  Make no mistake: they loathe, we, you the American people, we smelly Walmart shoppers.  I love Walmart.  We irredeemable deplorables. You know, we're Americans that cling to our God -- thank you.  Our guns, our bible, our religion.  They hate you, they hate me, they hate the president, and they look down on all of us, they think they know better and they want total control of your life, your decisions, and they'll tax you to death to get their scheme done. They want to confiscate our money, they want everything free, free, free, for everybody.  Cradle to grave, womb to tomb, free Medicare, free higher education, free childcare, free paid vacation, free housing, free healthy food, free universal basic income whether you are willing or unwilling to work -- by the way, they will eliminate oil, gas, the combustion engines, eventually planes and cows. And Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the real speaker of the House, now wants to provide -- this is the truth, welfare for illegal immigrants, including criminal illegal immigrants.  Those convicted.  Now, this would cause an economic devastation, the likes of which we, the U.S., the world has ever witnessed.  This is the greatest wealth producing system in the world. It would be turned into another socialist hell no different from Venezuela or Cuba.  In order to govern this country with an iron fist and carry out that socialist freedom of theirs, they must first reclaim power.  It's all about power. Now, you might say, we have an election in one year.  Why not let the American people decide?  Well, the answer to that is they don't want to risk another term of President Trump, so they feel like they've got to bludgeon it more.  It will backfire, but that's their thinking. Instinctively, I argue they know they can't win with the people they have running.  Congressman Al Green said it best.  If he's not impeached, yes, he could get reelected, likely well.  Take a look."

      "utterance": "If we don't impeach him, he will get reelected.  Now, what we have now been through the last three years, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, Stormy, Stormy -- it's now clear Democrats are fully prepared to up and the will of the American people by any means necessary.  They think they know better than we do. And what -- by the way, the do-nothing Democrats, what have they done? What a compliment had they made in the last three years of Russia, Russia, to make you, we the American people more prosperous, to keep us more safe and more secure? They have done nothing.  This is all they have done for three years.  They want this post-constitutional America.  They want to stack the U.S. Supreme Court, eliminate the electoral college of California, New Jersey, New York and Illinois will decide every national election. They want to get rid of a president because they don't like him and, by the way, even if he does something they like, they don't like him. Now, that the left does fail to realize time and again is that -- well, we might be a redeemable deplorables that cling to our God, but we are also hardworking, logical, smart Americans and we weren't -- well, swamped out of the common sense God gave us.  We know what this impeachment inquiry is all about, nothing more than a political stunt. They tried this for three years now.  They have failed.  By the way, this time, they're not going to -- they're not going to put their faith and hope in another special prosecutor who, in the end, just let them down because there was no evidence. We have all witnessed the left's insane, breathless, non-spot, three-year hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories, and their witch hunt.  The same people now, same agenda, just a different country.  It's Ukraine.  By the way, Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton the last election, yes, and, they admit it. And, by the way, a DNC operative subcontractor met with Ukrainian official to get dirt on Trump.  Not telling that story either.  Now, we the people, we've been watching and witnessing this phony, fake outrage, this media circus, the character assassination, the smearing -- oh, the president, Justice Kavanaugh, we witnessed a 16-year-old high school kid get demonized on national TV for wearing a MAGA hat.  They assassinated his character. You, the American people, you've been witnessing the media mobs and they are a mob with a mop mindset, breathless hysteria, resulted in one fake phony story after another, one lie after another, every second of every day.  We got him, we got him, we got him -- no, you don't. The great irony in all of this, whatever accusations Democrats and the mob launched against the president, they end of being guilty of that very thing themselves.  How ironic. This is why tonight, I want you to take a close look at this list.  By the way, those Democratic congressmen and women, they represent districts that President Trump carried in 2016. Now, if you live in any of those districts, it might be important to remind your lawmaker that they work for you, and not doing anything in three years is not acceptable to you.  It's to allow the corrupt, cowardly, Adam, the Shifty, Schiff, literally run this thing, these people need to stand up to this post-constitutional coup attempt in their party and frankly I say defeat them. This is where you have the power, not them.  The radical far left extreme socialist in charge of the Democratic Party think they rule it all.  You will have the last say at the end of the day.  The Cowardly Schiff and AOC and Tlaib and Omar and Pelosi, speaker in name only, they get your way, the sanctity of your vote, the foundations of this great, prosperous republic will be destroyed, because they want to want to fundamentally, drastically reshaped America. And Adam, the cowardly Shifty Schiff -- well, in particular, he is trying to con we the people with outright lies and fabrications.  Now, we know that the non-whistleblower whistle-blower, well, from the Ukraine call, worked with Schiff's office to craft the complaint.  In fact, Schiff's office encouraged the whistleblower to hire a lawyer, go to the inspector general. On national TV, the Shifty Schiff, well, he said, we have not spoken with the whistleblower but we'd like to.  That was a lie too.  Maybe that's why the fake whistleblower whistleblower failed to mention his contact with Schiff's office in the complaint. And according to a report of our own Catherine Herridge, this non- whistleblower, and we have more because that was not panning out, we have tons of whistleblowers, will make them up, filing this complaint, left a blank -- a section which they could have disclosed, that congressional contact, they didn't use it.  Still no word why there was also an 18-day gap in between the president's call with Ukraine and the urgent report made to the inspector general.  Maybe the Cowardly Schiff has not been contacted by that point.  Maybe he knows the answer. Maybe Schiff can also fill us in why the fake, phony non-whistleblower is reportedly a registered Democrat, hired to work in the Obama White House, went to his office of all places to file the complaint.  And maybe the cowardly shift can tell us how the president's phone calls with world leaders are now getting leaked again and again to the press -- Australia, Mexico, Ukraine, Australia again.  No other president in the history of this country has had to deal with this onslaught from a deep state bureaucracy swamped from within. Only Donald Trump and now we are seeing even more leaks from more whistleblowers.  There's no end to the whistleblowers that are not whistleblowers.  That didn't work out.  We'll find some more. They don't need to hear from anyone, by the way, because we have a transcript.  Doesn't matter what they think or how they interpreted hearsay information. So, to Schiff or anyone in the swamp actually care, let's see, real national security ramifications, what if the president needs to talk to a world leader frankly about issues of war and peace?  Is that going to be spied on too?  Do they care about our diplomacy is now that it significantly impaired because of these leaks?  Clearly not. Now, don't expect to get an honest answer from Schiff or any Democrat for that matter, and certainly don't expect your lying corrupt mob media to ever do their jobs.  The only thing they care about is taking down Donald Trump no matter what, undoing an election of we, the people. They are all proven liars, every one of them.  The same players, the same playbook, it's just a different country.  Now, it's Ukraine, not Russia. And I can't think of a single issue they didn't lie about. Our own Gregg Jarrett points out, Schiff alone lied about Carter Page getting bribed by the Kremlin.  He lied about the dissemination about the dirty dossier.  Schiff lied when he claimed that the dirty dossier was not the bulk of information in the FISA application against Carter Page to spy in a candidate, a transition team and then the president. And who can forget Schiff also lied repeatedly, alleging to have the damning evidence proving Trump-Russia collusion.  That didn't work out, did it?  As a matter of fact, for years, there he is, the cowardly Shifty Schiff, well, he's lied over and over and over again.  Frankly, not only censured, he should not be in charge of the intelligence community. Really?  This guy?  Take a look."

    {
      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "Yes, there is ample evidence of collusion in plain sight. We've known for some time, at least been publicly reported that the dossier, or the hiring of Christopher Steele, was initially on the behalf of one the Republican candidates and later on behalf of Democratic candidates. That application and those renewals have been vindicated in substantial part by Carter Page's own words. Well, I certainly think he's acting like someone whose compromise and it may very well be that he is compromised or may very well be that he believes that he's compromised, that the Russians have information on him. According to Christopher Steele, a British -- a former British intelligence officer who has reportedly been held in high regard by U.S. intelligence, Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, CEO of the Russia gas giant Rosneft.  According to Steele's Russian sources, Page is offered brokerage fees by Sechin on a deal involving a 19 percent share of the company. I hear what you want.  I have a favor I want from you, though.  And I'm going to say this only seven times and so you better listen good.  I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent and understand lots of it, on this and on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "He is a liar.  He is a pathological -- frankly, congenital liar. It's not just about the lies, though.  It's the complete and utter hypocrisy, his fellow Democrats, the media mob, they all do the same thing. Schiff alleged to have all the evidence, he's going to prove it.  Trump- Russia collusion, but he's the guy caught on tape trying to get dirt from somebody that sounds like a Russian that he thought was a Russian. In fact, he took that direct call from two pranksters who claimed to have naked pictures of Trump, compromising materials on Trump.  He thought the Ukrainians with connections to Vladimir Putin.  And they -- does Vladimir know?  Yes, Vladimir know about compromising materials of naked Trump. His colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mark Warner, he's not even better.  Remember, after four separate investigations, no evidence of any collusion, including his own bipartisan probe in the Senate.  Warner still claims that Trump might've colluded with Russia anyway. But at the very same time, whoopsy-a-daisy, Senator Warner was busy texting a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to get dirt on Trump.  Warner texting, wanting the oligarch to help set up a private meeting with none other than Christopher Steele without any of his Republican colleagues on the committee knowing what they're -- what they're doing or what they accused Trump of.  He actually texted the lobbyist for the oligarch, I would like to do a prelim call.  You, me, and no one else. And Warner also texting that he would rather have, not have a paper trail for his messages colluding with the Russians.  Senator indicating that he would be willing to travel abroad, to meet with Steele in order to get the dirt on Trump and Manafort.  Oh, what they're blaming Trump of. Now, this is not a good look for someone claiming to disavow all foreign election interference, is it?  And he's not the only Democratic senator guilty of doing that which they are accusing Trump of, that Trump is innocent of several months ago.  In letters from Senator Menendez, Durbin, Leahy, the three Democrats threaten to withhold aid if the government of Ukraine stopped investigating Trump on the Trump-Russia side. And just this month, in a meeting with Ukraine's new President Zelensky, well, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy reportedly threatened to cut off U.S. aid if the country open an investigation into Biden.  And don't forget, \"Politico's\" report about a DNC operative, this was January 11th, 2017, they wrote this, an operative working for the DNC, a contractor, working with Ukrainian government to get compromising materials to smear then candidate Trump to bolster and help Hillary.  Oh, collusion. And according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the Clinton Foundation, wow, they've got more than $50,000 in donations from Ukrainian citizens than any other foreign country.  Imagine if Vice President Trump -- not Biden's son, let's say it was Hunter Trump, no evidence, no background in Ukraine or China, and did what Hunter did while his dad was vice president? But not a word on any of this from your corrupt mob in the media.  The only thing they do, the do-nothing Democrats, they only care about three years now get rid of Trump, nothing else, nothing else.  Meanwhile, look at the president.  He's been tirelessly working day after day, keeping his promises, improving the lives of we the people.  And we are seeing results, 7 million new jobs. Look at your screen.  That is what the president has been able to accomplish despite the constant, unyielding resistance from the deep state, media mob, and the Democratic Party that does nothing.  Two originalist Supreme Court from the list he gave us.  Wages hit a post-recession high, jobless claims, the lowest since 1969, record low unemployment for African- Americans, Hispanic Americans, women in the workplace, and youth unemployment. We're energy dependent for the first time in 79 years and, you know, I can go on and on.  Promises made, promises kept.  This is what 2020 is really about.  You will have the final say, not them.  It's not a phony witch hunt, you know, center around a non-whistleblower whistleblower. Here with the reaction to this and also big news from the second circuit court today, we have President Trump's counsel, Jay Sekulow.  Also, the chief counsel for that Center for American Law and Justice. Sir, your reaction to this and on the court ruling?"

      "utterance": "Yes, sir. I think, look, they are now talking about a second whistleblower and my statement on that is, so what?  We've already released the transcript.  So, does -- is it really relevant what some other person who may or may not have heard the conversation thought about it? The transcript has been released.  It is out there in the public.  So, again, you know what?  They couldn't get Russia, they couldn't get obstruction, then it was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, and then there was a transcript that showed no quid pro quo, then it was a cover-up, except there was no cover-up because the transcript was released. Then it was the whistleblower, and what did the whistle-blower do?  The whistleblower said, well, no firsthand knowledge for most of it and then didn't bother to tell the inspector general that the individual was in conversations with Adam Schiff because, of course, Adam Schiff said, nobody, none of us had any conversations with the whistle-blower which ended up of course not being true. So, now that we have a second whistle-blower -- again, the transcript out, it speaks for itself.  It is not an impeachable offense, period. Now, number two, U.S. Court of Appeals for the second circuit today recognized -- I want to read the -- I like reading the exact words of the order.  The case is, Donald J. Trump, plaintiff - appellant, versus Cyrus Vance, who is the district attorney for the county of New York.  We filed a motion seeking an order temporary staying the enforcement of a subpoena that was given to the president's accountants. What do they want?  Tax returns.  What do they want in California?  Tax returns.  What did the California say?  No tax returns.  That's not part of the qualifications for office. The House of Representatives basically extending their investigation through a local D.A.  The words of the subpoena verbatim, the words of the House subpoenas.  Verbatim.  Then what happens? We go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the issue this order.  It is hereby ordered that a temporary administrative stay is granted pending expedited review by a panel of the court, a scheduling order will issue in the ordinary course.  The court also said because of the unique issues raised by this appeal, those unique issues, Sean, are the -- is really, at the heart of it, is the Constitution of the United States. And whether I'm wearing my hat as a president's lawyer or his chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, you have to protect the Constitution.  That doesn't just protect a president, that protects all of us."

Professor, we'll start with you.  You know what, do you see any bribery, any high crimes, any misdemeanors here, because nobody that I do -- you may not like -- you and I had our biggest fight ever over the Clinton impeachment.  It was pretty brutal.  And we made up since. But when you -- when you go up, there are 11 specific felonies identified by the independent counsel at the time, the statute has changed.  That would be Kenneth Starr.  I don't see even a mention of a felony here. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"DEFENDING ISRAEL\" AUTHOR:  There are no impeachable offenses.  The constitution is very clear that you need bribery, treason, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  The most interesting issue, the one that Jay has brilliantly litigated is whether a state can investigate and prosecute a sitting president. I think the Second Circuit has just given us a clue as how it might decide that issue.  It said it was a very, very important issue.  The Constitution itself says that a president who has been impeached and removed can then be tried for a crime, but it strongly implies that he could not be tried for a crime and that would mean a state crime or a federal crime. Let's remember at the time of the Constitution, a vast majority of crimes were state crimes.  So I think in the end, a president can't be investigated or charged with a state or federal crime, while he is sitting and I don't think he could be impeached for the conduct that's been alleged in this case."

And the problem of this abuse of power, it's a shifting sand of subjective interpretation.  That's exactly what the Framers did not want to.  They did not want a president to be removed for partisan reasons or personal animus.

Congressman John Ratcliffe, he says he expects the Inspector General Horowitz's report on FISA abuse in the next week or two.  Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr, John Durham, they are moving forward in their investigation to expose the origins of this Russia witch hunt so-called probe. It should be sending the deep state into an all out panic.  It's why you see deep state actors trying to run interference ahead of what my sources are telling me will be the explosive findings on the weaponization of intelligence against this president and, yes, the American people. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, alongside the author of the new book \"Power Grab\", FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz. And, let me start, Sara, with you on the news side of this.  This is important, because we've been expecting this from Horowitz.  My sources are telling me that there is an explosive email chain with Comey and Brennan on it that says they didn't verify the dossier, which would mean premeditated fraud on the FISA court as we've been saying."

Not only was there an email chain that I'm hearing as well, Sean, but there were the issues that were withheld in the foreign intelligence surveillance court regarding George Papadopoulos, also regarding Carter Page. So this is going to be the moment when this report is released and hopefully the documents that are also over with the Department of Justice will be declassified as well so the American people can see everything print one more point here, Sean. What's so important here and why the American people need to understand this, the reason Attorney General William Barr as well as John Durham are going themselves overseas and interviewing our allies in Italy and in England and in other places is because they want to get to the truth. They absolutely know that within the CIA and within the Intelligence Communities, people have been compromised. We see that right now with this whistleblower allegation. We see what was going on and this is why John Brennan is coming out and basically slashing and lashing out at the President saying that we are a corrupt country. They have to go around that, they need to talk directly to the sources to collect the information. This is what makes me have faith in the Justice Department and that they are doing their job."

There is no doubt about it it's an unverifiable dossier. McCabe said no dossier there will be no FISA warrant. They got the FISA warrant, and they didn't bother to even try to verify it when the FBI finally got around to it. What do we know what happened? The FBI decided they could prove 90 plus percent was not true. But they had by law an obligation to go back to the court. They never did. They double down and did it again. JASON CHAFFETZ, \"POWER GRAB\" AUTHOR: Multiple times they signed off on that document and as John Ratcliffe has said before at the very top it says verified. I think you need to look at the interactions between Mr. Comey and Brennan. Did they know ahead of time that it was unverified and go ahead and use it to spy on the Trump campaign? There's a reason why Mr. Brennan is in work with the in spin bound."

And Sara is right on this and I will start with you, Sara, they are spending a lot of time - I would always say, I don't know, countries like Italy, Great Britain or Australia we've had this story for a long time, and that is the issue of outsourcing spying, intelligence gathering against Americans and against the President to circumvent the laws of this country, what they did is they gave it to our allies to do that which was illegal themselves which would mean they are outsourcing, lawbreaking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Right. They are outsourcing lawbreaking and they're going against it. If we are talking about the CIA, the CIA cannot even touch anything national at all. Any time they hear about anything overseas that has anything to do with United States they need to pass it on when it has to do with internal politics, especially to the FBI. But they didn't. I think what people discover, and by the way, I think they should get Andrew McCabe's text messages as well and all of his emails and I know Judicial Watch is fighting for that. Those are going to be explosive too we don't want to leave him out. But I think, what we are seeing right now, Sean, is the fact is that people in the CIA, specifically John Brennan coerced with James Clapper were working with our allies, certain allies trying to retrieve information on the President of the United States. Look, it's just the facts on their face, Sean. This was an apparent soft crew on the duly elected President all you have to do is keep looking at the facts in order to understand that. I think the American people can see the evidence lay before them and I think the American people would agree that what we are seeing here is an illegal move to remove the President."

They will follow through on impeachment. The Senate is never going to convict. I know what the outcome is going to be. I do not know all the pieces in the middle but the ending in the book, is going to be Jason in my view, Donald Trump gets reelected. A good chance Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker and the majority in the Senate increases.

We can't even focus on national issues because of the Democrats are focused on any House and even with the Senate, Democratic Senators are focusing on President Trump, they have no platform.

I rarely agree with Phil Mud the CNN Intel Analyst, but on the date the whistleblower story broke, Sean, he told a stunned Chris Cuomo, I am about to blow my gasket not at Trump but at the whistleblower. He said the President should be able to have conversations with his counterpart and heads of other states without somebody \"Stitching on him,\" and Cuomo was gob smacked. He said I used to work in the White House, I used to be on these phone calls, the President can say what he wants, and if somebody doesn't like it, that person can quit, write a book, complain, but not file some sort of whistleblower complaints. And Trump has been a target from day one. It wasn't just after he got in the White House, from when he got elected, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign John Podesta writes an Op-Ed piece in \"The Washington Post\" and says Obama should advise the electors to first brief them on Russian interference before they certify the election for Trump. For crying out loud! The attempt to invoke the 25th amendment, AOC says he ought to be impeached for emoluments clause, and Representative Green says he ought to be impeached for his anti-squad tweets.

And they had their opportunity to show the American people what their agenda was. Do you know what their agenda is Sean; it is to do nothing but to try to have a fishing expedition to find any scandal they can on Donald Trump. They are transfixed with this idea that they don't bring Trump down with fake and pony scandals that they won't win. And if they know if they don't win, Donald Trump can transform the country. Why? Because we will have 8 years of him being a wreck-it Ralph to the deep state and to the swamp and to the way we've done things for 30 years which has ossified and caused so much pain to people around the country.

With this story, I was fired, I was let go, wasn't rehired because I was pregnant and the principal did what every principal did?
