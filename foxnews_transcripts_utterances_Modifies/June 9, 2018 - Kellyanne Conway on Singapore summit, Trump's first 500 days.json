Fine.\" But come together so that the two side can get their message across, so this isn't about kneeling, it's about the social injustice of colored people in America. That's the biggest issue here.

It's not about black-white. It's like, it is about when he called him a racist, like there is a difference between racism and prejudice. Now, we can go back and forth between the two on him, but I don't believe he is a racist. He might be prejudice. He might say some things that are demeaning, I get it, but what I'm thinking here is the players could have had a platform bigger than no other than the White House to get their message across to that man himself."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I don't know enough about the details of how that happened. I mean, it was really unfortunate to hear that only six guys are going to be going. Particularly because if you look at the Philadelphia Eagles and their ball club, I mean, from their leader, Malcolm Jenkins, who I think is one of the greatest black leaders of our time right now, Chris Long gave up his entire year's salary to help the kids. I mean, these guys are out there in the community doing good work, and the fact of the matter is every single one of those guys stood up for \"The National Anthem\" each and every game. And so, this is confusing me. I just don't understand why the Philadelphia Eagles ball club and Donald Trump aren't communicating. I mean, it seems like they agree on a lot of issues, I just think in front of the lights and cameras, they are going at each other, and it could have been handled in a much better way. I've asked, and you know this Jesse, we have talked before, I have asked for Donald Trump to please bring our black athletes to the White House and let's have a conversation and let's heal this nation."

      "speaker": "SEBORN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there are plenty of examples, but what I think would be more important for the two sides is to come together and understand what it is exactly they are trying to get across. I don't think they have disrespect for our country or our flag for that matter, I think they are just choosing a way to protest. We've given them that right with the First Amendment. I had spoken to two different military and they both said, \"I disagree with the way they are doing this. 100%.\" And I think what the problem is, their actual message of what they are trying to get across is being lost in the way they are going about it. So, they said, \"Hey, I fought for their right to do that. So they can do that. Fine.\" But come together so that the two side can get their message across, so this isn't about kneeling, it's about the social injustice of colored people in America. That's the biggest issue here. It's not the kneeling. The protest was supposed to get the message out, right?"

Well, no I believe it's a failed protest because if no one knows what you're protesting and everybody believes you are disrespecting the flag and the anthem, then your protest has failed, because they did it at the wrong time. If you are going to talk about social justice, do it on \"Watters' World.\" Do it on ESPN. There is plenty of outlets for you to do that, and, Jack, I don't think that was the right time or the place to do that I will give you the last word."

      "utterance": "Well, this is a President that has invited so many people, right, left and center to this White House over the 60 months that he has been here. You see the issues that we work on that are politically charged and the issues we work on that are decidedly non-partisan -- the opioid crisis that I helped lead here, prison reform that is getting new life through Jared Kushner and folks like Van Jones, and this President has pardoned folks who were asked to be pardoned by other Presidents, who failed to do so. I mean, he is very open to differing opinions and viewpoints. He's a master negotiator and deal maker that includes with whom he has discussions. I will tell you something that not a lot of people know, which is when the Philadelphia Eagles were first going to come, they requested policy time and the president said \"Okay, let's have policy time.\" And the people I think who wanted it most weren't coming to the White House."

They are concerned about criminal justice and social justice, and they should even give me that type of conversation about it, and by the way, if they have any ideas of people who have been treated unfairly by the justice system, they should give me ideas for pardon.\" He said, \"I will review those files and look at those cases.\" Now, just to go back to something you and I were discussing, some of the players that requested the policy time were not part of the smaller group who said that they were coming. There were Eagles players who were willing to come here and talk about their great work with respect to autism. The Eagles have raised in short order, $2.5 million for autism."

So, anyway, we could do that any time, but people -- some people want to have the conversations away from the White House and keep the issues alive."

Because obviously, it's through the President's leadership and stewardship that Secretary Pompeo has been over to North Korea two times already, unbeknownst to the media, both times, and including the release of those three American detainees here back home. And really preparing for this summit, obviously, the president has been involved with talks about North Korea since he got here. Since, actually when he was running for president and it was President Obama who told President Trump, North Korea is going to be your biggest problem. So, it's not like the President just decided yesterday to read up on North Korea, this is all because of his leadership."

And let me just make one thing clear, while I got you, Jesse, this porn star -- she is no victim at all, so I want the media to stop treating her like she is a victim. What -- they keep talking about a porn star, what is this porn star going to do for the country? You know, if Mika wants to talk about something, talk about the goodness that is going on in this country instead of gossip."

A 40-year-old Sacramento man was arrested on Monday after ramming his SUV into an unoccupied parked car multiple times and after several minutes, the driver then got out of the car, jumped on top of the Honda and began breaking out its windows. Police were finally able to calm him down before taking him into custody where he was booked on multiple felony charges. The guy just needs to hang out with the Party Bros to chill out a little bit. That's all for us tonight. Follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" is next. I am Watters, and this is my world.
