      "sentences": "And welcome 'Hannity.' We have so much breaking news tonight. And the head of fake news CNN, the soon to be scandal plagued Jeff Zucker, OK, you want to take pot shots at Fox News, Jeff, let's go. We're going to unveil our new nickname for the bleep hole network.  Plus, we're going to call out the hypocrisy of the media's news Stormy Daniels 24/7, 365, obsession, the same people that ignored Bill Clinton's accusers for decades. Oh, and by the way, in those cases, it wasn't always consensual, was it?  And also breaking right now, H.R. McMaster is out and John Bolton is in, good news, as national security advisor.  Also, new tonight, President Trump's lead lawyer in the Russia witch hunt is now stepping aside. In an apparent move, it means the president, he is getting ready to fight back and fight back hard against this corrupt special counsel. Our investigation into the investigators continues tonight. And the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte, he has now issued a subpoena for the DOJ to send over documents on the rigged Clinton e-mail investigation on FISA abuses, Andrew McCabe's firing, and Comey's firing.  The House Intel Committee has also announced their Russia probe is over and votes to publicly release the GOP's final report. There's new information in that. This report finds no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. It exposes deep state leaking, FISA abuse, and blasts the former director of national security, James Clapper, for giving inconsistent testimony just like McCabe about contacts with the media. Is that lying under oath?  Also, a stunning investigative report tonight from Sara Carter, how the special counsel Robert Mueller and his top prosecutor, you know, the guy that they say is the pit bull for Mr. Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, he's directly tied to two of the biggest scandals in FBI history. The rest of the media is ignoring this.",

Of course, porn king Jeff Zucker and his colleagues at the bleep-hole network, they're not alone in their Stormy obsession. NBC, ABC, CBS and others also featuring saturated coverage of the story. Predictably, the same level of media interest was not present back in the early 1990s when then-President Bill Clinton was accused of having multiple extramarital affairs and even worse, engaging in serious instances of sexual misconduct. By the way, in the case of Gennifer Flowers, she was proven right but I remember James Carville -- oh, he worked and was one of the people talking about it or dragging her through a trailer park about Paula Jones. Remember Paula Jones? She accused Bill Clinton of literally pulling down his pants and exposing himself. And according to the Media Research Center, the first three days of that scandal, ABC provided a whopping 16 seconds of coverage. NBC, CBS, they ignored it. And next, there's the case of Kathleen Willey, and she said that Bill Clinton groped, grabbed, fondled, touched, kissed her against her will inside the Oval Office. That story breaks, how's your fake news handle it? ABC ignores it, NBC, CBS gave it a whopping 34 seconds of coverage, again, according to the Media Research Center. CNN, meanwhile, they dedicated 26 seconds of coverage during their evening newscast.  Then, of course, you have the serious allegation of rape, Juanita Broaddrick. And I interviewed Juanita Broaddrick, one of the toughest interviews I ever did. This surfaced first in 1998. Media Research Center tells us ABC, CBS totally ignored the breaking story. NBC aired seven minutes of coverage, but not before initially spiking its pre-taped interview with Juanita Broaddrick. This proves what I've been saying about journalism since, what, 2007 or '08, it's dead and buried in this country. We'll have more in this later in the show. Also tonight, John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Trump's legal team for dealing with Robert Mueller's witch hunt has resigned. And just a few hours ago, Fox has confirmed that Victoria Toensing will be joining the president's legal team.  And President Trump is also breaking news saying that he would like to do a sit-down with the special counsel. Let's delve into this.",

I've been warning everybody about Robert Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors. We know for a fact Robert Mueller is conducting a biased, partisan, totally flawed investigation. He's gone way beyond his mandate, his original purpose. It was supposed to be about finding evidence of Trump-Russia collusion but we haven't found it in over a year, almost a year and a half now. That's why he was appointed. It is not what he is doing. As constitutional law expert and liberal Democrat, professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard, he is pointing that special counsels exist to bring about charges, justify their existence. Doesn't matter if it is at all connected to what they're supposed to be investigating. They have to do all of this to justify their existence at an enormous cost not only to the American taxpayers, all of you, but also to the culture and society. This Mueller witch hunt has been going on for over a year. And so far, he's found nothing regarding Trump-Russia collusion. And the president, by the way, has every reason to be upset. Here's why: Mueller's team has more Democratic donors than a liberal Hollywood fundraiser. And not one of Mueller's partisan witch hunters donated to Trump. Every single Republican in Washington not named Donald Trump would crack under this kind of pressure. So, yes, completely understandable when you appoint a team that donates to Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton and they're all going after one guy and not one person that donated to Trump? Of course, the president wants to fight back, because the special counsel from day one, has been abusively biased and many on that team have questionable ethics, they have horrific backgrounds, and they're out to destroy you. By the way, saying 'I'm not guilty', that's how any innocent person would act. Rod Rosenstein, he's stacked the deck against President Trump by appointing his buddy, Robert Mueller. He has conflicts himself. And then James Comey admitted he leaked the memos to get the special counsel appointed, and, of course, it happened. This is one big giant incestuous deep state cabal that is trying to unseat a duly elected president. All right. We'll have more on that.  Also breaking this hour, H.R. McMaster has resigned as national security advisor, and he will be replaced by John Bolton. This is a huge improvement. We'll have more that. And tonight, the House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has issued a subpoena to the DOJ, demanding documents on this fixed Clinton email investigation, which never was an investigation. Also about severe FISA abuse and on Andrew McCabe's firing. And Chairman Goodlatte, he notes in a press release, and this is something we have been reporting on, Congress has requested 1.2 million DOJ, FBI documents related to the Clinton investigation. The inspector general has them, why won't they turn them over? 'The Hill' is reporting that Chairman Goodlatte is trying to determine whether or not Comey lied under oath. He's requesting those documents as well. And so far, Congress has only received of the 1.2 million, 3,000. Well, that sounds like obstruction. That doesn't sound like the wheels of justice or equal justice under the law. The DOJ is stonewalling, they're preventing Congress from conducting their constitutional job, which is oversight. Remember, Rod Rosenstein sucking up to Paul Ryan in the final hours, please don't let Congress have access to the truth about FISA abuses. And we all know the Clinton email investigation was a sham, but Comey Strzok, Lisa Page, McCabe, and probably Loretta Lynch all part of putting the fix in. And on FISA abuses, the memos have exposed that the FBI and DOJ used, what, unverified, because they're not true. Clinton bought and paid for dossier, Russian lies, to get a FISA judge to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page, Trump associate, which then allows them to spy on the entire Trump campaign. And we know the bulk of the FISA investigation, according to the Grassley- Graham memo was made up of the phony Clinton dossier, full of Russia and Russian government lies and propaganda. And as Andrew McCabe testified, without no dossier, there never would have even been a FISA warrant application.  And as for McCabe, his comments after being fired, well, to put his buddy James Comey in serious legal jeopardy. Remember, in a statement, McCabe writes in part: the OIG investigation is focused on investigation I chose to share with the reporter through my public affairs officer in the legal counselor. As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that and it was not a secret, it took place over several days. And others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. By the way he's not addressing lying under oath. So, according to McCabe, Comey knew he was leaking information to the media which is in part why McCabe got fired, and then lying under oath also contributed. Well, McCabe is saying now, is very different from what James Comey said back in May of 2017. Who do you believe, Comey or McCabe? We'll let you decide. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R—IOWA: Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?",

Brennan is also threatening President Trump. Let's take a look at this tweet. 'When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude and political corruption becomes known, you will take your place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe but not destroy America. America will triumph over you.'  OK. John Brennan who voted for a communist for president, a deep state swamp rat, he's losing his mind and all of his friends now are being exposed. Here's a little 'Hannity' history lesson on Brennan that the media won't tell you. As I said, he admitted to voting for, quote, a communist party candidate. How did you ever become the CIA director? You have to wonder. And maybe Robert Mueller should see if he's ever colluded with the Russians. And that's not all. 'The New York Post' has reported that the House Intel Committee is investigating John Brennan and his ties to the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And the same committee is now looking into whether Brennan committed perjury when he testified under oath like his buddy McCabe who as he claims to have no idea who paid for that dossier. And 'The Post' also reporting that John Brennan briefed members of Congress, including former Democratic Senator Harry Reid about that phony dossier. And if you remember, Reid then put out a statement after meeting with Brennan, days after -- or before the election, and referenced the dossier, because Brennan told him. So, Brennan is dirty, political and corrupt as they come. And now, he's lashing out because we're all finding out who he really is. We have even more breaking news to tell you about. The House Intel Committee has put an end to this Russia investigation, 14 months, and they will have a vote to release to the public the Republican members' final report. And the House Intel Committee released a summary of the key findings today. Here are the highlights. After 14 months, interviews with all of these with witnesses, the committee found no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, one. So, the liberal media, all you Democrats, have been lying to the American people. James Clapper, number two, former Obama director of national intelligence, oh, fake news CNN contributor, he provided inconsistent testimony about his contacts with the media. I guess Comey is going to get hired next and then Brennan. And who knows? Maybe they'll hire Stormy.  And, by the way, if members of the partisan press are watching, we first reported this last week. It's called investigative journalism, real news. You guys might want to try it some time instead of spinning these conspiracy theories. And by the way, this wouldn't be the first time Clapper has lied to Congress. Back in May of 2013, let's watch Clapper lie. Take a look. SEN.

Here's my prediction, pretty easy to get this one right -- the rest of the liberal media is not going to report this tonight because it proves them to be liars and phony in their quest for journalism and truth. This is all a disinformation campaign and it's gone on way too long. Finally, tonight, I know I'm going long, Sara Carter, brand new news reporting, headline Robert Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, the FBI and the mob. Sara detailing how both Mueller and Weissmann are directly involved in two of the biggest scandals in FBI history. When Mueller was acting U.S. attorney in Boston in the '80s, all he was involved in the FBI's corrupt highly unethical relationship with the infamous murderer mobster Whitey Bulger. Four men ended up being framed for murder, sent to jail. Two of them died in jail. Then it resulted in over $100 million in damages to two that lived. And then there's Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. The rotten apple doesn't fall very far from the tree. He's the guy in a 1990s organized crime case, Weissmann was reprimanded by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence and his powerful friend -- well, later, were out there to get him out of trouble. We also told you about Weissmann's hard charging tactics in the Enron case. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs at Andersen Accounting, four Merrill executives go to jail, that case was overturned, 9-0 against him. All of this information is shocking. That's Mueller's team. But given what we know about Mueller and his pit bull Weissmann, well, it's now par for the course. This is a national disgrace what's happening. oining us with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, civil rights criminal defense attorney David Schoen, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.

But once he has that mandate, every single person who -- he, Mueller or his team, unilaterally decides, is interfering with this so-called investigation, or is obstructing it or has told him what he believes to be a lie, committed perjury, he has the authority under that general mandate, under regulation 600.04, to prosecute that crime. So, even if the person never committed a crime at all, simply by virtue of appointing this fellow as special counsel, he now has the unilateral authority to charge someone with a vey serious crime that had nothing to do with the underlying investigation. That's very, very dangerous. And that's one of the many reasons it's so important that you spend this time to point out who exactly Mr. Mueller is and who his team is. And I'm going to say this also: the conflicts that mark this team are absolutely astounding. The only reason special counsel is appointed under the statute, of course, is if there's reason to believe a crime was committed.

Plus, we're going to call out the hypocrisy of the media's news Stormy Daniels 24/7, 365, obsession, the same people that ignored Bill Clinton's accusers for decades. Oh, and by the way, in those cases, it wasn't always consensual, was it? And also breaking right now, H.R. McMaster is out and John Bolton is in, good news, as national security advisor. Also, new tonight, President Trump's lead lawyer in the Russia witch hunt is now stepping aside. In an apparent move, it means the president, he is getting ready to fight back and fight back hard against this corrupt special counsel. Our investigation into the investigators continues tonight. And the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte, he has now issued a subpoena for the DOJ to send over documents on the rigged Clinton e-mail investigation on FISA abuses, Andrew McCabe's firing, and Comey's firing. The House Intel Committee has also announced their Russia probe is over and votes to publicly release the GOP's final report. There's new information in that. This report finds no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. It exposes deep state leaking, FISA abuse, and blasts the former director of national security, James Clapper, for giving inconsistent testimony just like McCabe about contacts with the media. Is that lying under oath? Also, a stunning investigative report tonight from Sara Carter, how the special counsel Robert Mueller and his top prosecutor, you know, the guy that they say is the pit bull for Mr. Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, he's directly tied to two of the biggest scandals in FBI history. The rest of the media is ignoring this. And also, an exclusive tonight, you've heard about the Uranium One informant. He's now speaking on camera right here tonight, for the first time about being interviewed by the FBI as part of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yes, there's a real investigation going on, the media talking about Stormy. 'The Hill's' John Solomon has that report and those details. That and so much more in our breaking news opening monologue."

Of course, porn king Jeff Zucker and his colleagues at the bleep-hole network, they're not alone in their Stormy obsession. NBC, ABC, CBS and others also featuring saturated coverage of the story. Predictably, the same level of media interest was not present back in the early 1990s when then-President Bill Clinton was accused of having multiple extramarital affairs and even worse, engaging in serious instances of sexual misconduct. By the way, in the case of Gennifer Flowers, she was proven right but I remember James Carville -- oh, he worked and was one of the people talking about it or dragging her through a trailer park about Paula Jones. Remember Paula Jones? She accused Bill Clinton of literally pulling down his pants and exposing himself. And according to the Media Research Center, the first three days of that scandal, ABC provided a whopping 16 seconds of coverage. NBC, CBS, they ignored it. And next, there's the case of Kathleen Willey, and she said that Bill Clinton groped, grabbed, fondled, touched, kissed her against her will inside the Oval Office. That story breaks, how's your fake news handle it? ABC ignores it, NBC, CBS gave it a whopping 34 seconds of coverage, again, according to the Media Research Center. CNN, meanwhile, they dedicated 26 seconds of coverage during their evening newscast. Then, of course, you have the serious allegation of rape, Juanita Broaddrick. And I interviewed Juanita Broaddrick, one of the toughest interviews I ever did. This surfaced first in 1998. Media Research Center tells us ABC, CBS totally ignored the breaking story. NBC aired seven minutes of coverage, but not before initially spiking its pre-taped interview with Juanita Broaddrick. This proves what I've been saying about journalism since, what, 2007 or '08, it's dead and buried in this country. We'll have more in this later in the show. Also tonight, John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Trump's legal team for dealing with Robert Mueller's witch hunt has resigned. And just a few hours ago, Fox has confirmed that Victoria Toensing will be joining the president's legal team. And President Trump is also breaking news saying that he would like to do a sit-down with the special counsel. Let's delve into this."

It was supposed to be about finding evidence of Trump-Russia collusion but we haven't found it in over a year, almost a year and a half now. That's why he was appointed. It is not what he is doing. As constitutional law expert and liberal Democrat, professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard, he is pointing that special counsels exist to bring about charges, justify their existence. Doesn't matter if it is at all connected to what they're supposed to be investigating. They have to do all of this to justify their existence at an enormous cost not only to the American taxpayers, all of you, but also to the culture and society.

      "utterance": "Mueller's team has more Democratic donors than a liberal Hollywood fundraiser. And not one of Mueller's partisan witch hunters donated to Trump. Every single Republican in Washington not named Donald Trump would crack under this kind of pressure. So, yes, completely understandable when you appoint a team that donates to Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton and they're all going after one guy and not one person that donated to Trump? Of course, the president wants to fight back, because the special counsel from day one, has been abusively biased and many on that team have questionable ethics, they have horrific backgrounds, and they're out to destroy you. By the way, saying 'I'm not guilty', that's how any innocent person would act. Rod Rosenstein, he's stacked the deck against President Trump by appointing his buddy, Robert Mueller. He has conflicts himself. And then James Comey admitted he leaked the memos to get the special counsel appointed, and, of course, it happened. This is one big giant incestuous deep state cabal that is trying to unseat a duly elected president. All right. We'll have more on that. Also breaking this hour, H.R. McMaster has resigned as national security advisor, and he will be replaced by John Bolton. This is a huge improvement. We'll have more that. And tonight, the House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has issued a subpoena to the DOJ, demanding documents on this fixed Clinton email investigation, which never was an investigation. Also about severe FISA abuse and on Andrew McCabe's firing. And Chairman Goodlatte, he notes in a press release, and this is something we have been reporting on, Congress has requested 1.2 million DOJ, FBI documents related to the Clinton investigation. The inspector general has them, why won't they turn them over? 'The Hill' is reporting that Chairman Goodlatte is trying to determine whether or not Comey lied under oath. He's requesting those documents as well. And so far, Congress has only received of the 1.2 million, 3,000. Well, that sounds like obstruction. That doesn't sound like the wheels of justice or equal justice under the law. The DOJ is stonewalling, they're preventing Congress from conducting their constitutional job, which is oversight. Remember, Rod Rosenstein sucking up to Paul Ryan in the final hours, please don't let Congress have access to the truth about FISA abuses. And we all know the Clinton email investigation was a sham, but Comey Strzok, Lisa Page, McCabe, and probably Loretta Lynch all part of putting the fix in. And on FISA abuses, the memos have exposed that the FBI and DOJ used, what, unverified, because they're not true. Clinton bought and paid for dossier, Russian lies, to get a FISA judge to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page, Trump associate, which then allows them to spy on the entire Trump campaign. And we know the bulk of the FISA investigation, according to the Grassley- Graham memo was made up of the phony Clinton dossier, full of Russia and Russian government lies and propaganda. And as Andrew McCabe testified, without no dossier, there never would have even been a FISA warrant application."

As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that and it was not a secret, it took place over several days. And others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. By the way he's not addressing lying under oath. So, according to McCabe, Comey knew he was leaking information to the media which is in part why McCabe got fired, and then lying under oath also contributed. Well, McCabe is saying now, is very different from what James Comey said back in May of 2017. Who do you believe, Comey or McCabe? We'll let you decide. SEN.

We're not going to hold our breath. But James Comey is welcome on this show. Our invitation continues. What is becoming more apparent by the day is how the deep state is fighting back as they continue to get exposed. They're not liking what is now happening and what we are exposing on the show.

      "utterance": "President Trump has been 50 times harder on Russia than Obama ever was, and he's about to take the legs out of Vladimir Putin's economy and he's not whispering, oh, tell Vladimir, after the election I will have more flexibility. Brennan is also threatening President Trump. Let's take a look at this tweet. 'When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude and political corruption becomes known, you will take your place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe but not destroy America. America will triumph over you.' OK. John Brennan who voted for a communist for president, a deep state swamp rat, he's losing his mind and all of his friends now are being exposed. Here's a little 'Hannity' history lesson on Brennan that the media won't tell you. As I said, he admitted to voting for, quote, a communist party candidate. How did you ever become the CIA director? You have to wonder. And maybe Robert Mueller should see if he's ever colluded with the Russians. And that's not all. 'The New York Post' has reported that the House Intel Committee is investigating John Brennan and his ties to the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And the same committee is now looking into whether Brennan committed perjury when he testified under oath like his buddy McCabe who as he claims to have no idea who paid for that dossier. And 'The Post' also reporting that John Brennan briefed members of Congress, including former Democratic Senator Harry Reid about that phony dossier. And if you remember, Reid then put out a statement after meeting with Brennan, days after -- or before the election, and referenced the dossier, because Brennan told him. So, Brennan is dirty, political and corrupt as they come. And now, he's lashing out because we're all finding out who he really is. We have even more breaking news to tell you about. The House Intel Committee has put an end to this Russia investigation, 14 months, and they will have a vote to release to the public the Republican members' final report. And the House Intel Committee released a summary of the key findings today. Here are the highlights. After 14 months, interviews with all of these with witnesses, the committee found no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, one. So, the liberal media, all you Democrats, have been lying to the American people. James Clapper, number two, former Obama director of national intelligence, oh, fake news CNN contributor, he provided inconsistent testimony about his contacts with the media. I guess Comey is going to get hired next and then Brennan. And who knows? Maybe they'll hire Stormy. And, by the way, if members of the partisan press are watching, we first reported this last week. It's called investigative journalism, real news. You guys might want to try it some time instead of spinning these conspiracy theories. And by the way, this wouldn't be the first time Clapper has lied to Congress. Back in May of 2013, let's watch Clapper lie. Take a look. SEN.

Point three, the committee found House Intel Committee, zero evidence of President Trump's pre-campaign business dealings resulting in any kind of collusion. Point four, they conclude no evidence that Trump associates were involved with WikiLeaks publishing stolen Democratic emails. This is another liberal media fantasy that's getting shut down. By the way, with all of the countries that hacked into Hillary's server, who knows who got those -- who gave it to WikiLeaks? There's one of a dozen choices. Here's my prediction, pretty easy to get this one right -- the rest of the liberal media is not going to report this tonight because it proves them to be liars and phony in their quest for journalism and truth. This is all a disinformation campaign and it's gone on way too long. Finally, tonight, I know I'm going long, Sara Carter, brand new news reporting, headline Robert Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, the FBI and the mob. Sara detailing how both Mueller and Weissmann are directly involved in two of the biggest scandals in FBI history. When Mueller was acting U.S. attorney in Boston in the '80s, all he was involved in the FBI's corrupt highly unethical relationship with the infamous murderer mobster Whitey Bulger. Four men ended up being framed for murder, sent to jail. Two of them died in jail. Then it resulted in over $100 million in damages to two that lived. And then there's Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. The rotten apple doesn't fall very far from the tree. He's the guy in a 1990s organized crime case, Weissmann was reprimanded by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence and his powerful friend -- well, later, were out there to get him out of trouble. We also told you about Weissmann's hard charging tactics in the Enron case. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs at Andersen Accounting, four Merrill executives go to jail, that case was overturned, 9-0 against him. All of this information is shocking. That's Mueller's team. But given what we know about Mueller and his pit bull Weissmann, well, it's now par for the course. This is a national disgrace what's happening. oining us with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, civil rights criminal defense attorney David Schoen, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.

I think the president obviously wants to talk to Mueller, he knows he's innocent. He wants to tell him what he knows. But this is a problem, Sean, all you have to do is look at these cases in the past. Innocent people ended up either pleading guilty or they were found guilty. They spent their life in prison or -- and then they had to wait until they were exonerated. There is a very serious moment here where the president has to take a step back and think about what he's going to do because there were cases, we saw it with the Weissmann case in New York, and we see it with the case in Boston."

There's virtually no accountability. He's given a mandate originally and that's by Mr. Rosenstein. But once he has that mandate, every single person who -- he, Mueller or his team, unilaterally decides, is interfering with this so-called investigation, or is obstructing it or has told him what he believes to be a lie, committed perjury, he has the authority under that general mandate, under regulation 600.04, to prosecute that crime. So, even if the person never committed a crime at all, simply by virtue of appointing this fellow as special counsel, he now has the unilateral authority to charge someone with a vey serious crime that had nothing to do with the underlying investigation. That's very, very dangerous. And that's one of the many reasons it's so important that you spend this time to point out who exactly Mr. Mueller is and who his team is."

I'm not being influenced by the president, we're not being told not to pursue particular investigations, that's not where we are. However, as you've been documenting night after night and I've been trying to pick up the baton at 10 o'clock, what's happened is a corrosive atmosphere at the top that I think has bled down, and that has hurt morale at the FBI. That has hurt credibility. And public confidence. That the upper echelon of the Intel agencies and the FBI, they're going to call both and strikes, they're not going to put their finger on the scale one way or the other, even if they don't like Trump, they like Trump, they like Hillary, don't like Hillary.

As we continue tonight we are joined by former Secret Service agent, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino, former House chairman of the House oversight committee and Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. You know, we discovered and Comey actually in his first draft of exoneration before investigation, Congressman, he actually had talked about foreign intelligence agencies having access to Hillary's server, top secret, special access, information et cetera. Now I'm going to assume that's as many as five or six, that's Iran, that's North Korea, that's China, that's Russia? With all of those people having access to it, who would know where WikiLeaks ever got it or some other source? Who would know?"

Whose lives are at risk here?"

I mean, what national foreign leader, foreign dignitary is going to have any kind of a conversation with the White House knowing that the information is going to be leaked by, you know, diseased swamp rats on the inside. Listen, I think Trump tried to play a nice guy, Sean, I really do. I think he tried to hire some people that were recommended him by the swamp creatures of D.C. He brought them into the White House. They promptly turned around and screwed him over and leaked to the media. And I think now he's saying you know what, now it's time to do it the Trump way. You're all out, you're all canned, I'm bringing in my own team, you know, don't let the door hit your butt on the way out."

We just discovered Hillary fixed the primary, we discovered that in fact an investigation was concluded before they ever did an investigation. We learned that Hillary paid for Russian lies, they funneled it through a law firm. And a foreign national used his Russian sources, the Russian government sources. Then we used that dossier, everybody knew she paid for it, used as a basis for a FISA warrant and three subsequent renewal applications. We learned a lot. How much of what I just described to you is illegal?"
    },

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "A lot of it. And in addition to that, you have people who came before Congress, raised their right hand and lied. And one of those may have been the FBI Director Mr. Comey. When John Ratcliffe asked him very specifically when he made the decision about whether or not to prosecute and when that happened. He gave an answer that's inconsistent with the fact pattern that we now have. I really do believe that the two chairman of the judiciary committees, Senators Grassley and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House judiciary should go to Mr. Mueller and understand who's on his team, why is it that there appears to be all sorts of conflicts of interest, and why are you outside the lines in the bounds of the jurisdiction that you were given as a special prosecutor. And how come you're not looking at Hillary Clinton and the Clinton team and the DCCC and the DNC and what they're all doing. Why aren't they also looking at that? Because that's also in that special prosecutor letter."

I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is doing it now. But the moment those -- that subpoena that's issued goes past compliance, then they should hold them in contempt.

The Mueller investigation is entirely a smoke screen meant to cover for what was done to Donald Trump. I'm absolutely convinced. He has conflicts of interest, Sean, that haven't even come out yet that some people know about behind the scenes, Mueller, to some of the people. He is conflicted. This is a smoke screen. The Trump team was set up, I'm absolutely sure of it."

We know that Putin wanted these operatives to get a foothold in the uranium industry. We import 90 percent of our uranium, it's not like we want to give to Russia. And he's there 18 months before we approve the Uranium One deal. It never made sense, John."

And if you remember a year ago when I first came on, Sean, with Sara, when we're starting to talk about this, we talked about maybe the whole Donald Trump thing was a bread crumb trail to take us away from a different story. This may be the different story that the intelligence community was trying to take us our eye off the ball on. Here is what we know. If you were an American company and engaged in bribery and kickbacks you would be what's called the barred. You'd be prevented from doing business from the United States government, you'd be punished. It happens all the time. We see announcements every week about this. If you're Vladimir Putin's uranium company and you're involved in kickbacks, and you are involved in bribery, and you're involved in extortion, and you're involved in money laundering, but you give $500,000 to Bill Clinton and you give several million dollars to a lobbying firm that dealing with the Clintons, you know what happens to you? You get billions of new dollars and contracts from the United States government."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Let's go to this issue. We didn't know that the FBI field office in Arkansas was conducting investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Because as you follow the money, a lot of people that were involved from Canada, and elsewhere, that part of the deal, that all wanted America -- America that imports 90 percent of its uranium or thereabouts, we have a shortage of it. We didn't want it in hands of a foreign actor, Russia of all places, the hostilely regime, it is in Putin the hostile actor that he is. And in fact, as it was first reported by Peter Schweitzer, about 145 million over time kickback before and after to the Clinton Foundation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's a lot of money that flowed. Remember Bill Clinton got a $500,000 contribution. We reported that the Russians told Doug Campbell, and he confirmed this in the interview, that they routed $3 million to an American lobbying company with the intention that the money would go to support and provide free services to Bill Clinton's charitable initiative called the Clinton global initiative. Now it isn't just that the Russian set it. We found the money. We actually found an announcement by the Clinton global initiative and by the lobbying firm admitting that they were increasing their giving for this. So there is a path of money that goes from Russia into the Clinton's backyard. And yet, we're talking about a lot of other things today and not this."

    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes. His attorney, Victoria Toensing, went to the Justice Department and negotiated a deal to let him talk to Congress. And then because he's talked to Congress and his story has gotten out, we've been able to interview him. And I'll tell you something that's really important. I have a large portion of the FBI's counter intelligence file that actually shows what Doug Campbell did. His story and those facts do not match what Rod Rosenstein's prosecutors told Congress just a few months ago. They're not -- they still don't have his story right. The facts are in these files. Congress could have access to them. Somebody should take a look because we're talking about being tough on Russia. Seven years ago we gave the boat away on uranium, and we did it while knowing that the Russians were engaged in criminal activity on our soil, compromising our national security. That's what Doug Campbell's story is all about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So we know that about Russia and we also know Hillary paid for phony or a phony dossier with Russian sources by a foreign national. It seems like with no Russia collusion evidence that I've seen, maybe you've seen, John, I haven't, it seems like all fingers point back to the left and to democrats over this."

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "You know, you hear Democrats in the last few weeks saying President Trump hasn't been tough enough on Russia, we got to get tougher, they're bad actors. They're done things. But on their watch with their president, President Obama, with Secretary Clinton, we gave away some of the biggest, most valuable decisions in the uranium industry ever given to Russia. From the Cold War on we have restrictions. Barack Obama re-lifted them. George Bush suspended a thing called the nuclear cooperation agreement. Barack Obama restored it. We allowed Russia for the first time to compete for uranium fuel contracts and they got billions upon billions of dollars. And we let them have these uranium assets called Uranium One, and we did it all knowing that they were engaged in criminality."

A 20- year-old woman, North Carolina arrested after videos posted on social media showing her 1-year-old baby smoking marijuana. It shows an adult holding what appears to be a small cigar filled with marijuana to the baby's lips. The infant inhales the contents of this, and then exhales. According to Raleigh Police Department the mother is being charged with two counts of felony child abuse, inflicting serious bodily injury, plus two counts of contributing to delinquency and possession of marijuana.
