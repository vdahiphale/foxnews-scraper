And I think that the real scandal here, so much disclosed it makes it hard for the secrecy that's essential for the operation of the U.S. government in these areas to continue. I think people who have broken these tacit informal agreements and taken classified information and turned it loose are basically traitors to the country.\" He worked for the Clinton administration.  Then you have Michael Morell in the Obama administration was the acting CIA director about the Kushner story on The Washington Post. That is not a sourcing chain in which I would put a great deal of confidence. I spent a career watching the media get a significant portion of intelligence related stories wrong.

      "utterance": "Well, he is not going to deliver what they apparently want. Carter Page has made himself available to testify, and to Jonah's point, Comey himself along with John Brennan and others have said there's no evidence of collusion. And we do have to find out if our government was essentially turned into a political weapon against individuals for their political associations, whether to Trump or to associates of Trump, and tracked and perhaps ultimately an attempt to intimidate or harass. Susan Rice is not testifying. She refuses to testify before Congress. She has been asked to do. Jared Kushner has said he would make himself available to anyone who wants to talk to him. That's interesting. Why won't Susan Rice talk?"

      "utterance": "Hillary Clinton is obviously convinced of the linkage, the collusion, even though there's not evidence that we've seen. She talked about it at length today about the linkage, and she believes the Trump campaign is there. Here are former Clinton CIA director and former Obama CIA director James Woolsey, \"There are a lot of things I've seen I think have been disclosed too much. And I think that the real scandal here, so much disclosed it makes it hard for the secrecy that's essential for the operation of the U.S. government in these areas to continue. I think people who have broken these tacit informal agreements and taken classified information and turned it loose are basically traitors to the country.\" He worked for the Clinton administration. Then you have Michael Morell in the Obama administration was the acting CIA director about the Kushner story on The Washington Post. That is not a sourcing chain in which I would put a great deal of confidence. I spent a career watching the media get a significant portion of intelligence related stories wrong. So the bottom line, we should all be very careful in saying what is a fact on which to base analysis here. The real facts may be different.\" Just a perspective of two former Democratic CIA directors."

      "utterance": "\"Democratic,\" that is the keyword. These are not partisans. They are not Trump-ites by any means, and what they are speaking for is the institutions, and they are basically saying you might have a romantic notion being a Deep Throat and uncovering some terrible scandal as in Watergate, but if you treat the oath to maintain the secrets that cavalierly, you are undermining the national security of the United States. You better be sure this is a great crime that you are leaking about. Anything less than that, you are really betraying your country. So I would take what they say rather seriously and not romanticize people who are leaking this information."
