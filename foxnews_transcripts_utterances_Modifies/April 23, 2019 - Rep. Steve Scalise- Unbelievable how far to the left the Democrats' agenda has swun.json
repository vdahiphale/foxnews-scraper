Plus the shocking difference in response to the terror we saw in Sri Lanka versus that in say, New Zealand, Dinesh D'Souza is here with this and you'd want to hear what he has to say.  And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says the broken VA health care system is just fine, doesn't need fixing. We'll ask an army veteran for her response.  But first a new issue, the 20/20 Dems have become radicalized over who can vote; a terrorist, a child rapist, a murderer, all of them according to the Democratic frontrunner.",

This went on for five hours. They didn't even ask a question about it. Here now on the difference in the American political reaction to this attack versus New Zealand, for instance, is conservative commentator and documentarian, Dinesh D'Souza.

And this sort of attack of radical Muslims against Christians has been occurring all over the world. We've seen it in the Middle East, we've seen it in North Africa, we've seen it in Asia, so it's part of a systematic pattern of targeting. And yet this notion of Christians as victims and Muslims as perpetrators disrupts the progressive narrative, if you will. And so not just the Democrats, but also the media Left has been remarkably quiet about the Sri Lanka attacks in comparison to the New Zealand attack. The New Zealand attack, of course, fit the narrative. You had a mosque that was the target, so Muslims become the victims. You had a white supremacist who was the perpetrator, so they were all over that. And they were not only focusing on the attack, but they were focusing on the motivation of the attacker, and they were trying to link the white supremacists to white supremacy all over the world. Even Trump's name was brought into it, even though the perpetrator in that case was really clear that he hated President Trump. So what you see is a massive disparity of the way that these two incidents have been treated it's kind of a window into the way I think in which news gets distorted and tragedies get in a way played for political game.",

And so it's not just that they wouldn't use the word Christian, it's that in the New Zealand attack there was a tremendous quest for the motivation of the attacker. Why'd he do it? Answer, he's a white supremacist. Therefore, white supremacy is a global problem that needs our urgent attention. Now in this case the motivation is, if anything even more clear, this is ISIS. These are radical Muslims who are doing this in the name of Islam and targeting - religious targeting of Christians, and yet, no discussion of motivation.

And these are problems that have existed for generations. And this appears to be the first administration who has said we are no longer willing to kick the can down the road. Jason, you would remember because you were in Congress during this time, but in 2014, we had an innumerable number of V.A. scandals break. We talked about the egregious wait times that veterans were being submitted to. Veteran go in with relatively minor issues, and because of the extended wait time, there minor problems turned into life-threatening issues. And under this of administration, President Trump has been very focused on reducing those wait times. It's a very real problem. So for someone to say, it is not broke, don't fix that, I would be surprised if she's ever even stepped in a V.A. facility.",

It's saying, we got to get rid of the electoral college, so that small states like where I come from and you come from, have really no say-so in presidential campaigns. And remember, up to 25 percent of the people in prisons are here in this country illegally, we forget that piece. They just going to be able to vote as well. We know the next step in all this is that, if you're in America for a certain number of years you're not here legally, heck let's let them vote too, we've given them a driver's license.

The problem with what the Democrats are doing in too many cases is what they're trying to do is make us feel bad from our racial perspective in order to let people vote, who actually shouldn't vote. It's not - the reason why people in prison should vote has nothing to do with race or shouldn't vote has nothing you with race.

Carter Page wasn't charged. He was never going to be charged. The idea that he was a Russian agent was a joke.

The idea that this application said at the very top, according to John Berkeley, verified. How is that going to play and how are the courts, the Department of Justice going to be able to justify this when we find out that this dossier was such a fake piece of garbage?"

But as you point out, what this also is going to be the start of is an investigation of the FBI and the Justice Department officials who use the Steele Dossier to, I think, plausibly mislead the FISA Court. And if that happened, they would have committed a violation of federal law. They would have misused the federal government surveillance powers. And those are things that should be investigated because people are going to be - should be held accountable and responsible if they were misusing these powers to spy on an ongoing presidential campaign, which is the whole reason FISA was passed in the first place was to prevent that from ever happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Because when you go to the FISA Court there's only one side that's presented, that is the Department of Justice. There is no solicitor or somebody else that's arguing the other side of this. The Judge in this particular case is actually looking to the Department of Justice to provide them, what they says at the top of the document that we've now learned from John Ratcliffe as verified. So you have the Inspector General who's supposedly going to conclude in the May-June timeframe. You also have John Huber, we're not quite sure as the U.S. Attorney in Utah, what he may or may not be doing. But I'm not aware of any precedence here about how the Court is going to deal with the potential - potential that they were lied to and given a document that truly was not verified."
    },

      "speaker": "YOO",

I am absolutely shocked that people at Justice, people FBI would rely on something so flimsy as a Steele Dossier, which as you pointed, has been completely repudiated now by the Mueller report. So what can happen? As you point out, the Justice Department could conduct ultimately criminal investigations. And if you're the FISA Court, unfortunately, the way they can retaliate is to stop granting anymore FISA warrants or to ask for - they can ask for also there to be an investigation and prosecution of the agents or even the high-ranking intelligence agency officials in the Obama administration who approved these warrants and this surveillance. They could ask Mr. Barr - Attorney General Barr to open an investigation of those previous officials. I think that we're the only the very beginnings - we're only seeing the very beginnings of what this investigation will start to show."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

If you didn't have the dossier, we wouldn't have been able to go and spy on the Trump administration\". And I think one of the big question, John, is going to be when did Mr. Mueller know that there was a bogus document presented to the FISA Court and when did he know that there was actually no collusion, because he took an awful long time to investigate this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "I agree with you, Jason. I think actually it seems to me Mr. Mueller knew pretty early on that there was no real evidence of any collusion. And so the question that I think a lot of people, including me and other people are asking is, well why continue the investigation, why not just end it early? Why even have volume to the Mueller Report, which is all about obstruction. Those are all crimes that have to do - if they happened, they have to do with the investigation itself, not with any underlying substantive crime like conspiracy. And also let me add it's not collusion, its conspiracy to violate federal law."

The death toll has now risen to more than 320 people with another 500 people injured. Despite this terror attack being among the worst since 9/11, in fact I can't think of one that's been worse since 9/11, not a single Democratic presidential candidate brought it up at last night's town halls and not a single CNN Anchor asked a question about it. This went on for five hours. They didn't even ask a question about it. Here now on the difference in the American political reaction to this attack versus New Zealand, for instance, is conservative commentator and documentarian, Dinesh D'Souza. Dinesh, thank you so much for joining us here. You've looked at this issue, the difference between the two. Both terrorist attacks, but treated very differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, the Sri Lanka attack - the attack on multiple churches with now hundreds of victims, was an attack in which you have Christians as the targets or the victims and radical Muslims as the perpetrators. And this sort of attack of radical Muslims against Christians has been occurring all over the world. We've seen it in the Middle East, we've seen it in North Africa, we've seen it in Asia, so it's part of a systematic pattern of targeting. And yet this notion of Christians as victims and Muslims as perpetrators disrupts the progressive narrative, if you will. And so not just the Democrats, but also the media Left has been remarkably quiet about the Sri Lanka attacks in comparison to the New Zealand attack. The New Zealand attack, of course, fit the narrative. You had a mosque that was the target, so Muslims become the victims. You had a white supremacist who was the perpetrator, so they were all over that. And they were not only focusing on the attack, but they were focusing on the motivation of the attacker, and they were trying to link the white supremacists to white supremacy all over the world. Even Trump's name was brought into it, even though the perpetrator in that case was really clear that he hated President Trump. So what you see is a massive disparity of the way that these two incidents have been treated it's kind of a window into the way I think in which news gets distorted and tragedies get in a way played for political game."

The Left-wing narrative is that, in this country at least, Christians are the bad guys and the poor Muslims are the victims of terrorist targeting. And so it's not just that they wouldn't use the word Christian, it's that in the New Zealand attack there was a tremendous quest for the motivation of the attacker. Why'd he do it? Answer, he's a white supremacist. Therefore, white supremacy is a global problem that needs our urgent attention. Now in this case the motivation is, if anything even more clear, this is ISIS. These are radical Muslims who are doing this in the name of Islam and targeting - religious targeting of Christians, and yet, no discussion of motivation. In fact, the ones who talk about motivation basically say, \"Listen, we should not make the mistake of equating the people who do these things with Muslims in general\"."

Although, the suit does say the attack was a hoax, conceived and directed by Jussie Smollett, right down to the use of a noose, bleach and shouts that \"This is MAGA Country\" from the attackers. The lawsuit is directed at his high-powered legal team Mark Geragos and Tina Glandien. They claimed after charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett, Geragos and Glandien did the rounds on news programs and podcasts. Lawyers for the Osundairo brothers, say Geragos and Glandien repeatedly made false, reprehensible and damaging statements. The brothers claimed the reputation and personal training business were damaged. They also suffered emotional distress. Today attorney Gloria Schmidt said the two wannabe actors followed the direction of a successful actor and now they want to clear their names."

      "utterance": "It's a free country, but anybody who challenges Donald Trump has to know, we've got one of the best economies we've seen in generations. When there are more job openings then people looking for work, when regulations are finally under control, where you can do business in America again, where we are seeing true opportunities for people, and the president fighting both here and abroad, giving our troops a pay raise, first one they've had in years, and standing up for America, again trying to secure the border, President Trump has a great story to tell. And anyone that wants to run against him, he's ready for the fight. He's a tough guy. But in the end, I think it the American people want to keep it going."

Within five days of his suicide, another two military vets took their lives at V.A. facilities, and there are hosts of other stories, untold stories, just like that. The agency is plagued with problems, systemic neglect, secret wait lists, and veterans even dying waiting to see a doctor. But don't worry, AOC says everything is A-OK."

      "speaker": "BARNETTE",
      "utterance": "My first reaction when I heard that it is that AOC is the perfect example of why parents should say no to their children often, otherwise they go up to think everything they say is ingenious. You've already mentioned some of my initial thoughts, Jason. Twenty veterans commit suicide every single day. That is a problem. And as you mentioned earlier, three veterans earlier just this month walked into a V.A. facility and committed suicide right there in the waiting room. That is a problem. And these are problems that have existed for generations. And this appears to be the first administration who has said we are no longer willing to kick the can down the road. Jason, you would remember because you were in Congress during this time, but in 2014, we had an innumerable number of V.A. scandals break. We talked about the egregious wait times that veterans were being submitted to. Veteran go in with relatively minor issues, and because of the extended wait time, there minor problems turned into life-threatening issues. And under this of administration, President Trump has been very focused on reducing those wait times. It's a very real problem. So for someone to say, it is not broke, don't fix that, I would be surprised if she's ever even stepped in a V.A. facility."

      "utterance": "You know what, out of those 20 veterans who commit suicide every day, 14 have never even been in a V.A. facility. President Trump just signed into law a prevents program that will go out and reach out to those vulnerable veterans. They need to know there are resources, and they need to go to the nearest veterans' facility."
