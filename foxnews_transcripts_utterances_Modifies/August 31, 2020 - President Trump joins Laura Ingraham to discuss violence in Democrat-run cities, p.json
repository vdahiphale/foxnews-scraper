      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Well, well, well, it took the polls tightening in key states to jolt Joe Biden out of his basement today. He traveled to Pittsburgh in an attempt to stop the political bleeding from all the actual bleeding happening in blue cities like Portland and Kenosha. And after three months of essentially his indifference, Biden called for an end to the violence. And he attempted to rebuff President Trump's criticism that he tolerated the riots as long as he thought they were helping him politically.",

Can you trust Joe Biden to do what it takes to stop rioters and looters? I don't think any blue-state elected officials look, really want to see their cities destroyed by riots and looting, but many of them have proven themselves to be totally weak willed. And the hard left has taken advantage of that impotence to do enormous damage. So the question you have to ask yourself is this. When the rioters come for your town, and they're coming, will Biden and his team do enough to stop them? And the answer is clearly no. Look at Seattle, look at Portland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, D.C., Chicago, and of course, New York. Time and again, Democrats have had the chance to stop the riots and they have consistently failed.  Now remember, we don't want a president who's going to feel sorry for us and then who'll quote scripture at us after our businesses and our neighborhoods have burned down. We need a leader who'll stop the riots before they happen. And Joe Biden is not that leader. For now, the riots have been limited to the blue states. But with Biden in charge, the whole country is going to look like Portland. Now, we were lucky enough to sit down with President Trump for an exclusive interview earlier today. Here's part one of that interview, which will comprise our entire hour tonight. So, enjoy.",

If he didn't have security with him - he had five security guards - he would have been dead, just like they would have done to Rand Paul, who's a great guy, and his wife, Kelley. It is a disgrace when you look at happening. Now, we sent in Homeland Security. The reason we sent them in was to protect our courthouse. We have a $300 million courthouse, and they wanted to blow up our courthouse or burn it down. Take your choice, blow it up or burn it down, they said. And I said, no, no, that's not happening. So they wouldn't protect it because the Mayor said - he doesn't care. So we sent in our Homeland people. They did a great job. Immediately - Homeland Security. Immediately, it was protected. And that's the only reason they were there. I've offered to send in the National Guard. I've offered to send in anybody they want. I could put that out in 45 minutes and it would stop. And I think the people of Portland and the people of Oregon, I know it's a liberal state, considerate liberate, they're tired of it. They are tired of having - of living with this curse.

      "utterance": "With all due respect, that's not the relevant question because it doesn't really matter what's in Biden's heart. What matters is this. Can you trust Joe Biden to do what it takes to stop rioters and looters? I don't think any blue-state elected officials look, really want to see their cities destroyed by riots and looting, but many of them have proven themselves to be totally weak willed. And the hard left has taken advantage of that impotence to do enormous damage. So the question you have to ask yourself is this. When the rioters come for your town, and they're coming, will Biden and his team do enough to stop them? And the answer is clearly no. Look at Seattle, look at Portland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, D.C., Chicago, and of course, New York. Time and again, Democrats have had the chance to stop the riots and they have consistently failed. Now remember, we don't want a president who's going to feel sorry for us and then who'll quote scripture at us after our businesses and our neighborhoods have burned down. We need a leader who'll stop the riots before they happen. And Joe Biden is not that leader. For now, the riots have been limited to the blue states. But with Biden in charge, the whole country is going to look like Portland. Now, we were lucky enough to sit down with President Trump for an exclusive interview earlier today. Here's part one of that interview, which will comprise our entire hour tonight. So, enjoy."

And he went to a protest, and he went in and they almost killed him. If he didn't have security with him - he had five security guards - he would have been dead, just like they would have done to Rand Paul, who's a great guy, and his wife, Kelley. It is a disgrace when you look at happening. Now, we sent in Homeland Security. The reason we sent them in was to protect our courthouse. We have a $300 million courthouse, and they wanted to blow up our courthouse or burn it down. Take your choice, blow it up or burn it down, they said. And I said, no, no, that's not happening. So they wouldn't protect it because the Mayor said - he doesn't care. So we sent in our Homeland people. They did a great job. Immediately - Homeland Security. Immediately, it was protected. And that's the only reason they were there. I've offered to send in the National Guard. I've offered to send in anybody they want. I could put that out in 45 minutes and it would stop. And I think the people of Portland and the people of Oregon, I know it's a liberal state, considerate liberate, they're tired of it. They are tired of having - of living with this curse. They're living with a curse. They say that when you walk through the streets of Portland, this is years and years of burning and it's--"

They had them standing there, and they talked about how it was a show of great unity, the Mayor standing with the people. Those people were going to kill him. They were saying things that I can't repeat right now, but horrible things. But they didn't put that on. I actually happened to see the real tape on Fox. He escaped with his life. And yet he doesn't want any help. It's so unfair to the people of Oregon. We could solve that problem quickly, like I did in Kenosha. You know Kenosha went through three or four days of - you wouldn't have a Kenosha right now. We demanded that they send in the National Guard, call the Governor. And in all fairness, the Governor did it. Not enough, but it was enough to put it out, and we ultimately put in more. We had a thousand people, and we put it out quickly.

We worked through the governors. The governors have gotten everything they wanted, every ventilator. We didn't have ventilators -- we had empty cupboards when I got there. As I said, the cupboards were bare. I think they're going crazy over the election. I think they're seeing what's happening. Joe Biden now today goes to Pittsburgh, right? So he goes to Pittsburgh. He wasn't scheduled to leave ever. Then he said he's going to leave three or four days ago because his polls are going like this, right?"

That's to me, the most -- and we just did the convalescent plasma. I think -- and you have other things, too.

If they said -- so that means that if some doctor said we have to shut it down, we're going to shut it down. We're setting records. By the way, the stock market is at an all-time record right now. You look at what's going on in the stock market, look at what's going on. We are going to have a phenomenal year next year. We're going to have a great third quarter.

Also his thoughts on Bill Barr and what we might expect from various investigations before the election. You're not going to want to miss it. That's all the time we have tonight.
