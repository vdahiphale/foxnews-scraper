Every time the Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.   So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically isolate Russia.

Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean War, which is still going on.

He sees these negotiations as we're (ph) buying time. That's what they've done in the past.   So, I'd cut them off at the pass there. I would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action.  Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear program. Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes, there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program. They'll sell anything they'll build as to their history.

There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around Syria. We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.  If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran would dominate Syria.  It'd be the single worst decision the president could make.

One of the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former Russian agent in the United Kingdom. So, this is the `80s to me all over. I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did. Every time the Russians tried to advance their military technology, we one-up to them. Every time the Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back. So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically isolate Russia. I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia."

He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. I think the problem is that Russia is running wild. Whatever we're doing is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly. So, again, economic isolation of Russia. They're an oil and gas economy. They couldn't survive very long without customers. So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia.

Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing. The reason that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world is beginning to follow, has paid off. They're coming to the table because it has hurt so much. And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant he is. Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean War, which is still going on. But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as national security adviser. He's a very -- he has a very healthy skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea."

His big fear is that they're just buying time. They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear weapon on top that can hit America. He sees these negotiations as we're (ph) buying time. That's what they've done in the past. So, I'd cut them off at the pass there. I would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action."

      "utterance": "Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald Reagan playbook. When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook. This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out. This is a disaster in the making. All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the hands of ISIL. There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around Syria. We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region. If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran would dominate Syria. It'd be the single worst decision the president could make. I've seen this movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes. We got ISIL on the ropes. If you want to let them off the ropes, remove American soldiers."

The jury is still out regarding Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel."

The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget of $186 billion. Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral Jackson is going to have being confirmed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death decisions on the battlefield. He's committed medical personnel on the battlefield. He's been in the middle of this war. I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in Charleston and he had no idea this was coming. I had no idea it was coming. But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he said to me something that was very satisfying. Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down. Somebody needs to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get basic health care. I want competition for the veterans' health care. I want the V.A. to stay in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap. And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into the V.A. He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield. He knows what the fight is all about."

Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself. They believe it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large-scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world. They've gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for Russian defectors living inside their borders. It's a horrifying set of circumstances."

If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want to have more power in the Middle East. So, we are hearing from commanders on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means whether it's months or years. This would be a mistake and I think Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing the president in a different direction."

And I do think it's important that the president meets with the leader of North Korea. I think that will be productive. I don't think you should let off the gas at all.

He's now saying to South Korea or demanding that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for this negotiation with Kim Jong-un. And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North Korea. The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I can extract from South Korea."

I don't want California to miss out on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The -- the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years after a person answers the census.

Those are the words of the Constitution. Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution, to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is palpable. Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment.

And I would say that what's happening on this very show the Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum.

But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released into the streets.

And that's how, most importantly, Americans and people living in the country are seeing it. So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country, not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump administration might do with that information."

In that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision."

The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and it is a good thing to the postal service. If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the post office. So it is a good thing.

But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both -- both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states would get to make this determination. So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before, and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of decisions. A very conservative viewpoint."

    {
      "speaker": "LUCEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now, they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns The Post deeply frustrating. Now, The Post has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions. But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by news coverage."

And we see it particularly with Facebook and the role that they played with the -- with the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica and turning over information. What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically talking about Bezos using The Washington Post to lobby for his interests here in D.C.?"

      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he has, whether it's with The Washington Post, and Jeff Bezos. This is sort of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right? But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly, hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how -- should and how -- should we and how should we regulate Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is frustrating to a lot of people."

And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box retailers in the street."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal service. But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online retail."
