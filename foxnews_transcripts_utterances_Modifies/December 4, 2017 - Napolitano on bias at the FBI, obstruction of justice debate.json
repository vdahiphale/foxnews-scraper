We are now learning that the man that was removed from the FBI investigation for anti-Trump bias was the same person who conducted Michael Flynn's questioning. He is also the person, Peter Strzok, who changed the language in Director Comey's famous statement about Hillary Clinton's classified emails from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extremely careless.\" And that all lead to the closing of the case against her. So, let's back up for a moment. The president claimed today that the same FBI that went easy on Hillary Clinton in his estimation unjustly went after Michael Flynn for just doing his job.",

FBI Agent Peter Strzok weighed in on this July 2016 statement where Comey recommended against criminal charges for Clinton's mishandling of classified information. We confirmed late today that Agent Strzok changed Comey's earlier draft about Clinton's email and her of an unsecured personal server exclusively for government business from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extremely careless.\" This is a key change because gross negligence is the standard under the federal statute 18-USC-793F. The FBI agent was removed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last summer for sending an anti-Trump text to his lover and FBI lawyer. That matter is now under investigation.",

There was Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus had sort of put that in question for a short time moments ago, which would've been very dramatic, but we can tell you that now it has moved to the conference. So, the tax form process will continue to proceed as planned.   So, back to the other topic in terms of the FBI and the judgment about whether or not the Trump administration is being fairly treated here. Growing questions tonight about the Obama administration's role in all of this in the early stages and how the outgoing administration's fixation on Russian collusion and more specifically the Logan Act, may have led us to where we are today. Byron York laid out very nicely in a new op-ed today for the Washington Examiner, \"When it finally came time to charge Flynn with a crime,\" he writes, \"did prosecutors, armed with the transcripts of those Flynn-Kislyak conversations, choose to charge him with violating the Logan Act. Of course not. But for the Obama team, the law had already served its purpose. To entangle the new administration in a criminal investigation as soon as it walked in the door of the White House.\"  Here with more on that, Byron York, Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner; and Radio Talk Show Host, Tammy Bruce, both are Fox News Contributors and a great guest on this show. Good to have you guys both here tonight. Byron, so you basically claim that they took this, you know, a 200-year-old act that's never been prosecuted, but they used it as a basis to listen in on conversations, to get transcripts of conversations and to encircle the administration and enmeshed them in this as they walked in the door as you say.",

      "sentences": "Well, they used it as a basis to interrogate Michael Flynn on that January 24th interview that the judge was just talking about. If you go back and looked through the campaign, a number of Democrats were raising the question of whether Donald Trump or his campaign aides had violated the Logan Act, beginning, I believe, in July of 2016, when Trump was at the Republican Convention. And remember he said, hey, Russia, if you've got those 30,000 Hillary emails, let's see them. Well, that's when the accusation started. And then, they continued through the fall and there were Democrats who called for hearings on the Logan Act and the Trump campaign. They called for the justice department to investigate, and what we now know is inside the Obama Justice Department there was a lot of concern that Trump might have violated the Logan Act, and indeed the possibility of a Logan Act violation was one of the considerations they had in mind when they sent those FBI agents, apparently, including Agent Strzok, to the White House to interview Michael Flynn.",

So, they follow that to Michael Flynn, and Michael Flynn it turns out has had a number of conversations with Sergey Kislyak that he didn't disclose.   So, that gives them more reason to, you know, keep digging along these lines. But what they found was that Michael Flynn had been having discussions with Sergey Kislyak during the transition -- not before -- to begin that process of starting to have an administration that's talking to the Russians. Is there anything wrong with the content of the conversations that he had with ambassador based on your take on it?",

Is that you've got to have an administration that's coming in, that can be ready on the ground running in an environment where, keep in mind, the sanctions that Obama implemented were at the end of December. They were meant to hamstring him. They were meant to present a problem when you've got ISIS in the Middle East, Russia in the Middle East. You've got North Korea doing its thing. So, here you've got a situation where he's being set up effectively. So, there's look, argue -- you could argue that the arguments about to ask the Russians to not react or to not take action because of the sanctions was helpful to the Obama administration so that things could continue to go smoothly, not just helpful for Trump, but helpful for Obama as well. Less travel around the world. So, this is why I think you've got -- and the judge made a very good point, what was the point of that original interview if not, in fact, because you wanted to get him onto something which speaks to the idea of an agenda? And I think also when we think about the collusion dynamic, at about that same time in the summer, a little bit earlier perhaps, is when the DNC took over the Fusion GPS dossier. Creating effectively, then -- you could argue, they needed the basis with which then to try to get this unmasking for General Flynn. So, you see this pattern very early with an agenda.",

But there's a reason why Andrew Jackson is hanging up in the oval office. There's a lot of similarities with this president. There's a reason why Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, FDR and Ronald Reagan loved Andrew Jackson. And they were kind enough at Fox News to say let's do a special on it. And I had no idea that we'd be doing a special on somebody whose statue we might take down. And as a general, as I talk about in the book, if he doesn't protect New Orleans, New Orleans goes down, the British don't leave for another 50 years. And in New Orleans, we actually go to the statue where people are organizing to take it down because of -- Andrew Jackson didn't have the perfect life. So, Robert E.

We are now learning that the man that was removed from the FBI investigation for anti-Trump bias was the same person who conducted Michael Flynn's questioning. He is also the person, Peter Strzok, who changed the language in Director Comey's famous statement about Hillary Clinton's classified emails from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extremely careless.\" And that all lead to the closing of the case against her. So, let's back up for a moment. The president claimed today that the same FBI that went easy on Hillary Clinton in his estimation unjustly went after Michael Flynn for just doing his job."

Was the Obama DOJ and the James Comey FBI just doing their jobs, or did they go beyond their stated mission of gathering evidence and letting it be weighed by the scales of justice? It's a simple question, but the answer is complicated. It's one the American people deserve an answer to because we all know there's a lot at stake here. Judge Andrew Napolitano, Byron York, and Tammy Bruce all join me in just a moment but first Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge, breaking news on this story throughout the course of the day has the latest as we nail it all down tonight.

Within the last hour, Fox News obtaining this April 2016 memo from Attorney General Loretta Lynch to all department employees advising them that during an election, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators. And tonight, key decision-makers from Lynch to FBI Director Comey and a member of his inner circle are under new scrutiny. FBI Agent Peter Strzok weighed in on this July 2016 statement where Comey recommended against criminal charges for Clinton's mishandling of classified information. We confirmed late today that Agent Strzok changed Comey's earlier draft about Clinton's email and her of an unsecured personal server exclusively for government business from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extremely careless.\" This is a key change because gross negligence is the standard under the federal statute 18-USC-793F. The FBI agent was removed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last summer for sending an anti-Trump text to his lover and FBI lawyer. That matter is now under investigation."

House Intelligence Committee was promised one of the dossier's handlers to testify behind closed doors this week, but it was postponed late today with McCabe citing a scheduling conflict. Martha."

I just want to mention before we go to this topic that there is a lot going on in the House right now. There's the suggestion or, you know, the numbers are pointing the direction that could mean that the House will not go to conference on this tax bill, which means that there's the potential for this tax bill, which has been carefully shepherded through the House, and now the Senate, may not go to conference. It's a very big deal, and I assure you that we're on top of it. We're going to get you the breaking news as that comes in. But the judge, to this story which was the other big, big story today, your thoughts on that development?"

Show me an FBI agent that does not have a political opinion, I'll show you a dope. They all have political opinions, and under the law, they're entitled to them. But if the political opinion clouds and investigation or unduly animates an investigation, that person should not be in that investigation -- and that's apparently what happened here. So, we have two FBI Directors, Jim Comey has no problem with Agent Strzok's political views; Bob Mueller learns of the political views, wants him off the case."

And that's what the president is saying here. The president is saying, look, I looked at what happened to Hillary Clinton, and he's almost making the case that the FBI doesn't have credibility. He's saying, look at my case, look at what we're going through and I'm demonstrating to you that their credibility is on the line because of the way they handled a similar case, they can't be trusted."

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Correct. General Flynn was not under oath. But at the time the FBI interrogated General Flynn, it's January 24th. Donald Trump's been in office for four days. At the time the FBI interrogated General Flynn, they had a transcript of all five of his conversations with Ambassador Kislyak. Question: why were they interrogating him? They already knew he had the conversations. They already knew what he said to the ambassador and what the ambassador said to him. Unless, the purpose of that interrogation was to trap the general. If that was the purpose, it succeeded. It is clear he did lie. And he admitted on Friday under oath in a federal courtroom that he lied. So, he stuck with that, the FBI is stuck with it. Unfortunately, President Trump is stuck with it as well."

So, if Donald Trump did say to James Comey layoff of Mike Flynn and the purpose was Flynn has suffered enough, not a corrupt purpose. The purpose was the FBI has got more important things to do, and it catches terrorism, bank robbers, not a corrupt purpose. But if the purpose was to prevent General Flynn from telling the FBI something about him, the president, or people around him, that's a corrupt purpose. Can the president be indicted? Never happened before. There's nothing too prohibited. Obstruction of justice can form the basis of impeachment, almost universally in the legal community, yes."

It passed, so it will go to Congress. OK. All right. They're breathing a big sigh of relief on the GOP side of Congress tonight. The House of Representatives will go to conference. There was Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus had sort of put that in question for a short time moments ago, which would've been very dramatic, but we can tell you that now it has moved to the conference. So, the tax form process will continue to proceed as planned. So, back to the other topic in terms of the FBI and the judgment about whether or not the Trump administration is being fairly treated here. Growing questions tonight about the Obama administration's role in all of this in the early stages and how the outgoing administration's fixation on Russian collusion and more specifically the Logan Act, may have led us to where we are today. Byron York laid out very nicely in a new op-ed today for the Washington Examiner, \"When it finally came time to charge Flynn with a crime,\" he writes, \"did prosecutors, armed with the transcripts of those Flynn-Kislyak conversations, choose to charge him with violating the Logan Act. Of course not. But for the Obama team, the law had already served its purpose. To entangle the new administration in a criminal investigation as soon as it walked in the door of the White House.\" Here with more on that, Byron York, Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner; and Radio Talk Show Host, Tammy Bruce, both are Fox News Contributors and a great guest on this show. Good to have you guys both here tonight. Byron, so you basically claim that they took this, you know, a 200-year-old act that's never been prosecuted, but they used it as a basis to listen in on conversations, to get transcripts of conversations and to encircle the administration and enmeshed them in this as they walked in the door as you say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, they used it as a basis to interrogate Michael Flynn on that January 24th interview that the judge was just talking about. If you go back and looked through the campaign, a number of Democrats were raising the question of whether Donald Trump or his campaign aides had violated the Logan Act, beginning, I believe, in July of 2016, when Trump was at the Republican Convention. And remember he said, hey, Russia, if you've got those 30,000 Hillary emails, let's see them. Well, that's when the accusation started. And then, they continued through the fall and there were Democrats who called for hearings on the Logan Act and the Trump campaign. They called for the justice department to investigate, and what we now know is inside the Obama Justice Department there was a lot of concern that Trump might have violated the Logan Act, and indeed the possibility of a Logan Act violation was one of the considerations they had in mind when they sent those FBI agents, apparently, including Agent Strzok, to the White House to interview Michael Flynn."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting, because you kind of follow string along here, Tammy. The original concern was that there was Russian meddling in the election and that perhaps the Trump campaign had been in on it, that they were colluding as part of it. So, they follow that to Michael Flynn, and Michael Flynn it turns out has had a number of conversations with Sergey Kislyak that he didn't disclose. So, that gives them more reason to, you know, keep digging along these lines. But what they found was that Michael Flynn had been having discussions with Sergey Kislyak during the transition -- not before -- to begin that process of starting to have an administration that's talking to the Russians. Is there anything wrong with the content of the conversations that he had with ambassador based on your take on it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, this is -- I think that it's clear there's a reason why it's called a transition. Is that you've got to have an administration that's coming in, that can be ready on the ground running in an environment where, keep in mind, the sanctions that Obama implemented were at the end of December. They were meant to hamstring him. They were meant to present a problem when you've got ISIS in the Middle East, Russia in the Middle East. You've got North Korea doing its thing. So, here you've got a situation where he's being set up effectively. So, there's look, argue -- you could argue that the arguments about to ask the Russians to not react or to not take action because of the sanctions was helpful to the Obama administration so that things could continue to go smoothly, not just helpful for Trump, but helpful for Obama as well. Less travel around the world. So, this is why I think you've got -- and the judge made a very good point, what was the point of that original interview if not, in fact, because you wanted to get him onto something which speaks to the idea of an agenda? And I think also when we think about the collusion dynamic, at about that same time in the summer, a little bit earlier perhaps, is when the DNC took over the Fusion GPS dossier. Creating effectively, then -- you could argue, they needed the basis with which then to try to get this unmasking for General Flynn. So, you see this pattern very early with an agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Byron, really quickly, you know, it just raises the question of why Michael Flynn denied it, right? I mean, that sort of the thing that's the hardest to figure out. If he had said -- you know, first of all, if they had presented him with a transcript, you know, he would have said, yes, that's me, I had that conversation, in fact, it was part of my job. I was told to reach out to establish relationships and start talking about the future, whether or not we would uphold these sanctions. But he said no; he said I didn't meet with him and that was the beginning of his problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, that is the mystery, because, you know, he had been head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he should know that Sergey Kislyak was likely being wiretapped. And if he's talking to Kislyak then he's being wiretapped."

The prosecutor's handling of this case.

Just got off the phone with President Trump, who offered his full support and says that he needs a fighter to help him in the senate. I look forward to fighting alongside the president. #MAGA. Joining me now, Brian Kilmeade, who's been up for a long time, co-host of Fox & Friends, and Jessica Tarlov, author of America in the age of Trump, and a Fox News contributor. Welcome to both of you. So good decision on his part? BRIAN KILMEADE, \"FOX & FRIENDS\" CO-HOST: I don't think it was necessary. I mean, the guy is up by six points. He never backed to begin with. He didn't vacuum immediately. He was going to passively back him. I thought that was moving ahead. And now he just says, you know what, I fully back in. I think Roy Moore is a questionable candidate to say the least. As we've walked out here the Washington Post has another story of a 17-year- old with handwriting and campy graduation. I just think that Donald Trump actually had a pass on this one. I want the other guy. I wanted Luther Strange.

Look at his pro-choice policy, all these things that Republicans abhor without having to say, hey, the alleged child molester, he's my guy. And I think also the Billy Bush op-ed in the New York Times really set him off. I think that he either read that last night or this morning where Billy Bush doesn't mince any words. He said I heard him on the tape. There were eight other guys that were on the tape. And what Billy Bush did that was so smart is he connected the thinks that President Trump said on that tape to the accounts of the 16 women who have accused him of sexual assault. He said, oh, that's where it's the grab her by the -- that's where you can just kiss them. And I think that really frustrated him and he's riding high on the GOP tax bill.

You know there's a war in history in this country. The book that I have out now is the battle of New Orleans, made by the most famous man in the country. But there's a reason why Andrew Jackson is hanging up in the oval office. There's a lot of similarities with this president. There's a reason why Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, FDR and Ronald Reagan loved Andrew Jackson. And they were kind enough at Fox News to say let's do a special on it. And I had no idea that we'd be doing a special on somebody whose statue we might take down. And as a general, as I talk about in the book, if he doesn't protect New Orleans, New Orleans goes down, the British don't leave for another 50 years. And in New Orleans, we actually go to the statue where people are organizing to take it down because of -- Andrew Jackson didn't have the perfect life. So, Robert E.

If the president was instructing Flynn before the election, you know, during the period where the Russians were trying to meddle with the elections, it goes to the issue of potential collusion. It also would bring up the Logan Act, which would mean that a private citizen was interacting with a foreign government on behalf of a future president.

But there was never any evidence presented, including several surveillance videos that showed any indication that police gave Freddie Gray a so-called rough ride. And a second suspect who rode in a separate part of the van initially told investigators he heard banging and believe the person on the other side was trying to injure himself, though he later retracted that statement.
