But he will be breaking his pre-Hogmanay observances to make an appearance on the show later, so stay tuned for that. But first, a new warning from President Trump. As the government shutdown enters its second week, Trump refuses to give an inch in his fight for a Border wall.  And today, he warned on Twitter, \"We will be forced to close the Southern border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and President who would approve.\"  The Office of Management and Budget Director, and the incoming White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Fox this morning that the President is ready to negotiate an end to the shutdown but the Democrats are nowhere to be found.",

As the government shutdown enters its second week, Trump refuses to give an inch in his fight for a Border wall. And today, he warned on Twitter, \"We will be forced to close the Southern border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and President who would approve.\" The Office of Management and Budget Director, and the incoming White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Fox this morning that the President is ready to negotiate an end to the shutdown but the Democrats are nowhere to be found."

The CBP Commissioner has said, in the two separate tragedies, agents did all they could to help the eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl as soon as they became aware they were sick.

This is -- this is the choice. You -- you want people like this to come to your society. He comes here from Fiji. He assimilates with the community.

Because of her warning, they're now roaming free across State of California. As you know, California is now a -- in a legal sanctuary state as well, which means that our federal or our law enforcement can't cooperate with Federal Immigration authorities.

The company blamed the light on something called an arc flash at a power station in Queens. No aliens in this time, but we will continue to be vigilant monitoring it into a 2019.
