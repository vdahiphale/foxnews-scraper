      "sentences": "And thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News alert. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, explosive new evidence on what is becoming the biggest scandal -- or at least one of them -- in American history. Now it is something we have been saying would be exposed for months. According to news reports tonight from The Hill's John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter, there brand-new FBI documents that show the Russian nuclear industry officials kicked back millions and millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation all while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and helped approve the uranium one deal which gave Moscow, Russia, Vladimir Putin control of 20 percent of American uranium, the foundational materials for nuclear weapons.  And tonight, they are also reporting the FBI now has evidence that Russia for years has been doing this and they are reporting the FBI has evidence that literally they used bribery to gain control over America's uranium industry all while the Obama administration did nothing. And the Clintons benefited to the tune of nearly $145 million. You want a real Russia collusion story? We've got it.  Also, is Congress now going to do its job? Will they investigate these explosive reports immediately? Will the Special Counsel Robert Mueller start looking into this Russian plot to control American uranium? And is the left-wing mainstream media, are they going to stop pushing their lies and conspiracy theories to you, the American people? Will they ever tell us the truth?  And that's not all we have tonight. The FBI has confirmed that in fact, the disgraced former Director James Comey drafted a letter exonerating Hillary Clinton months before interviewing any key witnesses in the email server scandal. We will going to cover all of this in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. All right. So, The Hill's John Solomon, his colleague over there Alison Spann, are once again out with an explosive new report. Take a look at this headline from today: FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot before Obama administration approved a controversial nuclear deal with Moscow.  Now, here is the headline from Sara Carter: Russia nuclear firm under FBI investigation was allowed to purchase U.S. uranium supply. According to these breaking news reports, back in 2009, the FBI, they started gathering evidence, including recordings and emails and witnesses that they talked to showing that the Russian nuclear industry officials used bribes, kickbacks, money laundering and other illegal tactics to expand Russia's influence over America's uranium market.  Now, in The Hill report, they explained that despite all of the evidence that they had of wrongdoing against Russia, the Obama Justice Department, for some unknown reason chose not to act and pursue charges. What did they do instead? The Obama administration then went on to approve business deals that benefited Russia, Putin, Moscow greatly while these threats to our national security were actually going on. These include the 2010 -- we've talked about in a lot, now we have more details -- that Uranium One deal. Hillary Clinton, she signed off on it. She helped approve it. That gave Vladimir Putin control, over 20 percent of America's uranium. Uranium is the foundational materials so you can build nuclear weapons. We'll have a lot more on that in just a second.   And the 2011 deal, that made it easier for the Russian nuclear subsidiary to sell uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants. Now the FBI officials told Sara Carter at Circa News that the bureau's bribery investigation could have actually been stopped. However, this part is inexcusable. Both reports highlight how the Obama administration kept all of this evidence that they had of Russian bribery secret from Congress and the American people until five years after the approval of that uranium one deal. And when the DOJ finally did go public -- this was 2015 -- it was only to announce a single charge against the Russian at the center of the bribery scheme and they played it on the down low. Now keep in mind, after President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration, they were telling anyone who would listen, \"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy.\" Well, if that's the case, why when they had mountains of evidence -- that we will reveal tonight -- of Russian bribery going back to 2009? Why then did the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians?   And speaking of uranium one, according to the new report from The Hill, the FBI has evidence including eyewitness accounts that, quote, \"Russian nuclear officials routed\" -- pay attention -- \"routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's, \"charitable foundation during the exact time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow.\" Uranium one, sounds familiar? And by the way, we can't forget Peter Schweizer, he originally exposed this uranium one deal and his best-selling book, \"Clinton Cash.\" Now, all of that is why for months. On this program, I have been telling you uranium one will be one of the biggest scandals this country has ever seen. Just in case you forgot, let's remind you.",

Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton helped create a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child, giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium, that material, as I said, you use it to make nuclear warheads.  Now, if the liberal ideological mainstream media and the Democrats in this country that have been screaming, \"Russia, Russia, Russia,\" for all these months, if they want real Russia collusion, we've got it for them. The evidence is right here. It doesn't even need to be investigated, just corroborated. So, it's time tonight -- and I'm calling on Congress. I'm calling on Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Stop wasting our time and our money trying to find evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. You've been on this for a year. So far you have not presented one shred of evidence except now you can actually follow facts and evidence that we do have on the record.  I'm also calling out the Attorney General Jeff Sessions tonight. He recused himself from the Russia probe. He needs to now do the same. The evidence now shows that Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration put this country in danger handing Russia America's uranium. even though, as The Hill reported, there was crimes, bribery and worse and blackmail being committed.  And where was the liberal mainstream media during all of this? The media that is been running wild with all kinds of conspiracy theories about President Trump and Russia for months and months with no evidence? Well, here are some of the more unhinged examples of the left. Listen to their language. It applies to them tonight. It applies to the Clintons tonight. It applies to Obama tonight. Watch this.",

Has the media that is supposed to be trusted ever reported on the millions of dollars that were poured into the Clinton Foundation as a result of this deal? Will the press even now bother to look at John Solomon and Sara Carter's reporting and do their own digging?   And while we're at it, did anyone in the media aside from this show, did they ever asked Julian Assange about who gave him -- he's the one that has the information -- who gave him Hillary Clinton the DNC's emails? We actually asked him and Julian Assange told us repeatedly, five times that I interviewed him, it was not the Russians.  There is also the fake news Christopher Steele dossier that was funded in part by the Democratic donors. Guess what? That dossier relied heavily on Russian sources, a false smear to then candidate Donald Trump. Now, some in the media and some Democrats even repeated these boldest claims. Remember, the Ritz, hookers urinating on the bed, they paid for those lies. By the way, is that not spreading Russia propaganda? Is that not fake news? Is that not trying -- Russia trying to influence America's election with fake news? Catherine Herridge is reporting tonight that two members of the firm behind that fake news dossier have been subpoenaed to appear before Congress as it turns out tomorrow. Now the lawyer for Fusion GPS is saying tonight, his client has been advised to plead the fifth if they are forced to show up.  You know what? If members of Fusion GPS, if they don't want to appear before Congress, they're refusing to talk, let's hold them in contempt of Congress, maybe they will go to jail. Let's see.  But back to the media. They continue in this country to be exposed as a bunch of rigid, radical left wing ideologues. They do not care about the truth, and as I've been saying for years, journalism in America is dead. It's buried. We have an informational crisis in this country, and that's why you, the American people, no longer trust the press, nor should you. Look at this PBS-Marist Poll from over the summer. A combined 68 percent said they have not had very much or no trust at all in the media. And for good reason. The media is completely abusively biased in this country. They are a bunch of overpaid, rigid, left-wing radical ideologues and they no longer care about truth.  For example, the network evening newscasts tonight, even though these massive new stories are out about Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration, colluding with the Russians, giving them uranium, kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation. They did not even report on it because it does not fit their narrative, their talking points. There's also the fact that those stories are proof positive that Russia collusion hysteria is now starting to boomerang back on the Democrats. It's something by the way I predicted would happen back in June. Take a look.",

Does this not prove what I've been saying? We don't have equal justice under the law. We have a two-tiered justice system in this country. One for the Clintons and one for the rest of us. And it also proves James Comey acted inappropriately. He deserved to be fired. Now Comey played politics, he let Clinton off the hook, even though she had secret, top-secret, special access programs, classified information stored, let's see, in a mom, pop shop bathroom closet. Which by the way, mishandling of classified information, that is a crime it. Destroying classified information, that is a crime. Deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, oh, that is called obstruction of justice. And unlike the mainstream media, we care about the truth here. We care about facts. It's why we continue to expose all of these scandals. And tonight, a new level. Breaking news and this will now come back. Bribery, kickbacks, quid pro quo, America's national security at stake?   Joining us exclusively, John Solomon, he is with The Hill. Sara Carter, Circa News.  Sara, let me start with you. We are talking about bribery, we are talking about blackmail.

And I am going to give this to you and they said, would you work with us? They came to an agreement. He went inside. For 15 months, Sean, for 15 months, the FBI was investigating the Russian nuclear industry and agency. They knew that there were kickbacks.  They knew that there were bribes and they knew how dangerous this was to national security. And 15 months had passed in the investigation and then CFIUS, 13 members of the governing board approved the Uranium One deal to the Russians. I mean, this was something that I contacted FBI officials tonight. FBI sources that were there during that time. And they said the FBI would have had all of this information. It would have been their duty on the board, on the CFIUS board to report that information. And so, now what I'm thinking is, if they did report that information, it's got to be out there. We have got to be able to see these documents. And know what was going on and why the United States government decided to approve a deal that would give 20 percent of U.S. uranium assets to Vladimir Putin. There is the connection with Russia.",

That is a national security threat.

In a shocking turn of events, Bob Weinstein, Harvey's brother, he too is now accused of sexual harassment. According to reports, he is denying any allegation. And also tonight, the former chairman of DreamWorks Jeffrey Katzenberg says there's no way Harvey Weinstein acted alone saying men around Weinstein protected him and described him as a pack of wolves. Tonight more Hollywood topline actresses are coming forward about harassments that they received. Actress Reese Witherspoon said she experienced sexual harassment and assault including a Director that assaulted her when she was 16 years old. Actress Jennifer Lawrence she also detailed how a female producer made her stand naked in a lineup next to other girls, enticing her to lose weight. Oh, my gosh.

Now it is something we have been saying would be exposed for months. According to news reports tonight from The Hill's John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter, there brand-new FBI documents that show the Russian nuclear industry officials kicked back millions and millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation all while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and helped approve the uranium one deal which gave Moscow, Russia, Vladimir Putin control of 20 percent of American uranium, the foundational materials for nuclear weapons. And tonight, they are also reporting the FBI now has evidence that Russia for years has been doing this and they are reporting the FBI has evidence that literally they used bribery to gain control over America's uranium industry all while the Obama administration did nothing. And the Clintons benefited to the tune of nearly $145 million. You want a real Russia collusion story? We've got it. Also, is Congress now going to do its job? Will they investigate these explosive reports immediately? Will the Special Counsel Robert Mueller start looking into this Russian plot to control American uranium? And is the left-wing mainstream media, are they going to stop pushing their lies and conspiracy theories to you, the American people? Will they ever tell us the truth? And that's not all we have tonight. The FBI has confirmed that in fact, the disgraced former Director James Comey drafted a letter exonerating Hillary Clinton months before interviewing any key witnesses in the email server scandal. We will going to cover all of this in tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, here is the headline from Sara Carter",
      "utterance": "Russia nuclear firm under FBI investigation was allowed to purchase U.S. uranium supply. According to these breaking news reports, back in 2009, the FBI, they started gathering evidence, including recordings and emails and witnesses that they talked to showing that the Russian nuclear industry officials used bribes, kickbacks, money laundering and other illegal tactics to expand Russia's influence over America's uranium market. Now, in The Hill report, they explained that despite all of the evidence that they had of wrongdoing against Russia, the Obama Justice Department, for some unknown reason chose not to act and pursue charges. What did they do instead? The Obama administration then went on to approve business deals that benefited Russia, Putin, Moscow greatly while these threats to our national security were actually going on. These include the 2010 -- we've talked about in a lot, now we have more details -- that Uranium One deal. Hillary Clinton, she signed off on it. She helped approve it. That gave Vladimir Putin control, over 20 percent of America's uranium. Uranium is the foundational materials so you can build nuclear weapons. We'll have a lot more on that in just a second. And the 2011 deal, that made it easier for the Russian nuclear subsidiary to sell uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants. Now the FBI officials told Sara Carter at Circa News that the bureau's bribery investigation could have actually been stopped. However, this part is inexcusable. Both reports highlight how the Obama administration kept all of this evidence that they had of Russian bribery secret from Congress and the American people until five years after the approval of that uranium one deal. And when the DOJ finally did go public -- this was 2015 -- it was only to announce a single charge against the Russian at the center of the bribery scheme and they played it on the down low. Now keep in mind, after President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration, they were telling anyone who would listen, \"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy.\" Well, if that's the case, why when they had mountains of evidence -- that we will reveal tonight -- of Russian bribery going back to 2009? Why then did the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? And speaking of uranium one, according to the new report from The Hill, the FBI has evidence including eyewitness accounts that, quote, \"Russian nuclear officials routed\" -- pay attention -- \"routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's, \"charitable foundation during the exact time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow.\" Uranium one, sounds familiar? And by the way, we can't forget Peter Schweizer, he originally exposed this uranium one deal and his best-selling book, \"Clinton Cash.\" Now, all of that is why for months. On this program, I have been telling you uranium one will be one of the biggest scandals this country has ever seen. Just in case you forgot, let's remind you."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Then there's a real Russia collision story, the uranium one deal which I predict will be the biggest news to come out in the next year or two where the secretary of state, remember? She approved handing over up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. All while people involved in the deal in Canada, they kicked back over $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Tonight, with this new evidence where we have discovered is the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible. Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton helped create a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child, giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium, that material, as I said, you use it to make nuclear warheads. Now, if the liberal ideological mainstream media and the Democrats in this country that have been screaming, \"Russia, Russia, Russia,\" for all these months, if they want real Russia collusion, we've got it for them. The evidence is right here. It doesn't even need to be investigated, just corroborated. So, it's time tonight -- and I'm calling on Congress. I'm calling on Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Stop wasting our time and our money trying to find evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. You've been on this for a year. So far you have not presented one shred of evidence except now you can actually follow facts and evidence that we do have on the record. I'm also calling out the Attorney General Jeff Sessions tonight. He recused himself from the Russia probe. He needs to now do the same. The evidence now shows that Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration put this country in danger handing Russia America's uranium. even though, as The Hill reported, there was crimes, bribery and worse and blackmail being committed. And where was the liberal mainstream media during all of this? The media that is been running wild with all kinds of conspiracy theories about President Trump and Russia for months and months with no evidence? Well, here are some of the more unhinged examples of the left. Listen to their language. It applies to them tonight. It applies to the Clintons tonight. It applies to Obama tonight. Watch this."

Has the media that is supposed to be trusted ever reported on the millions of dollars that were poured into the Clinton Foundation as a result of this deal? Will the press even now bother to look at John Solomon and Sara Carter's reporting and do their own digging? And while we're at it, did anyone in the media aside from this show, did they ever asked Julian Assange about who gave him -- he's the one that has the information -- who gave him Hillary Clinton the DNC's emails? We actually asked him and Julian Assange told us repeatedly, five times that I interviewed him, it was not the Russians. There is also the fake news Christopher Steele dossier that was funded in part by the Democratic donors. Guess what? That dossier relied heavily on Russian sources, a false smear to then candidate Donald Trump. Now, some in the media and some Democrats even repeated these boldest claims. Remember, the Ritz, hookers urinating on the bed, they paid for those lies. By the way, is that not spreading Russia propaganda? Is that not fake news? Is that not trying -- Russia trying to influence America's election with fake news? Catherine Herridge is reporting tonight that two members of the firm behind that fake news dossier have been subpoenaed to appear before Congress as it turns out tomorrow. Now the lawyer for Fusion GPS is saying tonight, his client has been advised to plead the fifth if they are forced to show up. You know what? If members of Fusion GPS, if they don't want to appear before Congress, they're refusing to talk, let's hold them in contempt of Congress, maybe they will go to jail. Let's see. But back to the media. They continue in this country to be exposed as a bunch of rigid, radical left wing ideologues. They do not care about the truth, and as I've been saying for years, journalism in America is dead. It's buried. We have an informational crisis in this country, and that's why you, the American people, no longer trust the press, nor should you. Look at this PBS-Marist Poll from over the summer. A combined 68 percent said they have not had very much or no trust at all in the media. And for good reason. The media is completely abusively biased in this country. They are a bunch of overpaid, rigid, left-wing radical ideologues and they no longer care about truth. For example, the network evening newscasts tonight, even though these massive new stories are out about Hillary Clinton, the Obama administration, colluding with the Russians, giving them uranium, kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation. They did not even report on it because it does not fit their narrative, their talking points. There's also the fact that those stories are proof positive that Russia collusion hysteria is now starting to boomerang back on the Democrats. It's something by the way I predicted would happen back in June. Take a look."

Does this not prove what I've been saying? We don't have equal justice under the law. We have a two-tiered justice system in this country. One for the Clintons and one for the rest of us. And it also proves James Comey acted inappropriately. He deserved to be fired. Now Comey played politics, he let Clinton off the hook, even though she had secret, top-secret, special access programs, classified information stored, let's see, in a mom, pop shop bathroom closet. Which by the way, mishandling of classified information, that is a crime it. Destroying classified information, that is a crime. Deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, oh, that is called obstruction of justice. And unlike the mainstream media, we care about the truth here. We care about facts. It's why we continue to expose all of these scandals. And tonight, a new level. Breaking news and this will now come back. Bribery, kickbacks, quid pro quo, America's national security at stake? Joining us exclusively, John Solomon, he is with The Hill. Sara Carter, Circa News. Sara, let me start with you. We are talking about bribery, we are talking about blackmail.

And I am going to give this to you and they said, would you work with us? They came to an agreement. He went inside. For 15 months, Sean, for 15 months, the FBI was investigating the Russian nuclear industry and agency. They knew that there were kickbacks. They knew that there were bribes and they knew how dangerous this was to national security. And 15 months had passed in the investigation and then CFIUS, 13 members of the governing board approved the Uranium One deal to the Russians. I mean, this was something that I contacted FBI officials tonight. FBI sources that were there during that time. And they said the FBI would have had all of this information. It would have been their duty on the board, on the CFIUS board to report that information. And so, now what I'm thinking is, if they did report that information, it's got to be out there. We have got to be able to see these documents. And know what was going on and why the United States government decided to approve a deal that would give 20 percent of U.S. uranium assets to Vladimir Putin. There is the connection with Russia."

So, the FBI basically has evidence and the former documents' e-mails financial records and eyewitnesses proving the Russian's bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering to secure their Uranium One deal -- and about $145 million kicked back to the Clinton Foundation and they knew it in 2009? They knew it before they even approved the deal?"

That Russians tampered with our election results in 2016 while six years before that, they tampered with our nuclear security. They case proved that the nuclear Russia, Russia's nuclear industry had bribe their way and compromised an American truck company that moved all of Russia's uranium in the United States. That is a national security threat. And for two years, the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and everybody who has been quoted that said, the Obama administration had no knowledge of a national security threat and that's why they did not have any problem approving the Uranium One deal. Well, guess what? Tonight, we have a real National Security threat that was proven in real time in 2009 and it's going to be interesting to see what Congress does tomorrow morning. Chuck Grassley has a hearing with Jeff Sessions on the seat. And I think you might see some interesting questions."

So, it is going to be up to them to tell the truth and to deliver the answers to the American people. And it's going to be up to us to keep pushing this so that answers are delivered.

The Russian front which is unbelievable. And the Comey drafting and exoneration of Hillary two months before he interviewed her.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Every day we are learning more and more about just how disturbing that casting couch culture is in Hollywood. The disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein officially resigned from the board of the Weinstein Company today. Deadline Hollywood reporting tonight that the Los Angeles City attorney will prosecute Weinstein's victims come forward. We will have the reporter who broke that story on tomorrow. In a shocking turn of events, Bob Weinstein, Harvey's brother, he too is now accused of sexual harassment. According to reports, he is denying any allegation. And also tonight, the former chairman of DreamWorks Jeffrey Katzenberg says there's no way Harvey Weinstein acted alone saying men around Weinstein protected him and described him as a pack of wolves. Tonight more Hollywood topline actresses are coming forward about harassments that they received. Actress Reese Witherspoon said she experienced sexual harassment and assault including a Director that assaulted her when she was 16 years old. Actress Jennifer Lawrence she also detailed how a female producer made her stand naked in a lineup next to other girls, enticing her to lose weight. Oh, my gosh. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera, conservative columnist Monica Crowley. It's the music industry, TV industry. Movie industry. Young people have dreams, aspirations, and desires. What happens?"

      "utterance": "We have been talking about this scandal in ideological terms, political terms but essentially, they are criminal. The problem with prosecuting people like Harvey Weinstein or Roman Polanski or Woody Allen, you name them -- generally speaking, the complaint come years later. The statute of limitations -- these women, Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon that you mention were all at a gathering in Southern California over the last couple of days and they come up with \"well, I think it's a great idea. Because the criminal prosecution will not happen in the majority of these cases. The very rare -- very risky and shaky cases. Why not have a commission? Where you have actors or actresses, producers where they can tell these stories, name names and make recommendations. I believe if you had this commission, not only would you hear these hair-raising stories but you would also expose a corrupt industry. It's so corrupt that there are agents that work as pimps. And stage moms that know exactly what they are doing when they push their 15 or 16-year-old daughter into this meeting with a big belly gold chain wearing producer. I think that is the way to get meaningful reform and it is the only way Sean."

For the past few years I've been working on a very special project, I'm a proud executive producer and I wanted to do this because I'm tired of formulaic films that frankly, go against conservative sensibilities and values. The award-winning movie, it is an award winning already, it is called \"Let There Be Light,\" it's in theaters October 27th. You can find locations on Hannity.com. Here's a sneak peek. Ten days away.
