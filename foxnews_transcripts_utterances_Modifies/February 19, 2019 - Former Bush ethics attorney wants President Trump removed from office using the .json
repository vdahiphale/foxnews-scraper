      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Bernie Sanders is running for President again, not that he ever really stopped. Sanders announced his second campaign this morning in a ten-minute video. Before you drop everything and watch it, take half a moment to appreciate just how much America and the Democratic Party have changed over the past four years. Pull up Sanders' first presidential announcement speech. It was May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Vermont. Sanders looked a lot different then, but the second thing you will notice, if you watch it is how familiar his words sound. It is spooky.  Virtually, all of the themes in Sanders' announcement speech, his first one, or what in the end got Donald Trump elected President -- the collapse of the middle class, the crushing cost of healthcare and student loans, the pointlessness of perpetual war in the Middle East, the distorting effects of the Washington lobbyists and donors - the swamp, the dangers of corporate power and the need for better jobs and higher wages for Americans, the generational disaster that is the trade policy -- it is all there, everything but build a wall.  Sanders has often described the 1970s era of socialist and that is basically true. He honeymooned in the Soviet Union. He looks like he combs his hair with a balloon, but if you listen carefully, what Bernie Sanders was really selling in the last campaign was not Marxism, it was economic populism and an awful lot of people agreed with it.  Many of them wound up voting for Donald Trump in the general election. In case you have forgotten, here is what Bernie Sanders sounded back then.",

      "sentences": "Well, you can disagree about whether Wall Street and the big banks are really driving America's decline like all politicians -- Sanders was and is an over-stayer -- but looking back, there was something touchingly old fashioned about the way Bernie Sanders ran that campaign. Sanders made no appeal at all to interest groups. He explicitly opposed interest groups. He instead talked about national unity and the people left behind. His first announcement speech did not mention the words \"racism\" or \"sexism\" or for that matter, \"abortion\" or \"gun control.\" He said nothing about immigration or noncitizens.  Sanders was running for Americans, all of them whether you would agree with him or not. Needless to say, Sanders quickly found himself at war with Democrats. The modern Democratic Party has no place for the idea of nationhood. It rejects the existence of universal interests and values. Instead of a common American culture, Democrats see only tribes.   Now, Bernie Sanders is pushing 80 and he seems completely bewildered by these changes in attitude. In the weeks after 2016 election, Sanders told one reporter that Hillary Clinton lost the race because quote, \"It's not good enough to say, 'I am a woman, vote for me.'\" Well, Sanders was right, obviously. But he was way too late. Modern Democrats are defined by identity politics, that's the idea that the accident of your birth determines what your worth, your value. Some groups are favored, others are blamed and punished. What matters isn't what you do, the choices that you make. What matters is who you are genetically. By the time Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court six months ago, the Democrats had made this entirely explicit.",

      "sentences": "So that is the new Bernie Sanders, and he seems a lot smaller than the old version. Instead of saving America from predatory global capitalism, Sanders plans to save us from Donald Trump's racism and sexism. Okay, let's say he does that. What then? Racism and sexism aren't actually the biggest problems that America faces, sorry, not even close actually. Growing economic stratification and a dying middle-class, those are the biggest problems, but nobody in Washington wants to talk about those things and why would they? People in Washington are richer than ever.   Any change of the status quo is a threat to them by definition. It is much better for them to have the population squabble over unresolvable questions of identity. A nation that is arguing about skin color is not asking how a tiny group of people is now flying private while almost everybody else has gotten poorer. So identity politics is a tactic designed to prevent conversations dangerous to the ruling class, obviously. It is also a way for some of the most privilege people in America to recast themselves as victims. Cory Booker, for example, Cory Booker went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale. His parents were IBM executives. Booker has spent most of his career in the Senate carrying water for his fellow privileged people, his peers on Wall Street.  Privileged? Yes, Cory Booker defines that word. Now that he's running for President, it will be interesting to hear Cory Booker explain why he has allowed his friends in the finance world to continue to pay half the tax rate that you are probably paying now, but he likely doesn't want to talk about that.  Instead, he will probably spend most of his time talking about racism, including the racism he has personally experienced as a powerless person. A powerless person who went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale and whose parents were IBM executives. So you can see what is going on here. This is a scam. Identity politics is a scam and it is not so different from the one that Jussie Smollett just pulled. Smollett a rich actor with a hit TV show. That is fine. We used to call people like that \"pampered,\" but Smollett doesn't want to be thought of as pampered and nobody does really, so here he recast himself as a victim.   The people oppressing him, he told us, were Trump voters. Badly educated thugs from some rural backwater probably, in-breeds who have never read a book. People who do not have Kamala Harris' personal cellphone number. People who probably don't even believe in global warming or like Thai food. Those people. They are the problem and they must be crushed.  Somehow, the left is telling us the weak are now oppressing the strong. That is their claim. The old left would have pushed back against this. They would have felt some sympathy for the people our economy has left behind, but not anymore. The new left reveres Cory Booker and Barack Obama. They are rallying behind Jussie Smollett. Once Smollett's fraud was exposed, they defended him without saying so.",

And perhaps he needs a fourth beach house, I don't know, but he does well as a politician, right, this is a career. And so he is appealing to a group of people who have been trained and who are now demanding for this kind of an extreme dynamic, and this is what is heartbreaking. Is the Civil Rights Movement - was it a demand for people not to be treated differently because of who they are? Was it a demand for an elevation of people to be treated like everyone else? Identity politics is the cancer, it is the opposite of that. It demands that we not only treat people differently because of who they are, but then condemn some and elevate others based on some kind of benefit we have been assigned to a particular identity. It is the antithesis of what we fought for throughout the 60s and 70s and frankly, beginning at the turn of the 20th Century. This is how retrograde the Democrats have become, and it is what Americans reject. And so it is concerning that we see that this is happening with the Democrats because we need a good loyal opposition, but it certainly is what not America has been. It's not what we are now and not what we want to become.",

This arrest was confirmed by an L.A. county clerk who tells us that the birth date that we have for 36-year-old, Jussie Smollett matches the birthday of the Jussie Smollett that was arrested for this DUI and giving false information to the police. We reached out to Smollett's legal team who did not deny his arrest. We have not been able yet to pinpoint exactly what Smollett lied to the police about, but it is related to a vehicular charge. Smollett was sentenced to 36 months of probation. Also new tonight, Chicago Police tell Fox News that the two brothers that CBS reports confessed to carrying out the hoax with, met with prosecutors and detectives late this afternoon. Tonight, Chicago Police are still waiting for Smollett to respond to their very important request for a follow-up interview. The police tell us they are giving Smollett a quote, \"responsible amount of time,\" what happens next depends on Smollett's actions. Police can't present this case to prosecutors or a grand jury seeking an arrest warrant and tonight, we are learning police appear to be doing just that. Smollett was very cooperative with the police before this whole story dramatically altered, apparently no longer responding to phone calls to police requesting more information. Tonight, the police are no longer insisting Smollett is the victim. There are now referring to him as the person who filed the police report. Smollett's attorney say anyone who say Smollett was in on this attack as a liar and here in Illinois, filing a false police report is a Class IV felony. It is punishable up to three years in prison. It is also probational, but Smollett might even be in more trouble with the FBI who is investigating that alleged death threat letter with the MAGA return address that was sent to Smollett just one week prior to this alleged attack, Tucker.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Bernie Sanders is running for President again, not that he ever really stopped. Sanders announced his second campaign this morning in a ten-minute video. Before you drop everything and watch it, take half a moment to appreciate just how much America and the Democratic Party have changed over the past four years. Pull up Sanders' first presidential announcement speech. It was May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Vermont. Sanders looked a lot different then, but the second thing you will notice, if you watch it is how familiar his words sound. It is spooky. Virtually, all of the themes in Sanders' announcement speech, his first one, or what in the end got Donald Trump elected President -- the collapse of the middle class, the crushing cost of healthcare and student loans, the pointlessness of perpetual war in the Middle East, the distorting effects of the Washington lobbyists and donors - the swamp, the dangers of corporate power and the need for better jobs and higher wages for Americans, the generational disaster that is the trade policy -- it is all there, everything but build a wall. Sanders has often described the 1970s era of socialist and that is basically true. He honeymooned in the Soviet Union. He looks like he combs his hair with a balloon, but if you listen carefully, what Bernie Sanders was really selling in the last campaign was not Marxism, it was economic populism and an awful lot of people agreed with it. Many of them wound up voting for Donald Trump in the general election. In case you have forgotten, here is what Bernie Sanders sounded back then."

      "utterance": "Well, you can disagree about whether Wall Street and the big banks are really driving America's decline like all politicians -- Sanders was and is an over-stayer -- but looking back, there was something touchingly old fashioned about the way Bernie Sanders ran that campaign. Sanders made no appeal at all to interest groups. He explicitly opposed interest groups. He instead talked about national unity and the people left behind. His first announcement speech did not mention the words \"racism\" or \"sexism\" or for that matter, \"abortion\" or \"gun control.\" He said nothing about immigration or noncitizens. Sanders was running for Americans, all of them whether you would agree with him or not. Needless to say, Sanders quickly found himself at war with Democrats. The modern Democratic Party has no place for the idea of nationhood. It rejects the existence of universal interests and values. Instead of a common American culture, Democrats see only tribes. Now, Bernie Sanders is pushing 80 and he seems completely bewildered by these changes in attitude. In the weeks after 2016 election, Sanders told one reporter that Hillary Clinton lost the race because quote, \"It's not good enough to say, 'I am a woman, vote for me.'\" Well, Sanders was right, obviously. But he was way too late. Modern Democrats are defined by identity politics, that's the idea that the accident of your birth determines what your worth, your value. Some groups are favored, others are blamed and punished. What matters isn't what you do, the choices that you make. What matters is who you are genetically. By the time Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court six months ago, the Democrats had made this entirely explicit."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Old, white men. Not a favored group in the modern Democratic Party to put it mildly, and yet Bernie Sanders is undeniably all three of those things. So how do you win the nomination of a party that hate you for qualities that you can't change? Bernie Sanders is not the only Democrat facing this dilemma, far from it, nor is he the only one to realize that there is only one solution, you have to embrace identity politics. Getting woke is the only option, so Bernie Sanders has done just that. Here is a clip from his second presidential announcement video released today."

      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and all forms of discrimination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So that is the new Bernie Sanders, and he seems a lot smaller than the old version. Instead of saving America from predatory global capitalism, Sanders plans to save us from Donald Trump's racism and sexism. Okay, let's say he does that. What then? Racism and sexism aren't actually the biggest problems that America faces, sorry, not even close actually. Growing economic stratification and a dying middle-class, those are the biggest problems, but nobody in Washington wants to talk about those things and why would they? People in Washington are richer than ever. Any change of the status quo is a threat to them by definition. It is much better for them to have the population squabble over unresolvable questions of identity. A nation that is arguing about skin color is not asking how a tiny group of people is now flying private while almost everybody else has gotten poorer. So identity politics is a tactic designed to prevent conversations dangerous to the ruling class, obviously. It is also a way for some of the most privilege people in America to recast themselves as victims. Cory Booker, for example, Cory Booker went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale. His parents were IBM executives. Booker has spent most of his career in the Senate carrying water for his fellow privileged people, his peers on Wall Street. Privileged? Yes, Cory Booker defines that word. Now that he's running for President, it will be interesting to hear Cory Booker explain why he has allowed his friends in the finance world to continue to pay half the tax rate that you are probably paying now, but he likely doesn't want to talk about that. Instead, he will probably spend most of his time talking about racism, including the racism he has personally experienced as a powerless person. A powerless person who went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale and whose parents were IBM executives. So you can see what is going on here. This is a scam. Identity politics is a scam and it is not so different from the one that Jussie Smollett just pulled. Smollett a rich actor with a hit TV show. That is fine. We used to call people like that \"pampered,\" but Smollett doesn't want to be thought of as pampered and nobody does really, so here he recast himself as a victim. The people oppressing him, he told us, were Trump voters. Badly educated thugs from some rural backwater probably, in-breeds who have never read a book. People who do not have Kamala Harris' personal cellphone number. People who probably don't even believe in global warming or like Thai food. Those people. They are the problem and they must be crushed. Somehow, the left is telling us the weak are now oppressing the strong. That is their claim. The old left would have pushed back against this. They would have felt some sympathy for the people our economy has left behind, but not anymore. The new left reveres Cory Booker and Barack Obama. They are rallying behind Jussie Smollett. Once Smollett's fraud was exposed, they defended him without saying so."

And so he is appealing to a group of people who have been trained and who are now demanding for this kind of an extreme dynamic, and this is what is heartbreaking. Is the Civil Rights Movement - was it a demand for people not to be treated differently because of who they are? Was it a demand for an elevation of people to be treated like everyone else? Identity politics is the cancer, it is the opposite of that. It demands that we not only treat people differently because of who they are, but then condemn some and elevate others based on some kind of benefit we have been assigned to a particular identity. It is the antithesis of what we fought for throughout the 60s and 70s and frankly, beginning at the turn of the 20th Century. This is how retrograde the Democrats have become, and it is what Americans reject. And so it is concerning that we see that this is happening with the Democrats because we need a good loyal opposition, but it certainly is what not America has been.

Behind me is the door that police say Jussie Smollett used to get inside into his apartment building on the night of that alleged attack and now, we are learning this evening that Jussie Smollett was convicted of a DUI and lying to the police in 2007 according to court documents obtained by Fox News. This arrest was confirmed by an L.A. county clerk who tells us that the birth date that we have for 36-year-old, Jussie Smollett matches the birthday of the Jussie Smollett that was arrested for this DUI and giving false information to the police. We reached out to Smollett's legal team who did not deny his arrest. We have not been able yet to pinpoint exactly what Smollett lied to the police about, but it is related to a vehicular charge. Smollett was sentenced to 36 months of probation. Also new tonight, Chicago Police tell Fox News that the two brothers that CBS reports confessed to carrying out the hoax with, met with prosecutors and detectives late this afternoon. Tonight, Chicago Police are still waiting for Smollett to respond to their very important request for a follow-up interview. The police tell us they are giving Smollett a quote, \"responsible amount of time,\" what happens next depends on Smollett's actions. Police can't present this case to prosecutors or a grand jury seeking an arrest warrant and tonight, we are learning police appear to be doing just that. Smollett was very cooperative with the police before this whole story dramatically altered, apparently no longer responding to phone calls to police requesting more information. Tonight, the police are no longer insisting Smollett is the victim. There are now referring to him as the person who filed the police report. Smollett's attorney say anyone who say Smollett was in on this attack as a liar and here in Illinois, filing a false police report is a Class IV felony. It is punishable up to three years in prison. It is also probational, but Smollett might even be in more trouble with the FBI who is investigating that alleged death threat letter with the MAGA return address that was sent to Smollett just one week prior to this alleged attack, Tucker."

So in Chicago, for example, we saw the Velvet Ultra Lounge case where the owner of a popular gay and bisexual nightclub burnt his own business to the ground, collected, I believe a 20- plus thousand dollar check for that and attributed that originally to homophobes, so that is a partial motivation.

The weight of that convinces you that it's true. You don't question it because everyone is saying it. I didn't even notice that there was a bias in the media.

They do. And I've always thought this about bias and about fairness in news coverage. Fairness is not really a policy or even an attitude. Fairness is really kind of a skill. And it begins with the recognition of your bias. Once you do that, it's really not all of that difficult if you are aware that you don't like this particular politician or you feel this way about a particular issue and you're covering something related to it, it is not that hard to screen it out of your coverage. It really isn't. Lawyers do it every day. They represent clients that they think are guilty. Judges decide cases in favor or against people that they like or dislike all the time. It is not impossible. It is a discipline. It is a skill. But if you won't admit it to yourself, you have got no chance. And it used to be, you know, that the editors of newspapers around the country really led in those days by \"The New York Times\" were very careful to make sure reporters wrote their stories in neutral language. That discipline, I'm afraid, Tucker is out the window. The morning after the state of the union address by the President, \"The Washington Post\" had a banner headline that said \"A discordant appeal for unity.\" Now people may have found this speech discordant. I am confident that the journalist who wrote the story did, but that is an opinion. And in the lead of the story, it was referred to as a dissonant speech. Well, that is a judgment; that is an opinion. It had no business in the new story. Now, if you want to have editorials and denounce the speech and have columnists who write all kinds of invective about it that is all fine. That is the way it's supposed to work."

It looked like a Rubik's cube, as you can see and insisted that the candidate try it on and then got her to buy it. And then tweeted about it, glowingly. Well, I'm sorry, there is nothing wrong story with going into the store with a candidate who is visiting as a campaign event a store and observing the candidate's rights to try on clothes.

You can be an anchorman or woman and invited to the White House on State of the Union day and be entertained at lunch by the President. Those things are arm's length. They are perfectly appropriate. And they've been going on for a long time. But this kind of chummy, \"let's go shopping\" stuff is obviously something inappropriate. And the fact that these journalist who are involved in that defended it and a lot of others, too, shows you how far down this road we have gotten.
