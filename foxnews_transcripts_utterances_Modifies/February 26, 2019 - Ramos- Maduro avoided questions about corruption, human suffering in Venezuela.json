We're in Vietnam where we are broadcasting live for the second straight day.  In just moments, I will speak one-on-one with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. He was just detained by Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro at the presidential palace, oh, because the dictator couldn't handle the truth about socialism.  An amazing story -- Jorge confronted him about citizen being so desperate. Remember the promise of socialism, pilfering garbage trucks for food. The dictator had Jorge detained, he took his tapes and cell phone, and cameras and we'll have more on the desperate situation in Venezuela and this confrontation.  But tonight, we begin right here in Vietnam. Tomorrow, President Trump will keep off a series of historic meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Both leaders arrived yesterday. The president on Air Force One and Kim Jong-un via a 60-hour train ride. Somebody buy this guy a plane. Maybe it was in the shop getting repaired. But two years ago, remember that hate-Trump media mob told you, we the people, president, oh, he's leading us to nuclear annihilation. In response to what, North Korea, hostilities, rockets over Japan threatening Guam and the continental U.S., Trump deployed multiple aircraft carrier strike groups in the region. He nicknamed Kim Jong-un a little rocket man. He reminded the despot about America's nuclear superiority.  He squeezed North Korea's only real ally China with tariffs. He deployed strategy called peace through strength. And all while America's left told you the sky was falling, and a nuclear holocaust. Little rocket man, fire and fury, my button is bigger than yours. This is how the media reacted.",

      "sentences": "They said the same thing when Reagan called the former Soviet Union the \"evil empire\". And per usual, when he challenged Gorbachev, tear down this wall. They are completely wrong again and again and as you might've noticed, there's no nuclear holocaust. In fact, quite the opposite.  What do we see? North Korea completely stopping firing ballistic missiles over Japan, threatening the region, threatening Guam, threatening the continental United States. They returned the remains of U.S. servicemen, brave heroes and died in battle during the Korean War. They agreed to negotiate denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. Oh, and hostages will return, a huge deal.  And it's not just North Korea, now, China is being held accountable for its rampant intellectual property theft. Because of the real serious threat of ongoing tariffs, well, guess what? New, better trade deals that help Americans, that help farmers, that help manufacturers, that help our car industry are now on the table. Despite all of this success, of course, the hate-Trump media mob and Democrats publicly rooting for the president to fail in these upcoming negotiations with Kim Jong-un. We have eight U.S. senators, this is a joke, releasing an open letter to the president bashing him for his diplomatic efforts, insinuating our president is a liar.  Well, let's look at the hate-Trump media mob's obsession with a month's old statement from the president, oh, that he and Kim fell in love during their first encounter. OK, let me translate for anyone in the media who is too stupid to figure it out on their own, who never left the comforts of their little TV studios that are way overpaid.   The president developed a beneficial working relationship with someone we are trying to negotiate with. By the way, if we can stop North Korea from threatening the entire region, that would be a good thing. That's when nuclear annihilation's just a button away if we don't fix it. So, let's face it, here is a sad reality. We have the left in this country, Democrats, mainstream media, they don't obviously want the president to succeed, not just on this issue. Even when safety and security of the American people is on the line. This is sick. Their psychotic hatred of this president is more important to them than the well-being of South Koreans, the entire region, and Americans. Now, if that wasn't the case, remember it would fund the wall of the southern border like they were willing to do Obama's second term. When Trump is doing it, it's immoral. If that wasn't the case, they could not have tried to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life, smear, slander, besmirchment during their botched attempt to block his nomination.  If that wasn't the case, they would not have voted against the born alive bill which would protected living infants who survive the botched abortions, really? Pretty heartless. And all the Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted against this bill, all of them.  Now, that brings us to tonight's history lesson. While the left is actively rooting against President Trump because that then gets in the way of the desired power -- well, their own track record in foreign policy has been an absolute disgrace. Frankly, another failure. Their failed strategy can be summed up with two words: international bribery. If only we suck up to dictators and pay them the money, maybe they like us. 1994, then President Bill Clinton bragging about giving North Korea the world in exchange for just a promise not to build the nuke. It didn't last long. Take a look.",

The entire world will decipher as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons.  South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations, will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up to the nuclear energy it is losing. And they will pay for alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making much order for them to produce nuclear weapons.  The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations.",

      "sentences": "Well, it wasn't a good deal for the American people because North Korea took the money and ran, and today, yes, they have nuclear weapons arsenal. President Trump is now stuck cleaning up his mess.   And, sadly, Obama didn't learn from Clinton's abject foreign policy failures. Remember, 2015, then-President Obama tried to bribe the world's leading sponsor of terrorism with $150 billion in cash and other currency that they dumped on a tarmac in Iran for the mullahs of Iran that say \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" and burn our flags. What do we get in return? We got a promise again that they wouldn't develop nuclear weapons for a few years.  President Obama called it an unprecedented achievement, and stupidity, but Iran use that money what? We now know to fund terrorism all over the Middle East as proxies of wars all over the place, killing so many innocent humans in the process, killing innocent civilians around the world. Iran still publicly plotting annihilation of Israel, still burning the U.S. flag, still chanting death to America death to Israel. And Obama's flawed nuclear deal, thankfully because of President Trump, is now totally obsolete. If we don't learn from the past, yes, we are doomed to repeat it. Just like Reagan peace through strength, we can learn from success as well.  That's why the president will ultimately open up the spigot of economic opportunity in North Korea if Kim Jong-un agrees to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty which opens up his country to regular unabated checks on his nuclear program. And it will help his people out in the meantime. And he also has to agree to phase out and dismantle all of his nuclear weapons. Accountability, verification, or no deal?  Now, as a country that is learning from our past failures, it's critically important, not just abroad, but right here in America with the United States. Our country, in 2010, when former President Obama's fellow Democrats ran Obamacare down your throat, remember, they made a lot of promises again and again. Keep your doctor, keep your plan and save less and lower drug prices. Well, a lot of people lost their doctors, lost their plans and everybody is paying more. All Americans will be insured. It didn't happen. Healthcare costs have skyrocketed, some Americans only have one plan, 27 million Americans today still remain uninsured.  Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, nearly every far left radical Democrat is pushing Obamacare on steroids, human growth hormone times a million. They're literally calling for every American to lose, you cannot have private health insurance, and let ever so confident federal government, the ones who gave us Obamacare handle it all.

Free child care, free housing, free health, food, government healthy food, free vacations, free family leave, free health care but you can't have private insurer, free, free, free. Oh, and retirement, and you don't even have to work. Oh, yes, by the way, no more oil, no more gas, no more airplanes, no more cows, no more power cars and the government will rebuild every single building in America for energy efficiency. Well, all in ten years, by the way, we have our first cost estimate at a meager, oh, up to $94 trillion. Even though the world is to end in 12 years, according to Ocasio-Cortez. Now, this plan would wreck the United States. It would be an unmitigated disaster, nothing but a path to poverty. It would destroy the greatest wealth and innovation producing system that mankind has ever seen, called capitalism. And that's not all. The radical plans keep coming and coming. It's open borders, eliminate ICE. And if they get their way, only the government gets to have a Second Amendment right.   In fact, as we speak, House Democrats -- they are prepping a bill that would criminalize many gun sales. And let's never forget their unified opposition to living humans surviving abortions. This is a new extreme radical Democratic socialist party. All Democratic senators running for president voted against the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act.  Wow. The most innocent among us. If our government doesn't protect babies, living on their own, what's the point? All these radical plans, they have one common them: government power. Democrats want to bribe you, we, the American people and take away all your fear, convince you that giving up basic fundamental rights in exchange for security, lofty government promises, and free everything.  Now, it's time tonight we call on everyone in America. Learn from history. Driving dictators and kissing up to them never works. Socialism always ends in death, property and destruction for all. We will have a lot more coming up in the course of the show.  But first let's preview what is about to go down tomorrow in the nation's swamp. So, while the president is here in Vietnam, the president's former attorney Michael Cohen is going to testify in public. Three days in a row, one, two, three, OK? Tomorrow is the only public one, before the House Oversight Committee. He's going to be drilled by some of the worst Trump haters like Ocasio-Cortez, Congressman Tlaib and others.  Now, keep in mind among other issues, Michael Cohen did plead guilty, lying to Congress. It wasn't long ago the prominent Democrats hated Michael Cohen, called him out repeatedly for being a liar. Now, they were his best friend. Take a look.",

Whatever happened to politics ending at the water's edge? You know, it is a pretty heartless act by a group of people just pointed by all things Trump.

Quick reminder, by the way, New York passed a law allowing abortion up to the mother's due date. And a barbaric proposal, remember in Virginia nearly succeeded, would have allowed an abortion while a woman begins labor. And remember, disgraced Virginia Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, took it even a step further when describing the process, for letting a baby -- well, first, the baby is going to be born, we'll make the baby comfortable. And then the mother will decide whether or not to resuscitate it or a given medical aid. Now, Senate Democrats, they have blocked the GOP back born alive bill. That would provide medical care to infants who survive failed abortions. Let's be clear here, that is infanticide, plain and simple. And refusing to care for a child born alive, living independently has the support of all 2020 Democratic Senate hopefuls? But they couldn't be more out of touch with the American people.  Now, President Trump responded. He tweeted out, quote, Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. Democratic position on abortion is so extreme, they don't mind literally executing babies after birth. And added, quote: This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. And it looks like, well, Illinois maybe next. A pro-life group is warning a new proposal will make the state the, quote, abortion capital of America. This and more on Democratic extremism, former speaker of the house and new host of \"Newt's World\" podcast. Look at that. It's amazing. We're very happy to have back, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. I don't even know what to say here. You know, I don't think people could do this to a puppy or a kitten.

It's a little hard to understand what has happened psychologically to the Democratic Party that you could add a large group of people. I think all three of the Democratic senators vote in effect to allow the killing of babies who are already born. The position taken, as you point out, by the governor of Virginia, is that it's really OK because we'll keep the baby comfortable while we decide whether or not to kill it. I mean, this is pure infanticide in a way which is unthinkable in most of the world. And if this was a foreign country and we were describing a foreign country which allowed babies to be killed after they were born, even most liberals would be shocked and horrified.  But what you are seeing right now -- and I don't know whether it is just a natural maturation of the left over the last 40 years or impartially reaction to Trump, on almost on every front, they now feel compelled to rush to the most extreme positions, even if they are crazy. And someone said the other day, they have now become literally the party of death and taxes. And I think there is a lot to that. And I can't understand on a practical level what they think they are doing. But also, I cannot understand morally. You know, one or two people, yes, but to have every Democratic presidential candidate vote that it is OK to kill babies after they are born puts them in such a small minority, I don't quite see how they think they're going to create a winning campaign.",

He can't even bring himself to say that Maduro in Venezuela is a dictator. Now you look at the entire lifetime of apologizing for the Soviet Union, apologizing for Fidel Castro, Bernie Sanders has never met a Left-winger he didn't like. And so you have this whole thing coming together, partially I think a reaction to Hillary Clinton that she was so unacceptable to most liberals that they've gone further to the Left in response, partially in reacting to Donald Trump. Who, again, is from the standpoint of a Left- winger is so unacceptable. But I'm - I've been around long enough, what I'm reminded of is George McGovern in 1972 and the collapse of the Democratic Party as people began to realize when you go around the country, I don't think there's a single state, not one, in which they can get a majority in favor of killing babies after they're born.",

And before we go, by the way, we do have a big announcement in that UC Berkeley campus assault case. The University of California has concluded its investigation into the February 19th assault on conservative activist Hayden Williams that the media ignored and is seeking a felony warrant for the identified suspect. If a warrant is issued, police will pursue his arrest. We're going to follow this closely, and of course bring you every update. Also finally, we do have a big announcement, and make sure to tune in to this program Thursday night one-on-one exclusive interview with President Trump right after his second historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong- un. It's an exclusive interview. You'll only see here on HANNITY, and we look forward to that. We also - you would think that the rest of the country would forget about red and blue and forget about conservative, liberal, and Republican, Democrat. Maybe we should really hope for the safety and security of our children and the world that the President succeeds. Not hate him like they do over everything - even if he cured cancer. All right.

We're in Vietnam where we are broadcasting live for the second straight day. In just moments, I will speak one-on-one with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. He was just detained by Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro at the presidential palace, oh, because the dictator couldn't handle the truth about socialism. An amazing story -- Jorge confronted him about citizen being so desperate. Remember the promise of socialism, pilfering garbage trucks for food. The dictator had Jorge detained, he took his tapes and cell phone, and cameras and we'll have more on the desperate situation in Venezuela and this confrontation. But tonight, we begin right here in Vietnam. Tomorrow, President Trump will keep off a series of historic meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Both leaders arrived yesterday. The president on Air Force One and Kim Jong-un via a 60-hour train ride. Somebody buy this guy a plane. Maybe it was in the shop getting repaired. But two years ago, remember that hate-Trump media mob told you, we the people, president, oh, he's leading us to nuclear annihilation. In response to what, North Korea, hostilities, rockets over Japan threatening Guam and the continental U.S., Trump deployed multiple aircraft carrier strike groups in the region. He nicknamed Kim Jong-un a little rocket man. He reminded the despot about America's nuclear superiority. He squeezed North Korea's only real ally China with tariffs. He deployed strategy called peace through strength. And all while America's left told you the sky was falling, and a nuclear holocaust. Little rocket man, fire and fury, my button is bigger than yours. This is how the media reacted."

      "utterance": "They said the same thing when Reagan called the former Soviet Union the \"evil empire\". And per usual, when he challenged Gorbachev, tear down this wall. They are completely wrong again and again and as you might've noticed, there's no nuclear holocaust. In fact, quite the opposite. What do we see? North Korea completely stopping firing ballistic missiles over Japan, threatening the region, threatening Guam, threatening the continental United States. They returned the remains of U.S. servicemen, brave heroes and died in battle during the Korean War. They agreed to negotiate denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. Oh, and hostages will return, a huge deal. And it's not just North Korea, now, China is being held accountable for its rampant intellectual property theft. Because of the real serious threat of ongoing tariffs, well, guess what? New, better trade deals that help Americans, that help farmers, that help manufacturers, that help our car industry are now on the table. Despite all of this success, of course, the hate-Trump media mob and Democrats publicly rooting for the president to fail in these upcoming negotiations with Kim Jong-un. We have eight U.S. senators, this is a joke, releasing an open letter to the president bashing him for his diplomatic efforts, insinuating our president is a liar. Well, let's look at the hate-Trump media mob's obsession with a month's old statement from the president, oh, that he and Kim fell in love during their first encounter. OK, let me translate for anyone in the media who is too stupid to figure it out on their own, who never left the comforts of their little TV studios that are way overpaid. The president developed a beneficial working relationship with someone we are trying to negotiate with. By the way, if we can stop North Korea from threatening the entire region, that would be a good thing. That's when nuclear annihilation's just a button away if we don't fix it. So, let's face it, here is a sad reality. We have the left in this country, Democrats, mainstream media, they don't obviously want the president to succeed, not just on this issue. Even when safety and security of the American people is on the line. This is sick. Their psychotic hatred of this president is more important to them than the well-being of South Koreans, the entire region, and Americans. Now, if that wasn't the case, remember it would fund the wall of the southern border like they were willing to do Obama's second term. When Trump is doing it, it's immoral. If that wasn't the case, they could not have tried to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life, smear, slander, besmirchment during their botched attempt to block his nomination. If that wasn't the case, they would not have voted against the born alive bill which would protected living infants who survive the botched abortions, really? Pretty heartless. And all the Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted against this bill, all of them."

The entire world will decipher as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations, will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up to the nuclear energy it is losing. And they will pay for alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making much order for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, it wasn't a good deal for the American people because North Korea took the money and ran, and today, yes, they have nuclear weapons arsenal. President Trump is now stuck cleaning up his mess. And, sadly, Obama didn't learn from Clinton's abject foreign policy failures. Remember, 2015, then-President Obama tried to bribe the world's leading sponsor of terrorism with $150 billion in cash and other currency that they dumped on a tarmac in Iran for the mullahs of Iran that say \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" and burn our flags. What do we get in return? We got a promise again that they wouldn't develop nuclear weapons for a few years. President Obama called it an unprecedented achievement, and stupidity, but Iran use that money what? We now know to fund terrorism all over the Middle East as proxies of wars all over the place, killing so many innocent humans in the process, killing innocent civilians around the world. Iran still publicly plotting annihilation of Israel, still burning the U.S. flag, still chanting death to America death to Israel. And Obama's flawed nuclear deal, thankfully because of President Trump, is now totally obsolete. If we don't learn from the past, yes, we are doomed to repeat it. Just like Reagan peace through strength, we can learn from success as well. That's why the president will ultimately open up the spigot of economic opportunity in North Korea if Kim Jong-un agrees to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty which opens up his country to regular unabated checks on his nuclear program. And it will help his people out in the meantime. And he also has to agree to phase out and dismantle all of his nuclear weapons. Accountability, verification, or no deal? Now, as a country that is learning from our past failures, it's critically important, not just abroad, but right here in America with the United States. Our country, in 2010, when former President Obama's fellow Democrats ran Obamacare down your throat, remember, they made a lot of promises again and again. Keep your doctor, keep your plan and save less and lower drug prices. Well, a lot of people lost their doctors, lost their plans and everybody is paying more. All Americans will be insured. It didn't happen. Healthcare costs have skyrocketed, some Americans only have one plan, 27 million Americans today still remain uninsured. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, nearly every far left radical Democrat is pushing Obamacare on steroids, human growth hormone times a million. They're literally calling for every American to lose, you cannot have private health insurance, and let ever so confident federal government, the ones who gave us Obamacare handle it all.

Free child care, free housing, free health, food, government healthy food, free vacations, free family leave, free health care but you can't have private insurer, free, free, free. Oh, and retirement, and you don't even have to work.

Well, all in ten years, by the way, we have our first cost estimate at a meager, oh, up to $94 trillion. Even though the world is to end in 12 years, according to Ocasio-Cortez. Now, this plan would wreck the United States. It would be an unmitigated disaster, nothing but a path to poverty. It would destroy the greatest wealth and innovation producing system that mankind has ever seen, called capitalism. And that's not all. The radical plans keep coming and coming. It's open borders, eliminate ICE. And if they get their way, only the government gets to have a Second Amendment right. In fact, as we speak, House Democrats -- they are prepping a bill that would criminalize many gun sales. And let's never forget their unified opposition to living humans surviving abortions.

Whatever happened to politics ending at the water's edge? You know, it is a pretty heartless act by a group of people just pointed by all things Trump. And as of tomorrow, as the kangaroo court plays out on Capitol Hill, President Trump is going to be fighting for America's interest abroad, flying 25 hours to make the world a safer place, keeping the country and the citizens of the United States safe in the process. Pretty despicable. Joining us now, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan and California Congressman Devin Nunes. Good to see you both. Congressman Jordan, let's start with you. So, in the middle of what is really important issue for the safety, security of the world, rockets haven't been fired over Japan in 15 months.

He's been prosecuted for lying to the FBI, pled guilty and -- I'm sorry, lying to Congress. So, why is he testifying behind closed doors for the House Intelligence Committee? This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever. And what I'm concerned about is, is they will twist things around.

Thank you both. All right. The Democrats is a party of late-term abortion, today, they blocked a bill on infanticide. Newt Gingrich will join us. And later, Jorge Ramos detained in Venezuela. Thankfully, he's safe. He'll tell his story exclusively, straight ahead."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So, the Democrats' far left, extreme, radical agenda now on abortion hitting new levels of radicalism. Quick reminder, by the way, New York passed a law allowing abortion up to the mother's due date. And a barbaric proposal, remember in Virginia nearly succeeded, would have allowed an abortion while a woman begins labor. And remember, disgraced Virginia Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, took it even a step further when describing the process, for letting a baby -- well, first, the baby is going to be born, we'll make the baby comfortable. And then the mother will decide whether or not to resuscitate it or a given medical aid. Now, Senate Democrats, they have blocked the GOP back born alive bill. That would provide medical care to infants who survive failed abortions. Let's be clear here, that is infanticide, plain and simple. And refusing to care for a child born alive, living independently has the support of all 2020 Democratic Senate hopefuls? But they couldn't be more out of touch with the American people. Now, President Trump responded. He tweeted out, quote, Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. Democratic position on abortion is so extreme, they don't mind literally executing babies after birth."

A pro-life group is warning a new proposal will make the state the, quote, abortion capital of America. This and more on Democratic extremism, former speaker of the house and new host of \"Newt's World\" podcast. Look at that. It's amazing. We're very happy to have back, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. I don't even know what to say here. You know, I don't think people could do this to a puppy or a kitten. What they are describing, but they were voting for."

      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think most liberal Democrats would be more upset if you did it to a puppy or a kitten than if you do it to a baby. It's a little hard to understand what has happened psychologically to the Democratic Party that you could add a large group of people. I think all three of the Democratic senators vote in effect to allow the killing of babies who are already born. The position taken, as you point out, by the governor of Virginia, is that it's really OK because we'll keep the baby comfortable while we decide whether or not to kill it. I mean, this is pure infanticide in a way which is unthinkable in most of the world. And if this was a foreign country and we were describing a foreign country which allowed babies to be killed after they were born, even most liberals would be shocked and horrified. But what you are seeing right now -- and I don't know whether it is just a natural maturation of the left over the last 40 years or impartially reaction to Trump, on almost on every front, they now feel compelled to rush to the most extreme positions, even if they are crazy. And someone said the other day, they have now become literally the party of death and taxes. And I think there is a lot to that. And I can't understand on a practical level what they think they are doing. But also, I cannot understand morally. You know, one or two people, yes, but to have every Democratic presidential candidate vote that it is OK to kill babies after they are born puts them in such a small minority, I don't quite see how they think they're going to create a winning campaign."

If you look at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I think that her total share of the vote was 19%, but there was such a small turnout that 19% could elect her. The various cartoons that are now on the internet describing her in ways they're just funny, fit what's happening. This is a person who doesn't know anything, doesn't seem to want to learn anything. But, frankly, it's not just because she's young, interesting woman, look at Bernie Sanders. Here's a guy who's been around forever. He can't even bring himself to say that Maduro in Venezuela is a dictator. Now you look at the entire lifetime of apologizing for the Soviet Union, apologizing for Fidel Castro, Bernie Sanders has never met a Left-winger he didn't like. And so you have this whole thing coming together, partially I think a reaction to Hillary Clinton that she was so unacceptable to most liberals that they've gone further to the Left in response, partially in reacting to Donald Trump. Who, again, is from the standpoint of a Left- winger is so unacceptable. But I'm - I've been around long enough, what I'm reminded of is George McGovern in 1972 and the collapse of the Democratic Party as people began to realize when you go around the country, I don't think there's a single state, not one, in which they can get a majority in favor of killing babies after they're born."

But, boy, it sure a courageous step. You would think that most of the Democrats would have said, we can do this next week when he comes back home.

But now that - and that was an unquestioned human tragedy. Now that that's passed and it's not to be used for political purposes anymore, now it's not an emergency.

But then I show him the kids that you just showed on a garbage truck. And he just couldn't stand it. He stood up he tried to cover the image, so the cameras wouldn't be able to see it. And then I told him, Mr. Maduro - I didn't call him President. I called him Mr. Maduro. What are you doing? Why don't you answer the questions? What you are doing is what dictators do. And then and then he left. One of his ministers came back. They confiscated four cameras, Sean. They took our tape cards where we actually store the interviews and then they detain us for two hours. They took away our cell phones. And at this point - at this point we don't have the cameras, we don't have the interview.

And then one woman she had lost a family member and you know why, they didn't have $30 to pay for antibiotics. So the experiment in Venezuela has failed completely. And you know something?

You should wear your hair like that on the show. Edward asked, \"Where's your helmet HANNITY?\" Sorry no helmets. And before we go, by the way, we do have a big announcement in that UC Berkeley campus assault case. The University of California has concluded its investigation into the February 19th assault on conservative activist Hayden Williams that the media ignored and is seeking a felony warrant for the identified suspect. If a warrant is issued, police will pursue his arrest. We're going to follow this closely, and of course bring you every update. Also finally, we do have a big announcement, and make sure to tune in to this program Thursday night one-on-one exclusive interview with President Trump right after his second historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong- un. It's an exclusive interview. You'll only see here on HANNITY, and we look forward to that. We also - you would think that the rest of the country would forget about red and blue and forget about conservative, liberal, and Republican, Democrat. Maybe we should really hope for the safety and security of our children and the world that the President succeeds. Not hate him like they do over everything - even if he cured cancer. All right.
