You know, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your insurance and it's rolling out. People are seeing that that is not the case. People are seeing that if you can't make a website work after three years, how in the world are you going to deal with millions of health records and keep anything straight? I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that's just not going to happen. And the bill is so complex, we keep finding more and more things in it that somebody obviously didn't know about. If we really want to solve it, it's going to take more than just doctors and patients. It's going to take a willingness to be honest. And I know that may be a difficult thing in Washington, D.C. But, the fact of the matter is, we just need to recognize that this bill was passed because the facts were not on the table. So, if deceit is used to get a bill passed, is it really even legitimate? If we want to be honest, let's sit down and put all the facts on the table and then re-vote and see if it happens. Or, alternatively and preferably, let's just sit down as a bipartisan group and work it out. We can do that.",
