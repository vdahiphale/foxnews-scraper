It's hyperbole. You can criticize the press in America. In fact, Flake kind of worried me when he said that the only objective truth was in the media which is just nuts. If the media would admit it's biased, then accusations of false news would actually fade. It's the biggest lie of all, denying that reporters are not clouded by their own confirmation bias. We know it. It happens here. It happens there. So you have no right to criticize anybody for criticizing the media because it's not about lies. It's about shaping your story based on bias.

And the reporters who sit in that room will never use to get any kind of TV attention are now getting attention. But back to Jeff Flake's floor speech. The first thing is, if he's really so concerned about protecting the first amendment, protecting the press, and why is he bowing out early instead of standing and fighting, keeping his seat in Arizona, and then taking it to the president in a position of power. Instead, he's rolling over and going -- you know, doing this on his last stand. And what he said just wasn't true. He specifically said that this has never happened before. This kind of attack is unprecedented. Politicians, whether you're the president or congress, have always had a precarious relationship. That's the whole point of having a free, independent press, and the government is held accountable. So, they're always going to deal with this. We're going to see this for the next three years, definitely, the next seven if President Trump gets reelected. They need each other.

And you can criticize, like you said, the press. It doesn't mean you're attacking the first amendment. Fake news is the enemy of the Republican Party. President Trump is the only Republican that's actually said it. He's been incredibly open. He just did a 40 minute on the record interview with the New York Times at Mar-a-Lago just walking by. Also did another on the record interview with the Wall Street Journal. Just spoke to Reuters for 45 minutes.   His own doctor told us things we didn't really want to know for an hour in the press room. It was incredibly transparent and you juxtapose that to President Obama who put more whistle-blowers in jail than anybody else, prosecuted them, had Hillary Clinton tying up reporters in ropes. I remember that. Never even went on Fox News, was terrified. And I didn't hear a lot of people saying oh, you know, President Obama is encouraging other leaders across the globe to crack down.

Something tells me big business wouldn't have placed an incoming missile notification next to the frigging light switch. And they wouldn't reassign just one worker. They'd reassign the entire staff to Siberia. But such are liberal priorities: It's not Saturday's catastrophe, but the speed at which citizens can get their cat videos. My theory: The Democrats have fallen in love with resisting Trump so much that they've forgotten that they're supposed to be working to make lives better, not worse. Let's review what else gets Democrats' attention. As the rest of us focus on cop killers, they hold us hostage over DACA; and while the economy charges ahead, they normalize socialism; and while they give citizens heart attacks, they go after the FCC. Yes, did you hear about Sean Shields? He's a dad who nearly died from a massive coronary in Hawaii during that false alarm while he was talking to his kids.

It's hyperbole. You can criticize the press in America. In fact, Flake kind of worried me when he said that the only objective truth was in the media which is just nuts. If the media would admit it's biased, then accusations of false news would actually fade. It's the biggest lie of all, denying that reporters are not clouded by their own confirmation bias. We know it. It happens here. It happens there. So you have no right to criticize anybody for criticizing the media because it's not about lies. It's about shaping your story based on bias.

And the reporters who sit in that room will never use to get any kind of TV attention are now getting attention. But back to Jeff Flake's floor speech. The first thing is, if he's really so concerned about protecting the first amendment, protecting the press, and why is he bowing out early instead of standing and fighting, keeping his seat in Arizona, and then taking it to the president in a position of power. Instead, he's rolling over and going -- you know, doing this on his last stand. And what he said just wasn't true. He specifically said that this has never happened before. This kind of attack is unprecedented. Politicians, whether you're the president or congress, have always had a precarious relationship. That's the whole point of having a free, independent press, and the government is held accountable. So, they're always going to deal with this. We're going to see this for the next three years, definitely, the next seven if President Trump gets reelected. They need each other. Trump likes the attention, whether it's good or bad, and the press certainly likes the attention, especially those in the White House press corps."

And Flake, a noble statesman, but just totally out of control. Stalin killed 20 million people. Trump, the only people he's been killing has been ISIS. And you can criticize, like you said, the press. It doesn't mean you're attacking the first amendment. Fake news is the enemy of the Republican Party. President Trump is the only Republican that's actually said it. He's been incredibly open. He just did a 40 minute on the record interview with the New York Times at Mar-a-Lago just walking by. Also did another on the record interview with the Wall Street Journal. Just spoke to Reuters for 45 minutes. His own doctor told us things we didn't really want to know for an hour in the press room. It was incredibly transparent and you juxtapose that to President Obama who put more whistle-blowers in jail than anybody else, prosecuted them, had Hillary Clinton tying up reporters in ropes. I remember that. Never even went on Fox News, was terrified. And I didn't hear a lot of people saying oh, you know, President Obama is encouraging other leaders across the globe to crack down. When President Obama was using the IRS to crack down on political opponents, I didn't hear Jeff Flake saying, oh, he's inspiring the world leaders to crack down on their political opponents. It's baloney."

I've never actually examined you.\" And that's actually a very serious problem. But on a lighter note, the doctor was up there for so long, and I really think they should've put a time limit on it.

Many of you saw this today, and I thought it was a very special moment for an incredible American.
