Also, Judge Jeanine Pirro-- she'll join us with a preview of her sitdown interview with the president, Donald Trump. But first, the commander-in-chief is not taking the lies, the smear, the slander, the besmirchment any more from the destroy Trump propaganda media and the Democrats. The president has had enough. Tonight, he's fighting back, and that's our \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, so after never-ending fake news coverage from the propaganda media, highlighted by this unprecedented negativity and their bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy theories and outright lies, President Trump tonight is fighting back to set the record straight.  In an interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro that airs right here on the Fox News Channel tomorrow, 9:00 Eastern, the president says he is now contemplating getting rid of White House daily briefings due to this out- of-control media bias. Finally. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Now, we're going to preview more of President Trump's interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro in just a few minutes.   But first, the president -- I will say this tonight. He's absolutely right. If the propaganda destroy Trump media -- and they're going to smear and slander him and his administration and his family and lie about facts and what he's done, why bother? Why waste the energy trying to appease people who obviously hate his guts and want to destroy him and who twist his words and damage him every single day? Now, the president -- he doesn't need fake news media to reach you, the American people. So you know what? As long as they keep reporting fake news, bizarre conspiracy theories and show this bizarre fascination and paranoia about Russia, how about no more press conferences for the Hillary Clinton-colluding media?  Instead, I think every week, the president should tweet out all of his accomplishments going back to day one, update people daily about what he's doing and what he's accomplishing. And the president is also -- he can take to Twitter. He can respond to the barrage of attacks, this ridiculous the conspiracy theory about Russia that is being pushed with no evidence and (ph) collusion.  For example, the president earlier today -- I think it's leading by example. He tweeted again the story that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign was fabricated by Democrats as an excuse for losing the election. Now, you know what? The president's 100 percent right about this. And here's why. As NBC news reported back in December, the Obama administration -- they never made a big deal about Russian election interference before November 8th! Why? Because they thought Hillary was going to win. This only became a huge deal after Hillary lost. And since then, the Democrats and the media, including Hillary herself -- they abused this as an excuse for why she lost so badly. In other words, if Clinton had won, we would not be hearing about this issue every hour of every day. Now, on top of that, as we told you on this program, there is zero -- zero-- evidence of Russia/Trump collusion. None! Now, the president tweeted this in his response. Quote, \"When James Clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt say there's no collusion, when does it end?\"   Now, once again, the president is right to call these hypocrites out. Now, if you don't believe him about collusion -- don't believe him, OK. Let's listen to Obama's national director of intelligence, James Clapper in his own words. Pay attention, biased media!",

It turns out the guy who got fired has a bad memory and says, Oh, gee, it must have been a terrible moment. There's no way to -- this -- this is just child stuff. But second -- I was thinking about this during the break, Sean. I went back one time and read the transcripts of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first press briefings. Here was his rule. They were all off the record. You could quote a senior White House source, but never him. And anybody who broke their confidence if he said it's off the record was never allowed again in the press briefing. That's how he started the very first meeting with the press after he became president. There's a pretty good lesson there. Donald Trump is not the chief entertainer of the United States. He's not the chief wrestling match with the elite media. He is the president of the United States with big job and some very big goals. And what they ought to do is get out of all this junk. They ought to focus on the big goals. They ought to report to the nation on the big goals, ignore all these reporters, close down the press room, send the reporters off.

I don't have a lot of time, Peter, but in this day and age of fake news, we know a series of crimes that were committed. Let's start with e-mail server scandal. The legal standard is gross negligence. Comey said she was extremely reckless. I don't know what the difference in the terminology is. Offsite, she's not allowed to move it. She destroyed some top secret, special access program, classified information. She deleted e-mails, that also included classified, all those are felonies, aren't they? PETER SCHWEIZER, \"CLINTON CASH\" AUTHOR: That's exactly right. Look, Sean, I've said from the beginning on the Russian election thing, let's investigate it and see where the evidence leads. We already know where the evidence leads in the case of the Clintons. Whether it is the e-mail scandal or Clinton Foundation, you have laws that were broken, you have financial transaction that have taken place. And the people gave the money got benefit. There is far more on the scales of justice as it relates to the Clintons as it does to Donald Trump. And so I think we need to be consistent here. Those who are saying investigate Trump, why are they not saying, yes, we also need to pursue the Clintons. There is far more evidence there.",

      "utterance": "Now, we're going to preview more of President Trump's interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro in just a few minutes. But first, the president -- I will say this tonight. He's absolutely right. If the propaganda destroy Trump media -- and they're going to smear and slander him and his administration and his family and lie about facts and what he's done, why bother? Why waste the energy trying to appease people who obviously hate his guts and want to destroy him and who twist his words and damage him every single day? Now, the president -- he doesn't need fake news media to reach you, the American people. So you know what? As long as they keep reporting fake news, bizarre conspiracy theories and show this bizarre fascination and paranoia about Russia, how about no more press conferences for the Hillary Clinton-colluding media? Instead, I think every week, the president should tweet out all of his accomplishments going back to day one, update people daily about what he's doing and what he's accomplishing. And the president is also -- he can take to Twitter. He can respond to the barrage of attacks, this ridiculous the conspiracy theory about Russia that is being pushed with no evidence and (ph) collusion. For example, the president earlier today -- I think it's leading by example. He tweeted again the story that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign was fabricated by Democrats as an excuse for losing the election. Now, you know what? The president's 100 percent right about this. And here's why. As NBC news reported back in December, the Obama administration -- they never made a big deal about Russian election interference before November 8th! Why? Because they thought Hillary was going to win. This only became a huge deal after Hillary lost. And since then, the Democrats and the media, including Hillary herself -- they abused this as an excuse for why she lost so badly. In other words, if Clinton had won, we would not be hearing about this issue every hour of every day. Now, on top of that, as we told you on this program, there is zero -- zero-- evidence of Russia/Trump collusion. None! Now, the president tweeted this in his response. Quote, \"When James Clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt say there's no collusion, when does it end?\" Now, once again, the president is right to call these hypocrites out. Now, if you don't believe him about collusion -- don't believe him, OK. Let's listen to Obama's national director of intelligence, James Clapper in his own words. Pay attention, biased media!"

He's actually now claiming, Well, I'm not sure. Now, this just shows you how desperate the left, the propaganda media are at this point in time. They want to destroy Trump and they've been trying ever since November 9th. They can't believe Hillary lost! Now, we have been exposing them to be the total hypocrites they are and the conspiracy theorists they are. They will do and say anything at this point in time to take down this president.

This is probably going to be the single best montage we've ever put on our show. But back to my point. The propaganda media is beyond pathetic at this point. They have become lapdogs and for the Democrats and the alt radical left in this country. So I'm saying tonight let's stop pretending. The propaganda media is exactly that. They are propaganda. They're out to destroy Trump. That is their main purpose. They want to advance the interests of liberal Democrats and the left. Now, they're not journalists. They're not reporters. They're rigid, radical left-wing ideologues. Let's call it for what it is! Now, the president does not need to be abused endlessly. And by the way, don't forget they were proven to have colluded with Hillary Clinton vis-a- vis (ph) Wikileaks. They were in her camp! Do you need any more evidence?

And that's the base of their day is to track down the horrible thing that they know has happened. And I think, frankly, the president ought to shift gears entirely, get off all of this Washington insider baloney, go back to changing the government, draining the swamp, passing reforms, repealing regulations, doing the kind of things the country cares about, attracting new business in America, get back to substance. All around him, he's -- he's got a cabinet that's doing really good work, and they'd be much better off to eliminate the Washington press corps and do a daily briefing for the country of the things that the president and the administration are doing. There are plenty of things being done at the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce. Let the country see what a real administration focused on substance is like, and ignore the press corps. I mean, it doesn't do the president any good to get involved in some Twitter fight with The New York Times and CBS News and all these guys. Just gives them a new excuse to avoid the real news.

But second -- I was thinking about this during the break, Sean. I went back one time and read the transcripts of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first press briefings. Here was his rule. They were all off the record. You could quote a senior White House source, but never him. And anybody who broke their confidence if he said it's off the record was never allowed again in the press briefing. That's how he started the very first meeting with the press after he became president. There's a pretty good lesson there. Donald Trump is not the chief entertainer of the United States. He's not the chief wrestling match with the elite media. He is the president of the United States with big job and some very big goals. And what they ought to do is get out of all this junk. They ought to focus on the big goals. They ought to report to the nation on the big goals, ignore all these reporters, close down the press room, send the reporters off. They can sit over at the Hay-Adams. They can go to Starbucks across the street. I don't care where they go."

This is music to my ears, and I had not seen the interview until now. And that was my opening monologue for the most, shut it down. In the age of social media, I'll give you an example. NBC does an interview. Don't do interviews with the networks so they can spend hours and hours and hours tearing up every word the president says, something they would never do to Obama. End it.

And it is covered up. And all of the lunacy is really a result of the press. The man is working hard. He is delivering on an agenda. He got a house health care passed.

And what they do is they take their moment and act like they are so tough before their audiences, and that is all their going to play. They are not playing any of the substantive issues. I would also use social media to advance, as I said earlier, all the president's successes. Let me go to another cut you have. The assistant associate deputy attorney general Rosenstein said earlier today there is no need for a special independent prosecutor.

You have the House investigation, you have the Senate investigation. You're going to have a new FBI director. You're going to have an interim FBI director all committed, and a new commission, all committed to finding out any truth about this. But that is not the narrative. Clapper and others have said there's no there, there. There's no evidence of collusion --"

If they never come up with it, should this simply overshadow all of the successes of the president, and there are many of them. And for me it was frustrating because I wanted to talk about all of these successes, the public wants to hear about it. So then you say, OK, well, maybe use your social media, and then he uses social media and then he gets hammered for twitters, for tweeting, I should say. So it is just a no-win."

If I was him I would tweet out every week all of his successes from day one as I said from my opening monologue, and I would give updates, what he did this week. And it goes directly to millions and millions of people and goes viral. Judge, congrats on the interview. Thanks for being with us.

So here are two ideas that the president should consider seriously, and that is you rotate in different reporters. Monday, make it traditional White House press corps. That's fine. But then on Tuesday only business reporters are at the press briefings, because remember, the number one issue for voters every four years is always the economy or its jobs, and we never see questions about those items during these press briefings.

The world has changed and the mainstream media needs to catch up with the fact that we're in a different world. But let me take it a step further. Talk about a checkmate today, you talk about Twitter. The president saying watch what you when you testify, Mr. Comey. And then what is the response from James Comey. I'm not going to appear before the Senate. Checkmate by the president to James Comey."

Coming up, we'll speak to the man who exposed how the Clintons made their cash, and it was through corruption. Peter Schweizer is next, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "President Trump and his supporters, they believe during the campaign that Hillary should have been prosecuted and likely put behind bars. Now the former FBI director James Comey has been fired. Should the agency reopen their investigation into the Clintons? By the way, now for real news, for real investigative work is the presidential of the Government Accountability Institute and author of \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,\" Peter Schweizer. The prime minister that spoke out that, yes, Clinton asked her for cash, which, by the way, break out. I don't have a lot of time, Peter, but in this day and age of fake news, we know a series of crimes that were committed. Let's start with e-mail server scandal. The legal standard is gross negligence. Comey said she was extremely reckless. I don't know what the difference in the terminology is. Offsite, she's not allowed to move it. She destroyed some top secret, special access program, classified information. She deleted e-mails, that also included classified, all those are felonies, aren't they? PETER SCHWEIZER, \"CLINTON CASH\" AUTHOR: That's exactly right. Look, Sean, I've said from the beginning on the Russian election thing, let's investigate it and see where the evidence leads. We already know where the evidence leads in the case of the Clintons. Whether it is the e-mail scandal or Clinton Foundation, you have laws that were broken, you have financial transaction that have taken place. And the people gave the money got benefit. There is far more on the scales of justice as it relates to the Clintons as it does to Donald Trump. And so I think we need to be consistent here. Those who are saying investigate Trump, why are they not saying, yes, we also need to pursue the Clintons. There is far more evidence there."

As secretary of state be, she signed off on a waiver that allowed 20 percent of American's uranium to end up in the hands of Russia and all the people surrounding that deal donated millions and millions, you can tell me how much to the Clinton donation, and Bill doubled his speaking fee in Moscow, and Putin has 20 percent of the uranium which is the core ingredient to build nuclear weapons."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Sean. If you look at the 2008 election, I actually in \"Clinton Cash\" quote Russian officials as saying in that election Hillary Clinton was their preferred candidate over Barack Obama in the primary and certainly preferable to the Republicans. So she was the choice. There were a number of actions that she took as secretary of state that were enormously beneficial to Russia. The Uranium deal you talked about. You also have a technology transfer initiative, so enormous favors flowed to Putin and to Russia. You also had a lot of money that flowed the other way. And that's the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "That's right. It's the FBI and it's the department of justice, because we know in the Clinton Foundation investigation the FBI wanted subpoenas to get more information and the Obama Department of Justice refused to give them subpoena power. I think that may very well change in the Trump administration."
