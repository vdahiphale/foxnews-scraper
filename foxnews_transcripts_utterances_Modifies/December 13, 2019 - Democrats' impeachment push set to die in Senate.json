You're trivializing impeachment. And I tell you what. Someday there'll be a Democrat president, and there'll be a Republican House. And I suspect they're going to remember it. I'll do whatever I want. Look, there is, we did nothing wrong. So, I'll do long or short. I wouldn't mind a long process because I'd like to see the whistleblower who's a fraud."

They remind me of the time me and my brother in law, we were sitting at home and we decided we were going to drive four hours to Reno, Nevada, to gamble. And so, we got in the car, we drove. And as we got to Reno, we realized that we needed to go to bed. But we'd already committed--."

So the independents are like, we're not for this. Maybe. I'm not saying the election is going to be a breeze for President Trump, but at least for independents, they're like let's just handle this at the ballot box. Can I make a prediction?"

And Pelosi had said, remember, she already broke that one promise. Right. She said,\" I am not for impeachment unless it's bipartisan.\" The only bipartisan vote she could get right now is against impeachment."

Yeah Trump's message got out there and I don't think it helps Biden you know, as we approach the general election, that that's your point. But I think that, you know, to the larger point here today, if there's a prediction to be made next week, you can bet your whole dollar on it when you get to Vegas. The House will impeach Donald Trump and he'll be the third president in U.S. history to be impeached and he'll be impeached for a lot of very strong reasons, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. You know, today, Nancy Pelosi put out a video, and in the video, she had Republicans, former Republicans who were very clear, you know what we can't take this Trump stuff anymore, this abuse, this kind of attitude. You know, she had people saying, you know, she --"

Who is the incoming president? Here's the Democrats like to act like they have the high the moral high ground on this and they're talking down to the American people. Less than 10 percent of Republicans support impeachment. The independents nationwide never got above 50 percent in terms of support. And to have a moral high ground, they're sitting a top, a heaping steaming pile of donkey dong and they can't smell how bad it is because they're so wrapped up in their own story. This impeachment narrative started before President Trump was even nominated to the Repub -- as the Republican candidate. It's gone on and on. There were dozens of stories right after the election that called for impeaching the president. There was one University of Utah professor who argued that Trump could be impeached immediately because of the Trump University fraud, quote unquote. This is just as smelly as that."

And the Republicans faced a big deficit in popularity after impeaching President Clinton. Impeachment actually strengthened President Clinton. And now I think you're kind of just seeing it repeated and it's the same thing like with the shutdown. Remember, the shutdown doesn't help anybody. The Schumer shut down and the Democrats thought, oh, this is really going to hurt President Trump, and it didn't."

Twenty-two months is a speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who said, I don't want to do this. Who was standing up against the far-right fringes that never liked him?

But if you can look over there and you can see what's happening could happen to you. It's like when your buddy takes the drug 20 minutes before you do, and you can sit there and go, \"If it's any good, I'll take it.\" But you'll just let them take it first. And then if they have a bad trip, you skip it. This is not something I know personally, but I have seen that happen. But I think this is the result of England embracing identity politics. I think that's kind of the bigger issue here. And it's not just Boris Johnson, it's that -- it's how the country's changing and how, you know, Jeremy Corbyn is embracing the, \"He/him,\" you know, announcing his pronoun. I think people have had enough of that. And I think the AOC endorsement of Jeremy really, really helped him a lot."

The mainstream media conventional wisdom has been so wrong on pretty much everything when it comes to Brexit, Boris, Trump, the dossier, collusion, this upcoming recession that we never had. There's no other industry in the entire world where people can consistently get things wrong and still have a job. And that's why I think the people that own these media companies don't actually care about accuracy. They just want to hear a certain thing said. They don't care if it's right or wrong. They just want to hear it. It's like if you had a weatherman, they got, like, the wrong report day after day, or a stockbroker that every time he told you to invest, the place went down to the street. These people would have no jobs. But everybody in the media continues to cash paychecks and it's just embarrassing every single day. And I'm going to continue to point it out."

      "utterance": "Well, no, but I think in this case, Jeremy Corbyn is certainly not charismatic. I mean, even if you were to say, well, is he analogous to Bernie Sanders on the left? Well, you know, I don't think anybody's saying that Bernie Sanders is an anti-Semite. You know, I don't think the people think -- people might disagree with Bernie Sanders, but a lot of people, especially young people, are quite taken with his personality. That's not Jeremy Corbyn."

And I'll add a couple of points. When you put a camera in your kid's bedroom, you're literally inviting the entire connected world, the entire Internet into your child's safe space, if you will. Nobody who's really serious about hacking would ever do this kind of crap. This is Bush League, to quote the congressman. These are punks.

When we had eight track tape players, we had eight track tape player theft from your cars broke. Everybody had broken windows in the 70s. It drove us crazy.

And so -- t's a marking of time passing. That's why when you hear this stuff, it gets you angry. But that's not all. I hate holiday music with such a passion because it's foisted on you. You're being indoctrinated into other people's merriment. You have no control over it. I want to control what I listen to. I'm for capitalism, have Christmas every day. If it helps the economy.
