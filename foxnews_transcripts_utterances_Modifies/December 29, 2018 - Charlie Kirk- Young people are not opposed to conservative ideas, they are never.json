There's a tremendous amount of self-serving there and you see it in the negotiations for principled solutions versus what actually gets negotiated.

You know, unemployment has stayed pretty good at 3.7%, but there was some volatility in the stock market that we saw you know in mid-December.

But you also have to think about what he did with President Xi of China. He said, we're going to put a temporary stay on putting more tariffs on you and that was supposed to bring the market to these amazing numbers and for a period, the market was up over a three-day period, the highest it has been in six years.  So the market responded, but it is very fickle, and now what we're seeing, Judge, over the last two or three or four weeks is, every time the market goes down, whether it's 10 points or 50 points, they're now blaming the President; unlike for all those times where it's at record highs, under hisadministration, they never gave him credit.",

When we brought up a DACA only fix, we brought up something to take care of the victims of the ambition of their parents, we suddenly discovered that the other side wanted nothing to do with that. They wanted comprehensive or nothing. If it does nothing else, it shows that no matter what we do, we're going to have to do it probably without the other side's help because they don't really want a fix to illegal immigration.

      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Those are several great questions. The one that I think listeners would not be surprised or viewers would not be surprised but that really does burn me is the difference between what people say on the campaign trail and what they do in my party. In other words, we want to end the death tax. No, they don't. They just don't want to pay it themselves. We want to lower taxes and, no, we really just want to lower taxes on ourselves. There's a tremendous amount of self-serving there and you see it in the negotiations for principled solutions versus what actually gets negotiated. It's one of the reasons that so many of these tax deals are temporary. It's one of the things that's exciting about part of the President's tax reform, which is, it's permanent."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

I understand you have to be with your party to make sure you get your agenda done, but sometimes as I look at Paul Ryan, as I look at what happened with some of the committees and Paul Ryan not being willing, you know, to kind of hit the button on a lot of stuff going on with respect to Comey and you know, we saw at the end of December, you know James Comey comes and testifies at a House - before House committees. It's way too late. Nothing can be done. I wonder if they really believe in what they're saying or if it's just theater to them."

      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "You know, in Congress there's always somebody who really believes it and then there's the rest of the Congress and certainly that this latest thing with bringing in Comey really is an example of too little too late. On the other hand, there are things that are still being worked on as we get to the end of the Congress and one of them for example, it's pretty technical, but it's some of the immigration reform stuff that has broad support that actually still get done, that the President has talked about and asked for these high-tech immigrant the H1-B's and so on."

      "utterance": "Yes, I know and you know what? Now, I feel like I'm part of your club, but listen, you know, what the Congressman and I didn't have time to talk about, I want to talk to you guys about is the economy. We saw the GDP in 2018 hit record highs, but then it started to falter a little bit at the end of the year. You know, unemployment has stayed pretty good at 3.7%, but there was some volatility in the stock market that we saw you know in mid-December. What's going on and what can the President do to make sure that he can continue to deliver on the message that apparently the House couldn't deliver on, Corey?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think part of it is as you know, this President has focused in American trade policy on renegotiating bad trade deals. When you look at what he's done between Canada and Mexico and the United States, getting rid of NAFTA and renegotiating that, that's a positive. But you also have to think about what he did with President Xi of China. He said, we're going to put a temporary stay on putting more tariffs on you and that was supposed to bring the market to these amazing numbers and for a period, the market was up over a three-day period, the highest it has been in six years. So the market responded, but it is very fickle, and now what we're seeing, Judge, over the last two or three or four weeks is, every time the market goes down, whether it's 10 points or 50 points, they're now blaming the President; unlike for all those times where it's at record highs, under hisadministration, they never gave him credit."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "No, Barack Obama destroyed our economy. This President has taken the last two years to build it up whether it's bringing manufacturing jobs back, whether it is the energy sector, whether it is renegotiating these bad trade deals. I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the markets and I'm not an economist, but I'm a political guy and I look at the investigations that are about to beset this President and this White House. You're going to see a White House that is going to be under siege by the Democratic controlled House here very shortly and you're going to see a White House that is naturally going to constrict in its ability to get a legislative agenda through, as well as other priorities on the economy. And that's a big deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "It didn't do. Well because the House is known for passing things and then letting the Senate fail to do it. This time, there were a lot of things we didn't pass. We didn't even send them to the Senate as the President wanted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but the economy is so good, why didn't Republicans win and keep the House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "You know, the economy is an interesting and fickle thing. In a good economy, a lot of Republicans don't get really excited in turnout. Democrats looking at Donald Trump and despising him did turnout. But you know, one of the things about the economy, some people score the economy based on 3.7% unemployment and so on, how about we score it like it was the real battle that it is between us and the Chinese. Last quarter, Chinese 1.3% growth. Less than two months ago, I was at the World Economic Forum in China. Company after company told me about their leaving China. They're building their new factory in Vietnam or South Korea. The fact is --"

    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, no, there's a lot of being built in the U.S. and we see those every day, but we don't see what's moving out of China just to move out of China. What China is dealing with is - we're in this so-called war and we're winning it. Yes, we're growing at X rate, but China has decelerated from its typical over 10% to 1.3%. They are in a freefall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, what I'm going to do right now, is I know we have a question from our audience and I believe, sir, Ernie, I'll just call you Ernie. You're Ernie, right? All right, Ernie. Ernie's question is what does the situation with China mean for the economy and could things get worse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think I just gave you a part of that. China is in a freefall. China still has more than half a billion people. They are trying to get modern 21st Century jobs for and they don't have a way to get it and the rest of the world is starting to eat their lunch and they have an inflation problem and quite frankly, they've gone back to being a communist dictatorship. So that's where China is. What does it mean for us? It means that we're going to have a more diverse group of vendors for the United States, our partnership with Canada, our partnership with Mexico, renegotiated under this President is going to grow."

They have blocked us from putting our exports there for a long time because they didn't want to compete against the United States. But that renegotiation is - everything is witnessed at the ballot box. When people are doing well, they have to ask themselves a very simple question which was asked under the Clinton administration, in the Obama administration for a reelection effort. Am I better off today than I was two or four years ago? And you look at economic security, you look at Homeland Security and you look at national security, every economic indicator of those issues says, \"Yes, we are stronger today under the Trump administration than we were two years ago,\" which bodes very well for a reelection campaign."

The truth is, I don't think so because every economic indicator is showing that we're still expanding, our economy is growing. It's not receding. We have to be very cautious of the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates. It's something the President has been very candid about. He's been very vocal about it. We have to understand, people are finally having more money in their pockets for the first time in literally a decade. Under the Bush and then the Obama economy, people didn't have job opportunities and not just the new jobs, but what you're seeing in our economy right now is people who have jobs, have opportunities to move to other places that didn't exist because the deregulation that this President has impacted in our environment which means more economic opportunities for everybody."

All right, Madam Attorney General, you know America is split on this issue of immigration and as we go into the next segment with a couple of new guests that I'm not going to mention to you, we're going to talk about young people and how they view it. But the truth is that this President has been getting a beating on immigration and the border issue starting with the separation of kids from family members.

That's why it's called Homeland Security. It's our homeland."

We've seen the gang, SUR-13. I've been to Mexico dealing, helping the good Attorneys General from Mexico training them on how to protect their country and work well with our country.

      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we can both take this, but first, the President came up with the four pillars plan for immigration because we're a country made up of immigrants and he understands that, most of Congress understands that, but again it has to be done in a legal way, just like you came into this country. And so that's - he has a plan I think we're almost 1.8 million people could become citizens."

      "utterance": "Let me try to get you to buy into it in a different way for a moment. Before we agreed and the numbers were very different depending upon whose bill to take those who were clearly brought here as children and had no other life; in other words, the victims of their parents or family members' misconduct before we offer to fix for that under President Trump's leadership. The Democrats were constantly using it to claim that we didn't care. When we brought up a DACA only fix, we brought up something to take care of the victims of the ambition of their parents, we suddenly discovered that the other side wanted nothing to do with that. They wanted comprehensive or nothing. If it does nothing else, it shows that no matter what we do, we're going to have to do it probably without the other side's help because they don't really want a fix to illegal immigration. They want open borders. So I tell people, the reason we did it was because it was the right thing to help some of these victims. The reason we continue to push it is because it shows that the people who want sanctuary cities and open borders will settle for nothing less."

But in the long run, there's a combination of don't fund - don't provide funds that only are there if there's a quid pro quo, if there's a balance between what the state is doing and what the Federal government is doing. Write all of these programs of Federal dollars to in fact require reciprocal behavior. As we do that, then the Court would say, \"You're right.

Two young children both from Guatemala died earlier this month while in government custody. His comments came as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met with the medical staff at the border in Arizona. Meanwhile, Russian and Turkish officials agree to coordinate ground operations in Syria. Top leaders of the two countries met in Moscow.

We will learn the answer and meet our new surprise guests, \"Justice\" is back in a moment."

What do you think 70%? I've got a few - how many of you think they identify more with conservatives? Now wait a minute, this ain't making sense. Nobody raised their hand for conservatives and only about 70% for liberals, but anyway let's bring out a few people who are changing the way we think young people look at conservativism. A big welcome to Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk; Turning Point Communications Director, Candice Owens, and adviser to the 2020 Trump campaign, Katrina Pierson. Hi, everybody. Welcome. Great to have you all here. All right, so I believe that most young people or more young people identify with liberals than conservatives and Candace Owens, I'll start with you. Is that - do you think that's right or am I totally off-base?"

      "utterance": "It's not that young people are opposed to conservative ideas, it's just they're not exposed to them at all in the first place and you know, Candace and I, we did a historic campus tour this last year. I think we're the only conservative duo to go to Stanford, UC Berkeley and UCLA in a span of a month and lived to tell about it."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Where do you think it started? You know, Katrina you were in the 2016 race. I mean, you were a spokesman. You all recognize Katrina. She was the spokesman for the President. I mean, why the dissidence? Why is there such an inability to get young people to come out and why are campuses the feeding ground for hate for people on the right? KATRINA PIERSON, ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well. I think Charlie is right. A lot of it is exposure. A lot of people say, \"Well, Donald Trump has a millennial problem,\" and I say, no, the GOP has a millennial problem and it is because so many people have not been exposed to conservative principles or conservative values and those who are exposed to them, they're being preached to and not spoken to. And I think that has caused a huge disconnect with a large number of young people. On top of that, you have most of the professors in the universities who are very liberal and you top that off with the fake news media; 60% of millennials think Donald Trump is a racist. I'm a black woman and he chose me to represent his 2016 Presidential campaign. It's ridiculous."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Well, first and foremost, we don't pay attention too much of the polls. I mean they told us that Hillary was going to win and they were 80% sure and she's not sitting in the Oval Office last I checked, but look, I think that this President in particular is going to appeal a lot more to the youth generation because something about him feels very punk-rock and rebellious. He is a rebellious President. He is rebelling against the establishment. He is rebelling against the mainstream media. And it's something that we identify with. When you're younger, you're sort of in a more rebellious phase and it's something that this country needs to rebel against these socialist principles that are being taught on the left."

You see states like New York and California where younger voters are becoming more and more radical where they consider Nancy Pelosi to be a moderate, which is kind of horrifying to think about. You're going to see more of those Ocasio-Cortez type candidates, but you look at Florida, you look at now governor-elect Ron DeSantis what he was able to do there, it's absolutely amazing to energize younger voters and even African-American female voters in a way that really defied conventional norms."

      "utterance": "Yes, my question had to do with 2020 in the election coming up. It's not too early to plan for it and there are some that are saying that in the suburbs, we lost ground. I'm wondering how we can make up for it when we have 92 % of the media going against us."

    {
      "speaker": "PIERSON",
      "utterance": "Well we lost a little bit of ground in the suburbs, but in some areas, we didn't. I don't know if those numbers have come out yet, but I'll also say you know, one of the things that the President is very good at is you know, speaking directly to the American public, which is why the rallies are so important and why going to college campuses would be an amazing opportunity to talk directly to young people because what President Trump does - what most politicians at least on the Republican side doesn't do is speak directly about the issues. For so long, you've had GOP candidates who want to talk about philosophy and they want to talk about their 341-point plan to fix the economy. What Donald Trump just says, \"I'm going to bring you jobs. I'm going do X, Y and Z to do it,\" and that's what young people want. They want to know that when they get out of college, they're going to have a job. They want to know that their future is bright."

I think that black America is paying attention right now and that he should go there he should speak to them because as the left appeals more and more to illegal aliens, there's one group of individuals that are being forgotten about and that's black America."

You're going to see you - may see Hillary back in in this, but look, I think Joe Biden is going to run. I think Hillary is going to run. I think Elizabeth Warren is going to run. We know that Cory Booker is going to run, Kamila Harris is going to run. Michael Bloomberg, right? And so the question is going to be who can go as far to the left as possible --"

He's sort of - he's sort of the guy that wants to be like the outsider candidate like the Trump to get out there and represent the party just to defeat Trump, but his platform is just anti-Trump and the President has done such a great job at keeping his campaign promises. What are you going to do? You're going to run against a great economy? You're going to run against all of the amazing opportunity that's now available to Americans? They don't even have a platform to run on."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

You know, I was in Jerusalem for the opening of the embassy that the President promised and the people in Israel, I mean on every street corner, \"We love Donald Trump. Thank you, America.\" Why isn't not like that here, David?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the reasons is that the Democratic Party and along with the mainstream media have decided that they were going to create a narrative and then defeat this President in his reelection. First, they tried to defeat him during the campaign, then they tried to delegitimize him during the transition and now, they've spent the last two years working to undermine this President. Look, there are people in this - in the Democratic Party and elsewhere that hate this President more than they love the country and they're doing damage to our country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well and Corey, the next two years are going to be even worse given the fact that the House is absolutely going to start these hearings and go after - they're going to subpoena everybody, I mean, they're going subpoena housekeepers who work for the Trump's. I mean, I don't know that anyone who wasn't around that family isn't going to be under stress and investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge when you look at what has now happened, right, we knew that Trump had enemies in Congress. Some of those were Republicans, but now that the Democrats have taken over, they have already said they're going to use the power of the subpoena to move their agenda forward. So in other words, look, we just saw the most progressive member which is a very scary thing of the Democratic Party threatening to subpoena Donald Trump, Jr. because of a tweet he put out, right? Just recently. And if that is not abuse of government power of an incoming member of Congress to threaten the private citizens because they don't like what we said on Twitter, we should be very afraid. We should be very afraid of the power that some of these people have and how they're going to abuse it."

Nancy Pelosi is not going to be able to control them and so the American people are going to in 2020 be able to look back and see exactly what they did."
