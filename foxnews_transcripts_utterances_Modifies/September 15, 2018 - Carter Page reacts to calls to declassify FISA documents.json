      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, HOST",
      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice,\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. First, I just want to take a moment to say our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of and affected by tropical storm Florence, including my sister and her husband who live just outside of Wilmington. To everyone, please stay safe. We'll have an update on the storm at the bottom of the hour. And as always, a big thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for making \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals\" continue to stay on that old New York Times bestsellers list. We have a big show on deck for you tonight with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee, Tom Fitton, Carter Page to name just a few of the great guests that we have standing by.  But first, my open. Tonight is more than an open. It's who I am. It's what I know and what I did for over three decades. As a prosecutor, a superior court judge as well as elected district attorney. The way it works is you are innocent until you are proven guilty. Clear, unambiguous words etched in stone. Why would anyone ignore this truth, especially the ranking Democrat on Senate Judiciary, Senator Dianne Feinstein, is stunning. But you shouldn't be surprised. The left is committed to the removal of a duly elected president, the destruction of our system of capitalism, and now an all-out assault on our system of justice.  To them you are guilty - guilty until proven innocent. But no one in all the years I've spent in courtrooms has ever been able to prove a negative. So forget the time-honored notion like due process, probable cause, beyond a reasonable doubt or a jury of your peers. Today, unsupported, uncorroborated, untested words, not facts are sufficient to convict not just in the court of public opinion, but in the esteemed hallowed halls of the United States Senate.  Forget the right to counsel, the ability to defend yourself, the right confront your accuser or even cross-examine your accuser. Truth in this scheme is nothing more than collateral damage if a Republican is on the receiving end of an anonymous allegation. So Dianne, let me see if I get this. Another Democrat, a congresswoman from California, no less, forwards a July letter to you containing a completely unsubstantiated claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while in high school tried to force himself on another high school student almost 40, I said 40 years ago.  Kavanaugh for anyone who even cares has categorically and unequivocally denied the allegation. So why are we just hearing being this now? Dianne, when you get the letter, what do you do to make sure it's real? That the person is even real? Given the left's penchant to buy fake dossiers, make up facts and collude with the media to sabotage even the President of the United States, forgive me if I think it's all hogwash. Okay, you say quote, \"The individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. And I honored have that decision.\" Dianne, you honored that decision. Did you even speak to this alleged person? Did you meet with her, talk with her, interview her? Did you ask her to meet with others? Did you ask why she said nothing for almost 40 years? And Dianne, why would you wait to even send it to the FBI? Is it because nothing in you and your pack of demon rats, that's what I said, demon rats, aka, Democrats bag of tricks was working against Kavanaugh. Nothing was working that you were doing beginning with Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and every unhinged lunatic you could find.",

      "sentences": "Then, Dianne, you've been sitting on this letter for almost two months. You let Brett Kavanaugh go through days of Senate hearings, meeting with Senators, answered then additional 263 pages of 1,300 follow- up written questions, and now, you want to character assassinate this man who has undergone six FBI full field investigations where no such allegation resembling this anonymous nonsense has ever surfaced?  Dianne, as a Ranking Member of the committee interviewing Kavanaugh, how could you possibly let a moment pass without addressing the issue when Kavanaugh was right in front of you and would have had the opportunity to respond? What were you thinking? Are you stupid? Why would you let it go? Let me tell you why you let it go, Dianne. Because even you didn't believe it. What other reason could there be?   Now, I know about women who have been sexually assaulted and the kind of pain they go through. It is different from other crimes. It lingers and rears its head throughout their lives. I have prosecuted on their behalf for decades. One of the ways that we establish their credibility is with how recent their complaint is. A recent outcry is enormously powerful. An anonymous one almost 40 years later, not so much, Dianne. But silence? I guess, I shouldn't be surprised. You bozos in Congress actually had a fund of taxpayers' money, our money, to pay congressional staffers who were victims of sexual misconduct by your coworkers. It's a fund that even you as a woman, a powerful senator kept quiet about. Whose side are you on? Does it depend on the politics? Does it depend on the politics of the accused? Your audacity to destroy and try to destroy a man with impeccable credentials, harm his family and shift the burden of proof to the accused by alleging one of the most of heinous allegations imaginable shows your complete disregard for truth, justice and the American way. That's my open. Do you think Dianne Feinstein is a liar, leaker or liberal? Or all three? There is only one way to find out. My new book, New York Times number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, & Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" All right, joining me now with reaction to my open, and to discuss the vital issue of conservative censorship, House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Chairman, thank you very much for being with us.  Now, who needs a Constitution or a system of justice when after all of these months, after Brett Kavanaugh has been in the public eye and under scrutiny, and Dianne Feinstein at the 11th hour says, \"Hey, I've got this anonymous letter almost 40 years ago. He sexually abused somebody, but we are not going to - we didn't bring it up until just now.\" What took them so long?",

Remember, he has done all the background checks by working in the White House. He has been appointed a judge so he had to go through there as well. It's never came up and why would they wait until after. But also remember, Senator Feinstein, her own body person, her driver, we found out worked for the Chinese government, and we didn't find that out for a couple of years later. So remember what we're dealing with here. This is politics. This is how far this country has split apart. Whereas they would print just as the New York Times an anonymous letter without a name. So now, they are going forward with this. This is the wrong thing to do by the wrong person.

They say the leak of the dossier in the beginning of the Trump administration to CNN and Buzzfeed, they said, \"Well, maybe we can use this as a pretext to go out and interview people.\" So this leak strategy, it looks like, that they know it was happening. It was either coming out of their sister agencies, the FBI has acknowledged to be involved in stories. And of course, they knew that Christopher Steele was leaking information and Fusion GPS was leaking information. They didn't tell the FISA courts any of that.  So they were spying on President Trump through Spygate. They were taking up the Trump organizations and the Trump campaign's phone records. They were targeting Carter Page with an illegal FISA warrant, targeting the Trump campaign, Trump with an illegal FISA warrant, through this Page warrant. And it's all part of that strategy was the leak of all that classified investigative activity to the media to make Trump look bad.

He never talked about the record unemployment for minorities, and now suddenly, after Donald Trump delivers on the very things he said he would do, it was all because President Obama had laid all of the groundwork. This is incredible. I've never seen anything quite like it. But the one thing I will remind you, do you remember when President Trump, then candidate, was talking about what the economy was going to look under him, President Obama said, that's not going to happen, it would take a miracle and he just completely poohed the idea. Well, the President, President Trump promised it, delivered it, and now suddenly Barack Obama grabs the baton and jumps in front of the parade and says I was leading it all the time.",

And Debra Messing had said, \"Brett Kavanaugh went to an all boys school. How quickly you can get 65 names. It's almost as though you knew about the accusations of sexual assault and tried to hide it, but they prepared with the names just in case.\" So Debra Messing and then Chelsea Handler all say that because he went to an all boys school he most probably assaulted a woman as Dianne Feinstein came out and delivered this anonymous letter at the 11th hour that I did my open on tonight.

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice,\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. First, I just want to take a moment to say our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of and affected by tropical storm Florence, including my sister and her husband who live just outside of Wilmington. To everyone, please stay safe. We'll have an update on the storm at the bottom of the hour. And as always, a big thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for making \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals\" continue to stay on that old New York Times bestsellers list. We have a big show on deck for you tonight with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee, Tom Fitton, Carter Page to name just a few of the great guests that we have standing by. But first, my open. Tonight is more than an open. It's who I am. It's what I know and what I did for over three decades. As a prosecutor, a superior court judge as well as elected district attorney. The way it works is you are innocent until you are proven guilty. Clear, unambiguous words etched in stone. Why would anyone ignore this truth, especially the ranking Democrat on Senate Judiciary, Senator Dianne Feinstein, is stunning. But you shouldn't be surprised. The left is committed to the removal of a duly elected president, the destruction of our system of capitalism, and now an all-out assault on our system of justice. To them you are guilty - guilty until proven innocent. But no one in all the years I've spent in courtrooms has ever been able to prove a negative. So forget the time-honored notion like due process, probable cause, beyond a reasonable doubt or a jury of your peers. Today, unsupported, uncorroborated, untested words, not facts are sufficient to convict not just in the court of public opinion, but in the esteemed hallowed halls of the United States Senate. Forget the right to counsel, the ability to defend yourself, the right confront your accuser or even cross-examine your accuser. Truth in this scheme is nothing more than collateral damage if a Republican is on the receiving end of an anonymous allegation. So Dianne, let me see if I get this. Another Democrat, a congresswoman from California, no less, forwards a July letter to you containing a completely unsubstantiated claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while in high school tried to force himself on another high school student almost 40, I said 40 years ago. Kavanaugh for anyone who even cares has categorically and unequivocally denied the allegation. So why are we just hearing being this now? Dianne, when you get the letter, what do you do to make sure it's real? That the person is even real? Given the left's penchant to buy fake dossiers, make up facts and collude with the media to sabotage even the President of the United States, forgive me if I think it's all hogwash. Okay, you say quote, \"The individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. And I honored have that decision.\" Dianne, you honored that decision. Did you even speak to this alleged person? Did you meet with her, talk with her, interview her? Did you ask her to meet with others? Did you ask why she said nothing for almost 40 years? And Dianne, why would you wait to even send it to the FBI? Is it because nothing in you and your pack of demon rats, that's what I said, demon rats, aka, Democrats bag of tricks was working against Kavanaugh. Nothing was working that you were doing beginning with Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and every unhinged lunatic you could find."

Dianne, as a Ranking Member of the committee interviewing Kavanaugh, how could you possibly let a moment pass without addressing the issue when Kavanaugh was right in front of you and would have had the opportunity to respond? What were you thinking? Are you stupid? Why would you let it go? Let me tell you why you let it go, Dianne. Because even you didn't believe it. What other reason could there be? Now, I know about women who have been sexually assaulted and the kind of pain they go through. It is different from other crimes. It lingers and rears its head throughout their lives. I have prosecuted on their behalf for decades. One of the ways that we establish their credibility is with how recent their complaint is. A recent outcry is enormously powerful. An anonymous one almost 40 years later, not so much, Dianne. But silence? I guess, I shouldn't be surprised. You bozos in Congress actually had a fund of taxpayers' money, our money, to pay congressional staffers who were victims of sexual misconduct by your coworkers. It's a fund that even you as a woman, a powerful senator kept quiet about. Whose side are you on? Does it depend on the politics? Does it depend on the politics of the accused? Your audacity to destroy and try to destroy a man with impeccable credentials, harm his family and shift the burden of proof to the accused by alleging one of the most of heinous allegations imaginable shows your complete disregard for truth, justice and the American way. That's my open. Do you think Dianne Feinstein is a liar, leaker or liberal? Or all three? There is only one way to find out. My new book, New York Times number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, & Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" All right, joining me now with reaction to my open, and to discuss the vital issue of conservative censorship, House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Chairman, thank you very much for being with us. Now, who needs a Constitution or a system of justice when after all of these months, after Brett Kavanaugh has been in the public eye and under scrutiny, and Dianne Feinstein at the 11th hour says, \"Hey, I've got this anonymous letter almost 40 years ago. He sexually abused somebody, but we are not going to - we didn't bring it up until just now.\" What took them so long?"

Remember, he has done all the background checks by working in the White House. He has been appointed a judge so he had to go through there as well. It's never came up and why would they wait until after. But also remember, Senator Feinstein, her own body person, her driver, we found out worked for the Chinese government, and we didn't find that out for a couple of years later. So remember what we're dealing with here. This is politics. This is how far this country has split apart. Whereas they would print just as the New York Times an anonymous letter without a name. So now, they are going forward with this. This is the wrong thing to do by the wrong person.

And there is news reports out this weekend saying that the leak of the dossier, which they are talking about over unclassified systems. By the way, the dossier at the time was classified according to the FBI and DOJ. They say the leak of the dossier in the beginning of the Trump administration to CNN and Buzzfeed, they said, \"Well, maybe we can use this as a pretext to go out and interview people.\" So this leak strategy, it looks like, that they know it was happening. It was either coming out of their sister agencies, the FBI has acknowledged to be involved in stories. And of course, they knew that Christopher Steele was leaking information and Fusion GPS was leaking information. They didn't tell the FISA courts any of that. So they were spying on President Trump through Spygate. They were taking up the Trump organizations and the Trump campaign's phone records. They were targeting Carter Page with an illegal FISA warrant, targeting the Trump campaign, Trump with an illegal FISA warrant, through this Page warrant. And it's all part of that strategy was the leak of all that classified investigative activity to the media to make Trump look bad. I was laughing because this Google video, you could have had the same video be run by the videotape at the FBI. That was the reaction of the FBI to the Trump victory and we see what they tried to do and the resulting investigation is this Mueller special counsel operations."

That they are getting articles written and the strategy is working is consistent with the articles coming out. What is coming next? How much worse is it going to get, Tom?"

They are slow walking the release of e-mails to Judicial Watch separately. There is the rest of that FISA application that the President by all accounts is prepare to declassify, it's just a matter of when, not if. It is getting worse in terms of the underlying corruption and my view is the President needs to stop it either through executive authority on his own or seek some sort of court action to stop this Mueller investigation. You know Judge, if all the cops involved in a prosecution before you were doing this type of corruption, what would you tell the prosecutors? Get your case out of here and investigate the investigator."

Anyway, Governor Mike Huckabee is still ahead, but next is President Trump ready to declassify documents that could shed explosive new light on the plot to frame him in the Russia investigation? I talk live next with one of the key figures in the Mueller investigation from the very beginning. Carter Page. He's here with us. Don't miss it. Developing tonight, President Trump looks poised to finally declassify previously redacted sections of FISA applications against former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page. Joining me now with his very unique perspective on all of this including the Mueller investigation motivation behind it, former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page himself. Your first visit on \"Justice,\" Carter, we are delighted to have you on. And so, I want to start and move very quickly through this. You have been through so much. We now know that liars and leaks and the liberals in the DOJ as well as the Department of the Justice want to frame Donald Trump in order to impeach him. Do you wake up at night and say, \"This is a huge thing that's going on, how am in the middle of this?\""

He had a lot of security threats in various - he's concerned about his safety. That's exactly what I told the FBI that month as well.

This is incredible. I've never seen anything quite like it. But the one thing I will remind you, do you remember when President Trump, then candidate, was talking about what the economy was going to look under him, President Obama said, that's not going to happen, it would take a miracle and he just completely poohed the idea.

And Debra Messing had said, \"Brett Kavanaugh went to an all boys school. How quickly you can get 65 names. It's almost as though you knew about the accusations of sexual assault and tried to hide it, but they prepared with the names just in case.\" So Debra Messing and then Chelsea Handler all say that because he went to an all boys school he most probably assaulted a woman as Dianne Feinstein came out and delivered this anonymous letter at the 11th hour that I did my open on tonight.

The one person who is unknown and completely anonymous with really some pretty sketchy accusations, we don't know who it is. We have no idea. But I'll tell you something we have learned from all of this. If Judge Kavanaugh teaches and coaches girls' basketball and then he goes and he gives women record numbers of jobs, then he's a potential sexual predator. If he doesn't, he's a sexist. But I'll tell you the one thing that that t he left would love him for, if he would wear a dress and hang out in women's restrooms.

And so only when we started to make a fuss and Fox News and \"The Hill\" and some other people called up Twitter, the reporters called them up, only then did they back off and said, \"Oh, sorry, it was all a mistake.

She said, she can't find it. So what's happening is, they are now changing our lexicon - the dictionary. And if hate speech, the word illegal alien is hate speech, why does Title 8 of the USC include the words criminal alien, unauthorized alien - I mean, these are words that are in our statutes, in our laws, passed by Congress and they now are comfortable taking it out.
