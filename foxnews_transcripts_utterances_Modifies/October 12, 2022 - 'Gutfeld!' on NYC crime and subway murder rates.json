So, we all remember that letter POLITICO published ahead of the 2020 election that dismissed the Hunter laptop story as Russian disinfo. By the way, when I say we all remember, I obviously don't include the president. The letter was crafted right after the New York Post had published a piece on the laptop, which Hunter had dropped off at a computer repair shop and then abandoned it like it was his child.",

But then, miraculously, this letter, signed by 50 odd Intel experts, appeared to save Joe's day and boy did it. The story was blacklisted by major media outlets and social media algorithms. You even mentioned it, you were mocked, scorned or suspended from tech platforms. I like getting suspended from things, but not tech platforms. You know what I mean? The rest is history.

Now why in God's name would they do that? Well, obviously reduce global oil supply means gas prices go up. So, in order to keep Americans from feeling a hit to their wallet before they hit the voting booth, the Dems wanted to stop OPEC from cutting the oil supply. They just wanted to fool Americans until after they voted. Just like the mad scientist who reanimated Joe Biden. It's true. Look it up. But the Saudis refused. The cut happened anyway on October 5th and so your gas is still over four bucks a gallon. Pretty soon I'll have to let my butler and my chauffeur go. But these are the kinds of details that the president probably thinks it shouldn't matter. At least the New York Times thinks so. And who better to defend a liar? On Tuesday, they dropped a euphemism filled piece defending Biden's lies as storytelling. And dissecting a bunch of nonsense tales Joe has told over the years which the authors even agree aren't true. They excuse it with phrases like yarns that often unravel, unable to break himself of the habit of embellishing narratives to weave a political identity. Folks see this can veer into folklore.

If you close your eyes, you feel like you're in the roaring 20s. Just ignore the corpse in the corner, which is what the White House staffers do around Joe. But Errol is so clueless he thinks a jazz trumpet player makes the subway attractive. Even I want to murder a jazz trumpet player. So, this dolt who calls himself a journalist takes one trip and doesn't witness a murder. And so, that's proof of safety. That's like going outside at night and thinking, wow, the sun must be broken. It's like visiting Tijuana on the donkey's day off and thinking it's a family friendly place. I don't know what that means. But lazy anecdotal observations about public safety to right off the rise in crime. That is nothing new. Remember this classic?",

By the way, when I say we all remember, I obviously don't include the president. The letter was crafted right after the New York Post had published a piece on the laptop, which Hunter had dropped off at a computer repair shop and then abandoned it like it was his child."

The hard drive contained tons of stuff concerning Biden's business dealings, as well as all sorts of sordid or, in Kat's view, romantic videos of Hunter doing drugs and hookers, and not always in that order. But then, miraculously, this letter, signed by 50 odd Intel experts, appeared to save Joe's day and boy did it. The story was blacklisted by major media outlets and social media algorithms. You even mentioned it, you were mocked, scorned or suspended from tech platforms. I like getting suspended from things, but not tech platforms. You know what I mean? The rest is history.

The ends justify the means, you can lie to the American people and there's no consequences. But that's 50 reasons why you got to go vote and take control of the House, because every single signer of that letter needs to be questioned just like that. Like who asked them to do this? Were they paid? Did they deduct that contribution from their taxes? But I credit this guy for at least showing his face in public. Something I wish Madonna would stop doing.

The Wall Street Journal, whatever that is, reports that Biden administration officials begged Saudi Arabia to delay a cut in oil production until days before the midterms. Now why in God's name would they do that? Well, obviously reduce global oil supply means gas prices go up. So, in order to keep Americans from feeling a hit to their wallet before they hit the voting booth, the Dems wanted to stop OPEC from cutting the oil supply. They just wanted to fool Americans until after they voted. Just like the mad scientist who reanimated Joe Biden. It's true. Look it up. But the Saudis refused. The cut happened anyway on October 5th and so your gas is still over four bucks a gallon. Pretty soon I'll have to let my butler and my chauffeur go. But these are the kinds of details that the president probably thinks it shouldn't matter. At least the New York Times thinks so. And who better to defend a liar? On Tuesday, they dropped a euphemism filled piece defending Biden's lies as storytelling. And dissecting a bunch of nonsense tales Joe has told over the years which the authors even agree aren't true. They excuse it with phrases like yarns that often unravel, unable to break himself of the habit of embellishing narratives to weave a political identity. Folks see this can veer into folklore. The factual edges shaved off. Oh, wow. I haven't seen that much lipstick on a pig since I took my pet to the prom. That's better than going with your cousin, right, Kat? Well. Look at that look."

According to The Post -- sorry -- killings since 2020, or more than all the murders from 2008 to 2019 combined, but try explaining that to CNN Idiot in Chief, Errol Louis, he sarcastically tweeted: \"Going home on the violent NYC subways. Riders paralyzed with fright.\" And he paired it with cell phone video of a tranquil subway station and the sweet stylings of a jazz trumpet player. If you close your eyes, you feel like you're in the roaring 20s. Just ignore the corpse in the corner, which is what the White House staffers do around Joe. But Errol is so clueless he thinks a jazz trumpet player makes the subway attractive. Even I want to murder a jazz trumpet player. So, this dolt who calls himself a journalist takes one trip and doesn't witness a murder. And so, that's proof of safety. That's like going outside at night and thinking, wow, the sun must be broken.
