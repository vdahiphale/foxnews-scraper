And, as you mentioned, American Airlines anticipated that there was going to be a spike in the number of customers, but they didn't think it was going to happen this quickly. Although it may look relatively quiet here in Terminal B at this hour, American Airlines says that it has seen a 600 percent increase in the number of people taking to the air than during the darkest days of COVID. Now, in order to alleviate the stress on the system, American says it's going to cancel about 60 flights a day until mid-July. That's roughly 1 percent of its regular schedule. Not a big deal unless it is your flight. And in a statement, the airline said -- and I quote -- \"We made targeted changes with the goal of impacting the fewest number of customers by adjusting flights in markets where we have multiple options for re- accommodation.\"   The airline says there will be no surprises. These cancellations are not going to be last-minute, but days in advance. Passengers rerouted outside a four-hour window can receive a refund.  The airline expects mandatory training of furloughed pilots to be completed by the end of this month. And the airline also says it is cutting these flights to increase the number of pilots that it has in reserve. Today and over the weekend, American canceled more than 400 flights in total. The airline blamed the weather, a labor shortage, maintenance issues and flight crews simply maxing out on the number of hours that they are permitted to work.  And to put how much things have changed into perspective, consider this. Yesterday, a year ago, five million people took to the air, according to the TSA. A year ago yesterday, Sunday, they say it was more than two million people. And that is the highest number of travelers that the TSA has seen since the pandemic ended -- Gerry.",

And this weekend, we had the chance to embed with some Texas State Troopers, who brought us over to Roma, Texas and we got to see just how bad the problem is. Take a look at this wild video we shot, again, from Roma, which is about an hour west of where we are right now. In the middle of the night, we went out with them and watched as human smugglers brought raft after raft of migrants across the Rio Grande from the Mexican side and then dropped them off right at our doorstep on the American side.   This happened over and over and over. Literally, it was basically a ferry service for the smugglers. And the smugglers had no fear of being caught. They were dropping these folks off just yards away from State Troopers, from Border Patrol and from National Guard. They were laughing. They were joking. They even took their head coverings off. They had no fear of being caught. And that just goes to show you how brazen these human smugglers are. Eventually, they took about 60 people across right in front of us just in the span of about 45 minutes or so. Take a look at this other video we have shot after everybody had been dropped off. Obviously, a Border Patrol bus can't get down to those riverbanks. So, Border Patrol had to get all of the people together, all those migrants together, and literally march them up a hill, until they could get basically grouped together in another processing area, where there were more migrants who illegally crossed the river. So you had a group of at least 100 eventually just in one single spot in one night.  And I had a chance to talk to a Texas State Trooper and ask him, why are you guys not able to grab one of these human smugglers right when they come up to the shoreline? He said, it's a safety issue for the migrants. They're worried that these ruthless smugglers will take it out on the migrants if they try to take -- make a move on them. Take a listen.",

But shortly after it announced the days, today and tomorrow for this sale, Walmart came out to announce its competing sale, Deals For Days. So the two retailers are going to go head to head. And there's a lot on the line here, because J.P. Morgan just recently came out with a projection that Amazon will overtake Walmart to be the largest U.S. retailer as soon as next year. And that announcement is coming after Amazon had a great 2020 in terms of sales, boosted by consumers who are shopping online, which accelerated Amazon's growth to 39 percent of the e- commerce market. It also had a strong start to this year, reporting a profit of $8.1 billion during the first three months of 2021, compared to $2.5 billion during the same time last year.

And our problem is, because we're a local family-owned restaurant, as you would call it, we're having to compete with the chains, the -- I'm not going to name them, but they have chains now that are able to offer even more.

So it's not going to be surprising in the future if you see a place with a $17 hamburger and fries. It's just -- the margins in restaurants are so razor-thin already.

Although it may look relatively quiet here in Terminal B at this hour, American Airlines says that it has seen a 600 percent increase in the number of people taking to the air than during the darkest days of COVID. Now, in order to alleviate the stress on the system, American says it's going to cancel about 60 flights a day until mid-July. That's roughly 1 percent of its regular schedule. Not a big deal unless it is your flight. And in a statement, the airline said -- and I quote -- \"We made targeted changes with the goal of impacting the fewest number of customers by adjusting flights in markets where we have multiple options for re- accommodation.\" The airline says there will be no surprises. These cancellations are not going to be last-minute, but days in advance. Passengers rerouted outside a four-hour window can receive a refund. The airline expects mandatory training of furloughed pilots to be completed by the end of this month. And the airline also says it is cutting these flights to increase the number of pilots that it has in reserve. Today and over the weekend, American canceled more than 400 flights in total. The airline blamed the weather, a labor shortage, maintenance issues and flight crews simply maxing out on the number of hours that they are permitted to work. And to put how much things have changed into perspective, consider this. Yesterday, a year ago, five million people took to the air, according to the TSA. A year ago yesterday, Sunday, they say it was more than two million people. And that is the highest number of travelers that the TSA has seen since the pandemic ended -- Gerry."

And this weekend, we had the chance to embed with some Texas State Troopers, who brought us over to Roma, Texas and we got to see just how bad the problem is. Take a look at this wild video we shot, again, from Roma, which is about an hour west of where we are right now. In the middle of the night, we went out with them and watched as human smugglers brought raft after raft of migrants across the Rio Grande from the Mexican side and then dropped them off right at our doorstep on the American side. This happened over and over and over. Literally, it was basically a ferry service for the smugglers. And the smugglers had no fear of being caught. They were dropping these folks off just yards away from State Troopers, from Border Patrol and from National Guard. They were laughing. They were joking. They even took their head coverings off. They had no fear of being caught. And that just goes to show you how brazen these human smugglers are. Eventually, they took about 60 people across right in front of us just in the span of about 45 minutes or so. Take a look at this other video we have shot after everybody had been dropped off. Obviously, a Border Patrol bus can't get down to those riverbanks. So, Border Patrol had to get all of the people together, all those migrants together, and literally march them up a hill, until they could get basically grouped together in another processing area, where there were more migrants who illegally crossed the river. So you had a group of at least 100 eventually just in one single spot in one night. And I had a chance to talk to a Texas State Trooper and ask him, why are you guys not able to grab one of these human smugglers right when they come up to the shoreline? He said, it's a safety issue for the migrants. They're worried that these ruthless smugglers will take it out on the migrants if they try to take -- make a move on them. Take a listen."

All 50 states are under -- in a crisis right now because of this border. And it's hard to believe that just taking our foot off the messaging has allowed -- the Biden administration let folks in the far parts of South America just even hear the hint that we have opened our borders and to watch these families be disrupted and these humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate, it's troubling.

I have got a book coming out in September called \"GOP 2.0.\" And we tackle some of these big issues around conservative things like immigration, that we need to start to talk about border security and how we better execute, and how we tackle the 16 million-plus folks here that are undocumented.

But shortly after it announced the days, today and tomorrow for this sale, Walmart came out to announce its competing sale, Deals For Days. So the two retailers are going to go head to head. And there's a lot on the line here, because J.P. Morgan just recently came out with a projection that Amazon will overtake Walmart to be the largest U.S. retailer as soon as next year. And that announcement is coming after Amazon had a great 2020 in terms of sales, boosted by consumers who are shopping online, which accelerated Amazon's growth to 39 percent of the e- commerce market. It also had a strong start to this year, reporting a profit of $8.1 billion during the first three months of 2021, compared to $2.5 billion during the same time last year.

They're reportedly going to be focusing on price spikes as a major issue for the 2022 midterms. Is that a strategy that's going to work? Well, let's ask GOP pollster Lee Carter and Democratic strategist Kevin Chavous. Lee, let me start with you. We are seeing some of the biggest increases in prices across the economy that we have seen in decades. That isn't good news for a lot of consumers and savers.

If the Republicans purely react to the Democrats, saying, this is terrible, look at inflation, we're just reacting to their bad policies, they won't win. But if they use that as a launching point, if they say, do you feel better off today than when Donald Trump was president, yes or no? If the answer is that you don't, then here is what we're going to do to move things forward and get us back on track. They need to frame in positive terms and what they're going to do. Right now, the Republican Party seems somewhat fractured. And it's not enough for things to feel bad. They're going to have to show, how are they going to make it better?"

So we're already looking, historic -- if history is any indicator, we're looking at losing several seats. But I don't think it'll be because of inflation. After the year that we have had, where people were unable to go out, were unable to go have a meal, go to a ball game, have a beer and a hot dog, people are just looking to get out there. And I think that consumers will be willing to trade slightly higher prices for the ability to go out and enjoy life without restrictions. Biden is still polling very well. It has dipped a little bit, his approval rating, but it's still around 50 percent. And the support for the initiatives that he's pushing, the Americans Jobs Plan, American Families Plan, both of those are still approved of by consumers or by voters at a two-to-three clip. So as long as he's not spending money on things that the voters do not think are necessary, I don't think a little bit of inflation will hurt him as we go into the midterms next year."

Could find a situation where, the end of this year, into 2022, we could be back to normal rates of inflation and this political opportunity for the Republicans might pass by?"

      "utterance": "No, I think it's possible. But I think that the concerns are still going to be there. And the truth of the matter is, there's something called -- the so-called ratchet effect, which is prices have gone up. Are we really going to start to see them decline? Are people going to say, OK, the cost of lumber went up, now it's going to come down, now the price of windows is going to come back down? We haven't necessarily seen that historically. So it's going to be a concern on top of people's mind, and I'm not sure that people are going to fully feel the absorption of the price shifts by the next year. And we're starting to see that people are getting concerned about the economy. These things do factor in. Yes, people want to get out there again. But now that they're out there, they're noticing the price of gas is up, they're noticing that their dollar is going shorter and shorter than it was before. And I think as we get into heating season and other things, and people are doing all these things, they are going to start to feel it. We also know people are doing work around their homes. And they're starting to question that. So I think it is going to be tough for the Democrats to answer this one."

I don't think that people that aren't in states that are on the border really feel the impact of any crisis at the border.

So we know that the White House wants to hike that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent, tax capital gains like income, which will match the proposed top individual tax rate at over 39 percent. Now, despite most of these tax hikes aimed at the 1 percent, the middle class will be affected, according to the Tax Policy Foundation, indirectly impacted by higher rates on corporations. Even those making $75,000 a year, they will pay an extra $450. Nearly two-thirds of those low six figure salaries will pay more than $800, $2,000 for those making up to half-a- million dollars, and nearly 100 percent of those making over half-a-million dollars will have to pay more, of course.

This is incredibly significant from the lower court decision indicating that artificial caps or restraints or barriers to education-related benefits was an antitrust violation. In other words, anything that's connected to a student athlete's education should not be capped. But, more importantly, and to your question, this arguably does open the floodgates to the bigger issue, which is compensating student athletes for the second part, not just being students, but, rather, the athletic benefit that they provide a university, be it through salary or, more likely, an NIL, name, image and likeness, that we see on the horizon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",

I mean, because, as you as you say, the actual decision, it's quite a narrow one, in that it refers to education-related items, such as scholarships and help for computer equipment and that kind of stuff. It doesn't specifically or explicitly pave the way for direct payments to athletes. But is that next?"

And in any other context, to limit the amount of compensation or prohibit it altogether on the notion of amateurism would seem patently unfair, if not illegal, on its face. So what he was really saying is, give me the right case, and I would love to try this NIL, this name, image and likeness. The NCAA has been banging on the door and begging Congress to get something enacted by July 1. Clearly, that's not going to happen on the national level. And on that same date, six states, including key states when it comes to college athletics, California, Alabama, Florida, and some others, are already set to enact their own state-based legislation governing a student's ability to make money off of their name, image and likeness. Now, we're talking -- not talking a salary for being an athlete, but rather the opportunity to capitalize and cash in on their marketability off the field, court..."

    {
      "speaker": "ELDRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it certainly does. And I'm glad you mentioned that, because this is arguably the first time that we have seen the NCAA on its back foot. They have not only had fantastic legal teams, but they have had fantastic marketing teams to boot. For example, the name or moniker student athlete, that was literally created out of thin air by the legal team, in concert with some market analysts, to preserve the notion of amateurism. Just like Haagen-Dazs is not a real word in any language, it's a marketing tool used to sell ice cream, this -- the term student athlete was a marketing tool used to sell the notion that these are not professional athletes generating millions and now billions, plural, in terms of revenues for these individual universities and the NCAA as a whole. But we know that's not the case anymore. March Madness generates $1 billion in revenue for a year. The bowl system doubles that. So this is a billion- dollar entity that's been around for 115 years."

So it doesn't make very much sense that this has gone on for as long as it has. I think the cruise lines kind of bid their time, which I think was a huge mistake on the public relations side. They should have been out more forcefully, basically screaming about this, because they destroyed this industry. And you look at the debt that's piled up on these companies, it's massive, just so they could get ready to sail and not go out of business in the meantime."

      "utterance": "Do you think demand is going to come back to pre-pandemic levels for cruises? I mean, obviously, we were all very familiar with that -- the story of the Diamond Princess, which was kind of like a little -- kind of a little parable, really, for the whole coronavirus pandemic, and it was a pretty -- pretty horrific experience for a lot of those people. But do you think those fears that people have about being on a cruise ship, maybe being enclosed like that, do you think they have gone? And do you think we will see a complete return to normal?"

    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, when you look at the data on that Diamond Princess and the cruise ships that did have outbreaks, when you get down past the media hype, it wasn't that bad, literally. It was terrible for those who were on board, because they were not able to get off."

But I think Royal Caribbean and a lot of the cruise lines are making a huge mistake with these vaccine mandates, or to work around the new law with DeSantis, which I think is a great law, that the businesses can't require you to get vaccinated to do business with them here in the state, the problem with that is now they're saying, OK, well, we're going to let everybody on, but if you're not vaccinated, you're a second-class citizen, and there are certain things you can't do. And I think that is pissing off a lot of people. And I will tell you what. I will never go on a cruise as long as those are around. And I'm a travel guy, and I have been on I can't count how many cruises. I will never go on a cruise under those scenarios. And I think there's a lot of Americans -- I had COVID. Over 100 million Americans are projected to have had COVID. They're now saying, because they're learning this as we go, that you have natural immunity that can last decades or a lifetime."

Crime is the issue in New York City's primary happening tomorrow, especially as we're now learning that a 42-year-old volunteer for the Eric Adams mayoral campaign was stabbed multiple times Sunday in the Bronx. It happened as Adams was consoling the family of two kids caught in the crossfire of this shooting last week. Nearly every single crime category in New York City is up from this time last year, voters telling me they're angry that the NYPD was defunded by a billion dollars. They don't like bail reform. And now local NBC is reporting nearly half of the arrests that were made over those riots and the looting that happened in Manhattan last year, half of those were dropped by the DA's office. Business owners who saw their stores destroyed are furious about this. Now here's a look at the top of Democratic contenders in this mayor's race. They hit the streets today and the airwaves pitching their battle plans for crime."

      "speaker": "CRAIG",
      "utterance": "Well, we should be angry and we should still be concerned, Gerry. I'm going to tell you why. So, they realize that the defund movement wasn't speaking to the people that live in vulnerable communities. But they still have this veiled strategy called ending qualified immunity. That, in effect, does the same thing. It dismantles a police department. So what am I specifically saying? Let's look at NYPD. Their City Council voted to end qualified immunity. And what was the response? A significant increase in retirements and resignations. Chicago, they don't feel supported, the men and women who serve. They're leaving in high numbers. So we shouldn't get excited. What some of these politicians need to do is understand that the way to get out of this rut is support the vast majority of the men and women who do this work. It's that simple."

      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, Chief, briefly, as you say, it's come too late in many respects, this idea of restoring funding in some of these cities, because police morale has been hammered over the last year. A lot of police officers have left the forces, as you have said. The damage has been done. And it's going to take perhaps years to repair it."
