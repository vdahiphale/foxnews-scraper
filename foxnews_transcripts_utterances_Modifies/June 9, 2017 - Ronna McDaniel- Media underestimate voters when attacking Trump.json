It was a huge story. And guess what? It was not correct. The story was wrong. Almost entirely wrong is the way Senator Cotton asked and James Comey then responded. This is a very big deal.

I guess we won't be holding our breath for a full retraction or apology. So despite some widespread embarrassment for all these people in the destroy-Trump media following the Comey testimony, do think we can ever expect them to stop spreading their fake news? In other words, land the black helicopters and get back to reality? Or will the crisis and credibility continue to grow? Joining us now, Fox news correspondent, Geraldo at large. Geraldo, this is a personal thing for me. I don't think anybody vetted Obama honestly. There were very few of us that thought Trump could win. The media never told the full story on Hillary's emails, the server, never gave the full failed record of Obama, and now this 10 month witch hunt, and they are barely, barely wanting to acknowledge how wrong they have been."

      "utterance": "You know, Sean, the media tends to slant left. They tend to be liberal. That is part of the landscape of the American pop culture. That's just the way it is. But this is different than that. This is a mean spirited -- this is almost a hatred that comes from Trump's surprise election. The story about the Russia intelligence officials having contact with the Trump campaign aides is a gigantic story. You remember when it hit the front page. It was for the first time it put the Trump personnel in the KGB, in Moscow. They put them right with the prime operators of the anti-American -- it really was a very unsavory scene. It was a huge story. And guess what? It was not correct. The story was wrong. Almost entirely wrong is the way Senator Cotton asked and James Comey then responded. This is a very big deal. This isn't just a kind of an ideological slant. This is a vindictive effort it seems to me, to kill this president or this presidency, and a lack of the kind of professionalism that it takes to apologize when you are wrong."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Here is the thing. They are so often wrong, Geraldo. They were wrong on Obama. They were wrong on Hillary. They never did their due diligence on emails and the Uranium One deal, for example. They never did their due diligence, they never thought Trump could win. But think back, they were also wrong on the Zimmerman case, Trayvon Martin. They were wrong about Ferguson in their reporting. They were wrong about Baltimore in their reporting. They have been wrong so often as they advance their political agenda. And by the way, I'm not looking for props being right, but I will say this -- if I get one little itsy-bitsy thing wrong, Geraldo, they are ready to get all out wanting to fire me and I need you protecting me."

      "speaker": "RIVERA",
      "utterance": "I got your back all the way. You know that. But this is talking about people's backs. President Trump has a bull's-eye on his back this big. It is incredible how every day this man wakes up knowing that he has 20 of the best reporters in the country at The Washington Post newsroom waking up also thinking how am I going to screw the president today? How am I going to get the president today? They have led this entire investigation. And it turns out, look at where we are right now. And I think this is this is the only network that is really slowing people down and saying where are we with this? What did they have? They have General Michael Flynn, the national security advisor, who apparently lied to the vice president and others. He's in deep doo-doo, General Flynn is, not because of what he may have done with the Russians but because he lied about any contacts he had. When you go beyond that, what else is there? Is there any evidence? And the answer is no, there's no evidence of collusion."

The media continues to throw story and story after another that's not true that's against the president. They did it all through the campaign when he was candidate Trump. Now they are doing it as the president and they're underestimating the American voter. We see through it. We recognize that this president is fighting for the American person, that he's fighting for jobs and wages and better health care and national security. So the media can continue to lack self- awareness and continue to lie and be dishonest, but Middle America, they know that the president is fighting for them."

And this is where we are. And as Ronna said, or maybe it was you that said it, their approval rating, the media's approval rating, hello?

He is out there talking about the things that matter to the people in mid- America that Ronna was talking about, and he's going to continue to do that. It's a good darn thing, Sean, that this man has been an executive his entire life. He knows how to focus despite the storms going on around him. And every time I've ever seen him, he's pretty relaxed and chilling and having a good time, just like you said, having a great weekend."

They were all Democrat, all left leaning. They had one Republican guest. They determine what their narrative is going to be. They push it. They don't have any fairness. I'm just going to say, I'm from Michigan. We see it. We know it. The American people are smarter than you are giving us credit for. And that's why President Trump won. That's why people are proud of what he's doing. They know he's fighting for them. But it is unfortunate we have a media that refuses to report the facts."

I've watched us and we've been talking about it. When the president speculates -- my buddy Mike Myers goes, obviously he is saying I've got tapes. You better not lie. And the more I think about it, Lou, I actually think Comey and a lot of the things he said yesterday and things that have come out this week. Maybe in the back of his mind he was thinking there's tapes and probably got more truth out of him. That's a brilliant play by Trump and likely nonexistent."

They said as a result of Comey's testimony they headlined that Trump's character is on trial. This shows the \"FT\" to be one of those leftwing nut job publications. This is over the top activism. And to see that happen, this much we know for a fact -- one, Trump was never under investigation. The president did not collude. There is no evidence that he did. And yet intelligence agencies pursued this investigation and they were egged on by President Obama, who we do know was spying. His national security apparatus was spying on the Trump transition team. This is upside down, and the fact that the Senate intelligence committee, Sean, with Senator Burr and Senator Warner pontificating -- they know damn well there's nothing to this. This is nothing more than a show trial. And they should be ashamed and the American people should demand their heads."

And then that brings up the issue of what he was saying to the fake news reporter about this whole issue of yes, will you testify before Mueller? Yes, OK. And by the way, this is his word versus my word. I have been shown consistent here and I was proven right on the issue of collusion and corruption, and I was never being investigated and obstruction, and now Comey has been exposed as a leaker. And then then whole Loretta Lynch issue and the Hillary Clinton issue. But I have to tell you something here, this is really important. If he's willing to testify against Comey, then we get back to the legal issues I discussed earlier in this show, what are your thoughts on that?"

    {
      "speaker": "DOBBS",
      "utterance": "I think that's fine, except for this, Sean. There should be consequences for what is happened here. The testimony of Comey yesterday reveals that there is no substance, no possible way for the Senate intelligence committee or the special counsel to move forward because, A, the crimes have all been committed by the investigators, starting with Director Comey, starting with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch who is telling him not to call the investigation into Hillary Clinton and investigation but a matter. And he rolled over like a trained dog. And Iraq that this is, if he were not already fired, he should be fired again."
