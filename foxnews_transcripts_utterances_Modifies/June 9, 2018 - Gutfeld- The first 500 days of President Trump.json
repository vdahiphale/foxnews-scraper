All right, this week marked the first 500 days of Donald Trump's presidency or what I like to call the first 500 days of Donald Trump's presidency. I celebrate a little each day. Just see.  Oh, yes, that is me -- 500 days, 500 days since the media's nervous breakdown began. A lot of stuff happened since then especially for you in your life and that is what matters, not us, you and no matter what the media says, life went on without the predicted catastrophes. Your life either stayed the same or it got better and if it got worse, I blame Obama.   No, I am kidding. I am kidding. Stop, don't applaud. Terrible people. Terrible people. But even if nothing changed, that is not what was predicted. The trumpets of doom warned of financial meltdowns, civil wars and nuclear Armageddon. Instead, we have peaceful prosperity, lower taxes, a real chance with North Korea, a booming economy and as an added bonus, Kathy Griffin went stone bunkers.  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. It's an incredible age. All right, even if the media can't see it or refuses to so, if this is how the media acts now imagine how they would be acting if things were actually bad. He really hates phones. In the middle of all this good news, the media, they search for bad. They're like those pigs that dig for truffles except they are the press and those truffles, they are stories like where is Melania? Oh, there she is. Nevermind about Melania.  Meanwhile, you shrug. The media complaining about how the news create unease, that's like a mosquito complaining about malaria. A fruit bat whining about rabies, a rock star deploring Chlamydia. The media spreads the malaise, now clearly, they've got to report on bad stuff, but isn't it obvious how frequently they avoid the good?  And they may have the nerve to run stories saying that bad news makes you sick. No, it's not bad news that makes you sick, if you are bad news that hurts. With each negative story paints you, the viewer as the villain. Is the climate warming? It is your fault, you selfish consumer. Rising inequality? It's you, evil capitalist pigs. There is an earthquake in Peru, it's because you're fat. Frankly, it is not good for America being told hourly that America sucks . If only there was a solution for this and the solution that somehow involves a dolphin.",

All right, this week marked the first 500 days of Donald Trump's presidency or what I like to call the first 500 days of Donald Trump's presidency. I celebrate a little each day. Just see. Oh, yes, that is me -- 500 days, 500 days since the media's nervous breakdown began. A lot of stuff happened since then especially for you in your life and that is what matters, not us, you and no matter what the media says, life went on without the predicted catastrophes. Your life either stayed the same or it got better and if it got worse, I blame Obama. No, I am kidding. I am kidding. Stop, don't applaud. Terrible people. Terrible people. But even if nothing changed, that is not what was predicted. The trumpets of doom warned of financial meltdowns, civil wars and nuclear Armageddon. Instead, we have peaceful prosperity, lower taxes, a real chance with North Korea, a booming economy and as an added bonus, Kathy Griffin went stone bunkers. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. It's an incredible age. All right, even if the media can't see it or refuses to so, if this is how the media acts now imagine how they would be acting if things were actually bad. He really hates phones. In the middle of all this good news, the media, they search for bad. They're like those pigs that dig for truffles except they are the press and those truffles, they are stories like where is Melania? Oh, there she is. Nevermind about Melania. Meanwhile, you shrug. The media complaining about how the news create unease, that's like a mosquito complaining about malaria. A fruit bat whining about rabies, a rock star deploring Chlamydia. The media spreads the malaise, now clearly, they've got to report on bad stuff, but isn't it obvious how frequently they avoid the good? And they may have the nerve to run stories saying that bad news makes you sick. No, it's not bad news that makes you sick, if you are bad news that hurts. With each negative story paints you, the viewer as the villain. Is the climate warming? It is your fault, you selfish consumer. Rising inequality? It's you, evil capitalist pigs. There is an earthquake in Peru, it's because you're fat. Frankly, it is not good for America being told hourly that America sucks . If only there was a solution for this and the solution that somehow involves a dolphin."

I am kidding actually. It's a session where contestants discuss their achievements and goals in life. That is going to fly right by. The evening gown portion is being revamped as well so contestants can wear whatever they choose. I'd wear what I wore to the prom. Anyways, I have mixed feelings on the swimsuits. On one hand, who cares if they get rid of them. I don't need to see all that? Plus, they chafe, but then again, isn't the swimsuit portion designed to gauge dedication to physical health-- that is you are in shape. I don't know.

It's the 2018 National People, Things and Stuff To View on Stage Without Being Offended Show. It's a totally non-gender specific, noncompetitive, no age limit event with safe inoffensive categories bound to upset no one. Featuring such events as sitting quietly, sitting quietly in an empty room, sitting quietly and waving at a stationary candle. Don't worry folks, the candle will not be lit. Safety is the number one concern. Featuring special appearance by a celebrity who is easily recognizable, but also non-threatening. If you know anyone, call us. Plus, no contestant goes home early because in this contest, there are no judges or winners. Tiaras for everyone. You think it can't get any better? This contest will also include dudes."

I mean, they say it's a talent contest now, isn't there already a contest for Americans that have talent?

Michael Feinberg, if that is his real name, had apparently arranged to pay for the little blue pills himself and not go through his insurance, but when his wife later called CVS to check on one of her own prescriptions, the worker mentioned his secret prescription. He claims the worker violated the Federal HIPAA laws, which require a patient's permission before revealing confidential information. He says his marriage broke down and is seeking unspecified damages. This is why I do not go to pharmacists. I get all my drugs from the sky. My goodness. I did not know he did that on his free time.
