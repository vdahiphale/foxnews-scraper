      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Elite colleges are the pathway to the American ruling class. How many of our overlords went to Harvard? Almost all of them. Admissions are supposed to be based on merit. But if that's true, if only the best people get in, then why are the children of so many Democratic politicians at Yale? We've got the numbers. It's fascinating. We'll bring that investigation in just a minute.  But first tonight, after almost 200 years, the Democrats were a political party with conventional political goals. That's no longer true. The Democratic Party is now a religious cult with all that implies. Dissent has been banned. Anyone who questions the party's leftward fringe is denounced as a racist heretic.  The party has descended into a purity spiral and nobody is safe, not even the party's own leaders. Nancy Pelosi for example, she is the most left- wing Speaker of the House in the history of the United States. She has been a fire breathing liberal for longer than, I don't know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been alive.  But none of that has been enough to save her. Ocasio-Cortez and a tiny group of House freshmen demand explicit socialism in this country right now. They want to open the borders, empty the prisons and take over the entire U.S. economy in the name of fighting climate change. Now, Pelosi may agree with these goals, but she has contempt for their total ignorance of how laws are made. They're against the democratic system itself, and Pelosi has expressed that contempt repeatedly in public, including here.",

Many make that argument, Ocasio-Cortez made the very same case during her Democratic primary campaign last year.  By definition, it is a racist pitch. It's every bit as repugnant as a white candidate making the same appeal. And many Democrats did make that appeal -- that racial appeal -- under Jim Crow. \"Vote for me because of my race.\" It's disgusting. But it's everywhere now and Democrats applaud it.  Yesterday, for example, former Obama spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted, Ocasio-Cortez and her faction provides, quote, \" ... the vision and moral center of today's Democratic Party.\" That's a view that is widely shared, and it is bad news for people like Joe Biden. Like Pelosi, Biden has dedicated his entire life to the Democratic Party. As Pelosi has, Biden has beautifully moved left with the party over the years and hasn't complained about it. He is currently running for example, and free healthcare for illegal aliens. But none of it has been enough. People like Joe Biden are the past in the Democratic Party, and like so many others he is being denounced. Wait for it, as a racist.  It's over for Joe Biden. A bitter end to what might have been a decent political career. Only he seems to be unaware of that.   On Saturday, Biden groveled one last time in a doomed effort to save himself. Watch.",

He's over just like Thomas Jefferson and Betsy Ross and all kinds of other people who aren't absolutely aligned with the modern woke left.  The Democratic Party demands absolute perfect fidelity at all times. Anyone who fails to measure up is finished forever. Now, that attitude is an effective way to terrify weak people and keep public figures in line. But the question electorally is, will it work on the country? Normal Americans know they're not racist. They don't think their neighbors and friends are racist either. They don't care about that, they care about their jobs, their safety, their families, their country.  For years, they've watched in despair as both major parties drifted away from those concerns. They took a chance selecting Donald Trump because he seemed willing to put the basics first. Will they reelect him is the question. Will Democrats continue to act like this? Absolutely, they will. Charlie Hurt is opinion editor of \"The Washington Times.\" He has got a brand new book out tomorrow. It's fantastic.

Just five years ago, Barack Obama would have never gotten elected. He wouldn't have gotten the nomination running on this kind of crazy nutso platform.   But these kids have taken over the entire party. And, you know, I go back and forth between feeling sorry for Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and kind of laughing at them because they've gotten what they deserve. They have been little weenies afraid to stand up to these people, afraid to call out these people and at times use some of their exact same tactics. You know, when, when Joe Biden announced his campaign, how did he do it? He began it by accusing Donald Trump of being a racist and lying about what happened in Charlottesville, and in my book \"Still Winning,\" I have a whole chapter devoted to what a complete total lie that is that Democrats keep spreading.   But you know, my goodness, this is why Donald Trump will get reelected, if you ask me.

Their saying, \"Huh. No one has ever said that.

But he can barely speak English. There are nights when Cuomo omits entire paragraphs that mean nothing at all -- just pure gibberish, like Pig Latin or dogs barking. It's kind of remarkable. Was this guy educated in the United States? Let's check Wikipedia. Wait a second. The entry says that Chris Cuomo went to Yale University in Connecticut. That can't be right. Yale has famously high admission standards. Your kids couldn't get into Yale. No chance. They'd have to be incredibly smart geniuses, really. Is Chris Cuomo a secret genius? Does he have some amazing talent that's invisible on television? Maybe he speaks flawless Urdu. Maybe he has a deep grounding in Particle Physics. Perhaps he can calculate pi to the final digit. Actually no. Chris Cuomo can't do any of that. It turns out he has an even more impressive qualification. His father was the Governor of New York. If you want to get into a top American college, it's best to have a parent who is a well-known Democratic politician. That's the most effective credential of all and don't take our word for it. Ask Dante de Blasio, the son of Bill de Blasio, the incompetent mayor of New York City. There's no evidence that the younger de Blasio did remarkably well in high school. And yet, like Chris Cuomo, he somehow got into Yale. Once there, Dante de Blasio have found himself surrounded by people just like himself, the thoroughly average children of other prominent liberals. According to press reports, that would include the offspring of at least three Democrats currently serving in the U.S. Senate: Michael Bennett, Amy Klobuchar, and Sheldon Whitehouse. All of them sent kids to Yale. Did you? No, but they did. Their colleague Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, meanwhile, is one of a stunning number of Senate Democrats who have sent children to Harvard University. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey is a Harvard parent. So is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer sent both his kids to Harvard. Barack Obama sent one of his, so did former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. The all-time record, though, must go to former Vice President Al Gore. Al Gore sent four. Imagine that. Four kids in a row to Harvard. What are the odds of that occurring in nature? Well, statistically, it's about as likely as getting hit by lightning every single day for a year. And yet somehow the Gore family pulled it off. Congratulations Gore family. Andrew Cuomo, the sitting Governor of New York sent one of his kids to Harvard, but the other two went to Brown. That's also an Ivy League university that your kids could never get into. Brown is, as they say, highly selective, at least for the children of non- politicians. But for pure 200-proof exclusivity, nothing beats Stanford University outside San Francisco. You can live your entire life in this country and never meet a single person who went to Stanford. It's that rarified. And here's the amazing part, Hillary Clinton's daughter breezed right in. How did Chelsea do that? Was it her formidable brainpower? Well, you can check out our Twitter feed and judge for yourself. Now, there's a chance that Chelsea is intentionally misleading us, it's possible that her entire public persona is that kind of performance art, a subversive Borat-style parody of mindless lifestyle liberalism. If that's the case, Chelsea Clinton is utterly brilliant. She is the Jonathan Swift of our time. But it's also possible that Chelsea isn't joking at all. It's possible indeed, it's even probable that she is every bit as dough and self-serious as she appears to be. In that case, not only is Chelsea Clinton profoundly sub brilliant, you've got to wonder how she holds a paying job. How does someone like that get into Stanford? You would have the same question about some of the kids at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Georgetown's alumni magazine is available online. So next time you've got a second free. Take a look. You recognize many of the names inside: Biden, Pelosi, Kennedy, these are the children of famous Democratic politicians. Are they impressive, hardworking kids who deserve to be at one of this country's most prestigious universities? Possibly, maybe some of them. Maybe not. It doesn't matter. In fact, it's irrelevant. They're the offspring of prominent Democrats. That's the point. And that's why they're at Georgetown. So how does this happen? What happens because our meritocracy is a sham, it's fake. They tell you that only the most accomplished students get into these schools, but they're lying. Their friends' kids get first dibs, fellow members of their social circle, kids whose families can help them down the road. The children of sympathetic politicians are an obvious priority for admissions officers. These are the same politicians who funnel billions in tax dollars to colleges and universities every year. So letting a senator's kid into Harvard is just smart business. The quid pro quo is obvious. It's a kind of unregulated lobbying. Remember, the Varsity Blues scandal in California where a group of socially anxious soccer moms tried to game the college admission system? Well, this is far more corrupt than that, except that nobody is going to prison for it. So how many Chris Cuomo's get into Yale every year? It'd be nice to know, but we don't know. Like almost everything about higher education, it's opaque. Prestigious schools can pretend that they admit only the most qualified applicants because nobody can prove otherwise. The real admissions numbers are secret. They're hidden from public view, even though we pay for those schools because all of them take massive amounts in tax dollars. Elite colleges are like public companies that lie about their balance sheets. They're cooking the books to defraud shareholders. In this case, the shareholders are the entire country. A handful of elite schools form the gateway to success in America. If you go to Harvard, you're all but guaranteed to make more money over the course of your life than someone who didn't go to Harvard. It's that simple. And so when you rig the admission system, what you're really rigging is American society. You're creating an impenetrable class system for your own benefit. And that's exactly what they're doing. You often hear progressive said that they worry about income inequality. They don't mean it at all. How do you know they don't mean it? Because if the left really cared about the stratification of American society, they would make college admissions transparent. They'd force Stanford, for example, to open the books and show the rest of us how exactly they were assembling this year's freshman class. That's what they do. And yet Democrats in Congress haven't done that and won't do that. They seem strangely incurious about how the process works. Like they don't really want to know all the details. In fact, they already know precisely how the admissions game works, and they strongly approve. Why wouldn't they approve? Their kids are benefiting from it.

She went on to say that this program would close the wealth gap between black and white families by 31 percent, and I thought, \"How interesting.

It's gotten so bad that even President Obama's DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson can't take it anymore.

I know a lot of legal Hispanic Americans that are absolutely against immigration, absolutely against open borders and what I see honestly as a voter, as an African-American as somebody who turned conservative within the past couple years specifically because of this illegal immigration issue, what I've seen is that the party that was historically supposed to be for African-Americans is selling us out for illegal immigrants.

We used to look at the anthrax threat or the smallpox threat and say, well, we have vaccines for smallpox and for anthrax, it's not contagious. That's in preexisting days. But now we've entered an era where we can put together a novel virus called synthetic biology. The Department of Defense put out a report on this last year. It's terrifying because tools that are out there, Tucker, like CRISPR-CAS9 that is a genetic editor. It's a scissor that can splice your DNA. But guess what else it can do? It could splice up a virus, put it back together in a different way. Make it more deadly, make it something your immune system hasn't seen, make it something that spreads easily that we don't have vaccines for. Now, I have news for you. Iran is working with that with this tool. Now the scientists working with it in Iran are not terrorists. But of course, Iran sponsors worldwide terrorism. So what happens if this somehow gets into the wrong hands? Not the tool necessarily, but someone makes one of these viruses and then spreads it into the wrong hands. That is something that's possible. And it's something that a steering committee put together by HHS in the fall is looking at. But this is mushrooming into a much bigger threat than we ever thought. Because again, we can see new viruses that we've never seen before, that are much more deadly and spread much more easily. A pandemic flu for example, like 1918, somebody could take a flu virus, change it just a little bit and we have 1918 again.",

So this could really get out and end up being a worldwide threat. I think we need to be thinking about this more. The steering committee is fine. But you know, we're talking today about enriching uranium in Iran. We also should realize that Iran has a bioterror program, North Korea has a bioterror program. And in North Korea, the bioterror program is predominantly existing threats that are already out there. We've talked on the show here about how Ebola is so deadly. But Ebola doesn't spread easily.

Admissions are supposed to be based on merit. But if that's true, if only the best people get in, then why are the children of so many Democratic politicians at Yale? We've got the numbers. It's fascinating. We'll bring that investigation in just a minute. But first tonight, after almost 200 years, the Democrats were a political party with conventional political goals. That's no longer true. The Democratic Party is now a religious cult with all that implies. Dissent has been banned. Anyone who questions the party's leftward fringe is denounced as a racist heretic. The party has descended into a purity spiral and nobody is safe, not even the party's own leaders. Nancy Pelosi for example, she is the most left- wing Speaker of the House in the history of the United States. She has been a fire breathing liberal for longer than, I don't know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been alive. But none of that has been enough to save her. Ocasio-Cortez and a tiny group of House freshmen demand explicit socialism in this country right now. They want to open the borders, empty the prisons and take over the entire U.S. economy in the name of fighting climate change. Now, Pelosi may agree with these goals, but she has contempt for their total ignorance of how laws are made.

And many Democrats did make that appeal -- that racial appeal -- under Jim Crow. \"Vote for me because of my race.\" It's disgusting. But it's everywhere now and Democrats applaud it. Yesterday, for example, former Obama spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted, Ocasio-Cortez and her faction provides, quote, \" ... the vision and moral center of today's Democratic Party.\" That's a view that is widely shared, and it is bad news for people like Joe Biden. Like Pelosi, Biden has dedicated his entire life to the Democratic Party. As Pelosi has, Biden has beautifully moved left with the party over the years and hasn't complained about it. He is currently running for example, and free healthcare for illegal aliens. But none of it has been enough. People like Joe Biden are the past in the Democratic Party, and like so many others he is being denounced. Wait for it, as a racist. It's over for Joe Biden.

They don't think their neighbors and friends are racist either. They don't care about that, they care about their jobs, their safety, their families, their country. For years, they've watched in despair as both major parties drifted away from those concerns. They took a chance selecting Donald Trump because he seemed willing to put the basics first.

And, you know, I go back and forth between feeling sorry for Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and kind of laughing at them because they've gotten what they deserve. They have been little weenies afraid to stand up to these people, afraid to call out these people and at times use some of their exact same tactics. You know, when, when Joe Biden announced his campaign, how did he do it? He began it by accusing Donald Trump of being a racist and lying about what happened in Charlottesville, and in my book \"Still Winning,\" I have a whole chapter devoted to what a complete total lie that is that Democrats keep spreading. But you know, my goodness, this is why Donald Trump will get reelected, if you ask me.

But he's got a good point here.\" When Joe Biden or one of these other people says something that's supposed to be shocking, and outrageous to the system, everybody in America is like, \"What in the hell is she talking about? She's talking about drinking out of toilets on the border? What the hell is wrong with this woman?\" And I think that that sort of disconnect is very, very -- it's very clear to American voters, even if it is completely lost on our colleagues in the media, which apparently it is."

But the San Francisco School Board has just voted to spend $600,000.00 to destroy the murals, not temporarily, but forever. They say they are too offensive to survive. Every Democrat running for President this year ought to be asked, do you support this? Politicians destroying art they find politically disagreeable? Don't count on that question being asked.

They think that those false cries of racism and bigotry will be used against them, and that's what they fear the most.

Actually no. Chris Cuomo can't do any of that. It turns out he has an even more impressive qualification. His father was the Governor of New York. If you want to get into a top American college, it's best to have a parent who is a well-known Democratic politician. That's the most effective credential of all and don't take our word for it.

Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey is a Harvard parent. So is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer sent both his kids to Harvard. Barack Obama sent one of his, so did former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. The all-time record, though, must go to former Vice President Al Gore. Al Gore sent four. Imagine that. Four kids in a row to Harvard. What are the odds of that occurring in nature? Well, statistically, it's about as likely as getting hit by lightning every single day for a year. And yet somehow the Gore family pulled it off. Congratulations Gore family. Andrew Cuomo, the sitting Governor of New York sent one of his kids to Harvard, but the other two went to Brown. That's also an Ivy League university that your kids could never get into. Brown is, as they say, highly selective, at least for the children of non- politicians. But for pure 200-proof exclusivity, nothing beats Stanford University outside San Francisco. You can live your entire life in this country and never meet a single person who went to Stanford.

Are they impressive, hardworking kids who deserve to be at one of this country's most prestigious universities? Possibly, maybe some of them. Maybe not. It doesn't matter. In fact, it's irrelevant. They're the offspring of prominent Democrats. That's the point. And that's why they're at Georgetown. So how does this happen? What happens because our meritocracy is a sham, it's fake. They tell you that only the most accomplished students get into these schools, but they're lying. Their friends' kids get first dibs, fellow members of their social circle, kids whose families can help them down the road. The children of sympathetic politicians are an obvious priority for admissions officers. These are the same politicians who funnel billions in tax dollars to colleges and universities every year. So letting a senator's kid into Harvard is just smart business. The quid pro quo is obvious. It's a kind of unregulated lobbying. Remember, the Varsity Blues scandal in California where a group of socially anxious soccer moms tried to game the college admission system? Well, this is far more corrupt than that, except that nobody is going to prison for it. So how many Chris Cuomo's get into Yale every year? It'd be nice to know, but we don't know. Like almost everything about higher education, it's opaque. Prestigious schools can pretend that they admit only the most qualified applicants because nobody can prove otherwise. The real admissions numbers are secret. They're hidden from public view, even though we pay for those schools because all of them take massive amounts in tax dollars. Elite colleges are like public companies that lie about their balance sheets. They're cooking the books to defraud shareholders. In this case, the shareholders are the entire country. A handful of elite schools form the gateway to success in America. If you go to Harvard, you're all but guaranteed to make more money over the course of your life than someone who didn't go to Harvard. It's that simple. And so when you rig the admission system, what you're really rigging is American society. You're creating an impenetrable class system for your own benefit. And that's exactly what they're doing. You often hear progressive said that they worry about income inequality. They don't mean it at all. How do you know they don't mean it? Because if the left really cared about the stratification of American society, they would make college admissions transparent. They'd force Stanford, for example, to open the books and show the rest of us how exactly they were assembling this year's freshman class. That's what they do. And yet Democrats in Congress haven't done that and won't do that. They seem strangely incurious about how the process works. Like they don't really want to know all the details. In fact, they already know precisely how the admissions game works, and they strongly approve. Why wouldn't they approve? Their kids are benefiting from it.

So she was talking -- she used some numbers, which always interests and excites me, because I think people are doing math. It later ends up not being true. But that's beside the point. She went on to say that this program would close the wealth gap between black and white families by 31 percent, and I thought, \"How interesting. Where did she get that number?\" So I read through her website, and then I went to the Demos Study that she cited and they basically did a study where they said, well, if all values of homes go up -- go up -- first of all, and go up by the same amount over time, then this would close that wealth gap. So she is assuming home values always go up and no matter where you buy them, they go up by a lot. Well, if there's one thing we all learned in the last housing crisis and financial crisis, it's that that's not true.

And first of all, that's just not true. And the math they're using is ridiculous. But then beyond that, you're right. This is what caused the housing crisis. If you look back at the at the home values over time, it was actually during the Bush administration, when we decided that homeownership was a value everyone should have and HUD invested heavily in that, that we created the bubble that burst and crippled a whole bunch of people. So you're right, this could actually be really bad for families who took her up on her offer."

But under her program, if I'm getting this right, one family can go to the government and say, can I have help buying a house and be told no, you're the wrong color. Another family would be told, you're the right color, yes, you can have money to buy a house. Why is that not racist?"

And if you talk to millennials nowadays, they don't want to own things because they've seen the hazard in that, the risk in that when you buy a home, you're stuck there, you can't walk away. And she talks about -- this is really interesting. She says it's the credit rating that's holding everyone back. So she wants to make a Fair Credit Reporting Act that includes rent payments, cell phone payments, and utility payments go towards your credit score. That's a really interesting idea that could cut both ways. Can you imagine for young people, your cell phone payments, utility payments or rent payments, if you don't make those that also destroys your credit score. That's what she's advocating for. So I don't know if this is very well thought out, Tucker."

But of course they don't. Instead, every major candidate is competing to see you can be more brazen in backing completely open borders. It's gotten so bad that even President Obama's DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson can't take it anymore. In a new column in \"The Washington Post,\" Johnson accuses his party of extremism and says the policies that the candidates for President advocate would in fact amount to open borders no matter how much they pretend otherwise. Rob Smith is a Turning Point USA spokesman, he joins us tonight. Rob, so when Jeh Johnson, who I don't think anyone would describe as some kind of right-wing plant starts calling you an open borders extremist, I mean, that's kind of the end of -- that's kind of proof, I would say, would you?"

And they say over and over and over again that it's not open borders. They say it's not open borders, but you just played a clip of Beto O'Rourke literally saying that he would tear down the section of the wall at the border that he was being filmed at right then in there, so it is. And I do have to say as a black American, illegal immigration hurts black Americans the most. It hurts us very, very badly. You know, when I was watching that Democratic debate, and I watched every single Democrat candidate for President raise their hand when they said that they would advocate for free healthcare for illegal immigrants. I looked and I said, what American of any color thinks that the Democrats have anybody else in mind other than illegal immigrants? So they have totally turned into the party of illegal immigration, and it is hurting black Americans. It really is."

So that tells you that we're not stupid. So we see what's going on here. And we see people advocating for things like free college, free healthcare and of all these different things. And the number one we ask is who is going to pay for it? Obviously, it's not just going to be the rich, obviously, it's going to be the middle class. And another thing Democrats do when they try to attract Latino Americans is that they try to pretend that Hispanic and Latino Americans are all illegal. I know a lot of legal Hispanic Americans that are absolutely against immigration, absolutely against open borders and what I see honestly as a voter, as an African-American as somebody who turned conservative within the past couple years specifically because of this illegal immigration issue, what I've seen is that the party that was historically supposed to be for African-Americans is selling us out for illegal immigrants. I'm telling you the conversation on the streets, people are talking about the same thing. I hear conversations in my black barbershop in Brooklyn that would make both you and I blush, Tucker, you know, you and I would both probably not speak as freely about that."

When you look in 2016, when you look at the fact that Donald Trump got more black voters than the previous two Republican nominees combined, right, and you see the RNC and Donald Trump and the Republicans are actively going for African-American voters, we have to talk to African American voters and say, \"Do you want to vote for Republicans or do you want to vote for the party of open borders?

Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox medical correspondent. He just wrote a piece about bio weapons and he joins us tonight to terrify us."

      "utterance": "I am going to terrify you tonight because there's something called synthetic biology. We used to look at the anthrax threat or the smallpox threat and say, well, we have vaccines for smallpox and for anthrax, it's not contagious. That's in preexisting days. But now we've entered an era where we can put together a novel virus called synthetic biology. The Department of Defense put out a report on this last year. It's terrifying because tools that are out there, Tucker, like CRISPR-CAS9 that is a genetic editor. It's a scissor that can splice your DNA. But guess what else it can do? It could splice up a virus, put it back together in a different way. Make it more deadly, make it something your immune system hasn't seen, make it something that spreads easily that we don't have vaccines for. Now, I have news for you. Iran is working with that with this tool. Now the scientists working with it in Iran are not terrorists. But of course, Iran sponsors worldwide terrorism. So what happens if this somehow gets into the wrong hands? Not the tool necessarily, but someone makes one of these viruses and then spreads it into the wrong hands. That is something that's possible. And it's something that a steering committee put together by HHS in the fall is looking at. But this is mushrooming into a much bigger threat than we ever thought. Because again, we can see new viruses that we've never seen before, that are much more deadly and spread much more easily. A pandemic flu for example, like 1918, somebody could take a flu virus, change it just a little bit and we have 1918 again."

      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, sure. And not only that, we are looking at ways to try to combat this, like I said, flu, we're looking at the idea of a universal flu vaccine that would work even against a synthetic flu. But as you know, again, not to scare people, but terrorists are not exactly thinking about their own health or social responsibility, that's for sure. So this could really get out and end up being a worldwide threat. I think we need to be thinking about this more. The steering committee is fine. But you know, we're talking today about enriching uranium in Iran. We also should realize that Iran has a bioterror program, North Korea has a bioterror program. And in North Korea, the bioterror program is predominantly existing threats that are already out there. We've talked on the show here about how Ebola is so deadly. But Ebola doesn't spread easily. But Tucker, you could take an Ebola virus and genetically engineer it and then it starts to spread more easily. That's what we have to be concerned about right now."

Ed Henry is really one of the best people here at Fox, he is not just a talented reporter, though he obviously is, he is a genuinely loving person. You don't need proof of that. But here it is, anyway, tomorrow Ed will be temporarily taking leave of Fox in order to save the life of his sister Colleen. She's got a degenerative liver disease so Ed is donating much of his own liver in order to save her life. As in all surgeries, there is a risk of complications, but for Ed, it was worth it to help his sister. The prayers of our entire show staff are with Ed Henry and his sister, Colleen at this time and we know that all of the Fox is behind them as well. Godspeed, for sure. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. DVR it if you know how that works. In the meantime, have a great night and prepare yourself. Live from New York City this evening comes the host of the 9:00 p.m. show on FOX News Channel.
