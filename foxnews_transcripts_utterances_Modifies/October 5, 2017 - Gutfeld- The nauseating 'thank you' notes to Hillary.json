And you know, I waited because I thought, you know, they don't need me saying, \"Hey, send naval assets. Get the hospital ship Comfort down there.\" But a couple of days later, nothing was happening. So I tweeted.  If they aren't the highest priority of your government in responding to such a natural disaster, what are -- what are you people spending your time doing? Right? Golfing, tweeting, watching cable TV?   She's a real piece of work. Look, I don't blame her. She's still angry, still bitter, still Hillary. Apparently finding her grandchildren boring, she cruises the airwaves, slamming the guy who beat her, still, as people suffer and the guy who won consoles them. At times she sounds like she's campaigning. But for what? It's like this is high school, and she's vying for Most Likely to Clear a Room With Her Blood-curdling Laugh.  There's tragedies going on from Vegas to Puerto Rico and Hillary sees fit to remind people what she would've done if she were in charge. She would have done something. But during the election, she did almost nothing but lose. She's like a dumped ex who keeps writing long letters to the guy's parents, reminding them how their son screwed up. Oh, but I saved the best for last. You're going to love this. Check out the female writers at Jimmy Fallon, writing Hillary thank-you notes. Warning to viewers: Have a bucket nearby.",
