Director Jim Comey. For years we've been hearing rumors about what Comey was up to in the opening days of the Trump administration. And now we know. Catherine Herridge is Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent. She joins us tonight -- Catherine,",

      "sentences": "Thanks, Tucker. This is the second time the government watchdog found Comey went beyond his authority as F.B.I. Director. The first was handling of the Clinton e-mail case.  The Inspector General said Comey violated F.B.I. policy and his employment agreement quote, \"What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigated information obtained during the course of F.B.I. employment in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\"  Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the memos documenting private conversations with the President were government records and not Comey's to share with his lawyers or the media. After he was fired, Comey used a Columbia Law School Professor as a cut out to get the contents of one member to \"The New York Times.\" That law professor told the Inspector General he was the source for another \"New York Times\" story about Trump asking Comey for loyalty.  But on Twitter today, Comey claim vindication because the IG found no classified information was shared with the media. The Justice Department has declined to prosecute, fueling criticism that D.O.J. and F.B.I. employees are getting a pass. And today the IG also released this report about a senior Justice Department official who viewed pornography on government computers and then lied about it. No prosecution there either. Critics call this the Department of Just Us -- Tucker.",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "sentences": "Katherine, no surprise they call it that. Well, you'll know that for more than two years since Donald Trump fired him from his job, Jim Comey has maintained that he did absolutely nothing wrong at any level. He said that Donald Trump is a deranged madman, likely a foreign agent, and that he, Jim Comey, is the embodiment of moral rectitude -- the last honest man in Washington.  If you're paying attention to Twitter today, you saw Comey making that case even today, but with the release of this report, we can say definitively it is all a lie. The report proves it. It is a devastating assessment, as Catherine just suggested.   The report shows it from the very beginning of the Trump administration, Comey pursued a partisan political agenda and that he did it in the sleaziest most feline possible way. For example, publicly, Comey has claimed that he met with a newly elected President in January of 2017, in order to give him as much information as he could about the Steele dossier as a courtesy. But according to several witnesses, that account is false. In fact, Comey treated the interview with the President as an Intelligence gathering operation. He stashed a secure F.B.I. laptop in the car that he took to the White House so that he could immediately begin writing a memo about the meeting after it concluded. In other words, the whole thing was a setup and it was just one of many.   In the end, Jim Comey wrote seven memos like this, at least two of them contained information the government later classified as secret, but Comey leaked the information nonetheless. In the words of the Inspector General's report, quote, \"By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his F.B.I. employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey we set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current F.B.I. employees and the many thousands more former F.B.I. employees who have similarly had access to our knowledge of nonpublic information,\" end quote. All of which is putting it mildly. Jim Comey was the most powerful law enforcement official in the country. There was virtually nothing he couldn't do. He used his power for political ends, and there's nothing more corrupt than that.  Of course, we suspected that already. More than a year ago, Comey announced it to the world in fact. In an April 2018 interview with George Stephanopoulos, Comey admitted that he hid the origins of the Steele dossier from his boss, the President. Watch.",

John Brennan once ran the C.I.A., James Clapper was Director of National Intelligence. Like Comey, both men are proven liars with a weakness for conspiracy theories. And yet in Washington, all three of them are still considered impressive. And that may be the scariest fact of all.

And of course, we all know that at the end of that, he decided that despite the fact that she had broken all of the rules, that he decided that he would file no charges. And I really have a hard time seeing how you can make any argument other than that he believes that there are certain people who are above the law, and those people are people like Jim Comey, and Hillary Clinton.  But you bet that if a lower level F.B.I. and by the time this thing is over with, we will probably see this come to fruition, a lower level F.B.I. agent, or a regular American citizen or another government employee committed this level of crimes, they would go to jail.",

They had the most access to the most damning and penetrating information that you could find about fellow American citizens, these people were in charge.  And I think, there's no doubt in my mind that Jim Comey was weaponized during the Department to go after a duly elected President to try to get them removed. And you know, the most interesting, the most kind of shocking part of all of this to me is to look through his Twitter feed today, and he is spiking the ball today, because he is not going to jail. That's really strange.  And I think that the sort of tell there that's revealed by that is the fact that that he did lie about the purposes of his meeting at the Oval Office, and he said that he was just there to inform the President of what was out there, whatever that means.

You know, the F.B.I. has maintained from the beginning, and you know this, Tucker, that there was two reasons that they gave that briefing to the President elect in January.   One was to inform of about Russia's attempts to interfere in our election, and the other was to tell him about this damaging allegation that was in the Steele dossier. And those of us who watch this knew that that never stood to scrutiny, because I mean, how on Earth do you go and give a briefing to the President elect and not tell him that you've got a counterintelligence investigation open against his campaign for colluding against Russia?  So it had to be for other reasons. One of them, we think, of course, was to -- it was a hook for the news media to get the dossier out in the public, have a reason to publish it. And now we find from the IG report that in fact, the entire team met before Comey went in there with hopes that the President would say something incriminating in that meeting, and then he immediately rushes off back to his car and goes back and the first thing he does is holds a meeting with his Crossfire Hurricane investigation team.",

The classified piece is a little more complex, because he gave the memos not to Richman, but he gave all his memos to his lawyers, and there were small bits of classified information in there, but they were marked classified later. So the question is, did he know? Right? We've done this before with Clinton, did he know that those should have been classified at the time? And it's possible, they looked at that and said, \"You know what? It's kind of a tossup and you could make the argument that they shouldn't be classified.

Why wasn't he, given that damning report by the Inspector General? And the reason he wasn't was of the seven memos that he memorialized, these were private phone and person-to-person conversations with the President. He took four of them home and he used them as an insurance policy in case something would happen. When he was fired, he used them. And then he said that they were confidential and not classified. Who made that determination? Well, after what all blew up to the press, the F.B.I. panicked and they said, \"You know, these hadn't been classified or categorized as anything. Let's go back and look at them.\" And who were \"they\"? Who were the four people that looked at them? They were mister -- three steps -- and we know had gone to London three times involved with Christopher Steele and British Intelligence. There was James Baker, who we know was leaking to Mother Jones and David Corn to get out the Steele dossier to the press before the election. And in an Orwellian sense, there were Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, no comment needed. So those four people after the whole thing blew up, they got together and said, \"Let's categorize these. Oh, the ones that Comey took home, we've determined are confidential and not felonious, and the ones he left behind, we will say are classified, but he's not subject to criminal exposure, because he didn't take those three home.\" How hard would it been to get three or four F.B.I. agents that were not involved in spreading and seeding the Steele dossier and we're not confidants of Jim Comey. It's exactly the type of behavior that's getting people very, very disillusioned.

CAIR was too radical for the Obama administration, and yet just the other day, CAIR pops up issuing a press release -- in fact yesterday -- announcing that they are partnering with the Census Bureau, the current Census Bureau to promote participation in the 2020 census. Now CAIR's goal for the partnership is obvious overtly political. They want to pressure the Census to create a new ethnic category for people from the Middle East and North Africa. So just in case you're scoring at home, here's a state of play. The Census is not allowed to ask anyone in our country, whether they're a citizen, but they are allowed to partner with a group described as an unindicted co-conspirator to push a political agenda. So we brought this to the attention of the Commerce Department today, and thank heaven, it looks like they've reconsidered. They gave us this statement just about an hour ago, we're quoting, \"Based on further review, the Census Bureau is no longer partnering with CAIR,\" end quote. It's about as definitive and welcoming a statement as you could hope for, but it's another lesson you've got to pay really close attention to what's going on in the Federal bureaucracy, because there's a lot going on in the Federal bureaucracy. Well, just a couple of days ago, we told you about the crisis in Montgomery County, Maryland which is a sanctuary jurisdiction. We told you how in a single month, five illegal aliens had been arrested for rape. It turns out, we spoke too soon. Now, a sixth illegal immigrant has been arrested for rape this month. Nestor Lopez Guzman is from El Salvador. He is accused of molesting a 12- year-old girl as well as her younger brother. Vince Coglianese is a DC radio host with WMAL in the morning. He has been following these stories. He joins us tonight. Vince, thanks a lot for coming back with an update to the story.

Director Jim Comey. For years we've been hearing rumors about what Comey was up to in the opening days of the Trump administration. And now we know. Catherine Herridge is Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent. She joins us tonight -- Catherine,"

The Inspector General said Comey violated F.B.I. policy and his employment agreement quote, \"What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigated information obtained during the course of F.B.I. employment in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\" Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the memos documenting private conversations with the President were government records and not Comey's to share with his lawyers or the media. After he was fired, Comey used a Columbia Law School Professor as a cut out to get the contents of one member to \"The New York Times.\" That law professor told the Inspector General he was the source for another \"New York Times\" story about Trump asking Comey for loyalty. But on Twitter today, Comey claim vindication because the IG found no classified information was shared with the media. The Justice Department has declined to prosecute, fueling criticism that D.O.J. and F.B.I. employees are getting a pass. And today the IG also released this report about a senior Justice Department official who viewed pornography on government computers and then lied about it. No prosecution there either. Critics call this the Department of Just Us -- Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Katherine, no surprise they call it that. Well, you'll know that for more than two years since Donald Trump fired him from his job, Jim Comey has maintained that he did absolutely nothing wrong at any level. He said that Donald Trump is a deranged madman, likely a foreign agent, and that he, Jim Comey, is the embodiment of moral rectitude -- the last honest man in Washington. If you're paying attention to Twitter today, you saw Comey making that case even today, but with the release of this report, we can say definitively it is all a lie. The report proves it. It is a devastating assessment, as Catherine just suggested. The report shows it from the very beginning of the Trump administration, Comey pursued a partisan political agenda and that he did it in the sleaziest most feline possible way. For example, publicly, Comey has claimed that he met with a newly elected President in January of 2017, in order to give him as much information as he could about the Steele dossier as a courtesy. But according to several witnesses, that account is false. In fact, Comey treated the interview with the President as an Intelligence gathering operation. He stashed a secure F.B.I. laptop in the car that he took to the White House so that he could immediately begin writing a memo about the meeting after it concluded. In other words, the whole thing was a setup and it was just one of many. In the end, Jim Comey wrote seven memos like this, at least two of them contained information the government later classified as secret, but Comey leaked the information nonetheless. In the words of the Inspector General's report, quote, \"By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his F.B.I. employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey we set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current F.B.I. employees and the many thousands more former F.B.I. employees who have similarly had access to our knowledge of nonpublic information,\" end quote. All of which is putting it mildly. Jim Comey was the most powerful law enforcement official in the country. There was virtually nothing he couldn't do. He used his power for political ends, and there's nothing more corrupt than that. Of course, we suspected that already. More than a year ago, Comey announced it to the world in fact. In an April 2018 interview with George Stephanopoulos, Comey admitted that he hid the origins of the Steele dossier from his boss, the President. Watch."

John Brennan once ran the C.I.A., James Clapper was Director of National Intelligence. Like Comey, both men are proven liars with a weakness for conspiracy theories. And yet in Washington, all three of them are still considered impressive. And that may be the scariest fact of all.

    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "To me, one of the most shocking aspects that's kind of new here is just to look at the similarities between what the coordinated effort to thwart all of the rules of proper investigation, investigative conduct, on the part of James Comey, how similar the crimes he committed were to the crimes he was supposedly investigating, committed by Hillary Clinton. And of course, we all know that at the end of that, he decided that despite the fact that she had broken all of the rules, that he decided that he would file no charges. And I really have a hard time seeing how you can make any argument other than that he believes that there are certain people who are above the law, and those people are people like Jim Comey, and Hillary Clinton. But you bet that if a lower level F.B.I. and by the time this thing is over with, we will probably see this come to fruition, a lower level F.B.I. agent, or a regular American citizen or another government employee committed this level of crimes, they would go to jail."

They had the most access to the most damning and penetrating information that you could find about fellow American citizens, these people were in charge. And I think, there's no doubt in my mind that Jim Comey was weaponized during the Department to go after a duly elected President to try to get them removed. And you know, the most interesting, the most kind of shocking part of all of this to me is to look through his Twitter feed today, and he is spiking the ball today, because he is not going to jail. That's really strange. And I think that the sort of tell there that's revealed by that is the fact that that he did lie about the purposes of his meeting at the Oval Office, and he said that he was just there to inform the President of what was out there, whatever that means. I have never heard of an F.B.I. Director needing to do that."

I was just thrilled to see this report, though, because we've been waiting for years, right, for someone to come out in a position of authority, who was neutral and who would just tell it like it is which by the way, is not the way Jim Comey has told it. And I think that that was one of the most important aspects of this report was that the Inspector General said, you know, all those -- the entire line Jim Comey has been spinning for years to the nation, and to the F.B.I., it's all a bunch of hooey. He broke the rules. And what he did was absolutely inappropriate. And that's just an important thing for Americans to hear."

You're absolutely right, more information is better, and the people who had their suspicions for the last couple years have been vindicated, I think tonight. So the picture that I took away from this 81-page report, is that this is a guy who from the very first day was attempting to entrap his boss."

You know, the F.B.I. has maintained from the beginning, and you know this, Tucker, that there was two reasons that they gave that briefing to the President elect in January. One was to inform of about Russia's attempts to interfere in our election, and the other was to tell him about this damaging allegation that was in the Steele dossier. And those of us who watch this knew that that never stood to scrutiny, because I mean, how on Earth do you go and give a briefing to the President elect and not tell him that you've got a counterintelligence investigation open against his campaign for colluding against Russia? So it had to be for other reasons. One of them, we think, of course, was to -- it was a hook for the news media to get the dossier out in the public, have a reason to publish it. And now we find from the IG report that in fact, the entire team met before Comey went in there with hopes that the President would say something incriminating in that meeting, and then he immediately rushes off back to his car and goes back and the first thing he does is holds a meeting with his Crossfire Hurricane investigation team."

Comey and the people on the seventh floor left all of that in shambles. And I'm not sure people in Washington, D.C. right now know how to fix that. The F.B.I. has never faced this. The F.B.I. has never had a time in history, where so many people, people like myself, people -- former agents, and employees -- really are suspicious of how much we can still trust whatever is left of the F.B.I. now. Now, I have to say there's thousands of dedicated F.B.I. employees, and they're the same as they've always been. But literally, they watched as the seventh floor set double standards, one set of standards for them, the execs, the bosses; and another set of standards for the people that work in the F.B.I. and that's why we have the mess we have today.

Now, they chose not to prosecute, I think they looked at the case and said, \"Look, this is probably not the slam dunk case we want.\" But Andy McCabe is a slam dunk case. He lied to the F.B.I. in an investigation. Now, you had Horowitz say, \"Look, what Comey did here was a terrible example for the 35,000 employees of the F.B.I.\" What do you think if you're the D.O.J. and you're looking at the next issue that you have to deal with? What kind of example what it set if you let McCabe off the hook for actually lying in an F.B.I. investigation? That's a terrible precedent."

And so we're talking about Federal records that he had to return to F.B.I. or not take in the first place. Now, there's no criminal sentencing for that. There's no criminal charge for that. The classified piece is a little more complex, because he gave the memos not to Richman, but he gave all his memos to his lawyers, and there were small bits of classified information in there, but they were marked classified later. So the question is, did he know? Right? We've done this before with Clinton, did he know that those should have been classified at the time? And it's possible, they looked at that and said, \"You know what? It's kind of a tossup and you could make the argument that they shouldn't be classified. And so I'm not sure that we can get a conviction. Do we want to go after James Comey on this issue, as opposed to maybe something down the road, when you might not be able to get a conviction in Federal court?"

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVID HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",

And the answer is pretty disturbing, Tucker, because Jim Comey is high five-ing tonight because he said he wasn't indicted, or he wasn't going to be referred for indictment. Why wasn't he, given that damning report by the Inspector General? And the reason he wasn't was of the seven memos that he memorialized, these were private phone and person-to-person conversations with the President. He took four of them home and he used them as an insurance policy in case something would happen. When he was fired, he used them. And then he said that they were confidential and not classified. Who made that determination? Well, after what all blew up to the press, the F.B.I. panicked and they said, \"You know, these hadn't been classified or categorized as anything. Let's go back and look at them.\" And who were \"they\"? Who were the four people that looked at them? They were mister -- three steps -- and we know had gone to London three times involved with Christopher Steele and British Intelligence. There was James Baker, who we know was leaking to Mother Jones and David Corn to get out the Steele dossier to the press before the election. And in an Orwellian sense, there were Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, no comment needed. So those four people after the whole thing blew up, they got together and said, \"Let's categorize these. Oh, the ones that Comey took home, we've determined are confidential and not felonious, and the ones he left behind, we will say are classified, but he's not subject to criminal exposure, because he didn't take those three home.\" How hard would it been to get three or four F.B.I. agents that were not involved in spreading and seeding the Steele dossier and we're not confidants of Jim Comey. It's exactly the type of behavior that's getting people very, very disillusioned. And because we've already seen with the Clinton e-mail scandal, Comey acted unethically and unprofessionally, but not criminally."

And once he establishes that fact, any means necessary to take down the outsider, the dangerous Trump justified. And that's what's really scary about the whole thing. We have a small group of non-elected conspirators who feel that it's their moral prerogative to destroy an elected President, because they are just morally superior and they have insight that the rest of us don't have, so everyone of us would be in jail if we'd done what Comey did."

The prices of natural gas went down because we found more of it, and the problem with wind power is that it's mainly made at night and it's very expensive to store it. And so the town of Georgetown entered to this contract with a French-owned company. The government of France owns this wind farm that they're buying wind from at night when you're not needing it. And then during the daytime, they have to buy power off the grid. And as a result, they've lost about $30 million in the last four years.

Now, they of course rescinded those increases to the fuel taxes to save the planet. But with a little bit of an increase in France, and then you have chaos. Imagine what it would be like here in America, if we enacted the green New Deal, and electricity prices were about 10 times what they are now. That simply is unacceptable.

During that trial, it was revealed on government wiretaps that CAIR's Executive Director had taken part in early Hamas related organizational meetings held here in the United States."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So unindicted co-conspirator. CAIR was too radical for the Obama administration, and yet just the other day, CAIR pops up issuing a press release -- in fact yesterday -- announcing that they are partnering with the Census Bureau, the current Census Bureau to promote participation in the 2020 census. Now CAIR's goal for the partnership is obvious overtly political. They want to pressure the Census to create a new ethnic category for people from the Middle East and North Africa. So just in case you're scoring at home, here's a state of play. The Census is not allowed to ask anyone in our country, whether they're a citizen, but they are allowed to partner with a group described as an unindicted co-conspirator to push a political agenda. So we brought this to the attention of the Commerce Department today, and thank heaven, it looks like they've reconsidered. They gave us this statement just about an hour ago, we're quoting, \"Based on further review, the Census Bureau is no longer partnering with CAIR,\" end quote. It's about as definitive and welcoming a statement as you could hope for, but it's another lesson you've got to pay really close attention to what's going on in the Federal bureaucracy, because there's a lot going on in the Federal bureaucracy. Well, just a couple of days ago, we told you about the crisis in Montgomery County, Maryland which is a sanctuary jurisdiction. We told you how in a single month, five illegal aliens had been arrested for rape. It turns out, we spoke too soon. Now, a sixth illegal immigrant has been arrested for rape this month. Nestor Lopez Guzman is from El Salvador. He is accused of molesting a 12- year-old girl as well as her younger brother. Vince Coglianese is a DC radio host with WMAL in the morning. He has been following these stories. He joins us tonight. Vince, thanks a lot for coming back with an update to the story. So when you last were here, you shocked us by saying five in a month -- now, a sixth."

      "utterance": "Now, it is six. And then this guy, Guzman, what police say he has done is as horrific as we've heard before. This is an illegal immigrant from El Salvador. He says -- he has admitted now to actually doing this. He molested this little girl, 12 years old over the course of many months over the past year and he has also admitted to molesting a boy as well. He claims that he was playing a game with the boy that he was grabbing at the boy's groin because this is what he did back in El Salvador. This is some sort of in game that's played. I'd imagine many of our El Salvadoran brothers and sisters who are listening to this tonight will be horrified to think that that's in any way reflective of their country. But here he is making that claim to law enforcement. He is an illegal immigrant in a sanctuary county, Montgomery County, Maryland that's been very welcoming to illegal immigrants and in fact, has become a magnet for them. And now they're suffering through this crime. You mentioned that there's five, now six sexual assaults or rapes --"

I asked him, does he regret accusing the President of being terrorist by enforcing the nation's immigration laws? He stuck with it. He doubled down. He says that Trump and I.C.E. are terrorizing the community by making them feel unsafe. This is the world turned on its head."

But all of Montgomery County, Maryland is beginning to speak up about this, whether they're Americans or their immigrants. They were outraged about this. And I've got to say, one more person that needs to be involved in this conversation, the Republican Governor of Maryland is Larry Hogan. Last year, he said that localities need to cooperate more with I.C.E., but he has been pretty quiet over the course of a horrific series of sexual assaults and rapes in that county."

This week, O'Donnell had to retract the story about the President getting loans co-signed by Russian oligarchs. It turns out, there's no evidence that happened. But even after two years of bogus Russia stories, O'Donnell couldn't admit the story was fake. He has ranted at the wrong time, he now says."

There's no Sheriff in town and you can literally say anything on the network as long as you say, \"If true,\" like you know, \"I heard that Tucker Carlson molest colleagues, if true,\" right?

But look, this is par for the course for this network. Over the last month alone, you've had Mika Brzezinski say that Donald Trump wants mass shootings to happen in this country. You have Nicolle Wallace saying that Trump wants to, quote, \"exterminate Latinos.\" You have their intelligence analyst saying that -- she's also on that network at four o'clock, and an NBC intelligence analyst saying that President Trump after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton wanting to re-raise flags as a Bat signal to neo-Nazis. This was all said on their air. So look, Lawrence O'Donnell apologized. That's great, but with apologies needs to be accountability, but nothing is going to happen here because if O'Donnell were actually to apologize, say to the President directly, or the President of the network, or even Comcast came out and said, \"We got this wrong. We need to do better. We apologize.\" That would be seen as a victory for Donald Trump, for the President and that simply ain't going to happen."
