Trump, Jr., had originally said the meeting was about adoption law issues between the U.S. and Russia, and now he's adding that he accepted the meeting due to promises of possible dirt on Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. tweeted out sarcastically, quote obviously, I'm the first person on the campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent. It went nowhere but had to listen. The White House also commenting on the meeting just a short time ago.",

Check this one out: There was over 600 people in a bookstore in South Carolina, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Next picture, these ladies are the Republican ladies of South Carolina. They are Trump fans across the board. They love Trump. They love Fox. They love \"The Specialists.\" And hold onto this picture just for one second. This little girl brought tears to my eyes.

Trump, Jr., had originally said the meeting was about adoption law issues between the U.S. and Russia, and now he's adding that he accepted the meeting due to promises of possible dirt on Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. tweeted out sarcastically, quote obviously, I'm the first person on the campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent. It went nowhere but had to listen.

But here's what I want people to remember and I say this is a Democrat, Donald Trump, Jr. is a businessperson, and I think he approached this meeting with whomever this Russian person was utilizing the rules of engagement of business. You want to figure out how you beat the competition, right? So he wanted to figure out how to beat the competition. Now the rules of engagement in politics are different.

And what I'm saying is that, obviously, Donald Trump Jr. is not engaging this individual for the purposes of business engagement. I'm not saying that there was some profit to be involved.

I'm trying to figure this out. Fusion GPS was the group that was hired to go ahead -- go hire Christopher Steele, a British national, to dig up information on Donald Trump -- negative information on Donald Trump.

If they say we want to have a meeting for X and then come in with the personal motivation of Y, then we have to look back at that and question those individuals. Unfortunately with this, this is just part of a bigger hoax. You know as you were mentioning, this was not the context before in June. However, John Podesta did have prior connections to the Russians. Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton did have connections to Russia and their government, but yet, we're not talking about that."

And I guess in a very broad sense, sort of, but this isn't an actual government official. She's enacted -- and this isn't an actual campaign -- this is his son.

President Obama didn't do anything when Russia, essentially, was moving forward. And so now the president has an opportunity to sort of reset those negotiations and go into this with a positive influence. And there's no question that there is a world leader that doesn't believe that Donald Trump is serious about putting Americans first and making America great again.

President Trump quickly jumping on the report tweeting today, quote, James Comey leaked classified information to the media. That is so illegal. Now the report does not state that the memo, Comey have a friend describe to the New York Times, contained actual classified info.

Now, the professor says these weren't classified documents because they weren't stamped classified. That's what he says. Who knows if they were? I'll take his word for it.

You know, obviously, the problem is that there are so many people involved in this process. I mean, Jim Comey has been all over the board, you know, starting all the way back from last summer; and so, you know, his veracity is somewhat questionable. So I think that, at this point, if there is smoke and fire here, we don't know of any illegal activity has actually occurred. It is somewhat clear that the FBI protocol has been breached in some manner, but if there is anything -- I mean, again, two wrongs don't make a right, as my grandma would always say. If there is something here and there's obviously enough to look into, then you know, Jim Comey deserves to have some kind of investigation by Congress or someone else to at least get to the bottom of whether or not that memo really did include classified information."

There are others, like Rob Portman, like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the more moderates, that are concerned that this is not going to serve their constituents well, because not only do you have issues of pre- existing conditions not being dealt with, but you also have issues of Medicaid being on the chopping block, as well. So how you get -- you move one lever, you get these people. Then you take two steps forward and one step back. So it's going to be very, very difficult for them to get done. And I know Ted Cruz has presented a potential compromise that says, you know, you can have a slimmer plan on the health insurance exchange to reduce costs, which is fine, but frankly, that, again, doesn't address the issue of higher premiums for those with pre-existing conditions.

And also, Eric, I hate to say it, but it feels a bit as if this officer who gave her life for the badge, her wake and her services were planned around the mayor's schedule.

And if he acts like a victim over that, like, \"Oh, they're being mean to me,\" then I'm going to laugh in his face and tell him to shut up. Because you can't -- you can't behave that way and show that it's such a low priority to you and then be surprised. It's not just the NYPD. It's your NYPD if you're the mayor. You're supposed to lead it. So even if you have problems with the NYPD, you're not just some dude. You're the one guy that was the most power to actually make changes if it needs it, but you have to engage. You can't run away."

I just -- words can't describe how disgusted that I was when I heard about this, particularly knowing someone like a leader in Donald Trump, who really puts law enforcement on a pedestal.

Bill de Blasio is not the most popular guy around. And you know, as a Democrat, I -- you know, I'm disgusted by the fact that, No. 1, Bill de Blasio went into the midst of anarchist protesters when he has a job to do here at home. And No. 2, that we're politicizing the death of a law-enforcement officer, which is wrong. I'm not saying \"we.\" I'm saying collectively the fact that things are being scheduled around the mayor. This is a solemn occasion. I have a good friend who's the state senator for the Bronx. He was there on the scene to stop Rivera. And unfortunately, our mayor was not."

Amazing crowd there, just loving the show, as well. And here's the Vero Beach Book Club. Just packed out, this place. It was insane. People coming up. They love the show. They love Fox. This is my good friend, Greg Mosen (ph). Had to put him in there. He traveled -- we did eight stops in two days. Forty-eight hours, insane."

We were in Florida. We were in Panama City, Florida, and she wouldn't let go of that book. She was just so happy, just so happy to be part of the Fox experience. It was just heartwarming."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. It's very clear that Russia is a hoax. President Obama himself prior to the election said that it's impossible to rig the United States elections. There's too many people. It's decentralized, et cetera, et cetera. I believe him, and he did nothing when Russia was attempting to hack. The call to action are for those Republican voters in the districts where these committee people sit. The president needs to call his new buddy, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, and say the investigation is over. Because this is only happening because the Republicans are holding these meetings. It needs to end."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "What about you? What do you think about Russia? I want to ask you. Do you have a different view? I know in Ohio, do people talk about it a lot, or is it only in New York you hear people talk?"

    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "Honestly, the people in Ohio, yes, you know, they may say a thing or two about \"What is all this Russia stuff?\" But at the end of the day, the people in Ohio and, frankly, the people outside of the coasts care about the economy. They care about whether or not they can feed their family, whether or not they're going to keep their job. And, you know, whether or not their kids are going to be able to go to school and whether or not they, you know, can go to the doctor if they get sick. So, you know, inside the Beltway and on the coasts, we get fixated on these issues that the media focuses on when we really, again, whether it's the media or whether it's elected officials in Washington, we need to focus on what the people need, not what stirs the pot."
