So even if Chuck agreed with Trump on immigration just a few years ago, it doesn't really matter. He's got to stay in his cell and the media makes it worse by turning these prisons into business models. There's no way MSNBC or the \"New York Times\" can make any money if Chuck and Nancy agree with Trump. Compromise doesn't sell advertising. Meanwhile, this is all made possible by two years of peace and prosperity. Seriously, the only way we can endure this kind of idiotic malfeasance is if all the big stuff is taken care of -- jobs, terror, economy -- because Trump has gone down his list and ticked off all the big things, the Dems can afford to indulge this lunacy, holding workers hostage and pretending walls are some immoral phenomenon that Trump somehow just invented.

So even if Chuck agreed with Trump on immigration just a few years ago, it doesn't really matter. He's got to stay in his cell and the media makes it worse by turning these prisons into business models. There's no way MSNBC or the \"New York Times\" can make any money if Chuck and Nancy agree with Trump. Compromise doesn't sell advertising. Meanwhile, this is all made possible by two years of peace and prosperity. Seriously, the only way we can endure this kind of idiotic malfeasance is if all the big stuff is taken care of -- jobs, terror, economy -- because Trump has gone down his list and ticked off all the big things, the Dems can afford to indulge this lunacy, holding workers hostage and pretending walls are some immoral phenomenon that Trump somehow just invented. It's quite a spectacle. It makes you hate our government. It makes you want to turn off the news and God forbid, go talk to your family.
