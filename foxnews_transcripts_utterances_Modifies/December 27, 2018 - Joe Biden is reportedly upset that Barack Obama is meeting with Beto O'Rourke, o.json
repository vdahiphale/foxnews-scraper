It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and felling a little better, and this is The Five. 2020 Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, reportedly feeling burned by his former boss according to Vanity Fair. The former V.P. is upset over Barack Obama meeting with other potential 2020 contenders like Beto O'Rourke before he's officially made his decision. A Biden spokesperson pushing back against the story calling it unequivocally false.  Biden may have some other obstacles in his way, a new poll showing 59 percent of Democratic and independent voters are excited for someone entirely new to run for president. Biden comes in second followed by Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke. And 70 percent of those same voters say Hillary Clinton should not run again.  President Trump going after Democrats as we have more of that? No, we don't. Is that just a poll? OK. Well, the teleprompter is working very well today. Marie Harf, now that you're here. I don't think -- even if Biden were upset, I don't think he would say so because it's just obvious that Obama is going to have to meet with lots of Democrats before 2020, right?",

I don't think he's probably very upset about this. It's interesting though in that poll, 59 percent want someone new. I think that we see that in both parties, right? That's how we got Donald Trump. But Joe Biden was at 53 percent. So, Joe Biden knows that he's very popular in the party, he's popular among independents, and Barack Obama is going to have to meet with lots of people. I do think you will see President Obama trying to keep his powder dry a little bit and not really wait into what will be what? Twenty five, thirty people in Democratic primary here?  But if Joe Biden wants to run, Joe Biden will have a lot of support among people like Barack Obama, even if he doesn't endorse him, he was his vice president for 8 years. I don't think he's mad about Beto getting a meeting, like he has thicker skin than that.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and felling a little better, and this is The Five. 2020 Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, reportedly feeling burned by his former boss according to Vanity Fair. The former V.P. is upset over Barack Obama meeting with other potential 2020 contenders like Beto O'Rourke before he's officially made his decision. A Biden spokesperson pushing back against the story calling it unequivocally false. Biden may have some other obstacles in his way, a new poll showing 59 percent of Democratic and independent voters are excited for someone entirely new to run for president. Biden comes in second followed by Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke. And 70 percent of those same voters say Hillary Clinton should not run again. President Trump going after Democrats as we have more of that? No, we don't. Is that just a poll? OK. Well, the teleprompter is working very well today. Marie Harf, now that you're here. I don't think -- even if Biden were upset, I don't think he would say so because it's just obvious that Obama is going to have to meet with lots of Democrats before 2020, right?"

I don't think he's probably very upset about this. It's interesting though in that poll, 59 percent want someone new. I think that we see that in both parties, right? That's how we got Donald Trump. But Joe Biden was at 53 percent. So, Joe Biden knows that he's very popular in the party, he's popular among independents, and Barack Obama is going to have to meet with lots of people. I do think you will see President Obama trying to keep his powder dry a little bit and not really wait into what will be what? Twenty five, thirty people in Democratic primary here? But if Joe Biden wants to run, Joe Biden will have a lot of support among people like Barack Obama, even if he doesn't endorse him, he was his vice president for 8 years. I don't think he's mad about Beto getting a meeting, like he has thicker skin than that."

I think it is -- that is not true. The cult of (ph) personality is the Democrat Party. The cult is Donald Trump, but they're an anti-Trump party and that's all they are at this point. That's why they need a new personality. They're desperately in search of a personality because they think that Trump is all about personality, he's not. It's really about policy. They liked his policies, not his personality. They didn't want just someone new, Marie, they wanted Donald Trump. It wasn't anyone new. And so, they are searching for -- that's why Beto is such a big thing because they're not really sure about, you know, why they like him but they think he's a personality that can take on Trump.

What's ironic to me is how the Dem activist base is sort of freaking out with the top three people in polling are all white men. We've seen a lot of people that have a problem with that. And the Republican Party has been criticized nonstop by Democrats for being the party of white men. And anytime you oppose the policy of President Barack Obama it must have been because you're a racist. And now the women in the minority that are going to be running for president are going to be turning that around on their fellow Democrats. It will be interesting for me to see how Bernie, how Biden, how O'Rourke answer that white male charge which is like almost worse than being a criminal in the Democrat Party right now."

    {

      "utterance": "That will change it. Also the fact that super delegates, these parties elders who are given a lot of power in previous Democratic primary nominating processes, they helped anoint Hillary Clinton, for example, they have much less power now. So the power has been pushed down to the grassroots activists. Democrats in Iowa are different than Democrats in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Nevada now no longer a caucus, now a primary. These things seem very wonky, but they actually matter when there's going to be a very hotly contested primary. That's why you're going to see candidates go to Iowa, go to New Hampshire. You already are. This primary is starting like now."

And the generational struggle just isn't about their 2020 nominee. It's look at the angst that was geared towards Pelosi and to Schumer, people who are in their 70's and have been in leadership for a long time.

He is the one that holds the bully pulpit, so he's the one can do something different. And I think he needs to show, not tell, or show not tweet. So, I would let other people do the talking for me. So he has great people at the customs and border patrol who are civil servants, take them down with the press and let them show them their situation, show them how it would be more effective if they had border fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in these areas. How it would actually save money in the long run because you wouldn't need four people in one area, you just need one person in an area when you have that thing. So, showing not telling I think would be really important. But I also feel like the president has a lot to point to aside from this $5 billion for the wall funding that he has done on immigration that he could take to the base and say, do you want to know what I've done? Here's all these things, asylum claims. Basically getting Mexico to hold asylum seekers rather than being held in the United States, that's such a big deal --"

The visa overstay, which is the really big issue, nobody is talking about that, and he could do that. So, I feel like there are things that he could do that he could talk, then say, like, in addition to all these other things that we want to do with border security, I've done all of these things as well. He's willing to fight all the way up to the Supreme Court for it. He's got a story to tell. I think he gets himself too boxed in just talking about the wall."

Marie has probably been a part of drafting these in the Obama administration. And in that national security strategy, the president shifted us to great power conflict with Russia, with China, a focus on that. So the president is trying to shift us from a Middle East-focused strategy. Admittedly, the Obama administration also wanted to focus us towards Asia. And so what happens is when you're shifting, that means military equipment is different. That means fighting is different.

And so perhaps, you know, you're saying, \"I don't understand to counter Iran anymore,\" or \"I want to focus on ISIS.\" It's done. Moving on. I think the American people just need to understand what the strategy is, because we have a greater strategy. If we're going to actually counter them, we have to be in the region.

But I don't think it's unprecedented. You know, president -- the president has an opinion that we should pull our troops out of Syria. You're right. They're going to be still in the region. We're still going to be there. I think that the press overreacts to everything the president does, and they did to this visit. I mean, the signing of the MAGA hats. Somebody came on, and the analysis was it's a violation of the Hatch Act. I mean, he's signing a MAGA hat. We know the guys like the hats. They want him to sign the hat. He used the word -- what was the word he used? \"Suckers.\" America is no longer suckers. People overreacted to that. \"Oh, how dare you call our troops suckers?\" He wasn't calling the troops suckers. He was saying America -- it's a part of his \"America first\" philosophy.
