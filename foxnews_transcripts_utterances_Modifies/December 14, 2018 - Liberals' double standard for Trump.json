Joining me now with reaction is Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and Kim Strassel, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist. Alan, so Michael Cohen goes from this thug, fixer, goon as they called him, to now a media darling.  I was watching the roundtable at \"Good Morning America\" and they were empathizing with him and it was a beautiful moment for Michael Cohen to come forward and unburden himself to George Stephanopoulos.

If he got out of jail, would anybody really hire him to teach ethics somewhere? I doubt that very much.  But, I'm sure he has mixed motives.

They said that he had not very cooperative. The special counsel's filing was a little bit more generous. But, you know, that brings us to the question of him as a potential witness which was something he discussed with Stephanopoulos against any proceeding that might ever be brought up against President Trump in terms of these campaign finance violations that people are talking about.

He has written a pretty compelling piece for Fox News about how these types of hush money payoffs aren't criminal violations under the FEC rules and that Cohen, they twisted his arm to plead guilty and to throw in all this stuff about the, you know, direction of -- influence the election and so forth.

That is they try to make the story a little bit better. And the idea that he may have told Trump that what he was doing was wrong or illegal, let's be very clear. The laws are very complicated but one thing is very simple. Any candidate can contribute as much as he wants to his own campaign for any purpose. So if Bloomberg runs, he could decide to contribute a billion dollars to the campaign. A candidate can go to the bank, take out $150,000 in cash bring it to a woman and say I'm giving you this -- this to you in order to -- hush money so you won't talk and you won't destroy my campaign.   That would not be a violation of the law. Now, there are ways in which it could become a violation of the law if corporate contributions were involved with the campaign or failure to report, but the reporting requirements here or after the election so, essentially no harm no foul.

The new Michael Flynn documents that dropped just a few hours ago -- remember, Tuesday night, Flynn's attorneys felt that he had been duped by government lawyers and further that he was told he didn't need a legal representation in that interview with the two FBI agents in January of 2017. And he responded today in part writing, \"The agents did not provide General Flynn, his lawyers, with a warning of the penalties for making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. 1001 before, during, or after the interview. Prior to the FBI's interview of General Flynn, Mr. McCabe and other FBI officials decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because the wanted Flynn to be relaxed and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport.\"  They also said, \"That the lack of counsel did not make Flynn lie and that he should have known better. Now Kimberly, you wrote in the Journal that what happened to Flynn was akin to entrapment. Is there anything in today's document -- interesting redactions we're going to get to as well.

Hopefully it's not. Most of Washington would be in jail.  But, you know, and then goes through what he should have known better, he should have known not to -- none of this changes the fact, Laura, that the way they set this up and Jim Comey has essentially admitted it, is that they set it up on a casual basis, let's have a chat.

So, \"The interviewing agents didn't observe any indicia of deception and had the impression at that time that the defendant was not lying or did not think he was lying. Those who miss impressions did not change the fact as the defendant has admitted in sworn testimony in this district court that he was indeed lying and knowingly made false statements to the FBI agents in a national security investigation.\" Those false statements were material, et cetera, et cetera.

You don't lie to the vice president, you don't lie to the press, you don't lie to FBI agents. But the real question is what the FBI did. They asked him questions that they knew the answers to. They weren't trying to get information from him. They were trying to give him an opportunity to lie. That was the purpose.  Comey basically says that. They send in agents like Strzok and they gave him an opportunity to live. He shouldn't have done it, but that's not the way the FBI should operate and they should never discourage anybody from bringing a lawyer. That's why in 53 years of practice I have never had a client sit down with the FBI. I have never had a client testify. They are not here to help you. They pretending they are there to help you.

All the laws and all the rules are set up to make it easy for career politicians to stay in Congress, to stay in government and therefore you never had a conflict because you don't own anything in the real world. Along comes business people and it's almost impossible for them to run because people try to make a mountain out of nothing. So what that people stay in his hotel. He's already said he's not making the profits from it. He's divorced from that, from the Trump company as the president, but so what if the Trump Corporation is making money from it?

They're not going to get an education. They're going to end up in jail. Those are facts. And when you have that type of fact, guess what you're going to have? You're not going to have kids going to high school, they're not going to go to college, therefore they cannot debate and they cannot find themselves with any type of parity with their white counterparts.

By the way, as I was watching this, this morning and at some point he bizarrely after painting this picture of the president as a hopeless liar, Cohen went on to say this."

I just can't wait to see where he ends up next. Maybe, I don't know, Rachael Ray, does she have an open booking? Cohen's been stirring it up for so long, I'm sure he would be great in the kitchen. Joining me now with reaction is Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and Kim Strassel, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist. Alan, so Michael Cohen goes from this thug, fixer, goon as they called him, to now a media darling. I was watching the roundtable at \"Good Morning America\" and they were empathizing with him and it was a beautiful moment for Michael Cohen to come forward and unburden himself to George Stephanopoulos. No other motive possible for him to come forward right now. How credible are these sob stories?"

Frankly, I think they really persuade themselves that they mean it. They persuade their family and they want to mean it because nobody wants to be a phony so, I suspect that deep in his heart, Cohen thinks he's a changed man. If he got out of jail, would anybody really hire him to teach ethics somewhere? I doubt that very much. But, I'm sure he has mixed motives. He wants to appear to his peers and friends and family to have seen evil and redemption. And he also obviously has a secondary purpose, a secondary game of trying to get a reduction of sentence, which I think is unlikely to happen."

      "utterance": "Well, that's the really interesting point here, Laura. You know, remember, one of the reasons he got three years in jail is because at least the southern district of New York was not very complimentary of him in that filing that they made with the court. They said that he had not very cooperative. The special counsel's filing was a little bit more generous. But, you know, that brings us to the question of him as a potential witness which was something he discussed with Stephanopoulos against any proceeding that might ever be brought up against President Trump in terms of these campaign finance violations that people are talking about. Given that even the southern district didn't view him as a credible, trustworthy, helpful person, how good of a witness in such a case would he make?"
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

I mean, Alan, you and I put him on the stand, it's not hard to, you know, get him to wet his pants, sorry, but it's just -- he is not a hard guy to cross examine. But I got to ask about this FEC issue and we're going to move on. We got Michael Flynn (inaudible) guys, but Hans von Spakovsky was a two-term FEC commissioner. He has written a pretty compelling piece for Fox News about how these types of hush money payoffs aren't criminal violations under the FEC rules and that Cohen, they twisted his arm to plead guilty and to throw in all this stuff about the, you know, direction of -- influence the election and so forth. But in this case, he said this kind of payment would not be under the facts that have been put out there so far, would not be a crime. Alan, have you looked into that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "I agree. I have looked into it. First of all, you know, when you get somebody like Cohen, as Judge Ellis put it, not only do they sometimes sing, but sometimes they compose. That is they try to make the story a little bit better. And the idea that he may have told Trump that what he was doing was wrong or illegal, let's be very clear. The laws are very complicated but one thing is very simple. Any candidate can contribute as much as he wants to his own campaign for any purpose. So if Bloomberg runs, he could decide to contribute a billion dollars to the campaign. A candidate can go to the bank, take out $150,000 in cash bring it to a woman and say I'm giving you this -- this to you in order to -- hush money so you won't talk and you won't destroy my campaign. That would not be a violation of the law. Now, there are ways in which it could become a violation of the law if corporate contributions were involved with the campaign or failure to report, but the reporting requirements here or after the election so, essentially no harm no foul. So, I think that the American public is missing the point and many in the media are missing the point --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Again, because you haven't heard the other case. I mean, when you're in court you actually can argue the point. John Edwards did that obviously and Spakovsky pointed that out. He obviously cited the Edwards case as a particularly relevant in this matter. Now, I want to move on to other big stories today. The new Michael Flynn documents that dropped just a few hours ago -- remember, Tuesday night, Flynn's attorneys felt that he had been duped by government lawyers and further that he was told he didn't need a legal representation in that interview with the two FBI agents in January of 2017. And he responded today in part writing, \"The agents did not provide General Flynn, his lawyers, with a warning of the penalties for making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. 1001 before, during, or after the interview. Prior to the FBI's interview of General Flynn, Mr. McCabe and other FBI officials decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because the wanted Flynn to be relaxed and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport.\" They also said, \"That the lack of counsel did not make Flynn lie and that he should have known better. Now Kimberly, you wrote in the Journal that what happened to Flynn was akin to entrapment. Is there anything in today's document -- interesting redactions we're going to get to as well. Why they redacted certain things, but there is anything that you saw today that changes your thinking or maybe even solidifies it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "It's an incredibly unpersuasive document, Laura. First of all, one thing that really struck me is how defensive it sounded. We are used to these special counsel filings where they hold all the cards. This one went out of its way to also point out that Michael Flynn had lied to the press as if that is a crime. Hopefully it's not. Most of Washington would be in jail. But, you know, and then goes through what he should have known better, he should have known not to -- none of this changes the fact, Laura, that the way they set this up and Jim Comey has essentially admitted it, is that they set it up on a casual basis, let's have a chat. There seems to be no question that Flynn believed he was going to sit down and go through some of these questions when in fact what they were conducting was a formal interview and they didn't go through any of the motions or any of the standard procedures of a formal interview."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Hold on, hold on. I want to just read -- Alan, I want you to respond to this because I know this is what you want to address. Now, this is in the government's filing that just dropped, OK, responding to the question about the agents themselves not thinking that Flynn lied. So, \"The interviewing agents didn't observe any indicia of deception and had the impression at that time that the defendant was not lying or did not think he was lying. Those who miss impressions did not change the fact as the defendant has admitted in sworn testimony in this district court that he was indeed lying and knowingly made false statements to the FBI agents in a national security investigation.\" Those false statements were material, et cetera, et cetera. Alan, that is a cute formulation by the special counsel's office, that's very cute. But the fact is they were twisting the arm of Flynn and threatening probably his son to get him to say, oh yes, I lied. But the agents themselves did not think he lied, period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Look, on day one, when the charges were leveled against them, I came on this channel and I said he was not guilty and he should fight this and I think he would win on a number of grounds. Look, there are two issues. Did Flynn do the right thing? No. He shouldn't have lied no matter what the circumstances. You don't lie to the vice president, you don't lie to the press, you don't lie to FBI agents. But the real question is what the FBI did. They asked him questions that they knew the answers to. They weren't trying to get information from him. They were trying to give him an opportunity to lie. That was the purpose. Comey basically says that. They send in agents like Strzok and they gave him an opportunity to live. He shouldn't have done it, but that's not the way the FBI should operate and they should never discourage anybody from bringing a lawyer. That's why in 53 years of practice I have never had a client sit down with the FBI. I have never had a client testify. They are not here to help you. They pretending they are there to help you. They pretend they're friendly but they are there to trap you and he fell into the trap. It's his own fault. He fell into the trap, but I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about as a civil libertarian, do we want our government officials to behave this way to help create crimes? I think the answer is no."

The special counsel is appointed to try to uncover crimes that already occurred. In this case, almost all the crimes or crimes that occurred after he became special counsel in many instances and they use those crimes not because they are interested in Flynn or interested in Manafort, but because they want to squeeze him, to sing what they composed.

But this supposed latest blockbuster investigation gives liberals the narrative that the walls are closing in so the president has nowhere to turn, nowhere to go. Here's something you might not know. Back in 2013 special interests contributed 40 percent, that's almost half of the funds for Obama's second inauguration. Here with reaction this Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary to Bush 43 and Robert Wolf, Obama mega donor, former economic advisor to his 2012 campaign and someone who donated money to the 2012 inauguration for Barack Obama.

Now, I don't like to draw conclusions like that about justice because I was raised to believe justice is blind and it must be blind, but, you know, we haven't heard from justice yet on this. These were leaks into the newspaper about an investigation that's not yet confirmed. And if the focus is on foreign contributions and given to straw (ph) men who donated, that is a different matter and that should be investigated but I haven't seen any evidence that anybody in Trump world did anything wrong."

But, anybody you should be able to give whatever lines you're disclosing want, I have no problem you're a big donor to Obama. But, you know, Obama swore off special interests in the first inauguration, but then took corporate money, lobbyist money, teachers unions, all sorts of union money and came to the campaign.

Bush took from the same type of people that Obama took in ‘13. I don't think we're talking about corporate money here. I think to Ari's point, the whole wide deal is were there foreign interests that gave, which is illegal. And secondly, Obama didn't have an Obama hotel, which is there is a lot of scrutiny. So, if you want to go back where corporate interests started, I think in 2005 in the inauguration, Obama took from the same people that George W. Bush took. So I don't think it's about corporate. I think we're talking about were any laws broken? And by the way, I'm not saying any laws were broken, I'm just saying I think that's what they're looking at."

One of the thing that is so unusual and different about Donald Trump, to his credit, he's a businessman. He came from a hotel industry. All the laws and all the rules are set up to make it easy for career politicians to stay in Congress, to stay in government and therefore you never had a conflict because you don't own anything in the real world. Along comes business people and it's almost impossible for them to run because people try to make a mountain out of nothing. So what that people stay in his hotel. He's already said he's not making the profits from it. He's divorced from that, from the Trump company as the president, but so what if the Trump Corporation is making money from it? It is America's private sector and I want people from the private sector to be able to run for office."

Our agents are doing an amazing job to care for these people. Now, we have specialized policies in regards to how we treat juveniles in our custody, unaccompanied minors and those family units. Every time those people come into our custody, we have professional medical staff that will conduct an evaluation on those juveniles to make sure that they are OK to continue through the process.

And Christmas, Laura, is the perfect time to look at the cuisine and the people and our incredible people. The actors Wendell Pierce and Jim Caviezel were part of the who as are some of the best chefs in the city. And the NOLA Players, this sizzling jazz orchestra we put together, it has got members of the Marsalis family in it, and they play all these original compositions. And at this time in our country's history when we are so divided, I think it's important to see a place where the Spanish, the English, the French, the Africans, Germans, Italians came together and created something that lasts."

And the important thing about this, this was as children were boarding flights, the Gary Sinise Foundation each year flies over 1,700 Gold Star children and their surviving parent to Disney World. It's called the Snowball Express. I went down there to Orlando, spent some time with them and Gary Sinise. We will bring this entire story next week. Laura, I think it's the most important feature of the year, and to me one of the most moving. It puts it all in perspective. When you see these families left behind by our servicemen and women and how they carry on, they are amazing heroes. It's beautiful to see."

      "utterance": "There's a reason the media continually asks this question. It's a mindset that seems to have been encouraged by the mainstream of the Democratic Party, the idea that a candidate might face scrutiny simply because he or she is white. Why are we talking about race? I thought we were supposed to get away from judging people on the basis of their skin color. And why isn't that racist? This is the latest in a string of stories we've highlighted to speak to this new reality. Now, whether it's the powerful women's march embracing Louis Farrakhan and still remaining a powerful force inside the Democratic Party, or the no-whites-allowed vacation spots that we reported on earlier this week, how is any of this acceptable? Here to debate it, Hilary Shelton, head of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the NAACP, and Pastor Aubrey Shines of Glory to Glory Ministries. Mr. Shelton, I want to talk to you about this. Maybe I'm just naive here, but I think there has been so much progress. Nothing is perfect, but a lot of progress made at every level of society -- business, entertainment, high- tech, sports, politics. We had a two term African-American president. Why is the Democratic Party now saying banding about this, well, if we nominate a white person that might be problematic. Do you find that to be a little odd?"

I would argue, however, a little bit differently, and that is as we're looking at the challenges and problems we have in our society, there's a racial definition that surrounds those issues as well. So whether we're talking about employment. What's great for President Obama -- President Trump in this particular case to talk about how the African-Americans have the lowest unemployment rates since the data has been collected. But what he left out is that the lowest unemployment rate is still three times higher than our white counterparts. And so looking at the data and as it's designated --"

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "SHELTON",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I'm not even talking about that. I'm talking about the way they were talking about it in those sound bites. Pastor Shines, you know what I'm talking about, those kind of if you are a white person you are immediately suspect, the blacks only vacation spots that we featured earlier this week -- I don't get that. The best person should win. We're seeing all this prison reform being done by Trump and opportunity zones -- that gets just thrown off to the side. He's a racist because he is doing all this good stuff that's going to help underprivileged areas."

      "speaker": "PASTOR AUBREY SHINES, GLORY TO GLORY MINISTRIES",
      "utterance": "Laura, first of all, always great being with you. But Mr. Shelton has left out a tremendous point, and one of those points is simple. It has always been the Democratic Party that has always identified people of color by color. And this is why the Democratic Party is the party that gave you slavery and the KKK, et cetera. So when I hear Mr. Shelton and others begin to espouse these false narratives, it really fits the current narrative that is going on, and that is they overlook the facts. When I hear about this alleged discrepancy, let's take a look at that just very, very quick. If eight out of 10 black kids are not being raised by their fathers, guess what's going to happen? They're not going to get an education. They're going to end up in jail. Those are facts. And when you have that type of fact, guess what you're going to have? You're not going to have kids going to high school, they're not going to go to college, therefore they cannot debate and they cannot find themselves with any type of parity with their white counterparts. Put the dad in the home, let the dad take care of the kids, and guess what, there is no difference in the employment issue at that moment. So it's a false narrative that Mr. Shelton just offered."

But I'm telling you, the rhetoric that we are hearing from some, not all, in the Democrat Party about the type of candidate that we have to see, not on the basis of ideas but on the basis purely of skin color, I think that's a problem. I don't think it's good for Democrats and I don't think it's good for Republicans. I think it's bad for the country. It should be based, as Martin Luther King said, on the content of your character."
