Some media outlets are getting heat for comments regarding North Korea and Kim's little sister at the Olympics. The New York Times headline reads \"Kim Jong-un's sister turns on the charm, taking Pence's spotlight.\" CNN says \"If 'diplomatic dance' were an event at the winter Olympics, Kim Jong-un's younger sister would be favored to win gold.\" Barf. I don't know what's worse, the cheery lede about a murderous regime or that lame joke you could see limping towards you a mile away. Yahoo News wrote: \"All swagger and smiles, Kim Jong-un's mysterious sister gets her star turn. \" What is this, the red carpet at the Grammys? I can't believe they left out who she was wearing -- literally. Anyway, I feel pretty left out in this lovefest. So in honor of Valentine's Day, I made this.",

He send his younger sister over there and that's supposed to take the harsh edge off of the regime. Meanwhile, the regime is killing people in concentration camps. The North Koreans want to drive a wedge between the South Koreans and the United States, and they duped the U.S. media into it. CNN was like the P.R. machine for the North Koreans. They think they're worldly and they're so sophisticated and they're so informed but they were duped by a dictator. And to your point, they think, the media, the diplomacy trumps everything. They don't care about the results. So they will see a handshake, and a smile, or a summit, or a treaty, and that's the end goal for them. They don't care about the results on the other side.  Now, the other thing that was interesting was that the media, it's self- trapping and propaganda, and so does North Korea. So it's no surprise they're both in lockstep. And the U.S. media seems so intent on not being pro-American that they went so out of their way and they cozied up to a human rights abuser. This was from Reuters and I just have to read this, the crowd applauded as she stood for the South Korean anthem during the opening ceremony, while her big smile and relax manner left a largely positive impression on the south. Now, they tricked the reader into thinking the crowd applauded for little rocket man's sister, when in fact they were applauding for their own national anthem. They're also tricking the reader into thinking that the South Korean people are warming up to little rocket man's sister, when in fact, Willie Geist, who I think is a Democrat, but who I respect because he said, he was there, I can report South Koreans here are not as enthralled with Kim Yo-jong as the North Korean cheerleaders as it seems some in the media are back home, something about the north killing, starving and imprisoning its own people.

He send his younger sister over there and that's supposed to take the harsh edge off of the regime. Meanwhile, the regime is killing people in concentration camps. The North Koreans want to drive a wedge between the South Koreans and the United States, and they duped the U.S. media into it. CNN was like the P.R. machine for the North Koreans. They think they're worldly and they're so sophisticated and they're so informed but they were duped by a dictator. And to your point, they think, the media, the diplomacy trumps everything. They don't care about the results. So they will see a handshake, and a smile, or a summit, or a treaty, and that's the end goal for them. They don't care about the results on the other side. Now, the other thing that was interesting was that the media, it's self- trapping and propaganda, and so does North Korea. So it's no surprise they're both in lockstep. And the U.S. media seems so intent on not being pro-American that they went so out of their way and they cozied up to a human rights abuser. This was from Reuters and I just have to read this, the crowd applauded as she stood for the South Korean anthem during the opening ceremony, while her big smile and relax manner left a largely positive impression on the south. Now, they tricked the reader into thinking the crowd applauded for little rocket man's sister, when in fact they were applauding for their own national anthem. They're also tricking the reader into thinking that the South Korean people are warming up to little rocket man's sister, when in fact, Willie Geist, who I think is a Democrat, but who I respect because he said, he was there, I can report South Koreans here are not as enthralled with Kim Yo-jong as the North Korean cheerleaders as it seems some in the media are back home, something about the north killing, starving and imprisoning its own people. I mean, that just says it all."

President Moon and his wife and the Pence's were all in the front row. That's a nice picture. But our staff or his staff should have thought about that cut-shot, it would have been much better for Moon and for Kim Jong-un if they really want to talk about unification, to had have it reversed so the Pence's were on that side and the sister was behind President Moon rather than behind Pence because it's just setup for a really bad photograph, and that's what's actually driven the news for three days."

The minute social security and Medicare starts getting affected, which is going to be about 10-years, this one is going to come in and then it's going to be a crisis. But until then, they're not going to do anything about it. It's not even a real budget. This is a blueprint. It's fine. Trump is a big spending Republican. There's a few deficit hawks doing something about it, but they're not really going to be able to block it. There are things I do like, there's about $22 billion for the border. Eighteen of that is for the wall. The rest of it's for hiring more ICE people and detaining more illegal aliens. I do like the infrastructure package.

So with this kind of infusion of capital for infrastructure and, like you said, broadband, just being able to, like, work smarter, work better, create opportunities there, I think that's something that's very important. And then I also like the money that is being directed towards the opioid epidemic, which is also something that he campaigned about and was very passionate about during the election, has reached, you know, crisis epidemic proportions in this country.

BILL MURRAY, ACTOR/COMEDIAN/WRITER: My friend, who's a great comedy writer, Jim Downey, is accused of being a right-wing writer, a comedy writer, if there is such a thing. He says, \"No, no, I just think that the way that the Democrats handle a thing is poor,\" where they try to pick out little pieces of a population, that \"Well, we represent the Hispanics. We represent LGBT or something.\" And they're not speaking to everyone at once. There's almost a resentment that somehow you're separated again by a politician. You know, \"You're my people.

You can call me a hypocrite for saying how much I hate it when celebrities give political opinions and then say that I love this, but they're not comparable. Because when somebody like Bill Murray says something or Clint Eastwood or Jon Voight says something, they have more to lose. Because they are in an environment that is largely liberal. So if they come out with a comment like that, they have much to lose, which leads me to the obvious point. Bill Murray, Clint Eastwood, John Voight, what do they have in common? They're at the point in their careers where they can't be hurt. They're either older or more established. Their status is high enough that Bill Murray can say this stuff and get -- now half the comics -- all those comics that are half his age, they should be inspired by him and come out and say the things he says.

Get over it.\" But if you're watching it and you do have a kid with a severe -- a severe illness in which they're extolling a practice that would harm or encourage your child, I could understand. For example, let's say this was they were slipping sugar into a diabetic's food or if they were sticking a hemophiliac with, like, a needle. We would probably go, \"That's weird.\" But in this, it's kind of the same thing. So I think that, like, I think that if you have a point that this is encouraging something, but I don't know what you can do about it, because there are so many actions in movies that are encouraging bad things."

If they're alone, he asks them to play.\" And I care more about that than they say, \"Well, he got this grade or that,\" et cetera, because I want him to be a good citizen, meaning treat other people with respect and empathy and understanding. I feel horribly for parents who worry every single day about their children that have these food allergies. I have friends who have lost their children to food allergens. In one in particular, the parents were doctors. It's just very disturbing to see. I'm not a big fan of this whole \"Peter Rabbit\" situation or \"Willy Wonka\" or \"The Wizard of Oz.\""
