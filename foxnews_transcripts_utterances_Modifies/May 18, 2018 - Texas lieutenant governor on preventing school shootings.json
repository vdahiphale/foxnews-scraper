I am Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham tonight and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" A tough day for our nation as we grapple with yet another school shooting this evening. We will bring you complete coverage from every single angle on the tragedy in Texas.  And we dissect a huge move by the Trump administration to strip Planned Parenthood of million dollars of federal funding. Long overdue.  Plus, a brand new report from the New York Times coming out just moments ago on whether team Obama spied on the trump campaign. Fresh new details on that.  As well as a possible change in strategy by President Trump towards North Korea ahead of that big meeting next month. But we begin with the deadly events in the city of Santa Fe, Texas. Witnesses say a 17-year-old whose name I won't dignify reading on the air, walked into an art class in Santa Fe High School this morning and began shooting.  At least 10 people were killed and another 10 wounded. The suspect is in custody. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the teen told officers he planned to kill himself but admitted he didn't even have courage to pull the trigger on himself. The early morning shooting at 8 a.m. Central Time left students in shock. Listen.",

You can imagine the terror they must have experienced here this morning.  We have learned that all schools in the district will be closed at least Monday and Tuesday of next week as this small and devastated community searches for answers and tries to wrap their head around what happened here.   This as the teen gunman made his first appearance in court. Let's show you that video now, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis was charged with capital murder of multiple persons and aggravated assault of a public servant because one of the 10 injured was the school's public resource police officer shot while trying to stop the gunman. That officer is recovering in the hospital after undergoing surgery earlier. Right now, investigators continue combing the crime scene and interviewing two other persons of interest to see is this shooter had help and now a motive is still not clear.  Investigators say there is real no digital foot print portraying a troubled teen like in other shootings, no real red flags, if you will. But it is perhaps that randomness that has really shaken this community. Tonight, grieving students and family members and perfect strangers gathering for a prayer vigil not far from where I am at a nearby bank. Everyone coming together to pray for those who have been impacted. And frankly, it's not hard to go around this small community, southeast of Houston, and find someone who has been impacted by this. It's only a population of 13,000. One of those towns where everyone knows everyone -- Peth.",

This school was one of 186 giving a safety course that Texas offers out of 1,000 schools because of this officer many lives were saved.  Now we grieve tonight, and I want everyone in America to pray for these families that lost their children and lost a substitute teacher as well. The officers not responded quickly, this young man with a shotgun that could hold five to eight shells could have killed or wounded many more. They did their job.   What I look for, what I look for is what can we do next to protect our schools. Governor Abbott will put together round tables and we will meet with people from all points of view, pro-gun and anti-gun. Everything to stop this from happening again. One of the things, Pete, I want to look at. Number one, every parent out there, if you have a gun legally as I do. Lock them up and keep them away. We don't know if he broke into his father's cabinet to get these guns. We hear access to people who have guns. If you don't have a gun safe buy one. Protect your children and also from someone breaking in your house and taking a gun. The designs of our schools. We have too many exits and entrances for shooters to get in school. In Texas we have over 8,000 campuses with multiple locations.  We don't have 30 or 40,000 law enforcement to put at every day. Maybe we need to design schools like other infrastructure where you can only go in and out one door. That might mean changing the way we think about school kids don't come all at one time but staggered.  So, we can check every student. This young man walked in with a trench coat today when it was 90 degrees. Maybe a police officer would have stopped him if he with one entry or exit.

We leave it up to the local school board and parents to make that decision. We have school districts that allow trained teachers to carry. When I was at a hospital with a young man, I will leave his name private for now. He was shot twice. He was in the classroom. He played dead. Thought the shooter with moved. He went to get up and shot again. He will recover but had a series injury.  I was there with Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and there were a lot of student friends in there. They all said we want to arm our teachers. The parents all said arm the teachers. Next door to the art class was a Marine substitute teacher who heard the noise, went out and saw the shooter and locked the door and protected his students, but he was not armed.  Had that Marine been able to carry in that school district, he might have been able to stop that shooter. For those who say guns are the issue -- and we want the best background checks we can have -- but the answer is not taking away guns from people who can defend themselves and others. I think in our schools, leave it up to the parents as we do in Texas and the superintendent. More school districts want to arm teachers who want to be armed and efficient and limit the entrances and exits into these schools. Stagger the start and end times and be sure kids like this don't get in the school house with a gun under their coat.",

If you look the calculations, conniving and the concealment. All of this conscious decision making that went into it, you can see that is there a mentally healthy kid? Obviously not. That's not mental illness. What is it?  It's a narcissistic phenomenon where somebody becomes so wrapped up -- it could be they think they are superior to everybody or inferior and want to get some power, notoriety, whatever. But they feel entitled to indulge that at the expense of other people's very lives. That's not mental illness. That's sociopathy, psychopathy rooted in narcissism.

It's an open secret the identity of the spy or informant that the FBI may have had inside the Trump presidential campaign. Speculation is running rampant after a story in Wednesday's New York Times revealed this -- \"At least one government informant met several times with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.\" We'll learning of another name as well, Sam Clovis, this evening and that's coming from current and former officials. Well, President Trump tweeted that if true, this is bigger than Watergate. He just might be right. Now the Times published a follow-up story saying, \"FBI used informant to investigate Russia ties to campaign not to spy as Trump claims.\" A little editorializing in the headline there of the New York Times, it gets away with every once in a while. Still allies of the president are pushing to find out what role the informant may have played in the Russia investigation. Let's discuss this with Retired FBI Agent Bobby Chacon, along with Democratic strategist, Richard Goldstein, and former Delta Force officer, Jeff Beddie (ph), who is a CIA counterterrorism center case officer and hostage rescue adviser to the FBI. These guys know what they are talking about. Gentlemen, all, thanks for being here. So, Bobby, let me start with you, this headline from the New York Times saying the FBI used the informant to investigate Russia ties and not spying on Trump. What do you make of that?",

They had a source and heard there may be ties with Papadopoulos and Russia and they ran this source at several members of the Trump campaign, Papadopoulos, Page, Flynn, they ran them pretty hard. He lured Papadopoulos over to London for a meeting. He had a young woman with him. Now some of our other guests can tell you, I didn't work counterterrorism. I have friends that do. Having a new young woman at a meeting that later on invited Papadopoulos to a separate meeting alone with just the two of them, that's a recruitment type tool. So they were using pretty aggressive tactics to go after and look at Papadopoulos and Carter Page and to a lesser extent General Flynn. So I think that during the time he was run at Page the FISA was up, so we call that tickling the wire, trying to get conversation generated that you may overhear on your wiretap, in this case FISA. They didn't run this informant at the Russian side of the rumors that they had. They ran him at the Trump side of the thing. And they ran him in my estimation, and I worked a lot of informants in my time, they ran them pretty aggressively at these guys, and they came up with nothing.",

It said Mr. Papadopoulos replied that he had no insight, he's talking to the informant here, no insight into the Russian campaign despite being told months earlier that the Russian had dirt on Mrs. Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails. His response clearly annoyed the informant who tried to press Mr. Papadopoulos about what he might know about the Russian effort according to the person. So would you feel the same way you do right now, which I know you don't agree necessarily with some of the previous assessment, but what if this had been the Obama campaign and the FBI had been aggressively pushing informants to gather information on that campaign?

I think it's interesting as to who might have provided that information or how that information came about. But nonetheless, the thing your viewers should be aware of, to do a confidential informant, to run an operation like that, you don't need to go to a judge. You don't need to get a search warrant. You don't need to prove probable cause. In fact it's a very preliminary step that's designed to try to generate probable cause.  So there is no judge involved. It's simply administratively approved, although this would certainly be a very sensitive one and be maybe approved at a very high level which brings into question the motivations of some of the senior FBI leadership. They may have used a confidential informant tactic here as a fig leaf about the Russian connection as the fig leaf to do what they wanted to do.

Ten people are dead and 10 others injured including a school police officer named John Barnes. He is now in stable condition. One of the victims killed was a foreign exchange student from Pakistan.

Plus, a brand new report from the New York Times coming out just moments ago on whether team Obama spied on the trump campaign. Fresh new details on that. As well as a possible change in strategy by President Trump towards North Korea ahead of that big meeting next month. But we begin with the deadly events in the city of Santa Fe, Texas. Witnesses say a 17-year-old whose name I won't dignify reading on the air, walked into an art class in Santa Fe High School this morning and began shooting. At least 10 people were killed and another 10 wounded. The suspect is in custody. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the teen told officers he planned to kill himself but admitted he didn't even have courage to pull the trigger on himself.

You can imagine the terror they must have experienced here this morning. We have learned that all schools in the district will be closed at least Monday and Tuesday of next week as this small and devastated community searches for answers and tries to wrap their head around what happened here. This as the teen gunman made his first appearance in court. Let's show you that video now, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis was charged with capital murder of multiple persons and aggravated assault of a public servant because one of the 10 injured was the school's public resource police officer shot while trying to stop the gunman. That officer is recovering in the hospital after undergoing surgery earlier. Right now, investigators continue combing the crime scene and interviewing two other persons of interest to see is this shooter had help and now a motive is still not clear. Investigators say there is real no digital foot print portraying a troubled teen like in other shootings, no real red flags, if you will. But it is perhaps that randomness that has really shaken this community. Tonight, grieving students and family members and perfect strangers gathering for a prayer vigil not far from where I am at a nearby bank. Everyone coming together to pray for those who have been impacted. And frankly, it's not hard to go around this small community, southeast of Houston, and find someone who has been impacted by this.

This school was one of 186 giving a safety course that Texas offers out of 1,000 schools because of this officer many lives were saved. Now we grieve tonight, and I want everyone in America to pray for these families that lost their children and lost a substitute teacher as well. The officers not responded quickly, this young man with a shotgun that could hold five to eight shells could have killed or wounded many more. They did their job. What I look for, what I look for is what can we do next to protect our schools. Governor Abbott will put together round tables and we will meet with people from all points of view, pro-gun and anti-gun. Everything to stop this from happening again. One of the things, Pete, I want to look at. Number one, every parent out there, if you have a gun legally as I do. Lock them up and keep them away. We don't know if he broke into his father's cabinet to get these guns. We hear access to people who have guns. If you don't have a gun safe buy one. Protect your children and also from someone breaking in your house and taking a gun. The designs of our schools. We have too many exits and entrances for shooters to get in school. In Texas we have over 8,000 campuses with multiple locations. We don't have 30 or 40,000 law enforcement to put at every day. Maybe we need to design schools like other infrastructure where you can only go in and out one door. That might mean changing the way we think about school kids don't come all at one time but staggered. So, we can check every student. This young man walked in with a trench coat today when it was 90 degrees. Maybe a police officer would have stopped him if he with one entry or exit. I want to look at hardening these soft targets that are our schools."

When I was at a hospital with a young man, I will leave his name private for now. He was shot twice. He was in the classroom. He played dead. Thought the shooter with moved. He went to get up and shot again. He will recover but had a series injury. I was there with Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and there were a lot of student friends in there. They all said we want to arm our teachers. The parents all said arm the teachers. Next door to the art class was a Marine substitute teacher who heard the noise, went out and saw the shooter and locked the door and protected his students, but he was not armed. Had that Marine been able to carry in that school district, he might have been able to stop that shooter. For those who say guns are the issue -- and we want the best background checks we can have -- but the answer is not taking away guns from people who can defend themselves and others. I think in our schools, leave it up to the parents as we do in Texas and the superintendent. More school districts want to arm teachers who want to be armed and efficient and limit the entrances and exits into these schools. Stagger the start and end times and be sure kids like this don't get in the school house with a gun under their coat."

In San Antonio, Ron Martinelli is a forensic criminologist and in Kansas City, Dr. Brian Russell is a psychologist and an attorney. Gentlemen, thanks for joining us. Ron, let me start with you.

The first thing to keep in mind is discount the people that are telling you there is no red flags because as we begin to unpack this bag psychologically, we will find there were red flags. Some of them might be a little sublime, but they were certainly there. We are starting to see perhaps a ticking time bomb when I have written about extensively. This person probably felt isolated. He was certainly suicidal. When I am seeing in active shooters, 40 percent of which commit suicide or suicide by cop, is that they do experience suicidal ideations. So, the reason for suicide is to end pain, emotional and psychological. This person was probably experiencing some sort of pain. It could have been bullying coming from a variety of areas.

It's very important to think about what was the first word that went through your mind when you heard about this. A lot of people will say sicko, psycho. If you look the calculations, conniving and the concealment. All of this conscious decision making that went into it, you can see that is there a mentally healthy kid? Obviously not. That's not mental illness. What is it? It's a narcissistic phenomenon where somebody becomes so wrapped up -- it could be they think they are superior to everybody or inferior and want to get some power, notoriety, whatever. But they feel entitled to indulge that at the expense of other people's very lives. That's not mental illness. That's sociopathy, psychopathy rooted in narcissism. As we have discussed, there are always precursors to that, always signs and we will find some here. We have to heed those signs. For the few people where the signs are not enough, and they slip through the cracks, we have to harden the targets."

It's an open secret the identity of the spy or informant that the FBI may have had inside the Trump presidential campaign. Speculation is running rampant after a story in Wednesday's New York Times revealed this -- \"At least one government informant met several times with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.\" We'll learning of another name as well, Sam Clovis, this evening and that's coming from current and former officials. Well, President Trump tweeted that if true, this is bigger than Watergate. He just might be right. Now the Times published a follow-up story saying, \"FBI used informant to investigate Russia ties to campaign not to spy as Trump claims.\" A little editorializing in the headline there of the New York Times, it gets away with every once in a while. Still allies of the president are pushing to find out what role the informant may have played in the Russia investigation. Let's discuss this with Retired FBI Agent Bobby Chacon, along with Democratic strategist, Richard Goldstein, and former Delta Force officer, Jeff Beddie (ph), who is a CIA counterterrorism center case officer and hostage rescue adviser to the FBI. These guys know what they are talking about. Gentlemen, all, thanks for being here. So, Bobby, let me start with you, this headline from the New York Times saying the FBI used the informant to investigate Russia ties and not spying on Trump. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOBBY CHACON, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT",
      "utterance": "In my reading of it it's disturbing and that it's the direction they took with this informant. They had a source and heard there may be ties with Papadopoulos and Russia and they ran this source at several members of the Trump campaign, Papadopoulos, Page, Flynn, they ran them pretty hard. He lured Papadopoulos over to London for a meeting. He had a young woman with him. Now some of our other guests can tell you, I didn't work counterterrorism. I have friends that do. Having a new young woman at a meeting that later on invited Papadopoulos to a separate meeting alone with just the two of them, that's a recruitment type tool. So they were using pretty aggressive tactics to go after and look at Papadopoulos and Carter Page and to a lesser extent General Flynn. So I think that during the time he was run at Page the FISA was up, so we call that tickling the wire, trying to get conversation generated that you may overhear on your wiretap, in this case FISA. They didn't run this informant at the Russian side of the rumors that they had. They ran him at the Trump side of the thing. And they ran him in my estimation, and I worked a lot of informants in my time, they ran them pretty aggressively at these guys, and they came up with nothing."

Here's one quote from the brand new article in The New York Times as well that really caught our eye. Listen to this and we'll get you to respond, Richard. It said Mr. Papadopoulos replied that he had no insight, he's talking to the informant here, no insight into the Russian campaign despite being told months earlier that the Russian had dirt on Mrs. Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails. His response clearly annoyed the informant who tried to press Mr. Papadopoulos about what he might know about the Russian effort according to the person. So would you feel the same way you do right now, which I know you don't agree necessarily with some of the previous assessment, but what if this had been the Obama campaign and the FBI had been aggressively pushing informants to gather information on that campaign?

If they had them with the mafia, do you think that might be something they would want to get to the bottom of and we'd be all alarmed if we had an informant? That's good law enforcement practice.

The information that has come out today that you just briefed us on does talk about the fact that it has been stated that there was some information about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign that were a concern. I think it's interesting as to who might have provided that information or how that information came about. But nonetheless, the thing your viewers should be aware of, to do a confidential informant, to run an operation like that, you don't need to go to a judge. You don't need to get a search warrant. You don't need to prove probable cause. In fact it's a very preliminary step that's designed to try to generate probable cause. So there is no judge involved. It's simply administratively approved, although this would certainly be a very sensitive one and be maybe approved at a very high level which brings into question the motivations of some of the senior FBI leadership. They may have used a confidential informant tactic here as a fig leaf about the Russian connection as the fig leaf to do what they wanted to do.

What was that contact and what made it suspicious? Because they're saying that because they thought it was suspicious they then operated this source and ran him pretty hard at these three individuals in the Trump campaign. What was that information that the contact, because the contacts alone are not improper. It depends on the contact. So what made those contacts suspicious? Why are they using that word \"suspicious\"? For full transparency we've got to get down to why they thought it was suspicious, what information they had that those contacts were suspicious, because after they ran this informant at them, it produced no results, no tangible results. They didn't give up anything, didn't say anything, didn't incriminate himself. Carter Page certainly didn't, and after a FISA, if there was anything on that FISA that incriminated him in any crimes, he's be in jail by now."

In fact, Planned Parenthood wouldn't even be stripped of their funds if they simply agreed to disentangle their taxpayer money from abortions has family planning. But nobody actually things Planned Parenthood is going to stop with their abortions. This is a group that calls itself a woman's health organization but performs an increasingly small number of actual health services and make the vast majority of its money from abortions. Last year alone they performed well over 300,000 abortions and they are able to mask their true priorities of course with the help of Democrats and the mainstream media.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un strongly complained about the exercise and had threatened to cancel the summit with Trump planned for June 12th in Singapore. The question now is whether Kim will see Trump's move as a sign of good faith or as a sign of weakness. Joining us now with reaction is Michael Malice, the author of the book \"Dear Reader, The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong-il.\" Thank you very much for being here Michigan."

But is this the type of thing that brings them to the table and makes a deal more possible? MICHAEL MALICE, AUTHOR, \"DEAR READER\": They've already been brought to the table. These war games are happening every year since four decades. The fact that they are complaining publicly and abruptly is what is unfair. It would be as if I'd called you up on October 30th and said why are you having a Halloween party tomorrow."

So the fact they are doing this publicly is to humiliate us. But frankly it's a small price to pay. If they say we're giving up nuke testing and you're giving up these war exercises, that's fine."

      "utterance": "Well, it has quieted down quite a bit here at this candlelight vigil where earlier this evening hundreds of people came out to support and pray for each other during this tragic event. It was before 8:00 this morning when the shooter entered an arts classroom and opened fire striking multiple students. That shooter was identified as 17- year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a student and member of the football team. He is charged with capital murder and was denied bond after being seen by a judge. Ten people are dead and 10 others injured including a school police officer named John Barnes. He is now in stable condition. One of the victims killed was a foreign exchange student from Pakistan. Students who were in the classroom said that they saw their fellow classmate with a pistol and a shotgun. We learned that both weapons came from Pagourtzis' father who owned them illegally. Multiple law enforcement agencies had to locate explosive devices on school grounds and in surrounding areas."

    {
      "speaker": "GOV. GREG ABBOTT, R-TEXAS",
      "utterance": "Various different kinds of explosive devices have already been detected. One was a CO-2 device. Another was a Molotov cocktail, and there are various other types of explosive devices that have been identified both in a home as well as in a vehicle."

    {
      "speaker": "GEIGEL",

We are also told that resources will be coming out here tomorrow to help those friends and family members find comfort during this time. Reporting live in Santa Fe, Texas, Natasha Geigel, Fox News."

Tough stuff, and hopefully tomorrow we learn more about the family and more information about what in the world could have motivated him. Natasha, thank you time, we appreciate it. That's all we have time for tonight. If you are up early tomorrow morning, you can join yours truly from 5:00 to 10:00 a.m. on \"Fox & Friends.\" We'll have every angle of the royal wedding covered for you, special coverage. Not my cup of tea, but it might be yours, and if it is be up early with \"Fox & Friends.\" I will be there at 5:00 a.m. eastern time covering it. I have to learn a little bit about them both before I do that coverage. I plan to my homework tonight. I am Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham. Don't worry, she will be back on Monday. If you want to follow me on Twitter you can follow me @PeteHegseth. And that's all we have got from New York City. Shannon Bream, the one and the only, the wonderful, she is up next.
