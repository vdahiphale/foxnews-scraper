And don't blame him for killing scum who like killing us. It's not a good look. Taking the side of the thugs with American blood on their hands, leave that to Colin Kaepernick. He needs the work. Now, the media's new take is what is going to happen next. They are predicting bad things, which oddly have actually already happened, dead contractors, cyber attacks, attacks on ships and embassies, and soldiers. If killing Soleimani makes the world worse than that, I'd like to know how letting him live would've made him better, anyone? But I get it, because taking out dirt bags who kill our troops is a good thing. The media must again focus on imagined bad things to come. But what if what you imagine has happened every day since Mannix was in primetime. Predicting that Iran is planning bad things is like predicting Michael Moore will eat a pie. No bookie is going to take your bet. And really, those who keep predicting the end have never been right. But that doesn't stop them. They want the apocalypse just to say I told you so.

So there's plenty of public information on that. The problem is not asking questions about what might happen next. The issue is that you are insinuating that the president and his entire administration isn't thinking about that, and that he didn't think through that if we take this guy out, and -- who was also in the car, who was another terrorist who was a really bad actor, smuggled in most of the IEDs from Iran to Iraq that blew up our troops, he was in the car as well.

The fact is we kill bad guys all the time.  The problem is they just make more, and that sucks. But you can't blame Trump. He didn't put us there. And don't blame him for killing scum who like killing us. It's not a good look. Taking the side of the thugs with American blood on their hands, leave that to Colin Kaepernick. He needs the work. Now, the media's new take is what is going to happen next. They are predicting bad things, which oddly have actually already happened, dead contractors, cyber attacks, attacks on ships and embassies, and soldiers. If killing Soleimani makes the world worse than that, I'd like to know how letting him live would've made him better, anyone? But I get it, because taking out dirt bags who kill our troops is a good thing. The media must again focus on imagined bad things to come. But what if what you imagine has happened every day since Mannix was in primetime. Predicting that Iran is planning bad things is like predicting Michael Moore will eat a pie. No bookie is going to take your bet. And really, those who keep predicting the end have never been right. But that doesn't stop them. They want the apocalypse just to say I told you so.

So there's plenty of public information on that. The problem is not asking questions about what might happen next. The issue is that you are insinuating that the president and his entire administration isn't thinking about that, and that he didn't think through that if we take this guy out, and -- who was also in the car, who was another terrorist who was a really bad actor, smuggled in most of the IEDs from Iran to Iraq that blew up our troops, he was in the car as well. The intelligence on where they were at the right time was good. So now we are questioning, you know, what's going to happen next, of course. But the idea that we don't know or have a plan leading up to this is ridiculous.  And also, they keep saying, well, the president is incompetent. He doesn't know what the Iranians are going to do, blah, blah, blah. They've been on this guy. And they understand that the Obama administration appeased the regime over and over again. Soleimani had sanctions taken off of him as a result of the Iran deal, as a result of Barack Obama's negotiation on that deal.

And that is why you've seen President Obama with this rift in the party, the populist, non-establishment, grassroots versus the establishment, which is Joe Biden, him coming out and saying, look, I'm not endorsing everybody.  But I just want everybody know when there's a nominee we have to get behind them. Because you are absolutely right. The Bernie Sanders faction of the party and Elizabeth Warren's faction are so far left that they're worried that they will not come out and vote for someone like Joe Biden in order to beat Donald Trump. And then couple that with the problem of electability, and they banked on that before with Hillary Clinton. It doesn't always work."

This is about freedom of expression. And I think what should be uniting conservatives and liberals, or whatever stripe, is the rift that is going on among liberalisms between free expression and those who want to silence people on campus. And that is where Ricky Gervais is coming from. If you read his Twitter feed, he is expressing his own personal outrage over the cancel culture, about how people are constantly being attacked for things that they are saying. And it's very healthy that it comes from him, from somebody on the left. Nobody -- no liberal is going to listen to be because you're just going to say, Fox News, that guy, he trashes everybody. And, you know, they are right. But when he comes out and he is upset, Ricky Gervais is upset, because he is so confident in his liberal ideas that the refusal to listen to other ideas, which is happening right now in the regressive left, enrages him. It's an emphatic (ph) sign of weakness.  So it's the hard left that is actually destroying liberalism, not Trump-ism or not conservatism. And I think that's what is fuelling his fire and why he is so disgusted and angry. But do not mistake that for him becoming a conservative. He is as liberal. And the only politics he is really into, and very strongly, is animal rights. This is a guy who spends a lot of time dealing with humane issues with animals.
