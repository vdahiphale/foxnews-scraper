The Biden administration has written our fellow Americans that they abandoned off completely and basically they're saying to them drop dead. You're on your own. Jen Psaki doesn't care. She's tired of answering any questions, which are very few anyway, about the human tragedy that was caused by her boss and now according to a new report, the Biden administration's quote making it impossible for even private rescue organizations to remove those threatened with retribution by the Taliban for their work with the U.S. Now that would include American citizens that they left behind, thousands of green cardholders, even military families and our Afghan allies. The State Department is even reportedly blocking those organizations from negotiating flights to third-party countries. Wow. Now, this is a humiliating self-inflicted disaster, no end in sight. But a betrayal on a level I can't even bring words to. Now, America's enemies all over the world, they are smelling blood in the water. We see Russia fully emboldened. They're threatening to invade Ukraine. Iran is quickly developing nuclear capabilities, so not be surprised if Israel and Iran are in some type of conflict soon. China is getting a free pass for the global pandemic. They should be paying reparations. They caused the entire thing and they by the way are planning their post-Olympics takeover or they call it reunification of Taiwan. Joe Biden thinks this is all I guess pretty funny.

I'm really amazed, Sean, that there are so many, quote, moderate centrist Democrats self-proclaimed who are willing to risk their own careers in 2022 to be part of a Build Back Better plan that goes in the wrong direction for a country that is under the yoke of inflation and rising prices under Joe Biden. It's the wrong thing to do to spend money we don't have on things we don't need. They're going in the wrong direction. But in addition, you know, Joe Biden is channeling his inner Kamala Harris with all his cackling and laughing of late. It's no joke that we have stranded Americans and allies in Afghanistan and, you know, there's -- there are international volunteer groups who are tracking this. And Jen Psaki can joke about it. She can have FOX News arrangement syndrome all she wants in answer to a very simple question about are you helping these dozen or so Americans who are still stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. But the fact is, we have about 10,000 Afghan American allies who would qualify for the SIV, and maybe thousands or more family members. And they're facing a Taliban controlled winter that's coming with food shortages, human rights abuses. To say nothing of the fact that we left $85 billion worth of American equipment, there are 600,000 small weapons and 75,000 or so vehicles. It's really very cons -- all the intelligence, Bagram Air Base. These are real facts. And Americans are saying to Joe Biden, you're not doing anything well. You've got these liberal networks, when they're not obsessed with FOX News's ratings, how jealous they are, they are obsessed over who can actually succeed Joe Biden because they don't think Joe Biden can succeed. And look at just Ukraine. You mentioned Russia salivating over Ukraine, China's looking at Taiwan, Iran's always staring at Israel -- you know, Donald Trump sent javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, Obama sent pillows and blankets. Joe Biden sent Hunter Biden to Ukraine. I mean, just look at the difference in the way presidents of late have dealt with that entire region. And guess what? The polls are catching up with them. You're absolutely right about polls. Very quickly, the center has completely collapsed for Joe Biden. Any president needs the support of independence which are the dominant part, quote, nonpartisan group in so many of our states now. They outnumber Republicans and Democrats in registration roles in many of our states. They have left Joe Biden. In just the last month, the Monmouth poll says on COVID, which had been Joe Biden's number one issue, the handling of COVID, he has completely lost independence. And Gen Z, they are Generation Z, is done with COVID, these articles say. They're going to be mad at the Democrats and punish them for making them mask up and just really ruin their adolescence in so many their high school and college years.",

It's rude, condescending, mean and out of touch and it's that typical Democratic coastal elitism that you see that is dominating now the Democratic Party. Well, it's completely dismissive, Sean, because they know they won't help won't be held accountable no one's going to actually follow through to question why they said there were a dozen as Kellyanne pointed out, a couple hundred people that were still there now. We're revealing nine hundred, a thousand. We know there are thousands of Americans still there that can't get out and folks like you are highlighting it when the rest of the media goes away. They count on no accountability across the board , and it -- you know, Nancy Pelosi -- I'm construct, I'm sorry, Nancy Pelosi stands at a podium and says he's perfect. I mean, she is lying through her false teeth and she knows that she's lying because every Democrat wants someone else to be at the podium and someone else to run in 2024. In fact, as a representative of San Francisco, the mayor of San Francisco recently came out and said crime is out of control. In fact, Mayor London Breed had a press conference where she said I don't care if the left doesn't like what I'm going to have to do, but we have to crack down on the fact that our city is out of control. They're telling the American public, don't believe your lying eyes. From crime to inflation to COVID, what we know about omicron and the reality that it may be transmissible but thank goodness it's not as deadly in its implementation -- pay no attention. We're in charge. Build Back Better is the answer. They know voters are going to reject that. Just like in Virginia where they rejected the critical race theory, just like in New Jersey where they almost beat Phil Murphy, one of their golden children, they know they're on the precipice of a wave. They have to lie. They have to pretend like they feel good about it. They know they're not. So they're going to get -- if they can't get Build Back Better, Sean, you know this -- they're going to go for a voting bill because they're worried about the ballot box in to project their majority.

And now let's return to some good news from Capitol Hill. Biden's five trillion dollar Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialist spending spree is now officially stalled in Congress. Democrats are now reportedly very angry with Joe Manchin for refusing to bend the knee to their radical plans. Now, Manchin is feeling the heat, even though by the way, even having to lash out at reporters or lying to him about what he supports and doesn't support. They're stalking him as they have now been for several months. Manchin doesn't answer to the media mob or to Joe Biden. He should rightly answer to the people of West Virginia. And if this bill passes, all middle and lower income Americans will suffer even more from higher inflation. They already disproportionately negatively impacted by Joe's increase in energy and the increase in prices of everything we buy from every store we go to. New taxes, a huge new army of IRS agents, tasks with auditing as many as you as possible kind of like you'll get the HANNITY treatment. And here now with more is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I'm hearing and reports are that -- for this year at least -- that Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism is dead for this year. But that doesn't mean it's going away. I watched Manchin today and he had to say that's total B.S., because Democrats have turned on him and they're trying to make the case that he is trying to kill the child tax credit, which, by the way, is a lie. He's always been for the child tax credit. So they've -- now, his own party has turned against him and he's trying to look out for the energy sector which is such a big part of the West Virginian economy.",

And one thing we haven't talked about tonight but was mentioned today, the child care provisions and Build Back Better prohibit religious institutions from receiving money. So if you've got a child in a religious institution, providing child care, you will not be eligible for money from the government because that child goes to religious institution. It increases the wages of child care providers to the point that the average family will have to spend $13,000 more because this is a federal takeover of child care. It's declaring war on religious institutions. It's $5 trillion, not $1.75. It's an inflation bomb.

They looked at the bill, Sean, as if all the programs like child tax credits go for years, not one year. And they said it's $5 trillion. The child tax credit over 10 years is $1.6 trillion. So, the bill is written in the Senate is a lie. The CBO exposed that lie and when it comes to deficit spending, it has $3 trillion to the deficit.

But, of course, it was a total, complete, utter lie from Schiff as per usual. He totally misrepresented and then doctored what the message said, which was actually a summary of a legal theory not from Jim Jordan but from a Washington lawyer.

It has a predetermined outcome, and Schiff and company are now creating fake text messages to push their far left January 6 hysteria and hold Meadows in criminal contempt, all because they hate Donald Trump and want to purge Donald Trump from the Republican Party, and his supporters.

And, of course, in the background was all of the 574 riots at the previous summer. They were told again and again to have the guard ready. And guess what? They didn't do it. All just a giant distraction, of course, from the disastrous failures that is Joe Biden. They're failing COVID policy, never-ending restrictions, vaccine mandates they said they'd never shoved down our throat and also being knocked down in the courts, begging OPEC and Russia to produce more oil because they lost American energy independence, abandoning Americans in Afghanistan a 39-year inflation high, the supply chain disaster and, of course, an all- out super spreader catastrophe because of wide open borders, all caused by Joe Biden.

Five years ago, they said they weaponized the Department of Justice, went to the FISA court, lied to the FISA court, alter the document in front of the FISA court so they could spy on President Trump's campaign. And guess what? Two months ago, we caught them doing what? Going after moms and dads at school board meeting using the power of the Justice Department in the counterterrorism division at the FBI. And now this -- all because of their lust for power and their intensity for going after President Trump because they're afraid he's going to run and they know he's going to win if he does.

With this group of people, the outcome is predetermined and it is exactly what you said, and it is exactly what Congressman Jordan just said. They are petrified that Donald Trump is going to run again in 2024. They know if he runs, he will win. And look, in 2016, he won.

He has not had one accomplishment that he can point to. Everything he's done has been bad for Americans. They feel it every day, so they want this distraction. They want to have this story out there. But they're not going to find ultimately what they want because, at the end of the day, they're never going to find that anybody said to go do this.

If you eliminate executive privilege and if everybody that is giving advice to a president knows that at some point down the line that what they say, what advice they offer might be made public, that will probably prevent people from being completely, totally honest with a president, with advice that might be crucial in terms of even national security.

Now, with the Democrats' Build Back Better Bolshevik spending bonanza in peril, Senator Elizabeth Warren is doubling down on yet another power grab and far left fantasy and endorsing a radical court packing scheme. Now, that would add four justices to the U.S. Supreme Court claiming quote the current court threatens the Democratic foundations of our nation. Translation, the court doesn't have enough far left liberal activists that don't believe in separation of powers and co-equal branches of government. Here for a reaction to all of tonight's big breaking news -- now, Mark's book you see right there, \"American Marxism\", not only was number one on `The New York Times\" list for weeks in a row, it is the number one best- selling book, all books for the entire year. He also hosts \"Life, Liberty and Levin\" right here on the FOX News Channel. I call him the great one for a reason. Congratulations, my friend. That is a monumental achievement, sir. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY AND LEVIN\": Thank you, Sean. Let me try and unravel some of this. First of all, when it comes to Adam Schiff doctoring evidence, Adam Schiff is a lawyer. He's got a license in the state of California, maybe in other places too. So rather than us just whining about this reprobate, rather than us just whining about this unethical hack, let's do something about it. Lawyers are not free to doctor evidence, particularly when they're doctoring evidence for the purpose of trying to put people in prison. And that's exactly what Adam Schiff in this committee did when they were manipulating and doctoring those text messages. They removed paragraphs. They changed punctuations. They made it public. They used it as a basis to vote against Mark Meadows, to seek criminal contempt, the Democrat House doing the same thing. It's time that people file a serious ethics complaint I would ask the Republicans on Capitol Hill to do what any citizen can with the ethics arm of the Supreme Court of California and seek the license of Adam Schiff because enough is enough. We can whine about it all we want, he's got the media playing out of his hand. This guy is unethical. This guy does not deserve to be a member of the bar. He's worse than a slip and fall lawyer. He's a slip and fall congressman, that's number one. Number two, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to see what the old Soviet Union was like, you look at this January 6 Committee, you have these clowns making pronouncements about the innocent and guilt and mostly guilt of individuals who they're supposed to be investigating. They want their text messages. They want their emails. They're going to phone companies to get their phone calls. And why are they doing this? Because they want to get to the bottom of the insurrection they say. And for what purpose? We have a legislative purpose. And what's that? What law are you going to pass? Liz Cheney gave it up the other day. She said that they may look at a criminal aspect for Donald Trump dereliction of duty. Well, speaking of dereliction -- dereliction of an IQ in the case of Liz Cheney. Number one, Congress does not have the power to do criminal investigations. Number two, dereliction of duty, as we've discussed or you have, is Nancy Pelosi. She's in charge of protecting the House of Representatives. She was offered the National Guard, that's all the president can do. There's nothing else he can do. It's up to her. She didn't call in more Capitol Police. They report to her. The Democrat Mayor Bowser, who's another disaster in Washington, she didn't call in more Metropolitan Police. The Norfolk FBI office, the NYPD warned about more people coming and what did she do and why didn't she call in the National Guard? You know why she didn't? We know why. She doesn't like the National Guard. She doesn't like the Insurrection Act. She was attacking Trump, along with the phony generals in the media who was thinking about using the Insurrection Act to stop the riots all during the summer. She said no. So imagine if she brought in the National Guard as was offered by the president of the United States, what a hypocrite she would look like. Imagine if she called in more cops including federal cops, she called federal cops that were protecting the federal building, the courthouse in Portland, storm troopers. So she wasn't going to call in the storm troopers. She wasn't going to call in the National Guard having attacked the Insurrection Act. So, she Liz Cheney has been derelict in duty to protect the Capitol building. The president United States did everything he could. Moreover, there are no criminal statutes whatsoever to that apply to this former President Donald Trump. None, period. Or if they are, they're hiding with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Maybe her father can help her find those. But the fact of the matter is there aren't. This committee is violating the Bill of Rights. It's violating due process. This committee is on a, quote/unquote, criminal hunt, trying to get people humiliated and embarrassed. Why would you have a vote for criminal contempt on a serious issue like executive privilege that does apply in certain respects to former presidents of the United States? How do I know? The Supreme Court said so. And for good reason. Separation of powers carries forward regardless of your president now or president later. So what is it exactly that they're doing? They're holding people in contempt, the fraud who's the attorney general who wants to put parents in jail using the Patriot Act, he goes ahead and indicts Steve Bannon and wants to indict other people, this is an issue that's before several judges that has to be adjudicated, the extent of executive privilege. And then we have these two Obama judges and one Biden judge and what do they said? That the current president hasn't asserted it and he's in the best position to assert executive privilege. No, he's not. That jerk has announced he's going to run for reelection, he doesn't care if there's executive privilege or not. He is working with Pelosi and the Democrats to go after Trump, to hell with the country, separation of powers and all the rest of it. Now, let me get back to Elizabeth Warren and the Supreme Court of the United States. Elizabeth Warren is a thug and a liar. She got into college lying about her ethnicity. She continued to lie about her ethnicity in order to get big-time appointments as a professor. She didn't use her brain. She tried to use native Americans to get to where she is. Now, this thug that says we should add four seats to the United States Supreme Court -- this thug wants to add four seats to the United States Senate. They want to add enough seats until they control everything. You know what that is? Totalitarianism, and that's what she is, a totalitarian. I'm done.",

Ultimately, there is no good answer. After promising to shut down the virus as a candidate, more people have died from COVID-19 in this year under Biden 2021 than under Donald Trump in 2020. But according to Joe, it's not his fault, it's not China's fault, it's your fault. Are you the American people, you just value your freedom way too much. And if so many have said, F your freedom. No, I believe in freedom. I believe in medical privacy. I believe also in doctor-patient confidentiality, although they seem to be rare concept these days. Take a look."

Mark my words, with Democrats in charge, this country will never return to normal. They won't allow it. Now, there's always going to be a new scary variant and life will have to be put on hold yet again.

I'm really amazed, Sean, that there are so many, quote, moderate centrist Democrats self-proclaimed who are willing to risk their own careers in 2022 to be part of a Build Back Better plan that goes in the wrong direction for a country that is under the yoke of inflation and rising prices under Joe Biden. It's the wrong thing to do to spend money we don't have on things we don't need. They're going in the wrong direction. But in addition, you know, Joe Biden is channeling his inner Kamala Harris with all his cackling and laughing of late. It's no joke that we have stranded Americans and allies in Afghanistan and, you know, there's -- there are international volunteer groups who are tracking this. And Jen Psaki can joke about it. She can have FOX News arrangement syndrome all she wants in answer to a very simple question about are you helping these dozen or so Americans who are still stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. But the fact is, we have about 10,000 Afghan American allies who would qualify for the SIV, and maybe thousands or more family members. And they're facing a Taliban controlled winter that's coming with food shortages, human rights abuses. To say nothing of the fact that we left $85 billion worth of American equipment, there are 600,000 small weapons and 75,000 or so vehicles. It's really very cons -- all the intelligence, Bagram Air Base. These are real facts. And Americans are saying to Joe Biden, you're not doing anything well. You've got these liberal networks, when they're not obsessed with FOX News's ratings, how jealous they are, they are obsessed over who can actually succeed Joe Biden because they don't think Joe Biden can succeed. And look at just Ukraine. You mentioned Russia salivating over Ukraine, China's looking at Taiwan, Iran's always staring at Israel -- you know, Donald Trump sent javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, Obama sent pillows and blankets. Joe Biden sent Hunter Biden to Ukraine. I mean, just look at the difference in the way presidents of late have dealt with that entire region. And guess what? The polls are catching up with them. You're absolutely right about polls. Very quickly, the center has completely collapsed for Joe Biden. Any president needs the support of independence which are the dominant part, quote, nonpartisan group in so many of our states now. They outnumber Republicans and Democrats in registration roles in many of our states. They have left Joe Biden. In just the last month, the Monmouth poll says on COVID, which had been Joe Biden's number one issue, the handling of COVID, he has completely lost independence. And Gen Z, they are Generation Z, is done with COVID, these articles say.

It's rude, condescending, mean and out of touch and it's that typical Democratic coastal elitism that you see that is dominating now the Democratic Party. Well, it's completely dismissive, Sean, because they know they won't help won't be held accountable no one's going to actually follow through to question why they said there were a dozen as Kellyanne pointed out, a couple hundred people that were still there now. We're revealing nine hundred, a thousand. We know there are thousands of Americans still there that can't get out and folks like you are highlighting it when the rest of the media goes away. They count on no accountability across the board , and it -- you know, Nancy Pelosi -- I'm construct, I'm sorry, Nancy Pelosi stands at a podium and says he's perfect. I mean, she is lying through her false teeth and she knows that she's lying because every Democrat wants someone else to be at the podium and someone else to run in 2024. In fact, as a representative of San Francisco, the mayor of San Francisco recently came out and said crime is out of control. In fact, Mayor London Breed had a press conference where she said I don't care if the left doesn't like what I'm going to have to do, but we have to crack down on the fact that our city is out of control. They're telling the American public, don't believe your lying eyes. From crime to inflation to COVID, what we know about omicron and the reality that it may be transmissible but thank goodness it's not as deadly in its implementation -- pay no attention. We're in charge. Build Back Better is the answer. They know voters are going to reject that. Just like in Virginia where they rejected the critical race theory, just like in New Jersey where they almost beat Phil Murphy, one of their golden children, they know they're on the precipice of a wave. They have to lie. They have to pretend like they feel good about it. They know they're not. So they're going to get -- if they can't get Build Back Better, Sean, you know this -- they're going to go for a voting bill because they're worried about the ballot box in to project their majority.

And now let's return to some good news from Capitol Hill. Biden's five trillion dollar Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialist spending spree is now officially stalled in Congress. Democrats are now reportedly very angry with Joe Manchin for refusing to bend the knee to their radical plans. Now, Manchin is feeling the heat, even though by the way, even having to lash out at reporters or lying to him about what he supports and doesn't support. They're stalking him as they have now been for several months. Manchin doesn't answer to the media mob or to Joe Biden. He should rightly answer to the people of West Virginia. And if this bill passes, all middle and lower income Americans will suffer even more from higher inflation. They already disproportionately negatively impacted by Joe's increase in energy and the increase in prices of everything we buy from every store we go to. New taxes, a huge new army of IRS agents, tasks with auditing as many as you as possible kind of like you'll get the HANNITY treatment. And here now with more is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I'm hearing and reports are that -- for this year at least -- that Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism is dead for this year. But that doesn't mean it's going away. I watched Manchin today and he had to say that's total B.S., because Democrats have turned on him and they're trying to make the case that he is trying to kill the child tax credit, which, by the way, is a lie. He's always been for the child tax credit. So they've -- now, his own party has turned against him and he's trying to look out for the energy sector which is such a big part of the West Virginian economy."

Well, if you do away with the budget gimmicks, Build Back Better, according to the CBO, adds $3 trillion to the deficit. He doesn't want to vote for a bill that makes inflation worse. And one thing we haven't talked about tonight but was mentioned today, the child care provisions and Build Back Better prohibit religious institutions from receiving money. So if you've got a child in a religious institution, providing child care, you will not be eligible for money from the government because that child goes to religious institution. It increases the wages of child care providers to the point that the average family will have to spend $13,000 more because this is a federal takeover of child care. It's declaring war on religious institutions. It's $5 trillion, not $1.75. It's an inflation bomb. And at the end of the day, Joe mentioned as promised, the people of West Virginia, will no -- I will not vote for a bill that adds to the deficit. That's full of gimmicks.

I laugh when I hear Democrats say it's a fake number. The CBO number, it used to be the gold standard. I haven't hypnotized the CBO. They looked at the bill, Sean, as if all the programs like child tax credits go for years, not one year. And they said it's $5 trillion. The child tax credit over 10 years is $1.6 trillion. So, the bill is written in the Senate is a lie. The CBO exposed that lie and when it comes to deficit spending, it has $3 trillion to the deficit.

Our friends in Israel are watching the Iranians getting ever closer to making a bomb, and they're going to have to act because one Holocaust is enough. When it comes to Russia, I'm going to introduce sanctions to hit Russia for the buildup, not the invasion. And if we don't get this right, Taiwan will be invaded by China. There's so much at risk in this world. Here's the good news. I think Build Back Better is dead, the path to socialism has been stopped I think -- I think for the rest of this Congress.

But, of course, it was a total, complete, utter lie from Schiff as per usual. He totally misrepresented and then doctored what the message said, which was actually a summary of a legal theory not from Jim Jordan but from a Washington lawyer. And there were no instructions at all coming from Jim Jordan. So just like we've been telling you, this investigation is a complete sham. It has a predetermined outcome, and Schiff and company are now creating fake text messages to push their far left January 6 hysteria and hold Meadows in criminal contempt, all because they hate Donald Trump and want to purge Donald Trump from the Republican Party, and his supporters.

And, of course, in the background was all of the 574 riots at the previous summer. They were told again and again to have the guard ready. And guess what? They didn't do it. All just a giant distraction, of course, from the disastrous failures that is Joe Biden. They're failing COVID policy, never-ending restrictions, vaccine mandates they said they'd never shoved down our throat and also being knocked down in the courts, begging OPEC and Russia to produce more oil because they lost American energy independence, abandoning Americans in Afghanistan a 39-year inflation high, the supply chain disaster and, of course, an all- out super spreader catastrophe because of wide open borders, all caused by Joe Biden. The media mob desperately looking for anything else to talk about. Here with reaction, Congressman Jim Jordan himself, FOX News contributor Lara Trump.

You know what that is, Sean, that is a government speak, that is a fancy way of saying we got caught. We got caught lying. We got caught altering a document. And here's the scary thing -- this is a pattern with these guys. Ten years ago was the IRS targeting conservatives. Five years ago, they said they weaponized the Department of Justice, went to the FISA court, lied to the FISA court, alter the document in front of the FISA court so they could spy on President Trump's campaign. And guess what? Two months ago, we caught them doing what? Going after moms and dads at school board meeting using the power of the Justice Department in the counterterrorism division at the FBI. And now this -- all because of their lust for power and their intensity for going after President Trump because they're afraid he's going to run and they know he's going to win if he does.

Mark Meadows said the same thing, the Capitol police chief requested over six times, everybody was denied. Now, the person in charge of the Capitol police that would make that decision is none other than Nancy Pelosi.

He didn't tell people to go to the Capitol and break in. He said, let's peacefully and patriotically make our voices heard. But he tried to warn them. So many people tried to warn Nancy Pelosi. So why didn't they have the adequate security there? It is a great question. But at the end of the day, they know the answer. And it -- the outcome is already predetermined, you're right. With this group of people, the outcome is predetermined and it is exactly what you said, and it is exactly what Congressman Jordan just said. They are petrified that Donald Trump is going to run again in 2024. They know if he runs, he will win. And look, in 2016, he won. He started peeling back the onion and exposing the swamp and all of these people in it for exactly who they were. They know that if he gets back in there, the jig is up. The game is over for them. They're doing everything they can to discredit him now. They're doing everything they can to prevent him from running in 2024. And hey, it doesn't hurt that it is a distraction from the disaster that we have seen under President Joe Biden. Everything he touches turns to garbage. He has not had one accomplishment that he can point to. Everything he's done has been bad for Americans. They feel it every day, so they want this distraction. They want to have this story out there. But they're not going to find ultimately what they want because, at the end of the day, they're never going to find that anybody said to go do this. No one wanted to see this sort of thing happen, but it is a shame we don't have a legitimate and full investigation because we'd all love to see why this ultimately happened."

So maybe she could release that in the process of releasing other people's private text messages. But let me ask you, executive privilege. This is important. If you eliminate executive privilege and if everybody that is giving advice to a president knows that at some point down the line that what they say, what advice they offer might be made public, that will probably prevent people from being completely, totally honest with a president, with advice that might be crucial in terms of even national security.

So this is an important privilege. And Democrats are going to destroy -- here's what they said yesterday with what they did to Mark Meadows. They said, oh, Adam Schiff can have a so- called whistleblower, anonymous whistleblower and use that in secret hearings in the basement of the bunker of the Capitol to impeach the president of United States. We're not allowed to know who that guy is, but we're going to destroy executive privilege and we're going to alter documents in our quest to go after Mark Meadows and President Trump?

I'd like an answer to that. And please also set up a commission looking into the 575 riots that killed dozens of Americans, that resulted in billions of dollars of property damage and injured thousands of cops. I want that committee, too. Thank you both, Laura Trump and Jim Jordan. Coming up, the left continues to push their radical court-packing agenda. The great one, Mark Levin, weighs in on that and his thoughts on January 6, and the corrupt committee of Liz Cheney, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, with the Democrats' Build Back Better Bolshevik spending bonanza in peril, Senator Elizabeth Warren is doubling down on yet another power grab and far left fantasy and endorsing a radical court packing scheme. Now, that would add four justices to the U.S. Supreme Court claiming quote the current court threatens the Democratic foundations of our nation. Translation, the court doesn't have enough far left liberal activists that don't believe in separation of powers and co-equal branches of government. Here for a reaction to all of tonight's big breaking news -- now, Mark's book you see right there, \"American Marxism\", not only was number one on `The New York Times\" list for weeks in a row, it is the number one best- selling book, all books for the entire year. He also hosts \"Life, Liberty and Levin\" right here on the FOX News Channel. I call him the great one for a reason. Congratulations, my friend. That is a monumental achievement, sir. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY AND LEVIN\": Thank you, Sean. Let me try and unravel some of this. First of all, when it comes to Adam Schiff doctoring evidence, Adam Schiff is a lawyer. He's got a license in the state of California, maybe in other places too. So rather than us just whining about this reprobate, rather than us just whining about this unethical hack, let's do something about it. Lawyers are not free to doctor evidence, particularly when they're doctoring evidence for the purpose of trying to put people in prison. And that's exactly what Adam Schiff in this committee did when they were manipulating and doctoring those text messages. They removed paragraphs. They changed punctuations. They made it public. They used it as a basis to vote against Mark Meadows, to seek criminal contempt, the Democrat House doing the same thing. It's time that people file a serious ethics complaint I would ask the Republicans on Capitol Hill to do what any citizen can with the ethics arm of the Supreme Court of California and seek the license of Adam Schiff because enough is enough. We can whine about it all we want, he's got the media playing out of his hand. This guy is unethical. This guy does not deserve to be a member of the bar. He's worse than a slip and fall lawyer. He's a slip and fall congressman, that's number one. Number two, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to see what the old Soviet Union was like, you look at this January 6 Committee, you have these clowns making pronouncements about the innocent and guilt and mostly guilt of individuals who they're supposed to be investigating. They want their text messages. They want their emails. They're going to phone companies to get their phone calls. And why are they doing this? Because they want to get to the bottom of the insurrection they say. And for what purpose? We have a legislative purpose. And what's that? What law are you going to pass? Liz Cheney gave it up the other day. She said that they may look at a criminal aspect for Donald Trump dereliction of duty. Well, speaking of dereliction -- dereliction of an IQ in the case of Liz Cheney. Number one, Congress does not have the power to do criminal investigations. Number two, dereliction of duty, as we've discussed or you have, is Nancy Pelosi. She's in charge of protecting the House of Representatives. She was offered the National Guard, that's all the president can do. There's nothing else he can do. It's up to her. She didn't call in more Capitol Police. They report to her. The Democrat Mayor Bowser, who's another disaster in Washington, she didn't call in more Metropolitan Police. The Norfolk FBI office, the NYPD warned about more people coming and what did she do and why didn't she call in the National Guard? You know why she didn't? We know why. She doesn't like the National Guard. She doesn't like the Insurrection Act. She was attacking Trump, along with the phony generals in the media who was thinking about using the Insurrection Act to stop the riots all during the summer. She said no. So imagine if she brought in the National Guard as was offered by the president of the United States, what a hypocrite she would look like. Imagine if she called in more cops including federal cops, she called federal cops that were protecting the federal building, the courthouse in Portland, storm troopers. So she wasn't going to call in the storm troopers. She wasn't going to call in the National Guard having attacked the Insurrection Act. So, she Liz Cheney has been derelict in duty to protect the Capitol building. The president United States did everything he could. Moreover, there are no criminal statutes whatsoever to that apply to this former President Donald Trump. None, period. Or if they are, they're hiding with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Maybe her father can help her find those. But the fact of the matter is there aren't. This committee is violating the Bill of Rights. It's violating due process. This committee is on a, quote/unquote, criminal hunt, trying to get people humiliated and embarrassed. Why would you have a vote for criminal contempt on a serious issue like executive privilege that does apply in certain respects to former presidents of the United States? How do I know? The Supreme Court said so. And for good reason. Separation of powers carries forward regardless of your president now or president later. So what is it exactly that they're doing? They're holding people in contempt, the fraud who's the attorney general who wants to put parents in jail using the Patriot Act, he goes ahead and indicts Steve Bannon and wants to indict other people, this is an issue that's before several judges that has to be adjudicated, the extent of executive privilege. And then we have these two Obama judges and one Biden judge and what do they said? That the current president hasn't asserted it and he's in the best position to assert executive privilege. No, he's not. That jerk has announced he's going to run for reelection, he doesn't care if there's executive privilege or not. He is working with Pelosi and the Democrats to go after Trump, to hell with the country, separation of powers and all the rest of it. Now, let me get back to Elizabeth Warren and the Supreme Court of the United States. Elizabeth Warren is a thug and a liar. She got into college lying about her ethnicity. She continued to lie about her ethnicity in order to get big-time appointments as a professor. She didn't use her brain. She tried to use native Americans to get to where she is. Now, this thug that says we should add four seats to the United States Supreme Court -- this thug wants to add four seats to the United States Senate. They want to add enough seats until they control everything. You know what that is? Totalitarianism, and that's what she is, a totalitarian. I'm done."

      "utterance": "Even the media mob is coming to terms with what we have been showing you night after night and that is Joe Biden -- weak, frail and seemingly deteriorating daily as it relates to his cognitive abilities and unable to carry out the duties of commander in chief. Look at this new piece of liberal \"New York Times\" columnist Bret Stephens, quote: Biden should not run again and he should say he won't, laying out Biden's struggles and calling him alarmingly incoherent. That's an understatement. And that's not all. Even over at fake news CNN, they are already floating possible 2024 replacements for Biden, including names like failing Vice President Harris, Pete Buttigieg, even failed gubernatorial -- Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Here with reaction, author of \"Beyond Biden,\" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich. I think they're actually following your lead, and they're thinking beyond Biden. But I don't see any good options either in the CNN list. I don't think there are good options for them."

I mean, he'd have no authority, have no ability to do anything. If he is collapsing at the rate they're suggesting, the question should be, does he need to be replaced now? And, of course, the problem with that is that Kamala Harris of anything. You know, Kamala Harris if totally cognizant is more dangerous and goofier than Joe Biden. So, you -- so in a sense, she's the insurance policy that will keep him in office. But as a citizen and as a historian, I'm really worried. I think that we have the American system for national security purposes as a commander in chief. It's a very deliberate term. George Washington had been the commander in the revolutionary war. They knew what they were writing. And if we end up in a situation as these people are suggesting, where the commander-in-chief is incapable of doing his job, the world gets very, very dangerous, because you have people like Putin and the Chinese dictator and, you know, the head of North Korea, the head of the ayatollah in Iran. They're all watching this stuff."

Then the question is, do you believe the policies that worked under President Trump -- if President Trump wants a comeback, will people that maybe had issues with his style, not the success, would they -- would they openly be, you know, cheering for somebody that can form a sentence, a coherent sentence and also fight for the things that he promised and actually be engaged in the day-to-day activities and job of being the president?"
