      "sentences": "Welcome to 'Hannity.' We have a very important show tonight. We have major breaking news on a massive story that we have been exclusively reporting on and uncovering, and we are doing the jobs that journalists in America used to do, but they have sadly stopped doing their job. In my opinion, this has been a dereliction of duty. Today, Senators Chuck Grassley, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn and Thom Tillis, they are now demanding that a second special counsel be appointed to investigate rampant FISA abuses, FBI bias, and the Clinton email investigation and so much more.  Now, this needs to happen immediately and tonight all indications are this will, in fact, happen as now evidence is building that crimes have been committed.  Also brand new tonight, disgraced Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe begging earlier today to keep his big fat government pension all while the pension may be the least of his worries. As there is talk tonight of possible criminal charges against the former Deputy FBI Director McCabe. This is beyond significant.  For McCabe to lose his retirement means that he did something very wrong. And sources are telling us that, in fact, McCabe could end up facing charges. Sara Carter is here with all the explosive details coming up. And also breaking tonight, the destroy Trump media has a new method for spreading their fake news. They just recycle old stories to try to damage the Trump administration. We have the evidence. 'The New York Times' is claiming that special counsel, Robert Mueller, subpoenaed the Trump Organization but the Trump Organization is saying it's not true, they've already been voluntarily cooperating with Mueller for months.  And President Trump gets tough on Russia in response to election interference. This is something President Obama never did despite numerous warnings going back to 2014. An explosive new report 'The Hill's' John Solomon is here about James Comey's incompetence and warnings he ignored. We are going to cover all of that and so much more, an important breaking news hour coming up on 'Hannity.'",

      "sentences": "And sources telling us tonight that there is a very high probability that Sessions, in fact, will act and that he will appoint a second special counsel. This will be a huge victory for all of you, the American people. It is why we have been calling for a second special counsel for over a year.  This investigation is now reaching a new level and we're told there will be new explosive developments unfolding in coming days. In a letter to the A.G., Jeff Sessions, and Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, well Senator Grassley and Graham, they explain exactly why a second special counsel is, in fact, needed. These scandals directly implicate key members of the FBI and the Department of Justice. So, it makes it impossible for those organizations to investigate themselves. Key sections of the Grassley-Graham criminal referral against the fake news dossier author Christopher Steele, now tonight they are un-redacted and Grassley and Graham rightly are asking the DOJ to investigate Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the media.  Remember, Steele was shopping the fake news dossier around to everybody in the mainstream media, all these outlets like the 'New York Times,' 'Washington Post,' Yahoo News, fake news CNN, oh, and by the way, Steele is a foreign actor in bed with phony Russian sources. Even he didn't believe what he printed in the dossier.  I thought that was supposed to be bad for America. Criminal even, that, in fact, Steele would be working as a non-foreign actor with Russians to influence an American election. Did he ever register with the U.S. government? Also tonight, brand new news. Fox News reporting disgraced former FBI Director Andrew McCabe, this is huge, is now begging top DOJ officials. Remember, is he a former deputy director of the FBI, that he not be fired because starting Sunday, he would begin to get his lucrative government pension. He is set to retire on Sunday. But he is likely going to be fired tomorrow.  The fact that McCabe is even that the point is so significant and it means something, what, McCabe did something really, really wrong. You don't get fired over nothing, especially being the deputy FBI director working at the bureau for over 20 years. And sources are telling us tonight that McCabe could face multiple criminal charges.   Remember, McCabe, he was put on leave after the current FBI Director Christopher Wray, remember, he found out what we'll find out soon, what is being exposed in the upcoming inspector general's report. And for the I.G. report, don't think that what McCabe did happened in a vacuum. Remember, McCabe didn't do this alone. The I.G. report is supposed to cover, look at the list, the corrupt Clinton email investigation, Hillary having that unsecure server that was stored in the mom and pop shop bathroom closet where she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails. And her aides were smashing devices and acid washing and BleachBit. And then, of course, there's the Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. That's only a small fraction of what the inspector general is now investigating. And then you have what I call the exoneration before investigation. You had Comey and Strzok and Page and other top FBI officials, they put the fix in. They concluded their investigation long before they even interviewed Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses, which, by the way, goes against what James Comey said under oath when he claimed in front of Congress he didn't reach a conclusion on the Clinton email investigation until after interviewing Hillary.  But that's not true. We know it's not true. So, you have Hillary. She rigged her primary. She has her friends at the FBI. Then put the fix in as it relates to crimes she committed.  Then she tries to influence the general election, paying over $12 million to a guy outside of America for Russian government lies and propaganda all to lie to the American people. By the way, Robert Mueller, how about investigating real crimes tonight? And by the way, since we found out that those Clinton bought and paid for lies, which the FBI, they never verified, they never corroborated -- well, then they took those lies to the FISA judge and they used the lies and Russian propaganda to get a warrant to spy on a member of the Trump campaign. Well, that then, of course, gave them access to Trump campaign communications.   Remember, the FBI's own protocols and FISA laws, it says that information needs to be verified and corroborated independently before it ever goes to a FISA court judge. That never happened. And it didn't happen once. FISA judges were lied to on four separate occasions. This is beyond a massive scandal. And I know the media is ignorant, lazy and overpaid. But it's why Jeff Sessions is now looking to the inspector general and now looking into the severe FISA abuses but, remember, here's the problem -- the I.G., Inspector General Horowitz, he has no prosecutorial powers, hence, you need the second special counsel like yesterday.  It all needs to be investigated. People need to be exposed. Crimes were committed at the highest levels, and people in the end need to go to jail. The full story needs to come out. You deserve that and so much more from the people that are supposed to serve you in government.  Also tonight, we have breaking news on President Trump and Russia. It doesn't exactly fit in the narrative that Democrats and the members of the destroy Trump media have been pushing for months. The Trump administration -- they are cracking down on Russia in a massive way. This morning, the Treasury Department announced new targeted sanctions against dozens of Russian entities and individuals involved in cyber attacks and election interference in the 2016 presidential election. And that's not all. President Trump, he is joining leaders from Germany and France and the United kingdom in a joint statement condemning the Putin regime for brutally poisoning a former double agent and his daughter last week in England. Now, the pair remain alive but they are in critical condition in a British hospital. This all comes months after President Trump introduced his administration's first sanctions against Russia, meant to punish the Putin regime for its actions in Crimea. Well, that happened during the Obama years as well as other human rights violations.   Of course, this tough policy, it does stand in stark contrast to what happened under the Obama administration, and when Hillary was secretary of state. Remember, that lame Russian reset button that she handed over to her counterpart.  And continuing with Obama's total inaction during Russia's hostile takeover of Crimea, despite warnings from world leaders, our own intelligence agency and even Congressman Devin Nunes, remember, Devin Nunes wrote this op-ed warning then-President Obama about the Kremlin's hostile actions in Eastern Europe and elections, and warned specifically about the 2016 elections. And the Obama administration, they also dropped the ball in the Middle East when Russia boosted the Assad regime in their fight against Syrian rebels. Remember the red line? Assad crossed it and nothing happened. He gassed his own people. Russia supported it. Obama stood by and did nothing.  And the Obama administration wasn't any better on Russian election interference. According to experts, brand new book Michael Isikoff. Former national security advisor Susan Rice. She issues a quote, a stand down order to officials developing an aggressive response to Putin's meddling.  Remember, when President Obama told then candidate Trump, do you remember this? Stop whining. You know, no serious person thinks that our elections could ever be influenced by hacking, come on, stop being a whiner. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "So, let's get this straight. There's Obama, weak on Russia's hostile takeover of Crimea, weak on Russia's support for Assad using gas on his own people, weak on Russia's election hacking warned two years before the 2016 election, and the media is only focused on Trump's ties to Russia? Mr. Obama, where were you? Why didn't you act? I have said it before, I'll say it again, journalism in this country is dead. It doesn't exist. We break more news here than all these so-called news people put together. Also breaking tonight, speaking of the fake news media, they are hard at work, desperately trying to stop stories about real Democratic scandals, the ones we're reporting, because it's going to boomerang back on them.   For over a year, the deceitful fake news media in this country has been flat out lying to you, the American people, day by day, hour by hour. And now the biased press, they are employing a brand new tactic -- you got to pay attention -- to spread completely false information. 'The New York Times' is claiming to have a blockbuster story about special counsel Robert Mueller issuing a subpoena to the Trump organization to turn over documents. OK. This particular story is a definition of fake news. It's a smear to damage the Trump administration and here ask why. Take a look at this statement earlier today, Trump Organization: 'Since July of 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and are responding to all their requests. This is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.'   Oh, old news, recycled by pathetic liberal lap dog media so-called journalists. They have wasted 14 months beating the drum night after night, night after night, day after day, hour after hour about a conspiracy theory. None exists. No evidence exists. It's been a big lie.  And the media has deliberately spread false information and propaganda which is exactly what Putin and the Russians want. Isn't that what they wanted to do sow discord in America? All the media seems to care about is damaging and destroying President Trump, delegitimizing him and they're also trying to draw the president's attention away from the massive Democratic scandals and not let anybody else in the media focus on cases where we actually have real evidence that's incontrovertible, real facts, real evidence.  And as for Robert Mueller's special counsel, this latest leak is not surprising. What Mueller is doing is deliberate. The special counsel, his team of Democratic donors, Hillary donors, Obama donors, DNC donors, they are selectively leaking daily to the media to keep President Trump off balance. Mueller doesn't care about the truth or evidence or facts because he is bent on a witch-hunt. Look at the team he has put together. And the leaks are obviously intentional because it happens every day.  And if Mueller really cared about uncovering real crimes, real wrongdoing, Mueller, you would be investigating them. You know, if Mueller is going to keep expanding his mandate, why doesn't he focus on the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier with Russian lies? Does Mueller not care that Hillary paid for this Russian propaganda and she did it to influence an election?  Does Mueller not care that Christopher Steele is an unregistered foreign agent who hates President Trump? Does Mueller not care about the FBI lying to a FISA judge not once, twice, three times, but four times, using an unverified dossier as the bulk of the application to get a warrant from FISA judges to spy on a campaign associate so they have access to everything in that campaign? Does Mueller not care that this FISA warrant likely gave access to all of Trump campaign's communications during elections? I can go on all night.  Does Robert Mueller, sir, do you really not care that Clinton fixed and had fixed for her that email investigation and we know crimes were committed or the unmasking scandal of 350 percent increase in one year? Or the Uranium One scandal? You were the FBI director at the time. We had an FBI informant that infiltrated Putin's criminal scheme to control America's uranium. Well, have you no problem going down every other rabbit hole, Mr. Mueller, why don't you look into these scandals? This is why we need the second special counsel, someone that is going to lead from the outside the swamp. You can't have people involved in these scandals investigating themselves. That means Mueller. That means Comey. All -- they have friendships going on here, Rod Rosenstein, they are all BFF, old colleagues. You really think they're going to hold themselves and each other accountable?  Of course, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he created this special counsel witch hunt, now he needs to fix it. You can't be confirmed the A.G., and then the next day recuse yourself and, by the way, cite the long law as Gregg Jarrett pointed out last night. We need the second independent prosecutor. Sessions knew he was going to recuse himself. He never should have accepted the job as attorney general. Look at the chaos that as a result of all of this. Here's a key fact -- Gregg Jarrett pointed this out. This is where we cite -- Sessions cited the wrong law as the justification for recusing himself. He is the attorney general. So, the burden of all of this that is dragging this country down, falls squarely on Jeff Sessions' shoulders.  Tonight, Mr. Attorney General, do your job and fix the mess you created.  And also tonight, another damning report about James Comey's incompetence and his highly questionable conduct while leading the FBI. Our friend John Solomon reporting that the longtime head of the FBI Telecommunications Surveillance Unit is saying that he warned James Comey about how that particular spy program was dangerously ineffective in catching terrorists. Comey never tried to fix it, that's like Obama was warned about Russian collusion and influence on our elections and did nothing and laughed at the idea. Here is what the retired special agent told John Solomon. Take a look.",

And secondly, there are a number of charges that they are looking at based on different statutes. And this I have heard from several different sources. Now, I did contact the FBI and asked for comment and they told me they could not comment on McCabe whatsoever. They did hear me out, but they would not comment on this whatsoever, particularly, on any possible charges.  Remember, General Flynn was charged for basically saying that he didn't tell the whole truth to the FBI. Now, that's still up for debate right now because we know that the FBI agents, one of them being Peter Strzok didn't believe that he lied. So, we have got to get to the bottom of that but, if McCabe lied, to the, you know, to the I.G., if he lied to people within the FBI, and if he leaked information that should have never been leaked, it would be surprising that he would not be brought up on charges.",

California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, she is now calling for the public release of documents on Haspel's involvement in enhanced interrogation and detention of radical Islamist terrorists following the attacks and the murder of 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Now, Feinstein is only the latest liberal lawmaker to question whether Haspel was too tough on jihadists. And, by the way, it's not just lawmakers attacking Haspel.

At one point, you can actually see the person communicating on his radio and then ultimately jumping on a golf cart, driving down a corridor, presumably towards the sound of gunfire.

And then taking up a position, as you can see, outside of the school behind a concrete wall. Now, we're going to analyze that footage in a moment. But, first, we have more fallout from the nationwide antigun school walkouts that took place yesterday.

I talked to a number of people at the White House, nothing is imminent. No decisions have been made. Nobody is leaving.

They just, they won't cover policy. They cover personnel. They won't cover principle. They cover palace intrigue. And they keep in recycling rumors and stories constantly that have no basis. I think they figure hey, if a stop clock is at least right twice today, eventually I'll get this right. So if I predict the whole year in advance, so and so is on tonight. So and so is going to go. And they do. A year later I could just recycle these clips where people said, the president has full confidence in X in six months, a year later, it changes. This president has every right to put the team around him that he thinks aligns with his vision, his values. But he is the one that controls the time, the tone, and content of all substantive and personnel decisions. And I respect that enormously. You know, Sean, people say I see chaos. A lot see it streamlining of some parts and sophistication because we had too many people over time and we had too many of the wrong people. Other people are leaving on their own volition their own free will. And they will truly be missed in this White House. But this president has a great deal of joy on the job. A lot of fake news about he is fuming, is he angry. But he has made very clear what his vision is, too. On North Korea. On the Iran nuclear deal. On taxes, on infrastructure, on DACA, you name it. He could not be more explicit. And so he wants a team around him that supports that.",

We have major breaking news on a massive story that we have been exclusively reporting on and uncovering, and we are doing the jobs that journalists in America used to do, but they have sadly stopped doing their job. In my opinion, this has been a dereliction of duty. Today, Senators Chuck Grassley, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn and Thom Tillis, they are now demanding that a second special counsel be appointed to investigate rampant FISA abuses, FBI bias, and the Clinton email investigation and so much more. Now, this needs to happen immediately and tonight all indications are this will, in fact, happen as now evidence is building that crimes have been committed. Also brand new tonight, disgraced Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe begging earlier today to keep his big fat government pension all while the pension may be the least of his worries. As there is talk tonight of possible criminal charges against the former Deputy FBI Director McCabe. This is beyond significant. For McCabe to lose his retirement means that he did something very wrong. And sources are telling us that, in fact, McCabe could end up facing charges. Sara Carter is here with all the explosive details coming up. And also breaking tonight, the destroy Trump media has a new method for spreading their fake news. They just recycle old stories to try to damage the Trump administration. We have the evidence. 'The New York Times' is claiming that special counsel, Robert Mueller, subpoenaed the Trump Organization but the Trump Organization is saying it's not true, they've already been voluntarily cooperating with Mueller for months. And President Trump gets tough on Russia in response to election interference. This is something President Obama never did despite numerous warnings going back to 2014. An explosive new report 'The Hill's' John Solomon is here about James Comey's incompetence and warnings he ignored. We are going to cover all of that and so much more, an important breaking news hour coming up on 'Hannity.'"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And sources telling us tonight that there is a very high probability that Sessions, in fact, will act and that he will appoint a second special counsel. This will be a huge victory for all of you, the American people. It is why we have been calling for a second special counsel for over a year. This investigation is now reaching a new level and we're told there will be new explosive developments unfolding in coming days. In a letter to the A.G., Jeff Sessions, and Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, well Senator Grassley and Graham, they explain exactly why a second special counsel is, in fact, needed. These scandals directly implicate key members of the FBI and the Department of Justice. So, it makes it impossible for those organizations to investigate themselves. Key sections of the Grassley-Graham criminal referral against the fake news dossier author Christopher Steele, now tonight they are un-redacted and Grassley and Graham rightly are asking the DOJ to investigate Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the media. Remember, Steele was shopping the fake news dossier around to everybody in the mainstream media, all these outlets like the 'New York Times,' 'Washington Post,' Yahoo News, fake news CNN, oh, and by the way, Steele is a foreign actor in bed with phony Russian sources. Even he didn't believe what he printed in the dossier. I thought that was supposed to be bad for America. Criminal even, that, in fact, Steele would be working as a non-foreign actor with Russians to influence an American election. Did he ever register with the U.S. government? Also tonight, brand new news. Fox News reporting disgraced former FBI Director Andrew McCabe, this is huge, is now begging top DOJ officials. Remember, is he a former deputy director of the FBI, that he not be fired because starting Sunday, he would begin to get his lucrative government pension. He is set to retire on Sunday. But he is likely going to be fired tomorrow. The fact that McCabe is even that the point is so significant and it means something, what, McCabe did something really, really wrong. You don't get fired over nothing, especially being the deputy FBI director working at the bureau for over 20 years. And sources are telling us tonight that McCabe could face multiple criminal charges. Remember, McCabe, he was put on leave after the current FBI Director Christopher Wray, remember, he found out what we'll find out soon, what is being exposed in the upcoming inspector general's report. And for the I.G. report, don't think that what McCabe did happened in a vacuum. Remember, McCabe didn't do this alone. The I.G. report is supposed to cover, look at the list, the corrupt Clinton email investigation, Hillary having that unsecure server that was stored in the mom and pop shop bathroom closet where she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails. And her aides were smashing devices and acid washing and BleachBit. And then, of course, there's the Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. That's only a small fraction of what the inspector general is now investigating. And then you have what I call the exoneration before investigation. You had Comey and Strzok and Page and other top FBI officials, they put the fix in. They concluded their investigation long before they even interviewed Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses, which, by the way, goes against what James Comey said under oath when he claimed in front of Congress he didn't reach a conclusion on the Clinton email investigation until after interviewing Hillary. But that's not true. We know it's not true. So, you have Hillary. She rigged her primary. She has her friends at the FBI. Then put the fix in as it relates to crimes she committed. Then she tries to influence the general election, paying over $12 million to a guy outside of America for Russian government lies and propaganda all to lie to the American people. By the way, Robert Mueller, how about investigating real crimes tonight? And by the way, since we found out that those Clinton bought and paid for lies, which the FBI, they never verified, they never corroborated -- well, then they took those lies to the FISA judge and they used the lies and Russian propaganda to get a warrant to spy on a member of the Trump campaign. Well, that then, of course, gave them access to Trump campaign communications. Remember, the FBI's own protocols and FISA laws, it says that information needs to be verified and corroborated independently before it ever goes to a FISA court judge. That never happened. And it didn't happen once. FISA judges were lied to on four separate occasions. This is beyond a massive scandal. And I know the media is ignorant, lazy and overpaid. But it's why Jeff Sessions is now looking to the inspector general and now looking into the severe FISA abuses but, remember, here's the problem -- the I.G., Inspector General Horowitz, he has no prosecutorial powers, hence, you need the second special counsel like yesterday. It all needs to be investigated. People need to be exposed. Crimes were committed at the highest levels, and people in the end need to go to jail. The full story needs to come out. You deserve that and so much more from the people that are supposed to serve you in government. Also tonight, we have breaking news on President Trump and Russia. It doesn't exactly fit in the narrative that Democrats and the members of the destroy Trump media have been pushing for months. The Trump administration -- they are cracking down on Russia in a massive way. This morning, the Treasury Department announced new targeted sanctions against dozens of Russian entities and individuals involved in cyber attacks and election interference in the 2016 presidential election. And that's not all. President Trump, he is joining leaders from Germany and France and the United kingdom in a joint statement condemning the Putin regime for brutally poisoning a former double agent and his daughter last week in England. Now, the pair remain alive but they are in critical condition in a British hospital. This all comes months after President Trump introduced his administration's first sanctions against Russia, meant to punish the Putin regime for its actions in Crimea. Well, that happened during the Obama years as well as other human rights violations. Of course, this tough policy, it does stand in stark contrast to what happened under the Obama administration, and when Hillary was secretary of state. Remember, that lame Russian reset button that she handed over to her counterpart. And continuing with Obama's total inaction during Russia's hostile takeover of Crimea, despite warnings from world leaders, our own intelligence agency and even Congressman Devin Nunes, remember, Devin Nunes wrote this op-ed warning then-President Obama about the Kremlin's hostile actions in Eastern Europe and elections, and warned specifically about the 2016 elections. And the Obama administration, they also dropped the ball in the Middle East when Russia boosted the Assad regime in their fight against Syrian rebels. Remember the red line? Assad crossed it and nothing happened. He gassed his own people. Russia supported it. Obama stood by and did nothing. And the Obama administration wasn't any better on Russian election interference. According to experts, brand new book Michael Isikoff. Former national security advisor Susan Rice. She issues a quote, a stand down order to officials developing an aggressive response to Putin's meddling. Remember, when President Obama told then candidate Trump, do you remember this? Stop whining. You know, no serious person thinks that our elections could ever be influenced by hacking, come on, stop being a whiner. Take a look."

There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time. And so, I would advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes."

There's Obama, weak on Russia's hostile takeover of Crimea, weak on Russia's support for Assad using gas on his own people, weak on Russia's election hacking warned two years before the 2016 election, and the media is only focused on Trump's ties to Russia? Mr. Obama, where were you? Why didn't you act? I have said it before, I'll say it again, journalism in this country is dead. It doesn't exist. We break more news here than all these so-called news people put together. Also breaking tonight, speaking of the fake news media, they are hard at work, desperately trying to stop stories about real Democratic scandals, the ones we're reporting, because it's going to boomerang back on them. For over a year, the deceitful fake news media in this country has been flat out lying to you, the American people, day by day, hour by hour. And now the biased press, they are employing a brand new tactic -- you got to pay attention -- to spread completely false information. 'The New York Times' is claiming to have a blockbuster story about special counsel Robert Mueller issuing a subpoena to the Trump organization to turn over documents. OK. This particular story is a definition of fake news. It's a smear to damage the Trump administration and here ask why."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Take a look at this statement earlier today, Trump Organization",
      "utterance": "'Since July of 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and are responding to all their requests. This is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.' Oh, old news, recycled by pathetic liberal lap dog media so-called journalists. They have wasted 14 months beating the drum night after night, night after night, day after day, hour after hour about a conspiracy theory. None exists. No evidence exists. It's been a big lie. And the media has deliberately spread false information and propaganda which is exactly what Putin and the Russians want. Isn't that what they wanted to do sow discord in America? All the media seems to care about is damaging and destroying President Trump, delegitimizing him and they're also trying to draw the president's attention away from the massive Democratic scandals and not let anybody else in the media focus on cases where we actually have real evidence that's incontrovertible, real facts, real evidence. And as for Robert Mueller's special counsel, this latest leak is not surprising. What Mueller is doing is deliberate. The special counsel, his team of Democratic donors, Hillary donors, Obama donors, DNC donors, they are selectively leaking daily to the media to keep President Trump off balance. Mueller doesn't care about the truth or evidence or facts because he is bent on a witch-hunt. Look at the team he has put together. And the leaks are obviously intentional because it happens every day. And if Mueller really cared about uncovering real crimes, real wrongdoing, Mueller, you would be investigating them. You know, if Mueller is going to keep expanding his mandate, why doesn't he focus on the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier with Russian lies? Does Mueller not care that Hillary paid for this Russian propaganda and she did it to influence an election? Does Mueller not care that Christopher Steele is an unregistered foreign agent who hates President Trump? Does Mueller not care about the FBI lying to a FISA judge not once, twice, three times, but four times, using an unverified dossier as the bulk of the application to get a warrant from FISA judges to spy on a campaign associate so they have access to everything in that campaign? Does Mueller not care that this FISA warrant likely gave access to all of Trump campaign's communications during elections? I can go on all night. Does Robert Mueller, sir, do you really not care that Clinton fixed and had fixed for her that email investigation and we know crimes were committed or the unmasking scandal of 350 percent increase in one year? Or the Uranium One scandal? You were the FBI director at the time. We had an FBI informant that infiltrated Putin's criminal scheme to control America's uranium. Well, have you no problem going down every other rabbit hole, Mr. Mueller, why don't you look into these scandals? This is why we need the second special counsel, someone that is going to lead from the outside the swamp. You can't have people involved in these scandals investigating themselves. That means Mueller. That means Comey. All -- they have friendships going on here, Rod Rosenstein, they are all BFF, old colleagues. You really think they're going to hold themselves and each other accountable? Of course, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he created this special counsel witch hunt, now he needs to fix it. You can't be confirmed the A.G., and then the next day recuse yourself and, by the way, cite the long law as Gregg Jarrett pointed out last night. We need the second independent prosecutor. Sessions knew he was going to recuse himself. He never should have accepted the job as attorney general. Look at the chaos that as a result of all of this. Here's a key fact -- Gregg Jarrett pointed this out. This is where we cite -- Sessions cited the wrong law as the justification for recusing himself. He is the attorney general. So, the burden of all of this that is dragging this country down, falls squarely on Jeff Sessions' shoulders. Tonight, Mr. Attorney General, do your job and fix the mess you created. And also tonight, another damning report about James Comey's incompetence and his highly questionable conduct while leading the FBI. Our friend John Solomon reporting that the longtime head of the FBI Telecommunications Surveillance Unit is saying that he warned James Comey about how that particular spy program was dangerously ineffective in catching terrorists. Comey never tried to fix it, that's like Obama was warned about Russian collusion and influence on our elections and did nothing and laughed at the idea. Here is what the retired special agent told John Solomon. Take a look."

It's not just about his pension. According to the sources I have spoken with, McCabe will be fired. It will be surprising if is he not. Right now, that's what I'm hearing. And secondly, there are a number of charges that they are looking at based on different statutes. And this I have heard from several different sources. Now, I did contact the FBI and asked for comment and they told me they could not comment on McCabe whatsoever. They did hear me out, but they would not comment on this whatsoever, particularly, on any possible charges. Remember, General Flynn was charged for basically saying that he didn't tell the whole truth to the FBI. Now, that's still up for debate right now because we know that the FBI agents, one of them being Peter Strzok didn't believe that he lied. So, we have got to get to the bottom of that but, if McCabe lied, to the, you know, to the I.G., if he lied to people within the FBI, and if he leaked information that should have never been leaked, it would be surprising that he would not be brought up on charges."

Second, obstruction of justice. It follows along the same line. If he is not telling the truth in an investigation, he's obstructing it. That's obstruction of justifiable and for every time he does it, it's yet another crime. James Comey, I mean, can you multiply it by 10."

The best way to restore the confidence of the American people is to make sure that those even in the highest positions of power are held accountable, and that is to go after them and go to grand jury and go before and prosecute these people if they believe that there has been a crime.

And, by the way, from the use program and, by the way, they had found the information through traditional. So, we're spying on Americans by the tens of thousands of leads they looked at in this program and they only got one terrorism thing. And this is the program, section 215 would be the program, if you were building a case in 2016 against the Trump administration or the Trump campaign to try to prove collusion, you would use this power to try to find the connecting of the dots. This is the exact power that could have been abused in the middle of the Russia investigation or any of the other many investigations that have occurred over the last 13 years and we're not hearing this from an outsider. We are hearing it from the man who ran the program."

I'm hearing there may be multiple criminal charges coming down the road for him and the fact that a second special counsel is likely to be appointed in probably short order. I see that the fevered pitch is now rising in Congress. I would believe the attorney general must now act. But, I want to ask you the I.G. report originally we were told it was about just Clinton emails and the investigation. It's that and so much more. What are we going to learn in this I.G. report, Sara?"

What were they talking about when they talked about an insurance policy? What were they planning? What was happening with the Obama administration because, remember, they were all connected? So, this went up to the highest levels and this is what Congress is investigating right now, Sean. This I.G. report is not based on just McCabe or one small instance. These will be multiple reports, issued by Michael Horowitz on his investigation. He has had 1.2 million documents. That is what he has had access to, and interviews with current and former FBI agents. This is going to be a massive investigation and a special counsel will work with him if one is appointed."

Another big story we are following tonight, liberals, Democrats, they continue to mobilize against President Trump's pick for the CIA director. Her name is Gina Haspel. If confirmed by the Senate, she would become the first woman to lead the CIA, to lead that agency. California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, she is now calling for the public release of documents on Haspel's involvement in enhanced interrogation and detention of radical Islamist terrorists following the attacks and the murder of 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Now, Feinstein is only the latest liberal lawmaker to question whether Haspel was too tough on jihadists. And, by the way, it's not just lawmakers attacking Haspel.

Without going through all the litany of what you went through at the very beginning of this broadcast, this woman spent 30 years as an operations officer with numerous foreign postings. She is, quite frankly, admired by most of her colleagues. I have not talked to anybody at the headquarters currently or who was there who know her who don't think the world of her. Dianne Feinstein ought to retire now. Look, she is grandstanding about waterboarding when it was deemed to be legal by the Department of Justice, the attorney general, and the president of the United States. In other words, she did her duty. It was only afterwards that they decided it really wasn't lawful.

We used to do it to people when you need to be prepared for this kind of thing. I guess that has all stopped as well now. Look, all that ended for me. I hope it ends well for the new DCI Gina Haspel.

It shows what appears to be the start of this terrible shooting. At one point, you can actually see the person communicating on his radio and then ultimately jumping on a golf cart, driving down a corridor, presumably towards the sound of gunfire. And as you can see in this clip, minutes later, well, Peterson is outside looking at the building, utilizing his radio. And then taking up a position, as you can see, outside of the school behind a concrete wall. Now, we're going to analyze that footage in a moment. But, first, we have more fallout from the nationwide antigun school walkouts that took place yesterday. Remember in D.C., Democratic lawmakers called for common sense gun restrictions and they showed up at this protest Bernie Sanders with armed security? That includes Bernie walking through the crowd.

I have sources in the White House telling me no such thing is imminent at all in any way. Here to shed some more light on it, special counsel to the president Kellyanne Conway is with us. I talked to a number of people at the White House, nothing is imminent. No decisions have been made. Nobody is leaving. The president said it, I saw earlier today, I believe it was from the Oval Office that nobody is scheduled to leave at all in spite of rampant wild speculation. What can you tell us?"

      "utterance": "And I'm just been amazed. Well, I'm just -- well, first of all, no. It's no other journalist. But it is the rampant speculation itself is a story because it's so incredible to me that the media writ large and it's filled with people who are trying to get the story but it's filled with lots of people trying to get the president also. They just, they won't cover policy. They cover personnel. They won't cover principle. They cover palace intrigue. And they keep in recycling rumors and stories constantly that have no basis. I think they figure hey, if a stop clock is at least right twice today, eventually I'll get this right. So if I predict the whole year in advance, so and so is on tonight. So and so is going to go. And they do. A year later I could just recycle these clips where people said, the president has full confidence in X in six months, a year later, it changes. This president has every right to put the team around him that he thinks aligns with his vision, his values. But he is the one that controls the time, the tone, and content of all substantive and personnel decisions. And I respect that enormously. You know, Sean, people say I see chaos. A lot see it streamlining of some parts and sophistication because we had too many people over time and we had too many of the wrong people. Other people are leaving on their own volition their own free will. And they will truly be missed in this White House. But this president has a great deal of joy on the job. A lot of fake news about he is fuming, is he angry. But he has made very clear what his vision is, too. On North Korea. On the Iran nuclear deal. On taxes, on infrastructure, on DACA, you name it. He could not be more explicit. And so he wants a team around him that supports that."

I started the program tonight, Kellyanne, there comes a point where with all that has happened, and the special counsel and this weight that has literally been there almost from day one. And everything is now boomerang back. We find out, what, Hillary fixed the primary. Imagine if Donald Trump did. The fix was in on crimes. We know she committed with the e-mail server. We have an I.G. report coming. Then you have this whole issue of she purchased, bought and paid for Russian lies, Russian government lies, paid a British spy for them to lie to the American people about Donald Trump, even the guy that creates the dossier cast doubt. He didn't even believe his own material. And then it's used to get a FISA warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. You've lived under all of this. Where is the special counsel looking into the crimes we know were committed?"

I think they put it best which is that different questions are being raised by those who are in charge of these types of investigations, Sean. And there is real questions lingering out there among many people in the public. Why the double standard for that woman who lost the election whose name I never say on TV anymore. Why the special treatment for her. And I think what America saw this week is a great reminder as to why they rejected her and elected him. Because she -- first she ignored all the people in these states then she insulted them again this week."

But let me say, she is actually insulting people who are going to go to the ballot box this fall, including in states, it would seem, where you have these red state Democratic senators who are now so upset with her. Claire McCaskill came out against her, Heidi Heitkamp. Her former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle came out against her in these comments. Sherrod Brown who's up for re-election in Ohio. All these states that she lost. And let me just say. She is insulting voters in states calling them backward and non-progressive, non-diverse that her husband carried twice and her boss, Barack Obama carried twice."
