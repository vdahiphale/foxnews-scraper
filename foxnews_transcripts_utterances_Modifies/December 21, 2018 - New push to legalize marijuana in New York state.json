I don't know, but I hope you have a Merry Christmas. In the meantime, everybody got some big stories breaking. The president's big immigration promises from 2016, under assault tonight on multiple fronts. Both in the courts and here on Capitol Hill. As the highest court in the land deals his asylum policy, a big blow. In Congress, barrels towards a partial government shutdown.  Moments ago, the president tweeting about a now-canceled flight to Mar-a- Lago. Pointing the finger at Democrats to \"protect America's southern border\".  Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in four Martha MacCallum. Where we stand right now is a government will likely shut down partially, at least, at midnight. Question now, how long will it stay closed?  I notice Senator Corker said, \"Go have a scotch.\" So regardless of your beverage of choice, the blame game over this shutdown already underway. As a president who just a few days ago, boasted he was more than happy to own a shutdown, now recalibrating.",

      "sentences": "Good evening, Ed. Yes, this is definitely a blow to the president's immigration policies. What this means is that people who cross into the United States illegally will still be allowed to claim asylum. Now, remember, the Trump administration has been trying to impose a new policy that would only allow asylum claims to be made at specific points of entry.  Last month, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that those new policies violated U.S. immigration laws. Then, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which President Trump has called a big thorn in our side on multiple issues refused the administration's request to lift that lower judge's order which brings us to today, when the Supreme Court sided with the Ninth Circuit, and denied the Trump administration's request that it be allowed to enforce these new policies immediately.   The court was split 5-4 with Chief Justice John Roberts casting the deciding vote. Four justices would have granted the president's request to let the order go into effect including the two justices that he appointed to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. At today's Supreme Court ruling is the second major blow to the president's immigration policies just this week on Wednesday. A federal judge here in Washington struck down large portions of Justice Department policies that made it harder for immigrants to claim asylum because of domestic or gang violence. And then, of course, there's the fight that's happening right now on Capitol Hill over funding for the president's border wall. So, Ed, he said two losses on immigration this week, we'll see in the next few hours or maybe even days if he's able to get a win on his wall. Ed.",

The president signing his name simply as George Walker with each message. Wow! Now, Timothy is a 25-year-old man. You see him there. He says, quote, \"my biggest take-away from being a former beneficiary is that I was molded in the right path and in the ways of God. To the late and the former President of the United States of America, Mr. George Bush, thank you very much for being my sponsor.\" Joining me now is Tim Glenn of Compassion International, that is the non- profit behind President Bush's child sponsorship.

The president's big immigration promises from 2016, under assault tonight on multiple fronts. Both in the courts and here on Capitol Hill. As the highest court in the land deals his asylum policy, a big blow. In Congress, barrels towards a partial government shutdown. Moments ago, the president tweeting about a now-canceled flight to Mar-a- Lago. Pointing the finger at Democrats to \"protect America's southern border\". Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in four Martha MacCallum. Where we stand right now is a government will likely shut down partially, at least, at midnight. Question now, how long will it stay closed? I notice Senator Corker said, \"Go have a scotch.\" So regardless of your beverage of choice, the blame game over this shutdown already underway.

    {
      "speaker": "KRISTIN FISHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Ed. Yes, this is definitely a blow to the president's immigration policies. What this means is that people who cross into the United States illegally will still be allowed to claim asylum. Now, remember, the Trump administration has been trying to impose a new policy that would only allow asylum claims to be made at specific points of entry. Last month, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that those new policies violated U.S. immigration laws. Then, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which President Trump has called a big thorn in our side on multiple issues refused the administration's request to lift that lower judge's order which brings us to today, when the Supreme Court sided with the Ninth Circuit, and denied the Trump administration's request that it be allowed to enforce these new policies immediately. The court was split 5-4 with Chief Justice John Roberts casting the deciding vote. Four justices would have granted the president's request to let the order go into effect including the two justices that he appointed to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. At today's Supreme Court ruling is the second major blow to the president's immigration policies just this week on Wednesday. A federal judge here in Washington struck down large portions of Justice Department policies that made it harder for immigrants to claim asylum because of domestic or gang violence. And then, of course, there's the fight that's happening right now on Capitol Hill over funding for the president's border wall. So, Ed, he said two losses on immigration this week, we'll see in the next few hours or maybe even days if he's able to get a win on his wall. Ed."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",

Some lawmakers have told us there was some discussion about maybe agreeing to less than $5 billion in border wall money. But, there has not been a breakthrough yet.

The question is how long will he stick to his position. I think, right now, Democrats feel like they have the upper hand there was just a House election and Democrats won. Even though immigration was front and center by almost nine points. The polling on the wall right now says about 59 percent of the country doesn't want the wall that the president wants, even though his base wants it.

That we're -- look at what happened last year at the border. 3,800 known or suspected terrorists were stopped. 17,000 criminals were stopped, over a thousand gang members were stopped. If we're not going to stop them at the border, we have to be prepared that they're going to be in the country, and local law enforcement is going to have to deal with it. So, you're going to have to get money for them. So, whatever amount of money --"

It is insulting to the intelligence of any voter who pays even a second of attention in a government that is running a $1 trillion deficit. We are fighting over the difference between $1.6 billion and $5 billion. There is no wall, the wall is made of slats now. And so, the Democrats say you can build walls if you don't call them walls. The Republicans say you can build fences but you must call them walls. This is as dumb and unworthy as anything I've seen this Congress or any Congress do. The normal thing that humane decent people would do and say, you're at 1.6, you're at 3.0 -- you're at five -- 3.3, sounds pretty good to me."

The President in 2017 said basically that we can't pull out of Afghanistan because then there's going to be the safe haven for terrorists and yet it seems like he's doing the opposite now.

He talked about these drugs imprisoning people, which is what they do. A great scholar James T. Wilson said, you know, they destroy the mind and enslave the soul. Marijuana is discussed by Reverend Sharpton as a civil right access to marijuana. It's really quite incredible. There' s professor at Northwestern Medical School, Hans Breiter, he's a psychiatrist and practitioner who said if you wanted to design a drug worst suited for young people in order to keep them down in the bottom ranks of society, you couldn't do better than marijuana. It decreases attention, focus and memory. If you smoke it regularly, once a week, for several years, you will lose I.Q. points. Why in heaven's name would we want to make such a drug more generally available? Well, the legalization lobby has been very effective and very successful.

That's carried on 1,800 years now. But also, this was again, a man of tremendous influence in the church. He went to the council of Nicaea where Constantine presided and he was angry at the heresies there that he spalled the major, the bringer of these heresies in the face. He was imprisoned by Diocletian, the Roman emperor, tortured. He ministered to his fellow prisoners while being tortured. When he got out, he became a bishop. A remarkable man and became the patron saint of sailors, but most of all he became the patron saint of children. Children all around the world loved him and still do.

And Amy is a friend of Compassion and during an intermission in the concert she talked about Compassion International. She told people all you have to do is sponsor a child and raise your hand and we'll bring a packet to you. And here was President Bush raising his hand at the concert, surrounded by a security detail and they passed the packet down to him. He chose Timothy right there that night and he started sponsoring him in January of 2002."

We have 7,000 of those church partners in those 25 countries. And we have two million children who attend those church partners to receive the child development program. That involved educational assistance, after school tutors, health and hygiene education, social skills, help to become employable as adults--"

You know, I was at the White House last night and I wanted to send you in Christmas booklet. You know, pamphlet about all the decorations. But there was -- that was amazing. This one is truly amazing. He said at one point the president, \"P.S., be sure to say your prayers. I do every day. This birthday present will show you the time all around the world.\" The gift was a calculator."

You just go to Compassion.com and you can start that kind of relationship, too. You can start writing letters to your sponsored child, you can send gifts. Small gifts through the mail. And you can even visit your child with a trip to their home, to their village, to the community, to their church project and see first-hand the impact that Compassion's program has."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, look, sometimes you have to transition from a wonderful story about faith to something about Michelle Obama's arms that are not all the rage these days. Another big thing that's the rage. First lady stepping out in thigh-high yellow boots, adorned in sequence at an event in New York this week. Turns out they cost $4,000 from a big-time designer. So big-time I can't even pronounce it. I'm not even going to try it. And let's just say the internet -- Balenciaga. I don't want to get it wrong. And the internet, apparently, everybody else knows where these boots are from. Everybody was going wild. And here is now for ladies' night, Penny Nance from the Concerned Women for America, president and CEO, Jennifer Holdsworth, Democratic strategist and the former campaign director of Senator Cory Booker, and Kimberly Klacik, Republican strategist and talk America radio contributor. Good to see you all. I want to start with you, Penny, what did you think about this? PENNY NANCE, CEO & PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: Listen, Concerned Women for America stands firmly in bipartisan support for fabulous, unserious shoes. So, I loved them. I love her shoes. I also by the way wrote a piece not too long ago in Foxnews.com standing alongside Melania Trump and praising her beautiful shoes. I said very clearly, I think we need to talk about all the important policy issues we have today. But look, I'm wearing Jimmy Choo today in solidarity with our beautiful first ladies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, what about that? Because remember when the first lady, there was a, she was wearing pumps instead of sneakers to go visit the hurricane. Everybody went crazy. For no apparent reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENNIFER HOLDSWORTH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "No. I mean, I think the boots were just fabulous. I mean, I wish that I could pull them off. But I don't know if I have the confidence or the height to do it. But I think one thing we can get together on bipartisan is that we have had two incredibly trendy, beautiful first ladies in a row with a wonderful design and fashion aesthetics. So, it is one thing that both the parties can get together on."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KLACIK",
      "utterance": "Yes. But I'm glad that she wore them. Because not too long ago I was on Fox & Friends defending Melania Trump and what she wore in Africa. And everyone talked about her expensive tastes. So, now hopefully the left can stop talking about that because $4,000 boots it doesn't get more expensive than that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm going to get hit probably by Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez. Because we did a segment on the show a few weeks ago and we were talking about the shoes she used on the campaign trail and how they were being put in a museum and it was positive story. And she kind of got mad and tweeted about how we were only focused on her shoes. We were not. We were focused on her, the historic nature of her campaign."

      "speaker": "NANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, and this--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, the story ends up becoming a big blown out of proportion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, this is woman by the way who has embraced socialism so it's hard to take her too seriously when she is wearing $10,000 outfits and all of that. Michelle Obama made $65 million in the joint book deal. So, I'm thinking she can afford the four grand for the shoes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, on that point, what about the fact that first lady Melania Trump, she never appears on the cover of any of the big fashion magazines. As has been noted we should be bipartisan. Michelle Obama, a beautiful woman. Melania Trump, a beautiful woman. And both beyond their looks, we should point out, both are very good first ladies. They both had strong causes. Michelle Obama talked about healthy eating, she helped our veterans. Melania Trump is talking about anti-bullying. Why won't any of the magazine just give her a tiny bit of due?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLDSWORTH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think if you compare the number of magazines that first lady Melania Trump was on versus Michelle Obama, I think Melania Trump would win any day of the week--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, before she was first lady."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KLACIK",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLDSWORTH",
      "utterance": "But, you know, in terms of her being on the magazines while President Trump is in office, I think that's because a lot of people disbelieve the credibility of her Be Best campaign while the president is insulting people on Twitter. So, there is a little bit of a concern there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Kimberly, this photo, by the way, there is another fashion magazine we just showed it up there. The Christmas photo. The president and the first lady were holding hands. And I think was it Vogue? They were going crazy about it."

    {
      "speaker": "KLACIK",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "My God, it doesn't look real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KLACIK",
      "utterance": "Everybody was going crazy about it. But here, you have the first lady that is actually an immigrant. And you think the left would champion her, because hey, they are all about immigration. But here they are not doing that. They're thumb in their nose at Melania. I mean, she can't help that she is beautiful and intelligent and speaks so different many languages. I mean, what does she is supposed to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Quick point, Jennifer and I want to go--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLDSWORTH",
      "utterance": "Sure. She is the first immigrant first lady since Louisa Adams that's very historical, but it's certainly a different story when you want to slam the door behind you."
