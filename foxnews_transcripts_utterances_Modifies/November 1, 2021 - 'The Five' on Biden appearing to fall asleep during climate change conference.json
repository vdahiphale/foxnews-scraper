And the number one discussion now is that your Thanksgiving dinner is going to cause more and if you try to fly to go see grandma, your flight is going to get canceled because of vaccine mandates and bad weather according to mandates, Christmas is coming. Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary when asked if you going to get your Christmas presents on time says call that x because we are dealing with a supply chain crisis right now. gas is through the roof so if you get in your car, it's going to cost you twice as much in some areas of the country. There are major, major problems and major headwinds right now and people feel that.

But going back to the climate summit today, it's a perfect example of how the left is now completely out of touch with the so-called working class they want to represent. None of these people lecturing today are afraid of climate change but they want you to be really afraid of climate change. Like they have Prince Charles who lives in a palace, multiple palaces, lecturing about how he wants a militarized campaign to get the rest of these people in line. The agenda that they are pushing doesn't allow undeveloped countries to become developed which is also a huge problem for poor people around the world. They want to be able to continue their lives of luxury, Al Gore, for example, sold his TV company $500 million pocketed from Al Jazeera which of course is funded by oil, he is there. John Kerry, we talk about him all the time wants to keep jetting around because it's the good of the planet. They want to be in control, they want to control people's lives. It has nothing to do with solving the issue of climate change. And then back home they say well, gas prices are going to go up 40 percent. So while we are all flying into, you know, Scotland for this conference, your house gets a little cold, you can't afford to heat your house, just throw another sweater on and deal with it later. I mean, people understand that and that's why you are seeing these numbers in the 70s.",

Climate change to me is really an effort to go after our biggest geopolitical threat and the biggest geopolitical question we have as a country and that's China. China as we all know a few weeks ago launched a supersonic, hypersonic weapon that for the first time can zig and zag and deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world. As I've shared, they lead the world in electric battery production, solar panel production, wind turbine production. Now, are they right? Probably so. They are predicting where the world is going to go. So, I think we should be in the business of competing and trying our hardest to beat them. Climate change to me is also an economic challenge and should set that matter economic race around the globe. Now I would agree with you, Katie. There is some hypocrisy to people flying in big planes, having enormous carbon footprints and some not saying that we should have it all of the above energy strategy. You can't out of one side of your mouth say what we're dealing within the country in terms of shortages and people wanting to be warm during the winter that we should rely on grids that are unreliable. We should invest in everything and invest in all above strategy or above all strategy or on all above strategy that all wealthy and middle class, upper-middle-class people are able to live by. We are not doing that. And I think Democrats and Republicans alike have some blame -- have some blame. But for me, it's China.",

And Democrat for years with the help of the media have used Trump as a way to scare people into voting for them on a number of issues. But in Virginia in particular, Glenn Youngkin is not just running on education which is something that Terry McAuliffe shot himself in the foot on during that debate. He's also running on things that people care about like limiting the state grocery tax while grocery is going through the roof. He's been campaigning on wanting to repeal the state gas tax temporarily, so people have money in their pockets. So, while terry McAuliffe has tried to nationalized this race to make it all about Trump and brought everybody under the sun, Glenn Youngkin has really made it about people in Virginia and I think also he's made it about everybody, he's made less political. Whereas Terry McAuliffe is a political machine backed by the Clintons and that's why Glenn Youngkin is getting support from people of all kinds of backgrounds.",

I think I'm a concerned parents. I have two kids and my kids happen to be black and white and I care deeply about them and what the schools to perform well. I know Greg meant that as well. But in this race here, two things are going to be learned. If Glenn Youngkin wins, this is the playbook for Republicans next year to win in the midterms individual candidate, and it's really a playbook for how do you capitalize on the best of Donald Trump and try to shun the parts that don't do it. I would remind everybody that Republicans probably would be in a majority in the Senate had Donald Trump not divided Republicans in Georgia. Two, if Terry wins, it's a message for Democrats that a moderate down the middle economic message. Remember, for two of the last four years Virginia has been the number one state to do business and according to a rival business network to now based on taxes and education, livability. Terry was governor five years ago. So, Democrats have to understand you have to get back to talking about the economy, you got to get back to talking as James Carville who says about the economy is stupid. But understanding where parents are. And this year it's education. And if terry does not win this race this would be probably the biggest reason and the biggest as to why.",

The other thing aside of this that's obvious to people watching, is when Southwest or American say, it was just weather-related, but it happens only at one or two airports. And when you talk to people who know air traffic controllers or pilots and they say no, no, this is our way of quietly saying we don't want these mandates and it's not just about us, it's about all the people we work with. So the airlines tried to lie to the passengers and say, well, we are just having issues when it's obvious what the problem is and it would be very simply for the CEOs of these companies to just say, you know what, if you want to get vaccinated, go for it.

Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary when asked if you going to get your Christmas presents on time says call that x because we are dealing with a supply chain crisis right now. gas is through the roof so if you get in your car, it's going to cost you twice as much in some areas of the country.

But going back to the climate summit today, it's a perfect example of how the left is now completely out of touch with the so-called working class they want to represent. None of these people lecturing today are afraid of climate change but they want you to be really afraid of climate change. Like they have Prince Charles who lives in a palace, multiple palaces, lecturing about how he wants a militarized campaign to get the rest of these people in line. The agenda that they are pushing doesn't allow undeveloped countries to become developed which is also a huge problem for poor people around the world. They want to be able to continue their lives of luxury, Al Gore, for example, sold his TV company $500 million pocketed from Al Jazeera which of course is funded by oil, he is there. John Kerry, we talk about him all the time wants to keep jetting around because it's the good of the planet. They want to be in control, they want to control people's lives. It has nothing to do with solving the issue of climate change. And then back home they say well, gas prices are going to go up 40 percent. So while we are all flying into, you know, Scotland for this conference, your house gets a little cold, you can't afford to heat your house, just throw another sweater on and deal with it later. I mean, people understand that and that's why you are seeing these numbers in the 70s."

Climate change to me is really an effort to go after our biggest geopolitical threat and the biggest geopolitical question we have as a country and that's China. China as we all know a few weeks ago launched a supersonic, hypersonic weapon that for the first time can zig and zag and deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world. As I've shared, they lead the world in electric battery production, solar panel production, wind turbine production. Now, are they right? Probably so. They are predicting where the world is going to go. So, I think we should be in the business of competing and trying our hardest to beat them. Climate change to me is also an economic challenge and should set that matter economic race around the globe. Now I would agree with you, Katie. There is some hypocrisy to people flying in big planes, having enormous carbon footprints and some not saying that we should have it all of the above energy strategy. You can't out of one side of your mouth say what we're dealing within the country in terms of shortages and people wanting to be warm during the winter that we should rely on grids that are unreliable. We should invest in everything and invest in all above strategy or above all strategy or on all above strategy that all wealthy and middle class, upper-middle-class people are able to live by. We are not doing that. And I think Democrats and Republicans alike have some blame -- have some blame. But for me, it's China."

He's also running on things that people care about like limiting the state grocery tax while grocery is going through the roof. He's been campaigning on wanting to repeal the state gas tax temporarily, so people have money in their pockets. So, while terry McAuliffe has tried to nationalized this race to make it all about Trump and brought everybody under the sun, Glenn Youngkin has really made it about people in Virginia and I think also he's made it about everybody, he's made less political.

I think I'm a concerned parents. I have two kids and my kids happen to be black and white and I care deeply about them and what the schools to perform well. I know Greg meant that as well. But in this race here, two things are going to be learned. If Glenn Youngkin wins, this is the playbook for Republicans next year to win in the midterms individual candidate, and it's really a playbook for how do you capitalize on the best of Donald Trump and try to shun the parts that don't do it. I would remind everybody that Republicans probably would be in a majority in the Senate had Donald Trump not divided Republicans in Georgia. Two, if Terry wins, it's a message for Democrats that a moderate down the middle economic message. Remember, for two of the last four years Virginia has been the number one state to do business and according to a rival business network to now based on taxes and education, livability. Terry was governor five years ago. So, Democrats have to understand you have to get back to talking about the economy, you got to get back to talking as James Carville who says about the economy is stupid. But understanding where parents are. And this year it's education. And if terry does not win this race this would be probably the biggest reason and the biggest as to why."

They are engaging in civil disobedience and proving that they are essential workers who worked for most of the pandemic and you were going to tell them now that they're going to lose their jobs or that people working in the airport or for the airline are going to lose their jobs over something that they may not need or do not want. The other thing aside of this that's obvious to people watching, is when Southwest or American say, it was just weather-related, but it happens only at one or two airports. And when you talk to people who know air traffic controllers or pilots and they say no, no, this is our way of quietly saying we don't want these mandates and it's not just about us, it's about all the people we work with. So the airlines tried to lie to the passengers and say, well, we are just having issues when it's obvious what the problem is and it would be very simply for the CEOs of these companies to just say, you know what, if you want to get vaccinated, go for it. If you don't, great.

An NRA instructor was there or somebody who was part of the NRA because they are -- they are obsessive about this stuff. I have been yelled at -- like, just like -- and I've yelled at people because I -- because like, I'll be at a range and like some guys walk around with his rifle and he just kind of steers.

But Taran Tactical which is an organization that trains a range in L.A. that trains a lot of actors and actresses. They've trained for John Wick. They trained Halle Berry and Keanu Reeves. They say that when they train people, their actors understand all the safety protocols themselves even when they are not on the set to make sure things are going well. And they also say that look, there have been millions of rounds fired -- blank rounds fired over the past 20 years. And just because a single product's refusal to recognize established safety protocols, doesn't mean that the entire system should be changed because Alec Baldwin allegedly didn't have his crew following those rules."

I hope that people get trained with guns but I hope we don't -- there's no need for guns. And you said it well earlier. They can do anything with cameras. Why have guns and ammunition on a movie set anyway? I mean police officers mistake people with fake guns, so fake guns are clearly made well enough --"
