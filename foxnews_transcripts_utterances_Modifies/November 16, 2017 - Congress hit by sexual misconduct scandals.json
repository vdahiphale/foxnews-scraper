I'm done with it. I have moved on with my life. But I am coming out with it now so I can be done with it. And maybe he can't get away with it anymore.  Before I even knew it, he grabbed, he put his hands on the back of my head and came towards me and mashed his face against my mouth and stuck his tongue in my mouth. And I sort of pushed him back and I said don't ever do that to me again.",

They were on this trip, and she tells the story about what she says was the harassment and groping behind stage. And then there's this picture from the C-17 where she is asleep. And you can see Al Franken making that motion.  She comes out with this today and the initial statement from Franken says \"I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for this skit,\" when this kiss happened, \"in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it.\" That's how the day started. There were a couple of other statements throughout the day and a lot of reaction on Capitol Hill. Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent of Washington Examiner; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of \"No Labels Radio\" on Sirius XM, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist. OK, A.B., your thoughts?",

Women are coming together, trying to, in solidarity with each other, but also just to try to stop it from happening again.   And it's going to really be very difficult time on Capitol Hill. This whole situation with comparing Senator Franken to Roy Moore, the candidate in the Alabama Senate race, it's a little difficult. I think that you do see that the senator, the majority leader is trying to subject Senator Franken to an ethics committee investigation in order to set a precedent so that if Moore were to win and come in, he would automatically be subjected for activities that took place before you were a senator for the same kind of ethics investigation. But where this ends I don't know. When someone apologizes and the victim accepts the apology, do you have ethics investigations? This is really a mess, and I think we are only at the beginning.",

And you were talking about a Democrat -- excuse me, Republican leadership that was completely distancing himself from his candidacy, trying to starve his candidacy of money and trying to in every way make sure Roy Moore did not become the next senator from Alabama.   Now it's become a bipartisan issue, a lot of Democrats running away from microphones today and this whole Al Franken thing. And one thing about the ethics committee, we've talked about both cases ending up there. The ethics committee in the Senate has never expelled a member for conduct before that member became a senator. It just hasn't happened before.

But I do kind of wonder if maybe what should happen here is a little bit of everybody taking a deep breath, thinking through how to properly handle credible allegations of sexual assault and sexual impropriety, how to balance the allegations with the defense, and whether we should institute better systems for handling this.

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and this is a delicate situation given the allegations against Donald Trump, too. But what really needs to happen here, I think, is care for the Alabama voter who is in a very bad situation there. People need to be thinking about them. But also I think we really need to take some deep breaths and think through how to handle these allegations. You cannot have a situation where society forms mobs in response to allegations and executes punishment immediately. We should think about why we have good systems in place to handle these things in a little more judicious manner. And that's something that affects everybody across the political spectrum, but nobody seems interested in it because they are just trying to see how they can get political advantage.
