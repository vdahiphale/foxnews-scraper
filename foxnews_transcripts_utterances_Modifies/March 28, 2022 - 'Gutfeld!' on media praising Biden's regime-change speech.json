But I remember my childhood when I was a kid, I had a dog named Chipper. It was a miniature schnauzer that looked like a tiny German General with mange. No, think Wolf Blitzer, but with a color. The dog drove me crazy because we lived on a street between a park and a busy street full of fast cars. And whenever the dog got out, you think it would run to the park to pee or poop, you know, like vagrants and Democrat run cities. But no, it always ran up the street towards the traffic. And as kids would have to race after him and risk our lives trying to scoop the mutt out of harm's way was a weird habit. When offered options to pick the worst one, which seems to be a president's problem. Instead of taking a quiet walk to the park, he just loves to run right into traffic and scream World War III.",

The proposal includes 3.2 billion in discretionary resources for state and local grants, and 30 billion in mandatory resources to support local law enforcement, crime prevention, and community violence intervention. It also includes funding for more deputy marshals and ATF agents on major cities, with a special unit dedicated just to Kat Timpf. But is this renewed focus on crime too little too late? Is it like when I brought condoms to a gender reveal? Or is it a political ploy Biden is using to clean up the mess Democrats have made with progressive policies like no cash bail and defund the police crusades.

As supply chain issues impact the auto industry and national gas prices continue to rise, so as the popularity of using e-scooters to get around without going bankrupt, all it will cost you is your dignity. According to the Wall Street Journal owned by our parent company, Pampers, several electric scooter manufacturers report massive increases in sales and Web traffic since gas prices are shooting up like passengers on the subway. Scooter rental programs have also skyrocketed in places like New York where public transit is more unpleasant than shopping for laptops with Jeffrey Toobin. Speaking of joysticks, those who are driving, don't want to pick a car with a stick. According to data from U.S. News and World Report, only one percent of cars sold in America have manual transmissions, and only about 18 percent of Americans even know how to drive one. So, I guess driving a stick shift is a dying art. Much like my clay sculptures of various drifters. Of course, only the surface is made of clay.

But I remember my childhood when I was a kid, I had a dog named Chipper. It was a miniature schnauzer that looked like a tiny German General with mange. No, think Wolf Blitzer, but with a color. The dog drove me crazy because we lived on a street between a park and a busy street full of fast cars. And whenever the dog got out, you think it would run to the park to pee or poop, you know, like vagrants and Democrat run cities. But no, it always ran up the street towards the traffic. And as kids would have to race after him and risk our lives trying to scoop the mutt out of harm's way was a weird habit. When offered options to pick the worst one, which seems to be a president's problem. Instead of taking a quiet walk to the park, he just loves to run right into traffic and scream World War III."

He may as well have said, we're nuking Russia next week, unless they do it first. Thanks, Joe. As we inch closer to negotiations, we just took a giant step back.

But really if you wanted to enhance his status, he's just should have stayed home and dated Pete Davidson. It's sad, Joe's been in politics for over five decades, six if you count his first year as president. He was a V.P. for eight, been to a lot of countries, met all the players and of course knows Ukraine, like the back of Hunter's laptop. But in politics the longer you're in it the dumber and more detached you become. It's the only profession where experience counts against you. And the higher the stakes the more Biden screws up. Look, we know Putin violated international law and follows it with bomb and the crap out of Ukraine. So why help him at home by indulging his fears?

But I also think that the smarter way to go with this kind of language is more along the lines of what we heard from President Reagan in terms of empowering the people of Russia, and encouraging them to potentially make different choices in the future about their world and about the kind of world that they want to live in. Then it's a dig at Putin is sort of saying we recognize the fact that many of the people who live in your country are probably against this war, and are probably against you in what you're doing without calling for regime change. It also reminded me of President Obama who told us time and time again, that Assad's days were numbered."

Biden's problem is he hasn't had any manhood in this whole thing. And he should be calling Putin a war criminal and a crook on a daily basis. And you might be surprised either this -- either the Russians overthrow them or like take a poll.

He goes up he smacks Chris and in my opinion he threw away everything that he stood for in that moment. This brother was one of the -- he was one of the brothers that -- he did a different. He wrapped without cussing. He did everything the right way. He was -- we had Bill Cosby. We know how that ended. He was the one guy who -- his criticism was always, he was soft. He was this, he was that. But he was the guy who did it right. He was the guy who tell you something like, hey, be like him. He did this way. He did it that way. In one moment, he was no different if he was going to be in NWA or any of the controversial groups back in the day, they used to fight against. All because -- it had nothing to do Chris Rock. It had nothing to do anything to do with him and Jada, and their relationship. And I mean, the turntable thing which he talked about. Basically being with the dude in the house and all that stuff. That stuff weighs on you. And when you have a bad relationship, that's what happens. You don't have to be in the academy wars to see it. We've seen at restaurants, bars, all kinds of places where a guy and his wife or his girl will be there, they had a bad relationship. Some guy says something like, you know, what are you going to do about it? See? I told you want a man or I'll show you and then walks over and hits the guy because that's their thing.

And the mayor of Irpin says the Kyiv suburb has been liberated from Russian troops. Meantime, according to British intelligence, Russia is deploying its private military firm to eastern Ukraine. The U.K. says the Wagner group is expected to send more than 1000 mercenaries including its senior leaders to undertake combat operations.

The President's proposing more than $33 billion to fight crime nationwide as part of his 2023 budget. The proposal includes 3.2 billion in discretionary resources for state and local grants, and 30 billion in mandatory resources to support local law enforcement, crime prevention, and community violence intervention. It also includes funding for more deputy marshals and ATF agents on major cities, with a special unit dedicated just to Kat Timpf. But is this renewed focus on crime too little too late? Is it like when I brought condoms to a gender reveal? Or is it a political ploy Biden is using to clean up the mess Democrats have made with progressive policies like no cash bail and defund the police crusades. They're just like arsonists who bill you for the gasoline. And just in time for the midterms when Dems need to wash the stank of their pro crime agenda off their clothes.

As supply chain issues impact the auto industry and national gas prices continue to rise, so as the popularity of using e-scooters to get around without going bankrupt, all it will cost you is your dignity. According to the Wall Street Journal owned by our parent company, Pampers, several electric scooter manufacturers report massive increases in sales and Web traffic since gas prices are shooting up like passengers on the subway. Scooter rental programs have also skyrocketed in places like New York where public transit is more unpleasant than shopping for laptops with Jeffrey Toobin. Speaking of joysticks, those who are driving, don't want to pick a car with a stick. According to data from U.S. News and World Report, only one percent of cars sold in America have manual transmissions, and only about 18 percent of Americans even know how to drive one. So, I guess driving a stick shift is a dying art. Much like my clay sculptures of various drifters. Of course, only the surface is made of clay.
