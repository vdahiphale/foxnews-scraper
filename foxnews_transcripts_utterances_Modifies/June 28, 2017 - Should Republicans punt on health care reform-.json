And in terms of five years not being enough, I'm not sure. If you get kicked out, your family is still there. I don't know. Five years might be worth the risk to you. Certainly, I have questions about how this will look implemented, I certainly have no qualms about wanting to punish people who come here illegally and then commit a crime.

But I think there's something to be said for prioritizing who gets out first. But I want to ask you about something else, Eric, and that's the other legislation that's proposed the sanctuary cities. Now a lot of people have mixed feelings on this when it's not as clear-cut as Kate's law.

Earlier this month, it published an editorial falsely linking her to the 2011 shooting of then Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, which the paper later corrected. The Times editorial came after this month's shooting of house majority Steve Scalise. But, can Governor Palin prove the Times purposely published false information to defame her?
