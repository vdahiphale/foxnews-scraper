      "utterance": "Jason, great to see you. Thanks so much. Fantastic show. I’m Laura Ingraham, and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy Washington tonight. Has impeachment ever been misplayed as badly as what we’re seeing from Pelosi and Schumer? I think not. My Angle drives a stake in their folly before Clinton impeachment veterans Ken Starr and Sol Wisenberg react. Also, three congressmen have been instrumental in exposing the Democrat circus, Zeldin, Gaetz, and Scalise, and they’re all here tonight. And did you notice how many lawmakers yesterday compared Trump’s impeachment to the civil rights movement? Candace Owens has reaction. Plus, we’ll have the first reaction to tonight's 2020 Democrat debate. It's a doozy. And some big breaking news tonight in John Durham's investigation. You've been waiting for it. A busy hour ahead. But first, America's first fake impeachment. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were right about one thing. Yesterday was historic, but not for the reason they claim. It's historic because it was the first time the impeachment process has been used for purely partisan reasons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "Their slap-dash process has concluded in the first purely partisan presidential impeachment -- this week wasn't even the first time House Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment. It was actually the seventh time. It was the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even nominated, let alone sworn in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll take it a step further. I think one can make a fairly decent argument that the president wasn't really even impeached, at least not yet. Now why am I saying that? Because Nancy and the gang ran out of town without even naming impeachment managers and without sending the articles to the Senate. You know who else is saying this? The Democrats' own lawyer. Noah Feldman, one of their impeachment witnesses, wrote today, \"If the House does not communicate its impeachment to the Senate, it hasn't actually impeached the president. If the articles are not transmitted, Trump could legitimately say that he wasn't truly impeached at all.\" Again, I repeat, this is from their lawyer. Last night, The Angle explained that Pelosi's stall was just the latest sign that the Democrats were never really serious about any of this. In the end, it was a pretend impeachment because it didn't pass Pelosi's own previously stated test. It wasn't bipartisan. So no wonder she stumbled through her year-end press conference today. When asked on whether she'll ever transmit the articles to the Senate, she said this."

      "speaker": "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lindsey Graham",
      "utterance": "Well, I would hope that she knew what arena she was in. Nancy, it's called the Senate. Did she just wake up today and realize that McConnell was the majority leader, or did she lose her copy of the pocket Constitution? The Senate has the sole power of impeachment. She doesn't get to dictate its rules for an impeachment trial or anything else for that matter. But, of course, she's smart. She knows that. Now that the House has dragged the country through this bogus Ukraine-Trump-Zelensky ordeal, it's time for her to put up or shut up. She -- she chose the latter."

    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "She's not going to go there anymore. She's not even going to tell America what her demands are for a Senate trial? She just did this fake impeachment yesterday, and she's going to run out of town? How convenient. Again, it's all fake. This is why her impeachment theater didn't rate well even with the resistance watchers. Both the acting and the script were lame. Fox has been dominating the ratings since this sad saga began. Not trying to brag, but we have. The House impeached itself yesterday by perpetrating a fraud on the American people, because the case for impeachment was nonexistent from the start and because everyone knew the ultimate outcome before it began. Pelosi's failure to send the articles to the Senate is tantamount -- I was thinking about this today -- to a prosecutor who makes a big show of charging some high-profile individual with a crime only to then announce, he's not sure whether he'll ever prosecute the case, whether he'll take it to trial. You heard of smash and grab, right? Well, this is smear and run. Remember, Democrats assured us, they assured us that they were rushing this through, not because they hated the president, no. But because he represented an imminent threat to democracy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "\"Work up the courage.\" Come on, Democrats never intended to bring this case to trial. As Pelosi stated last spring, impeachment is only warranted when both parties agree on the gravity of the underlying accused conduct. This fruitless corrosive exercise was Pelosi's attempt to throw a bone to the party's hard-core radicals and protect her members from being primaried by them. If this is as critical as they claim, if President Trump was really colluding with the Ukrainians or the Russians or whoever to steal the next election, they would not on the have immediately sent the articles to the Senate, named their impeachment managers, they wouldn't have adjourned for the holidays. Today, Nancy did her best to staunch the bleeding. It was not successful."

Just yesterday, Pelosi's colleagues and members of the press, they were ready to petition the National Park Service to add her to Mount Rushmore. And today, all she has to show for herself is a non-impeachment impeachment, a bewildered caucus and nowhere to go. And that's The Angle. Joining me now, is Ken Starr, former independent counsel, Fox News contributor, and Sol Wisenberg, former deputy Whitewater independent counsel. Ken, Noah Feldman's column is kind of interesting today in Bloomberg. He says the president isn't technically impeached until it actually becomes part of a Senate trial, as it goes to the Senate. But it certainly does speak to the confusion that Pelosi and Schumer have caused for the country and her caucus, does it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Starr, former independent counsel",
      "utterance": "It certainly does. I have a very different perspective, and it's one that's rooted in the language of the Constitution. The sole power of impeachment rests with the House of Representatives. And the House of Representatives wisely, or as I think, unwisely, acted. They were called into formal session. They had a debate, and they voted. And that vote is now a matter of record. Now, something is missing, and that is the filing. It's almost like the filing of the criminal complaint that we were talking about earlier. You can get the grand jury to indict, but the prosecutor needs to go file the indictment in court. This is not a court proceeding. This is politics. But Constitution contemplates, and history teaches us, and here history is a guide, that in short order -- there's no time limit. But in short order, that the speaker will designate the House impeachment managers, the prosecutors --"

She’s just -- it’s very childish, to begin with, and it’s supposed to be a serious and somber thing, as she said, and she’s trying to do something that the Constitution doesn’t allow her to do. As Ken said, the Senate has the sole power to try impeachment; the House has the sole power to consider impeachment. However, I don’t believe the Constitution requires her to send it over to the Senate. She looks like an idiot for not doing it, but I don’t think it requires her to. The interesting question is, what about the Senate? What if Senator McConnell -- it doesn’t sound like he wants to do it, but what if he decides, “All right, look, you’re not bringing it over here, but we have the sole power to try impeachment. We’re going to have a trial, and we’re going to acquit him.”"

They knew that McConnell was Senate majority leader. They didn’t wake up today and find out, “Oh, God, he’s running the Senate.” Right? So, what does it tell you about the strength of their case, the lack of bipartisan nature, and whether they were ever really serious that this constituted a high crime or misdemeanor? That’s why I say it’s a fraud perpetrated on the American people."

This was a running theme. “We have to do this now because the president is a clear and present danger.” Ridiculous hyperbole. We all saw it as hyperbole, but now it’s been proven. Unless she moves forward quickly and appoints impeachment managers, then it becomes a fraud on the House, as well as a fraud, of course, on the American people."

Senator Graham said something, but before we get to Senator Graham, I want to play something from Amy Klobuchar in tonight’s Democrat debate. This is fresh sound. Apparently, now, Sol, if you don’t testify, or if you don’t put on witnesses, it means you’re de facto guilty. This isn’t the Democrats. This is civil libertarians, the new approach to impeachment. Watch."

      "utterance": "As we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn’t he have all the president’s men testify? If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses."

      "utterance": "Sol, response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sol Wisenberg",
      "utterance": "Well, it’s just -- it’s silly, but it’s consistent with what they have -- the kinds of things that the House managers -- the people in the House -- there are no House managers yet -- have been saying. For example, Congressman Swalwell said the other day, “If you don’t -- if you’re innocent, you would come and testify.” I guess he’s never heard of the Fifth Amendment. I can’t believe the guy is a lawyer. So, it’s a -- the senator’s point is a rhetorical point. You can say, “If he really did nothing wrong, why doesn’t he put his people up to testify?” That’s a political point. But to say that we can vote guilty because of that is ridiculous. Her duty, like Senator McConnell’s duty, is to listen to the evidence and to make a decision in an impartial way, and I don’t think the senator should have said -- I don’t think it was wise or right for him to say that he is not impartial. Do it the right way."

I disagree with you on that, but I -- I mean, I see your point if it was a legitimate impeachment. I don't think he thinks it’s legitimate from the beginning. I want to play something from Senator Graham, who met with the president today, Ken. Watch."

But I can understand, as a matter of pride, that the president wants to clear his name. It was a weak case. Abuse of power does not fit.

That’s what your point was."

Yeah, that -- I believe that if Pelosi does not exhibit the articles of impeachment to the House -- to the Senate, which, by the way, the preamble to the articles says that once it is voted for, it will be exhibited to the Senate. If she doesn’t do that, I believe that the Senate has the power, because it has the sole -- I think he’s -- number one, I think Professor Feldman is wrong; I agree with Ken. He has been impeached; the president has been impeached. The Senate has the sole power to try impeachment under the Constitution. I think the Senate would be totally within its constitutional right, and Senator McConnell would, to say, “We’re trying this baby.” Now, he doesn’t sound like he wants to do it. That’s up to him. I think they have the power to do that, and I think it would be challenged in court, and I think the court would say the Constitution leaves this checks-and-balances battle to the Senate and the House."

They lost intensity even among Democrats. And Republicans certainly saw it for the sham that it was.

And you can debate whether it was a high crime or misdemeanor. But they were all a crime. There's no dispute about that. Here, there was never a crime. They hoped there was a crime. The Mueller investigation was a 22-month witch hunt to try to find a crime. But go look at Pelosi's comments just a week ago, where she said they've been doing this for two and a half years. Again, I read on the House floor last night, some of the things that Democrats already voted to impeach President Trump on, two years ago, they voted to impeach him for criticizing NFL players who kneeled for the pledge. Is that really a high crime and misdemeanor? Or is, as Turley, one of the Democrat witnesses who, under oath, testified he voted against President Trump, said the only abuse of power is what Democrats are doing, abusing their power because the president is exercising his legal rights. Maybe Adam Schiff read Article I and II of the Constitution, but maybe his version didn’t have Article III, which is the judicial branch. He forgot about that one. But they don’t have a case.

How can we make them angry?” To the Democrats, they believe that black Americans are stupid, so, absent any facts, if they dangle the term “Civil Rights Movement,” if they liken something to the Civil Rights Movement, if they call somebody or smear somebody as racist, the job of us is we’re supposed to jump up, be really angry, and run into a burning house to save their party. That is exactly how the Democrats view black America, and it is so obvious when these people invoke imagery from the civil rights era, I mean, to add credence to their bogus impeachment, and they do not take the black voter bloc seriously.

Obama, when he campaign in 2008, said, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA. I'm going to do it. He's a bright star, incredible campaigner and incredible politician. In eight years, couldn't get it done. This guy gets it done in about a year and a half, and the Democrats sit on it for a year."

They got the South Korean free trade deal. And now they're going to have a new deal with England. That's going to be the next big deal and Japan. That's all good for blue collar America. Speaking of blue collar workers, though, Joe Biden, I think won the award tonight for the worst response to a debate question. And there was some competition. Take a look."
