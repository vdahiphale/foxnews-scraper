      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Nineteen are dead, around 50 injured during an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Police are currently treating this incident as an act of terrorism and they are expected to hold a news conference this hour. Authorities are advising people to avoid the area around the arena, and the train station that is nearby is also closed. Concertgoers describe hearing a loud explosion or explosions as the event ended, causing a massive panic. And one eyewitness is saying that he saw people lying on the ground covered in blood.  New video appears to capture sound of this blast. Listen.  Joining us now on the ground via the phone is Daily Mail reporter Jake Wallis Simon is with us. Sir, how are you? Welcome to the program. Can you tell us the latest?  JAKE WALLIS SIMONS, DAILY MAIL (via telephone): Well, the latest is, you know, on the ground that 19 people have been confirmed dead and 50 people have been confirmed injured. This is a very, very high death toll indeed. We haven't seen an attack this bad in The United kingdom since 2005, 12 years ago, when 52 people were killed in a coordinated spate of suicide bombings across London. Now, this evening at the moment, things are calm here at the scene. There's a sense that things are more under control. There's almost an eerie feeling in the air because you just know how much suffering is going on behind closed doors here. In the Manchester Royal Infirmary, the hospital just a mile away from the scene here, and also in various hotels around about the scene...",

Currently, we have 19 people confirmed to have lost their lives in the explosion and around 50 casualties that are being treated at six hospitals across greater Manchester. My thoughts are very much with those who have been injured and lost their lives and their loved ones at this terrible time.   We are doing all that we can to support them. Officers from Greater Manchester Police and emergency services are working at the scene and are supporting those affected. We are coordinating the operation here at Greater Manchester Police headquarters. An emergency number is available for all those concerned about their loved ones or anyone who may have been in the area. The number is 01-61-856-9400. We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we have further information. We are working closely with National Counterterrorism Policing Network and U.K. intelligence partners.   This is clearly a very concerning time for everyone. We're doing all that we can working with local and national agencies to support those affected as we gather information about what happened last night. As you will understand, we are still receiving information and updates so we'll provide further detail when we have a clearer picture. I want to thank people for their support and ask them to remain vigilant, and if they have any concerns at all, to report them to the National Anti-terrorist Hotline. The number is 0800-789-321. It is important also for people here in Manchester avoid the area around Manchester Arena so that emergency services can continue to effectively deal with the incident at that location.  Thank you very much.",

      "sentences": "It's kind of fascinating, that news conference, Sean, of what he didn't say, which was pretty much everything. I mean, we have confirmed a number of facts, and all he really did was confirm that it was 19 dead and 50 injured -- yes, 50 wounded. That number, of course, may change.  But what he did not talk about and what U.S. officials have already confirmed to a number of media outlets is that this was, in fact, a suicide bomber that hit this arena, outside the arena of the Ariana Grande concert. That was talked about early on because we knew as the hospital reports started coming in, they saw wounded people coming in with shrapnel wounds, specifically nail wounds. So they figured this was some type of nail bomb device. And U.S. officials through U.K. officials have, in fact, confirmed this was a suicide bomber.  What you played at the top of the show, Sean, is fascinating because that was the explosion that was heard on that dashcam video. And what nobody understood was how he was inside his car, the dashcam facing it, and yet you could still hear the explosion very loud that we thought it initially was inside the building. You had witnesses coming out. Some of them were injured. And they all felt like they heard something. Or in fact, they did hear something. They felt some things. But nobody saw anything. There was no smoke seen inside the arena. And then the reports started coming in that the explosion was in the foyer area, just outside in the hallway as people were exiting. And you had eyewitnesses saying that in that foyer area, they smelled smoke. They smelled kind of a gassy smell.  And then you had the arena officials coming out and saying that this was, in fact, outside the arena altogether, in the box office area that's between Victoria station and Manchester Arena.   For those who don't know the area, this is kind of one contiguous building. The train station kind of goes up into the arena. 21,000 people it seats. It's one of the biggest arenas in the U.K. And Ariana Grande among young people -- she is extraordinarily popular. This was packed, according to all accounts, with anywhere from 6-year-olds to 20-year-olds. That was the lion's share of the audience, mostly female. And if you look on line now, if you look on social media, you see these heartrending pictures of missing children, of parents and families already posting their pictures of missing children as young as 6 years old. Again, we won't show them because it's unconfirmed if they are missing or if of hotels in that area that have taken in children who do not have or did not have parents waiting to pick them up at the time. So there's a good possibility that some of them were in those hotels. And we should also point out that not only did the constable not talk about where the location of this attack was, there's been no at all of the breakdown on who was killed and who was injured, no ages given at all. We just know that one man who was probably the most -- the clearest eyewitness to date said that he was picking up his family, and he looked down the hallway and he saw a number of bodies lying there. And that's when the numbers started coming out, 19 dead, 50 wounded. And again, Sean, that might change.  But this is being looked at as terrorism right now, and it certainly has all the hallmarks, though there has been no call for responsibility as of yet -- Sean.",

As I said, the U.K. police are treating this event as a terrorist attack, a specific attack in this case that would be targeting children and young teenagers.   Joining us now, our reporter on the ground in Washington is our own Catherine Herridge, who has been in contact with our own Department of Homeland Security and has a report for us. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Thank you, Sean. A government official confirmed that the Homeland Security secretary John Kelly is monitoring the situation. He has been briefed. And we should expect a statement from the department in the very near future.  Government officials said they are working to assess what happened in Manchester, and they noted the following. They said if it is confirmed as terrorism, it is a level of sophistication beyond the recent U.K.-based plots that have involved knives and vehicles as weapons.  They also pointed to the reports of shrapnel as deeply concerning because this is another indicator of premeditation and a plot that may have been directed by a foreign terrorist organization. Also reports of the explosion at an exit -- that's another indicator suggesting premeditation. Also, a closed space amplifies the concussive effect of the explosion, disfiguring impact of shrapnel and also maximizing casualties. I asked them if there had been anything in the recent chatter. So this is the discussion through social media and in chat rooms amongst those who are sympathetic or followers of various terrorist groups. And they said it's been very steady among these Islamic terror cells. And the call has been to hit so-called soft targets, as well as civilians.   This person did not go as far as to talk about confirmation of a suicide bombing in this case, but just based on the open source media reports, it does suggest that's a strong possibility, Sean.",

I don't remember the exact number before he was killed. They rounded up 10 people in the plot, many of them from Manchester, from this middle-sized northern English town. It is -- it's horrifying.

And that was Barack Obama's apology tour and specifically the speech in Saudi Arabia that Donald Trump gave this weekend where he framed this fight against ISIS.   And I'm going to give you a couple of quotes here -- and other terror groups -- as a battle between good and between evil. \"A better future is only possible if your nations drive out terrorists and drive out extremists,\" he said. He said, \"Drive them out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. Drive them out of this earth.\"  And then he said \"deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil.\" And then he went on to say, \"It is a choice between two futures and it's a choice, this case, America cannot make for you. And he says, \"Our friends will never question our support. Our enemies will never doubt our determination. We are not here to lecture,\" and he goes on from there.

ISIS utilizes dates as significant. So it was just four years ago today. Could it be chance? Yes. Most likely, it's not. These are planned. The other thing is Geraldo said, the utilization of this type of device, which is reminiscent of what took place and has taken place in Israel, suicide bombers with the basically nails being shrapnel, has done unbelievable damage. They’ve confirmed already 19 dead and 50 injured. I mean, this is a serious, serious situation.  And then I'll take it a step further. What the president said is absolutely correct. And this means in the communities -- when he says in the places of worship, that means in the mosque! If someone is showing signs of radicalization, that community has an obligation at British citizens, or if they're in the United States, as Americans, to let authorities know. In the communities, if you see something, you've got to talk with the police, talk with Homeland Security, talk with the FBI.  The same thing is you're going to have to drive them out. This is -- this is good against evil, but Sean, look at the target here. The target here were young girls at a concert.

I think it's something when the nation awakes in the morning -- and don't forget, this news didn't really break until after midnight our time. I think the country's going to wake up and be very, very shocked indeed. The fact that it happened outside London will also surprise people because we kind of think of terrorist attacks, whether it's the bombings on the underground or whether it's Lee Rigby, who was killed four years ago today on a London street -- so they'll be surprised that it took place outside London, in our second city of Manchester.  And also the fact that it took place in public space. That's going to worry people even more because what do you do? You can check bags going into the venue. You can scan people.

They leave the U.K. They say they're teaching English in Afghanistan or English in the Middle East someplace, when really, they're fighting for ISIS.

The attack in Mosul, a suicide bomb attack from a many by -- from Manchester in Mosul just recently. What you have to watch -- and I think the key is when you see -- and kids that were usually in gangs or historically in gangs with guns and so forth are now becoming radical Islamists, and they use the jihad as the kind of context for their violence and their acting out.",

And I don't want to politicize this, but when you have eight years of the vacuum that was created, no wonder, as Geraldo said, these cell groups metastasized. They went out for training and then came back in.  I mean, des anyone want to argue tonight that we shouldn't have an executive order restricting who's coming into the country so that we know who these people are? I mean, does anybody think that tonight? Does anybody want to argue that case tonight that we should not know from these particular countries of origin who these people are before we let them into the United States of America? I'd like to take on that argument! But to the point you made -- this is a significant enough issue now globally. It's hitting everywhere. It's not just in the United States. It's not just in Europe. It is everywhere, that when you look at -- when the president says your places of worship, that means you got to go into the mosques and you got to root it out, into the communities, into those towns. If you see something, you go to report to the authorities. But Sean, it's going to have to also include the Muslim community willing to do this because what's happened in Europe -- it's been a failed experiment. They allowed in this population. They allowed in sharia law as to be part of almost -- part of the culture within these communities. And it's one thing to respect somebody's culture, but it's another thing to allow them to violate the laws of your country. And that's what's happened her. And we've got right now a situation where you've got an Islamitization of Europe that is significant. Obviously, we're seeing it in the U.K.. You're seeing it in France. You're seeing it in Germany. But let's not think we're not immune to it here in the United States because we're not immune to it. The plan from the Islamists -- I said this when I wrote that book some four years ago now, three years ago, \"Rise of ISIS,\" that this was the plan all along, to infiltrate and to inculcate these people and they'll do it to the youth. But here, as we've saying all night, they picked on young girls. That's who was the target of this concert, young girls.",

The wounds on the victims as reported from hospitals are shrapnel like wounds which would indicate that high temperature caused nails or whatever was in this bomb presumably to create what looks like shrapnel wounds on the victims. And then the authorities who arrived there were able to discern that in their estimations, this was a suicide bomber in the early going, according to U.S. official, and many reports here in the United States indicated to them that this may have been a suicide bomber.

Sean, I spoke with two people live on air tonight who said, well, I had my bag checked. One woman told me I had to throw out a bottle. It sounds like security was strong enough to where maybe security kept whoever this was outside and this person waited for people to come out. I spoke with person after person, Sean, who was a parent waiting for the kids to come out of there. And it was parents who saw the explosion or heard the explosion and ran in to get their kids with all these people injured and maimed around them.

Our own Catherine Herridge is now saying a government official said they are working to assess what happened in Manchester, and based on preliminary media reports, they are now noting in Great Britain if confirmed as terrorism, and again, the police are currently treating the incident as an act of terrorism. If confirmed, it is a level of sophistication beyond recent U.K. based plots involving knives and vehicles as weapons. And these reports of shrapnel that we've been talking about now are concerning and point to a premeditation and a plot that may have been directed by a foreign terrorist organization. And the explosion at the exit again shows the potential that there could have been much more carnage as a closed space amplifies the effect of the explosion and the disfiguring impact, in other words of the shrapnel, maximizing casualties, maximizing injuries, which shows the degree of sophistication and level of evil that we have been talking at length about tonight.

There's nothing inconsistent about going in and finding out who these people are, because you know what happens after these every single time? Every single time they will do a roundup of 20 people and find out who was the one that made this bomb. That happened on every one of these events. You have the terrorist attacks, then they have the roundup and they find the 10 or 12 people that were involved in some capacity. Why is it that we're not finding that on the front end? And that is because we are still in the west not really ready to recognize that this threat is at our front door. And it is. And because of that we've got to take, you want to call at extreme measures, call it whatever you want. I'll tell you what I think at the end of the day -- if we don't take this threat for what it is we pay the consequences. Unfortunately that happened to a bunch of people, at least 19 or 20 or more, in Manchester.

And then he said drive them out, drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land, and drive them out of this earth.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Nineteen are dead, around 50 injured during an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Police are currently treating this incident as an act of terrorism and they are expected to hold a news conference this hour. Authorities are advising people to avoid the area around the arena, and the train station that is nearby is also closed. Concertgoers describe hearing a loud explosion or explosions as the event ended, causing a massive panic. And one eyewitness is saying that he saw people lying on the ground covered in blood. New video appears to capture sound of this blast. Listen. Joining us now on the ground via the phone is Daily Mail reporter Jake Wallis Simon is with us. Sir, how are you? Welcome to the program. Can you tell us the latest?"

We haven't seen an attack this bad in The United kingdom since 2005, 12 years ago, when 52 people were killed in a coordinated spate of suicide bombings across London. Now, this evening at the moment, things are calm here at the scene. There's a sense that things are more under control. There's almost an eerie feeling in the air because you just know how much suffering is going on behind closed doors here. In the Manchester Royal Infirmary, the hospital just a mile away from the scene here, and also in various hotels around about the scene..."

Currently, we have 19 people confirmed to have lost their lives in the explosion and around 50 casualties that are being treated at six hospitals across greater Manchester. My thoughts are very much with those who have been injured and lost their lives and their loved ones at this terrible time. We are doing all that we can to support them. Officers from Greater Manchester Police and emergency services are working at the scene and are supporting those affected. We are coordinating the operation here at Greater Manchester Police headquarters. An emergency number is available for all those concerned about their loved ones or anyone who may have been in the area. The number is 01-61-856-9400. We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we have further information. We are working closely with National Counterterrorism Policing Network and U.K. intelligence partners. This is clearly a very concerning time for everyone. We're doing all that we can working with local and national agencies to support those affected as we gather information about what happened last night. As you will understand, we are still receiving information and updates so we'll provide further detail when we have a clearer picture. I want to thank people for their support and ask them to remain vigilant, and if they have any concerns at all, to report them to the National Anti-terrorist Hotline. The number is 0800-789-321. It is important also for people here in Manchester avoid the area around Manchester Arena so that emergency services can continue to effectively deal with the incident at that location. Thank you very much."

They gave out a number for people that are in Great Britain to call if they have any information that they can share with the police there. Joining is now with the very latest, our own Trace Gallagher. He's in our West Coast newsroom tonight -- Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "It's kind of fascinating, that news conference, Sean, of what he didn't say, which was pretty much everything. I mean, we have confirmed a number of facts, and all he really did was confirm that it was 19 dead and 50 injured -- yes, 50 wounded. That number, of course, may change. But what he did not talk about and what U.S. officials have already confirmed to a number of media outlets is that this was, in fact, a suicide bomber that hit this arena, outside the arena of the Ariana Grande concert. That was talked about early on because we knew as the hospital reports started coming in, they saw wounded people coming in with shrapnel wounds, specifically nail wounds. So they figured this was some type of nail bomb device. And U.S. officials through U.K. officials have, in fact, confirmed this was a suicide bomber. What you played at the top of the show, Sean, is fascinating because that was the explosion that was heard on that dashcam video. And what nobody understood was how he was inside his car, the dashcam facing it, and yet you could still hear the explosion very loud that we thought it initially was inside the building. You had witnesses coming out. Some of them were injured. And they all felt like they heard something. Or in fact, they did hear something. They felt some things. But nobody saw anything. There was no smoke seen inside the arena. And then the reports started coming in that the explosion was in the foyer area, just outside in the hallway as people were exiting. And you had eyewitnesses saying that in that foyer area, they smelled smoke. They smelled kind of a gassy smell. And then you had the arena officials coming out and saying that this was, in fact, outside the arena altogether, in the box office area that's between Victoria station and Manchester Arena. For those who don't know the area, this is kind of one contiguous building. The train station kind of goes up into the arena. 21,000 people it seats. It's one of the biggest arenas in the U.K. And Ariana Grande among young people -- she is extraordinarily popular. This was packed, according to all accounts, with anywhere from 6-year-olds to 20-year-olds. That was the lion's share of the audience, mostly female. And if you look on line now, if you look on social media, you see these heartrending pictures of missing children, of parents and families already posting their pictures of missing children as young as 6 years old. Again, we won't show them because it's unconfirmed if they are missing or if of hotels in that area that have taken in children who do not have or did not have parents waiting to pick them up at the time. So there's a good possibility that some of them were in those hotels. And we should also point out that not only did the constable not talk about where the location of this attack was, there's been no at all of the breakdown on who was killed and who was injured, no ages given at all. We just know that one man who was probably the most -- the clearest eyewitness to date said that he was picking up his family, and he looked down the hallway and he saw a number of bodies lying there. And that's when the numbers started coming out, 19 dead, 50 wounded. And again, Sean, that might change. But this is being looked at as terrorism right now, and it certainly has all the hallmarks, though there has been no call for responsibility as of yet -- Sean."

As I said, the U.K. police are treating this event as a terrorist attack, a specific attack in this case that would be targeting children and young teenagers. Joining us now, our reporter on the ground in Washington is our own Catherine Herridge, who has been in contact with our own Department of Homeland Security and has a report for us."

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (via telephone)",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Sean. A government official confirmed that the Homeland Security secretary John Kelly is monitoring the situation. He has been briefed. And we should expect a statement from the department in the very near future. Government officials said they are working to assess what happened in Manchester, and they noted the following. They said if it is confirmed as terrorism, it is a level of sophistication beyond the recent U.K.-based plots that have involved knives and vehicles as weapons. They also pointed to the reports of shrapnel as deeply concerning because this is another indicator of premeditation and a plot that may have been directed by a foreign terrorist organization. Also reports of the explosion at an exit -- that's another indicator suggesting premeditation. Also, a closed space amplifies the concussive effect of the explosion, disfiguring impact of shrapnel and also maximizing casualties. I asked them if there had been anything in the recent chatter. So this is the discussion through social media and in chat rooms amongst those who are sympathetic or followers of various terrorist groups. And they said it's been very steady among these Islamic terror cells. And the call has been to hit so-called soft targets, as well as civilians. This person did not go as far as to talk about confirmation of a suicide bombing in this case, but just based on the open source media reports, it does suggest that's a strong possibility, Sean."

It's something I will never forget. I pity those parents now, those who don't know what is happening to their youngsters. Ariana Grande, the former Disney star, clearly, her fans now middle teens, late teens. This was -- and most of them little girls. I mean, this takes a particular pervert, a real sickness that hatred is so vicious. You know, and I understand, though, from the Sky reporter that they haven't had a major mass murder on the terror scale, but it was only in March they had the -- the guy in Westminster palace in London mowing down people, killing five or six. I don't remember the exact number before he was killed. They rounded up 10 people in the plot, many of them from Manchester, from this middle-sized northern English town. It is -- it's horrifying. I saw a couple of tweets from groups purporting to be ISIS claiming credit. I don't know that that is confirmed yet, but this has all the hallmarks, particularly with the talk of a nail bomb..."

Jay, I want to go you, especially -- I had prepared a show tonight before this act of terror, as they are believing it is, in Great Britain and police are investigating it as such, about a tale of two presidents. And that was Barack Obama's apology tour and specifically the speech in Saudi Arabia that Donald Trump gave this weekend where he framed this fight against ISIS. And I'm going to give you a couple of quotes here -- and other terror groups -- as a battle between good and between evil. \"A better future is only possible if your nations drive out terrorists and drive out extremists,\" he said. He said, \"Drive them out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. Drive them out of this earth.\" And then he said \"deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil.\" And then he went on to say, \"It is a choice between two futures and it's a choice, this case, America cannot make for you. And he says, \"Our friends will never question our support. Our enemies will never doubt our determination. We are not here to lecture,\" and he goes on from there. I mean, if -- he understands the nature of this conflict, and this is the conflict that I believe, if the police are right, is on display here in England tonight!"

      "utterance": "No, that's absolutely correct. And Sean, it was four years ago today that that British soldier was hacked to death by two Islamic terrorists in southeast London. ISIS utilizes dates as significant. So it was just four years ago today. Could it be chance? Yes. Most likely, it's not. These are planned. The other thing is Geraldo said, the utilization of this type of device, which is reminiscent of what took place and has taken place in Israel, suicide bombers with the basically nails being shrapnel, has done unbelievable damage. They’ve confirmed already 19 dead and 50 injured. I mean, this is a serious, serious situation. And then I'll take it a step further. What the president said is absolutely correct. And this means in the communities -- when he says in the places of worship, that means in the mosque! If someone is showing signs of radicalization, that community has an obligation at British citizens, or if they're in the United States, as Americans, to let authorities know. In the communities, if you see something, you've got to talk with the police, talk with Homeland Security, talk with the FBI. The same thing is you're going to have to drive them out. This is -- this is good against evil, but Sean, look at the target here. The target here were young girls at a concert. These barbaric terrorists are convinced on doing one thing, one thing only, the destruction of Western civilization as we know it!"

I think it's something when the nation awakes in the morning -- and don't forget, this news didn't really break until after midnight our time. I think the country's going to wake up and be very, very shocked indeed. The fact that it happened outside London will also surprise people because we kind of think of terrorist attacks, whether it's the bombings on the underground or whether it's Lee Rigby, who was killed four years ago today on a London street -- so they'll be surprised that it took place outside London, in our second city of Manchester. And also the fact that it took place in public space. That's going to worry people even more because what do you do? You can check bags going into the venue. You can scan people. But clearly, the way this suicide bomber planned this was to be in a place where he simply couldn't be detected. And I have to say we are 16 days away from a general election in which open-door immigration and in which dealing with terrorism has to date not even been discussed. I think from tomorrow morning, it will be."

And I know he's taken great fire and heat for wanting to protect America's borders, and of course, vetting refugees from countries whose values they grew up with directly contradict our constitutional values. I called it a clash of cultures. If you grow up under sharia law, where men oppress women and gays and lesbians and Christians and Jews, we have a right to know if you want to bring those values with you, or if you want to assimilate into our societies. I've talked about the Islamization (sic) of Europe, and you have warned your friends here America that we are headed down the wrong path that you believe your country is headed down."

And it was one of the contributory factors to Brexit. I mean, I -- you know, we've got a problem in this country. I think the problem is even worse in France and in Belgium. And one of the reasons that I wanted to support Donald Trump and I still very much do support Donald Trump -- and by the way, I thought that speech that he gave in Saudi Arabia was tremendous. I mean, he looked like a global statesman giving that speech."

I've even said during the Obama years he was the only adult on the world stage that understood the nature of this evil. And now it's clear that this -- that -- that the prime minister now has a partner. And to target -- I mean, if you don't believe in evil, if you target children and young adults, I don't think there's anything more profoundly evil than that. And recognizing that truth and confronting it the way he did is so important, I believe, for the safety and security of good and free people around the world. And you're right, by allowing the Islamization (sic) of Europe and not checking people's backgrounds, once they get into Germany or France, they also get into the entire European continent."

We will now start to have a proper conversation about it. But my feeling is -- my feeling is that you in America have got a real opportunity not to make the same mistakes that so many countries in Europe have made. And I think you've got a leader. And yes, moral courage. You know, whatever people say about Donald Trump, you know, whatever way he might upset them sometimes, whatever fights he occasionally picks and you wonder why he did it, when it comes to the big stuff, Trump has got it absolutely right."

They leave the U.K. They say they're teaching English in Afghanistan or English in the Middle East someplace, when really, they're fighting for ISIS. They come back, they bring back these deadly skills, like the click that did that fatal mowing down of the folks in March near Westminster, where the British parliament -- native-born, Christian-born, converted to radical Islam. The attack in Mosul, a suicide bomb attack from a many by -- from Manchester in Mosul just recently. What you have to watch -- and I think the key is when you see -- and kids that were usually in gangs or historically in gangs with guns and so forth are now becoming radical Islamists, and they use the jihad as the kind of context for their violence and their acting out."

And I don't want to politicize this, but when you have eight years of the vacuum that was created, no wonder, as Geraldo said, these cell groups metastasized. They went out for training and then came back in. I mean, des anyone want to argue tonight that we shouldn't have an executive order restricting who's coming into the country so that we know who these people are? I mean, does anybody think that tonight? Does anybody want to argue that case tonight that we should not know from these particular countries of origin who these people are before we let them into the United States of America? I'd like to take on that argument! But to the point you made -- this is a significant enough issue now globally. It's hitting everywhere. It's not just in the United States. It's not just in Europe. It is everywhere, that when you look at -- when the president says your places of worship, that means you got to go into the mosques and you got to root it out, into the communities, into those towns. If you see something, you go to report to the authorities. But Sean, it's going to have to also include the Muslim community willing to do this because what's happened in Europe -- it's been a failed experiment. They allowed in this population. They allowed in sharia law as to be part of almost -- part of the culture within these communities. And it's one thing to respect somebody's culture, but it's another thing to allow them to violate the laws of your country. And that's what's happened her. And we've got right now a situation where you've got an Islamitization of Europe that is significant. Obviously, we're seeing it in the U.K.. You're seeing it in France. You're seeing it in Germany. But let's not think we're not immune to it here in the United States because we're not immune to it. The plan from the Islamists -- I said this when I wrote that book some four years ago now, three years ago, \"Rise of ISIS,\" that this was the plan all along, to infiltrate and to inculcate these people and they'll do it to the youth. But here, as we've saying all night, they picked on young girls. That's who was the target of this concert, young girls."

You know, all throughout human history -- I wrote a book in 2004 and the book was \"Deliver Us From Evil.\" And I did a study and a research on Stalin and the gulags and Russia and Nazism and fascism and the killing fields in Cambodia, and in the last century, Raheem, 100 million human souls killed by evil! This is evil in our time! And the two world leaders that are speaking out the loudest -- and he was alone for a long time -- were the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and now this weekend he has a president that has the same moral clarity as he does!"

And you only have to look through social media tonight, Sean, to see that there are anti-Trump people out there in the media and in the comedy sphere who are actually making light of this attack in Manchester, in my home country, in one of the largest cities in my home country. Here's the thing. We have to look at the indicators of this attack. We have to look at the style. We know the Islamic State has recommended to its soldiers around the world to use nail bombs, to use Molotov cocktails. We have to look at other indicators, such as populations around places like Manchester. And then I suggest we start looking up and down places like the United Kingdom all across Europe, as I recently did when I went on a tour of these infamous no-go zones, and look at what these Muslim populations are saying about the areas in which they are the majority. They are claiming that those are Muslim areas now. They're not shy about it. And what does the Quran say? It says that driving the infidels, driving the non-believers out of Muslim areas, violence is perfectly acceptable in that regard. So while we don't quite know yet -- we didn't hear much from the Greater Manchester Police earlier. While we don't quite know yet..."

With all due respect to the Saudis, where the president spoke this weekend, they have played both sides of the fence. They have treated women, they have killed -- horribly. They have killed gays and lesbians for no reason! They have persecuted Christians and Jews. And they are bigoted and they do not allow the free practice of religion or freedom of speech or equal rights to women, and what they do to gays and lesbians is evil in our time. They throw them off roofs and they hang them. Now, I want them to take on their radical elements, but they also need to modernize. And we've got to demand that from them, as well."

Within about three hours after the attack, various reports we get indicate that it's very clear that forensic experts -- speaking of, this is American officials quoting their British counterparts, it's very clear that to them at least in the early going that was a suicide bomber. The wounds on the victims as reported from hospitals are shrapnel like wounds which would indicate that high temperature caused nails or whatever was in this bomb presumably to create what looks like shrapnel wounds on the victims. And then the authorities who arrived there were able to discern that in their estimations, this was a suicide bomber in the early going, according to U.S. official, and many reports here in the United States indicated to them that this may have been a suicide bomber.

It could have been so much worse, especially when you're talking about 19 people killed and 50 injured here in the early going. But this from all reports right now is this person didn't actually get it. We don't know why. Was it possible that security services stopped them? Sean, I spoke with two people live on air tonight who said, well, I had my bag checked. One woman told me I had to throw out a bottle. It sounds like security was strong enough to where maybe security kept whoever this was outside and this person waited for people to come out. I spoke with person after person, Sean, who was a parent waiting for the kids to come out of there. And it was parents who saw the explosion or heard the explosion and ran in to get their kids with all these people injured and maimed around them. And just so thankful I think so many of them were that thisexplosion did not happen inside. There's nothing good from this, certainly. The only good thing might be is that this person wasn't inside amid tightly packed concert going. As you know, Sean, many of the age of your own children.

The individual or the team, the unit who perpetrated this horrible acts are really acting as a group that wants genocidal results, that these are killing, mass killing children. This tells me that the ideology behind it and the movement behind it, because this is not just an individual. This has been organized and been inspired by others, is an ideology and a movement who knows that now after Riyadh, after that address in Riyadh there is a rise of a worldwide coalition.

And Walid, there's one other thing that President Trump said in Saudi Arabia. He said terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. Your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned.

These are the troops that we need in Syria, in Iraq, and maybe in Yemen and in Libya. But beyond that what is important is that for them to wage an ideological war. This is where we need them. Yes, they launched this center of counter extremism, but they need to do more, to spend more on these issues, because the network we are facing is not just in the Middle East.

And understand he did this in front of 50 leaders from Muslim countries that understand the nature of the threat as well. So this was historic not just from perception but reality because what the president did was issue a clarion call. And that call was we cannot tolerate this, and you, the Muslim world, have to engage this. You have to engage it at the most serious of levels. In your community, in your worship centers, that's what this has to go. The horrific nature of this event in Manchester, England, should be sending a message to the rest of the world, though, because we had this in the United States. Remember this, they're looking for those soft targets. Remember the airport incident in Fort Lauderdale? Remember that it was in the baggage claim area. The person went off, got the weapon and came back in. We have to recognize now there is no such thing as a safe zone. And we have to govern ourselves accordingly, which means our security apparatuses, our intelligence gathering has to be utilized at the most sophisticated level.

They have targeted today innocent children, women, a lot of young people. We cannot tolerate this kind of act. All over Europe you have seen again and again a series of terror attacks on European soil. This cannot become the new normal for Europe. We have to acknowledge. We are at war against the Islamists.

Our own Catherine Herridge is now saying a government official said they are working to assess what happened in Manchester, and based on preliminary media reports, they are now noting in Great Britain if confirmed as terrorism, and again, the police are currently treating the incident as an act of terrorism. If confirmed, it is a level of sophistication beyond recent U.K. based plots involving knives and vehicles as weapons. And these reports of shrapnel that we've been talking about now are concerning and point to a premeditation and a plot that may have been directed by a foreign terrorist organization. And the explosion at the exit again shows the potential that there could have been much more carnage as a closed space amplifies the effect of the explosion and the disfiguring impact, in other words of the shrapnel, maximizing casualties, maximizing injuries, which shows the degree of sophistication and level of evil that we have been talking at length about tonight. Jay, you wanted to weigh in at length?"

And the fact that in a free society, how do you prevent a guy, a terrorist, from doing that? But I want to go a step further, and this was just mentioned by one of the others, and that is you've got to go into these communities and rat this out. And that means real surveillance. And I know that the left is going to be screaming civil liberties. There's nothing inconsistent about going in and finding out who these people are, because you know what happens after these every single time? Every single time they will do a roundup of 20 people and find out who was the one that made this bomb. That happened on every one of these events. You have the terrorist attacks, then they have the roundup and they find the 10 or 12 people that were involved in some capacity. Why is it that we're not finding that on the front end? And that is because we are still in the west not really ready to recognize that this threat is at our front door. And it is. And because of that we've got to take, you want to call at extreme measures, call it whatever you want. I'll tell you what I think at the end of the day -- if we don't take this threat for what it is we pay the consequences. Unfortunately that happened to a bunch of people, at least 19 or 20 or more, in Manchester. And, by the way, you've got to understand the scope and nature of that device, that in an outdoor area they were able to kill or wound 80 or 90 people. From one device, if that's what it is, yes, it's a new level of sophistication. But let's round them up before, not after."

I don't know how many have returned to the United States of America. But the people that have returned from ISIS training to come back with these savage skills, they told their family allegedly they were teaching in Afghanistan. They were doing some other benign task in some foreign country. Those families had to know. They had to suspect. If you have your own 22-year-old or 25-year-old and he tells you he's teaching in Afghanistan, don't you want to see a postcard from Afghanistan, a souvenir from Afghanistan? Were you really in Afghanistan? Does the mom know you were in Afghanistan teaching, or were you really in Syria or Iraq learning from ISIS how to commit mayhem and mass murder using easily obtainable chemicals from a hardware store and nail from the hardware store and so forth?

But what is so sad about this attack and what is so concerning is that they were prepared for them in London. The British authorities were monitoring, thinking we have to be careful in London. We have to be prepared. But they were not prepared in Manchester, which shows you that the terrorists have become so sophisticated that they chose a location where it was the last place that the authorities and the police are going to be monitoring. And that is a concert for young girls, as young as six and seven years old, and as old as 20. So they were able to do such an attack without any care about girls. And what is shocking as I heard some of the British authorities saying we were shocked that they would do this. I don't know why they would do this. It's like, why do we even ask after 16 years, after 9/11 we still ask when we see ISIS people training children to behead people, raping young girls, kidnapping young Yazidis and torturing them, this is not a surprise."

One of the great evils of radical Islam and Sharia law, Brigitte, is the treatment of women and the abuse of women. And we mentioned earlier, gays and lesbians killed. We mentioned earlier the mistreatment and the lack of tolerance for freedom of religion and the persecution of Christians and Jews. There's a big story that we have covered on this program, and I covered it extensively on my radio program, there is a modern day genocide against Christians and a purging of Christians and Yazidis in Iraq and around the world, and a purging that very few people have time to cover, like CNN or NBC, because they're so busy advancing a theory about collusion with no evidence whatsoever about Donald Trump."

We are now seeing a rise of FGM, female genital mutilation, honor killings, sexual assault committed by refugees against American women, and this is happening here in America. Look in just a couple of weeks, we're going to have the remembrance of the attack on the Orlando nightclub where young Americans are having a good time on a weekend. This is something that the American public needs to pay attention to. And we are fortunate that we are way ahead of Europe. At least we have learned from what happened in Europe, and we are mobilizing here in America. And I want to bring to the attention of our listeners that there are marches nationwide in America on June 10th, a march against Sharia and a march for human rights to bring attention to the treatment of women under Sharia, the treatment of young girls. We want to protect women. The treatment of gays, for those interesting you can go for information at ActforAmerica.org. We now have 24 cities scheduled in 20 states. This is an issue that the American public watching the news tonight needs to be aware of and needs to be involved in stopping this from coming to our country."

I got a tweet from the U.K., \"Manchester Muslim doctors working through the night, Manchester Muslim taxi drivers taking people home for free. You don't know Manchester.\" That's a tragedy of this. That's the tragedy of radical Islamist terrorism. So many people in the community who just want to get along, who just want the best for their children and want what everybody else wants."

I am so sorry. I don't have words.\" Obviously nobody holds her accountable. These are young -- even preteenagers. My daughter likes Ariana Grande. Her friends like her. Teenage girls like here. And that just adds a level of evil. I actually think that what we've got to do, Jay Sekulow, I'll go to you, we have got to look at what has happened in Israel and the level of attacks and the pure evil as what Prime Minister Netanyahu said to me about America, a preview of coming attractions."

But look, we are a lot bigger territory and we're a lot bigger target in that sense. But the prime minister is absolutely correct. The tragedy of all of this is, and I was thinking about what you just said, Geraldo, with the Muslim cabdrivers and the Muslim doctors working all night, I don't doubt that at all. But you have 10 percent of your community radicalized. That's a lot of people."

Terrorists don't worship God, they worshiped death. And then he said drive them out, drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land, and drive them out of this earth. That's a good way to end on the program. That's all the time we have left. Stay tuned for our continuing coverage. Our friend Shepard Smith is next. We'll see you back here tomorrow night."
