What you need to know about the promise and the pitfalls, and CNN's bizarre anti-hydroxy obsession called out by one of the nation's top epidemiologist. Dr. Harvey Risch is back tonight to respond. Also, the Wall of Moms in Portland; doesn't it sound so sweet? Almost nurturing, but what's the truth behind the media's newest heroines? Mollie Hemingway and Lara Logan reveal.  And Biden and Obama are reunited, oh, and it felt so good. You know the song. Well, we're going to tell you why it's necessary. Raymond Arroyo brings us revelations in Seen and Unseen.  But first, Joe's care package. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Tonight, we're about 15 weeks out from the 2020 election, if you can believe it. And the last few days have revealed the candidates' starkly different approaches to leadership. Now, each one has tried to improve his standing on the economy and/or COVID. Now, when Biden though emerges from his comfy basement, he often is just shuffling upstairs to a camera near his French doors with a bucolic scene framing the shot. Yesterday, he tried to show us that he'd be more hands-on regarding the pandemic, offering never before heard solutions like appoint a commanding COVID officer or he'd help small businesses.  Oh wait, didn't Trump already do that? Try again, Joe. Well, of course we know, regardless of what he says, the only big thing that poor old Joe would do differently are the lockdowns. In other words, he would mandate a national shelter in place order, which of course would push us toward a socialist cliff and over time, it would end up killing more people than it would save. But of course, he had to start his attempt at relevancy with a shot at the Trump economy.",

The entire country benefits from how cases are handled at the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland, not just the few citizens of Portland. And so even if the Portland mayor wants to allow mobs to control his city, it still is of concern to the rest of the country.

Just hours after the State Department ordered that consulate to close down, employees there began burning paperwork in an obvious attempt to hide their efforts.

Also, the Wall of Moms in Portland; doesn't it sound so sweet? Almost nurturing, but what's the truth behind the media's newest heroines? Mollie Hemingway and Lara Logan reveal. And Biden and Obama are reunited, oh, and it felt so good. You know the song. Well, we're going to tell you why it's necessary. Raymond Arroyo brings us revelations in Seen and Unseen. But first, Joe's care package. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Tonight, we're about 15 weeks out from the 2020 election, if you can believe it. And the last few days have revealed the candidates' starkly different approaches to leadership. Now, each one has tried to improve his standing on the economy and/or COVID. Now, when Biden though emerges from his comfy basement, he often is just shuffling upstairs to a camera near his French doors with a bucolic scene framing the shot. Yesterday, he tried to show us that he'd be more hands-on regarding the pandemic, offering never before heard solutions like appoint a commanding COVID officer or he'd help small businesses. Oh wait, didn't Trump already do that? Try again, Joe. Well, of course we know, regardless of what he says, the only big thing that poor old Joe would do differently are the lockdowns. In other words, he would mandate a national shelter in place order, which of course would push us toward a socialist cliff and over time, it would end up killing more people than it would save. But of course, he had to start his attempt at relevancy with a shot at the Trump economy."

It's a movement that believes the founders were evil, capitalism is evil, the constitution is evil, most Americans are racists, and that's evil; you get my drift. But we are supposed to believe that the only guy is sweet, old Joe Biden who can save us. Are we supposed to believe now that Obama, he wasn't as talented as Joe is now?

We locked down this country and never thought of the ramifications in terms of undiagnosed cancers and other issues and the effect on the economy. I think the same thing is true for not having in-person schooling. It's critical that these kids go to school five days a week. They're at low risk and without it, there are going to be clearly, and we have seen this scientifically shown with the SARS epidemic, clearly implications for severe social distancing of children and not having in-person schools.  INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, as always, we really appreciate your insight tonight."

      "utterance": "Joining me now is an epidemiologist, Dr. Harvey Risch, Professor of Epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Risch, who is really doing the disservice to the American people? Doctors with decades of experience like yourself or the treating physicians on COVID, or CNN hosts who think that hydroxy is so dangerous that we shouldn't even talk about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. HARVEY RISCH, PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Laura. That's a little funny that we shouldn't talk about anything. This is a drug that's been used for 65-plus years in billions of doses around the world that people take without even thinking about it. And suddenly it's become dangerous; that's ludicrous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The idea that has been floated by yours truly and a few others of giving hydroxychloroquine to those essential workers who want it before they go back to work and a prophylactic dose Dr. Risch, we have some favorable studies on prophylactic use of the drug. What about that? To give people a peace of mind, and where is the FDA on revoking its emergency warning about hydroxy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "So those are two questions. The first one, there is evidence to show that prophylactic use is at lower doses than treating doses are still beneficial. It's not as strong as the evidence for successful treatment with the drug but still there is evidence for that. One shouldn't be overly confident by taking prophylactic doses that you won't get it, it's still possible, but there is still the possibility of treatments regardless. As to the FDA, I'm hoping that the FDA will in fact change its mind. It will re-evaluate all the evidence that it has and update the evidence and see that there is room for changing its position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, it's just amazing that we have CNN anchors out there proclaiming on this drug as if they reviewed all the peer-reviewed studies on this. It does such a disservice to people and this has been going on for months and I haven't dropped it because I actually know the science on this, I think pretty well at this point. Dr. Risch, this is what Dr. Fauci said today about the end of the pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Dr. Risch, your reaction to that, is this why therapeutics are so much more important in the short term?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "Well, in the short term, yes. I think that it's hard to predict its ultimate sequence - events, but it's possible that it may circulate like influenza where it's seasonal, eventually that it's better in the Southern hemisphere in our winter - in our summer and comes back in our winter. It's hard to know. And I think that once we have a handle on treatment, then it won't matter so much because the treatment is so very effective."

This, this really took the cake. It's kind of a microcosm of the media's coverage from Portland and other cities; pay no attention. Everything's peaceful, happy, and even homespun."

And that's understandable because they know the violence is at odds with their own agenda. That you see so many other people like in the media going along with that is very disturbing. And likewise, this approach of taking your most sympathetic members and putting them as the face of what's going on, this is very common tactic in paramilitary organizations to do that, hide your weaponry in schools or hospitals and whatnot.

      "speaker": "LARA LOGAN, HOST, FOX NATION",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Laura, I take their word for it, right? Because this woman is not the only one to say that. They say it every single day, all over the internet on thousands of sites. They also have sprayed it all over the walls of the cities where there have been riots, all Democrat controlled cities, by the way. And I say that because it's very significant that these riots are taking place in areas that are where the Democrats can control the messaging. Why? Because when you bring in federal agents, you upset all of that. Now, you don't just have local district attorneys. You're bringing in Assistant U.S. attorneys are coming with those federal agents. The people on the ground who are committing crimes, they can't just be released from prison because now they're being charged with federal crimes. They're facing much more significant charges and longer sentences, and it's also showing how effective local law enforcement and federal law enforcement can be when working together. All of which is outside the control of city officials who --I've been talking to people on the ground in some of these places. And they're just saying that they're tired of being ignored, that there's a group of radicals and a small group who have taken over the city councils, who've taken over the messaging and who are out there on the streets. And they don't represent everyone in these cities. It's not true that everyone in Portland feels this way. But the media isn't even talking to these people and what you're talking about with the moms, this is why I love Mollie, right? Because she's so right. These are deception tactics. They're being used. This is an information war. And they have been trying to say that federal authorities are being misused or overused, painting The President in their strategic messaging as some kind of dictator. And that's because they don't want this tactic being used because it's effective."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Let me jump on what you just said there because the rioters are portrayed as the new freedom writers. They're not writers; they're freedom writers. And then the police, any law enforcement, especially federal law enforcement are being demonized including by Joy Reid. Watch."
    },

      "speaker": "REID",

There's a secret police aspect of it. These federal secret police. The deploying of secret police. It's a secret police sort to vibe. Using his own secret police."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The former attorney general there, that's just embarrassing. Mollie, secret police that happen to have clearly marked uniforms that are protecting federal property. Boy, the tables are turned here. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's not just that they are clearly marked as police or that they have identifying badges on them. But also, when people are attacking federal courthouses, that is a federal concern. When they are going after federal personnel as they did the Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C., that's a federal concern. And there is actually an obligation to restore law and order. The entire country benefits from how cases are handled at the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland, not just the few citizens of Portland. And so even if the Portland mayor wants to allow mobs to control his city, it still is of concern to the rest of the country. And ideally, cities would be handling these issues better on their own and there would be no need for any federal law enforcement agents to have to risk their lives because the mob has gotten out of control. But when cities don't handle their own business and states don't handle their own business, there is a role for the federal government to play, and in fact, not just a role, but an obligation."

They know exactly what they are doing. They are special operations level inside the Border Patrol. When they're deployed like this, they have markings. They have \"Police\" on the front of their vests, they have it on the back. On both of their arms they have both the Border Patrol patches and the BORTAC patches. And just because local officials and journalists and idiots on the streets there who are rioting, they can't look up what that patch means and they don't know who these people are, doesn't mean that they haven't been identified.

So the real ramifications, physical safety, physical health and well-being, on top of all of the demonization that's going on here. Ladies, phenomenal analysis, as always. Thank you so much.

According to the latest Zogby poll, only 77 percent of black voters support Biden right now. So he needs Obama to make up that difference and more. Also, the Obama/Biden meet up may be a smokescreen, Laura, to hide the fact that today it was revealed the Biden and Sanders camps have submitted proposals to update the Democratic Party platform. They want to decrease spending on national defense, emphasize police brutality and climate change, propose an end to forever wars -- I thought Trump did that -- and a national proposal to study slave reparations. If that was your agenda, you'd be sitting across from Obama too, Laura."

He just had the solutions but he was hiding them from him?"

Yet we see example after example of politicians, finance execs, and foreign relations experts acting as surrogates basically for the CCP. Now, take the issue of the coronavirus.

Just hours after the State Department ordered that consulate to close down, employees there began burning paperwork in an obvious attempt to hide their efforts. So how do those apologists for China feel now? Remember their names. Remember the words of appeasement toward our greatest foe.
