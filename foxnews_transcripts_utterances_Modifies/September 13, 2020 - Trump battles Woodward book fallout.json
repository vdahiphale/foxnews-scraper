And they were able to come back to this whole question of Coronavirus and relitigate March and April, which is not something I think that the Trump campaign or administration is terribly excited about doing. I think the fact you saw the president telling Bob Woodward in February that this was airborne, very transmissible, much more deadly than the flu. And then he's tweeting about a month later with comparisons to an average flu season, you know, that is a problem for the White House and for the president. And what he says on tape, I would like to downplay it to not cause a panic. And the press secretary says the president never downplayed what was happening. That's a disconnect as well. You can call it a lie. You can call it spin.

So what we're getting here is what looks like outright lying. We've gotten that before. The Washington Post has counted up how many thousands of exaggerations.

It's not going to hurt you. But it's going to come out in the book. I don't know exactly what the timeline was of this.

He told the Washington Post he need more time both to put the president's comments in context and make sure that they were accurate.  So for example, he found out later that -- or days earlier before that February 7th conversation. National security officials had gone to the president and said this is the most serious crisis you'll face in your presidency.

Bob Woodward didn't necessarily know in January or in March what we know today, because scientists at the CDC on the president's Coronavirus task force themselves didn't have a clear picture of the virus at that time. So it's never OK for an American president to lie to the American people about anything. I'm not saying that's what President Trump did here. That's for others to decide. But what I will say is that everybody agrees that the messaging coming from the administration was not clear at that time. In many respects, it's still muddled today.   So the idea that President Trump was presenting one very clear picture to Bob Woodward behind the scenes, and then one very clear picture to the American people writ at large and they directly contradicted one another is an exaggeration.",

Officials tend to be more candid when it's a longer term project, whether you have a strict understanding or not, that's just a fact of life. But let me ask you, Clarence, because as long as I have followed Woodward's career, and as long as I have known him, he has taken a just the facts approach to these books from Nixon to Obama. I can remember him telling me my writing style is fact A, fact B, fact C. In this book, he flatly comes out and says Trump is the wrong man for the job.

There was no written agreement, simply said that it was going to hold off on reporting anything until after the book came out.

If Woodward is now basically joining the resistance in his own mind, holding off on some of this information and detonating it sort of as a September surprise.

Do I think that they have the same antagonistic relationship with Joe Biden that they do with Donald Trump? Absolutely not. But Joe Biden has never called the press the enemy of the people. He has never pointed at someone in the crowd and said fake news. He has never said to his supporters, look over there, it is where the fake news people are. So it makes sense that they don't have as antagonistic of a relationship with them because he doesn't hate them and he knows what purpose they serve as support of the state.",

Look, this overall firestorm is Christmas in September for the media, right? They were able to turn away from issues that were less comfortable for them like rioting in the streets when it comes to their goal of electing Joe Biden. And they were able to come back to this whole question of Coronavirus and relitigate March and April, which is not something I think that the Trump campaign or administration is terribly excited about doing. I think the fact you saw the president telling Bob Woodward in February that this was airborne, very transmissible, much more deadly than the flu. And then he's tweeting about a month later with comparisons to an average flu season, you know, that is a problem for the White House and for the president. And what he says on tape, I would like to downplay it to not cause a panic. And the press secretary says the president never downplayed what was happening. That's a disconnect as well. You can call it a lie. You can call it spin. I think it's not helpful at all to the re-election campaign, certainly of the president, although I think some of the criticism is probably also over-hyped, and people are definitely pouncing on this for their various reasons."

And so in this book, there are some background interviews to be sure, classic Woodward style. But Jared Kushner speaks quite openly. And 17 of the 18 interviews with the president are taped, on the record. So why is Woodward getting heat and getting blamed for what the president said to him?"

    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, the president has said unequivocally that he now believes Woodward's book is a, quote, \"political hit job.\" It begs the question how something can be perceived as a hit job when entire transcripts on the record are released in full, accompanied by recordings. That said, Howie, you know that in my past life, I worked in the government. At the White House, in the Bush and Obama administrations. And if I had a dollar for every policy maker who was upset with Bob Woodward about something he chose to report about them or when, I would be a very rich woman. I think it's a hallmark of really good investigative journalism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Woodward has been doing this through many, many administrations, going back to Richard Nixon of course. So Clarence Page, the television obviously is now replaying again and again and again early clips of the president saying the virus is under control. It is like the flu. It will miraculously disappear. But he has also said in the past that he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. And he didn't want to cause a panic. So how much of these quotes to Woodward are that surprising?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLARENCE PAGE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Well, only surprising in regard to the stark contrast between the president telling Woodward this is a very serious issue, a very serious problem that threatens many lives in America, and then next day going out telling the TV cameras, the public, you know, this is all going to go away. I mean, President Trump doesn't do nuance well. We know that. That's not news. So it's hard for him to play something down one day and then play it up the next and vice versa. So what we're getting here is what looks like outright lying. We've gotten that before. The Washington Post has counted up how many thousands of exaggerations. And we know he's also a salesman at heart. And a politician who formerly was a salesman for -- as a profession, and he thinks he can persuade anybody in an interview. So that's why he wanted to talk to Woodward."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

By the way, some news organizations pushing back on the no panic defense by noting that the president sometimes stirs up passions and other issues, for example, the campaign just put out something called Antifa alert. They'll attack your homes if Joe is elected, Joe Biden of course. Guy Benson, let me come back to you on this. Another sound bite from the president this week, sort of a mounting a defense, and it taps into something that media critics have been hurling at Woodward, which is how could you sit on this explosive information and save it for a book. Here's the president."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it depends on what the situation was or the agreement was for the terms of these conversations. My understanding is how Woodward often works with these things is he grants his subjects, in this case the president, all sorts of access. And the access flows obviously both ways. But the agreement is, well, we're going to embargo some of this stuff for a while so you can speak candidly to me now. I'm not going to report it right now for political reasons. It's not going to hurt you. But it's going to come out in the book. I don't know exactly what the timeline was of this. I'm sort of shocked that Trump would agree to any sort of embargo being lifted before the election, unless he thought this book was going to help him, which is what Woodward books typically don't do for politicians involved. So I think that I need more information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. Let me move on. Let's -- we're a little short on time, so let's try to be tight in our responses. Look, Gillian, Woodward said there was no absolute embargo but there was an explicit understanding. He told the Washington Post he need more time both to put the president's comments in context and make sure that they were accurate. So for example, he found out later that -- or days earlier before that February 7th conversation. National security officials had gone to the president and said this is the most serious crisis you'll face in your presidency. So that was Woodward's argument for why he held these things for the book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "There is always the very important element of context, which sometimes we lose when we look at these headlines sort of a snapshot today, right now. Bob Woodward didn't necessarily know in January or in March what we know today, because scientists at the CDC on the president's Coronavirus task force themselves didn't have a clear picture of the virus at that time. So it's never OK for an American president to lie to the American people about anything. I'm not saying that's what President Trump did here. That's for others to decide. But what I will say is that everybody agrees that the messaging coming from the administration was not clear at that time. In many respects, it's still muddled today. So the idea that President Trump was presenting one very clear picture to Bob Woodward behind the scenes, and then one very clear picture to the American people writ at large and they directly contradicted one another is an exaggeration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, having worked with Bob Woodward years ago. And as the author six books myself, I can tell you that President Trump wouldn't have said these things to Woodward if he thought it was going in the paper the next day, the next week. Officials tend to be more candid when it's a longer term project, whether you have a strict understanding or not, that's just a fact of life. But let me ask you, Clarence, because as long as I have followed Woodward's career, and as long as I have known him, he has taken a just the facts approach to these books from Nixon to Obama. I can remember him telling me my writing style is fact A, fact B, fact C. In this book, he flatly comes out and says Trump is the wrong man for the job. Doesn't that open him up to charges that two months before the election, he's become part of the resistance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Look, the idea of a journalist having an opinion in a book that is partly interpreted, it's hardly a scandal. And also, Howard, you know very well, in past election campaigns, Newsweek in particular, had -- has covered campaigns from the inside with the promise of they're not going to reveal anything until after election day. And Newsweek is not alone with that. I think what Bob Woodward was doing here, he wanted to -- he told President Trump and the Washington Post has written about this too, what Woodward's deal was. There was no written agreement, simply said that it was going to hold off on reporting anything until after the book came out. And that was something that I think caused President Trump to be more candid than perhaps he would have if he had thought about it in more detail. But it wasn't --"
    },

      "utterance": "Let me bring Guy back. Bob Woodward is 77 years old. He may have just been saying, look, I have done all these interviews and I'm entitled to give my opinion.

And then you start to -- to my previous answer, say OK, maybe there were embargoes, what was actually going on. If Woodward is now basically joining the resistance in his own mind, holding off on some of this information and detonating it sort of as a September surprise. Of course, the president -- this is self inflicted for him in some ways, certainly. But the timing of it and the withholding of the information if he really thought lives were at stake back then. I think that is a legitimate and fair thing to raise."

Before we go, Gillian, New York Times and Washington Post confirming today a story in Politico that political appointees at HHS have pressured the CDC to either delay, change, or in some cases kill Coronavirus reports that are given to other health experts throughout the government.

The problem is you're not supposed to do that, because the reality is -- I'm probably in the minorities now today of journalists who believe that there is some information out there that transcends politics.

And whether President Trump likes it or not, it's a defining issue of his presidency, that he has not brought the races together as much as he's helped put them further apart. But his answer about denying that white privilege exists, I'm not going to get into an argument about whether it does or not. I'm of the same age of these two guys. And I can remember Jim Crowe's segregation and the impact it continues to have on our society. What's important here is President Trump is speaking to and for a large portion of his base that believes white privilege is a myth. I don't have it. My family came over here from Europe on a boat and we worked our way up. You know, forget all of the institutionalized discrimination of labor unions, et cetera, housing, et cetera, that black folks have been through.

I think it's completely fair for someone who looks like me to recognize that white people have been in a position of privilege throughout this nation's history. And that's something to keep in mind when you're interacting with other people. But that's not necessarily cause for all sorts of self flagellation or this notion that white people -- their opinions count less now, or it's time for us to shut up.

I think it's highly unusual, statistically speaking, for a president to that brazenly sort of accuse or imply that his top generals have some kind of association with the for-profit military industrial complex. He's getting a lot of flak for that. But in a sense, it's unsurprising that he said this.

Zucker crossed the line by offering advice. You know what you should do. Whoever is around him today should just be calling him a con man all day so he's used to it. So when he hears it from Rubio, it doesn't matter. Hey, con man. Hey, con man. Hey, con man. Hey, con man. Hey, con man. Hey, con man. Zucker who helped Trump create the Apprentice back when he ran NBC was wary of contacting him directly. As fond as I am of the boss, he also has a tendency, like, you know, if I call him or I e-mail him, he is then capable of going out at his next rally and saying that we just talked. And I can't have that, if you know what I'm saying. I have all these proposals for him like I want to do a weekly show with him and all this stuff. Talking about a weekly show with a presidential candidate? CNN which did not respond to a request for comment is about roughly a zillion times more negative toward Trump than in those early days.

I wonder why the media is not leaning on Dr. Fauci's statement anymore. Look at what the president did very quickly. He first talked about the virus in his State of the Union Address back in January. It was February and Democrats were still attacking the president. Nancy Pelosi was wondering around Chinatown telling people not to worry. John Biden was saying not to panic. The president was actually enacting travel restrictions from China, probably saving thousands if not millions, acting early, taking that decisive action. I don't think it's out of the ordinary that a president wouldn't want everyone to panic.

So I don't think there's a direct comparison there. I'm perfectly happy for people like Jay Tapper to push Biden about his NAFTA record. I honestly think it's better for Democrats to be in a position where we can acknowledge things that are good like the USMCA, who had Sherrod Brown, one of our great economic populist and proponent of labor on the democratic side in support of it and say this is a good policy and this is how I can build on it."

So I just can't buy into that argument about it. I think that the mainstream media does have a lot of liberals working for them. Do I think that they have the same antagonistic relationship with Joe Biden that they do with Donald Trump? Absolutely not. But Joe Biden has never called the press the enemy of the people. He has never pointed at someone in the crowd and said fake news. He has never said to his supporters, look over there, it is where the fake news people are. So it makes sense that they don't have as antagonistic of a relationship with them because he doesn't hate them and he knows what purpose they serve as support of the state."

His own vice president pushed him on his bussing record. Remember when Kamala Harris stood up there and said that little girl was me. He has had to talk about his vote on the crime bill. He has had to talk about that he previously wasn't in favor of same sex marriage and how he evolved to be the ultimate champion of that and to push it through the Supreme Court in 2015.

      "utterance": "All right. Well, I hope the former V.P. does more television interviews. One last sound bite for you aired last night on Jeanine Pirro's show. They were talking about what they saw as Biden's uneven debate performances in the democratic debates. Let's roll it."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I think there's probably -- possibly drugs involved. That's what I hear. I mean, there's possibly drugs. I don't know how you can go from being so bad where you can't even get out of a sentence."

      "utterance": "What is your take on the president throwing out this charge of possible drug use by Biden without any evidence?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Oh, he's speaking to his base of conspiracy theorists that are going to run around the internet saying that Joe Biden is on drugs. They did this with Hillary Clinton, as well, where they said that she had Parkinson's disease. He's a fearmonger. He is conspiracy theory spreader. This is no different. It is so irresponsible. I wish that Judge Pirro had pushed back and said what are you talking about? You have no evidence of this. I have been consistent through my time appearing on air that I don't want to speculate about anyone's physical condition, what disorders they might have. It is reckless and it is irresponsible. But Trump's base loves this. I'm sure QAnon is having a wonderful day."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Jessica Tarlov doesn't hold back. Thank you, Jessica. Still to come, the president's son says he is done with the NFL. But a new poll shows more tolerance for racial protest."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Today is the first NFL Sunday since the pandemic and the controversy over player protests is making headlines."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In the opening game in Kansas City, the Chief and the Houston Texans locked arms as messages like Black Lives Matter flashed on the scoreboard. Chief's player Alex Okafor took a knee during the anthem, and as you're hearing, some boos from the crowd. This as the new Washington Post poll finds 56 percent of Americans say it's appropriate for athletes to kneel during the anthem to protest racial inequality, 42 percent saying not appropriate. Joining us now, Fox News correspondent and sports fanatic Griff Jenkins."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Griff, in that same poll, Washington Post found 59 percent of football fans saying -- approving anthem protest. How much of a sea change is that and how much is the media coverage, do you think, contributing to the shifting attitudes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Howie. I am very excited, no doubt, and it is really a case of that was then, this is now. If you look back at the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from August of 2018, 43 percent said that it was appropriate to kneel, 54 percent said not appropriate. We've seen a total flip, a sea change indeed. How much the media played in it? I'm not sure. But you have certainly seen attitudes change. You're seeing it across really all sports for that matter. And of course, the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, doing an about face on it, and we have seen Dallas' owner Jerry Jones saying today he expects in Dallas to see some protests and he's OK with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think in this environment, the media coverage has to be at least a factor. Now, the president has tweeted very critically about NFL protests and his son, Eric Trump, tweeting, football is officially dead, so much for America's sport, good-bye NFL, I'm gone. Is that a premature obituary overall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "We'll see how it works out. If the president really does engage, he obviously won when Colin Kaepernick first did it and it became a culture issue. But now, things have changed so much and really sports fans, football fans like myself, who can't wait to watch Washington's football team take on the Eagles here in just an hour or so. And also, you know, we don't know how the season is going to change and what will be out there. We will be watching for the players' helmets to see what messages are written on the helmets. We are going to hear the Black national anthem, as well as the regular national anthem. There are so many changes. But I think ultimately the core fans are going to be geared up for one thing and that is watching great football. I have Tom Brady and Gronk on my fantasy football team, and I'll be looking to retain my championship trophy, Howie, by the end of the season."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Nice prop. Well, look, the ratings for NBC's airing of the Kansas City game which should have some fans, a lot of stadiums would be empty, down 12 percent from last year's season openings. So, if the ratings keep sliding, will we know if the protests are a factor or maybe just the fact that most of the stadiums are going to be empty and quiet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's too early to say on the ratings. It is down 12 percent. However, we're just getting started. There was no preseason. Things are not normal. As people come back and realize that they can watch football again as the fall season hits, I think people are going to start to engage and a maybe we'll see these ratings go up. Only time will tell."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. You can tell when Griff Jenkins is pumped up. He has a little trophy. He's really excited. And for those of you who are excited about football six NFL games on Fox today, you can check your local listing for that. Thanks, Griff."
