But remember during the Obama administration we were constantly told after every terrorist attack, wait, let's see what the motive is, you know, give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they're lone wolf attackers. Maybe they're not. So perhaps the Trump administration wanted to verify who indeed carried out the attack.   Now, on the other hand, if we are to have a serious conversation call hate what it is, the conversation about neo-Nazis and Nazi rhetoric can't just be about the alt-right. I mean, I just flew in from Chicago. The same day the so-called left-wing group had a protest called the slut walk in Chicago using terminology straight out of David Duke's playbook, the Zionist controlled foreign policy, the Zionist are evil.

He names groups and people all the time that tick him off. Whether it's appropriate or inappropriate, right? Like he'll go after MS-13 and ISIS by name all the time, appropriately so. He'll also go after Mexican-Americans judges and Goldstar families by name in a very aggressive way. So again, the explanation for the delay, we've seen a few of them and they're shifting, I don't buy them, but I would still much prefer finally the president coming around and doing the right thing than never doing it out of some sort of stubbornness. So he came around to it so he deserves credit from people who've been saying he has to do this, we demand that he do this. And then, immediately they start saying, well, he finally did it but it's not enough, or he waited too long. You've got to give some props to someone for doing what you want them to do.

I will say though, to leftist double standards which I think it's a fair thing to bring up in some cases, when the left demands certain actions from conservatives, you look at senators like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who came out with very strong statements about this very early on. There was a New York Times reporter who tweeted yesterday, saying, well, I think what they're doing is posturing for their own political careers. I mean, that is a damned if you do, damned if you don't, no matter what a Republican says. The worst motives are attributed to them and I think that's grotesquely unfair.

This afternoon, President Trump gave a second response to the racist domestic terrorism that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia. Today, we learned that there will be a federal investigation from the DOJ around the tragic events that led to the deaths of Heather Heyer, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, and also injured 19 others. It's a solid first step toward technical justice. Mr. President, your initial remarks were cowardly and dangerous, and they indeed warranted a second statement. Here's why. Your presidential campaign slogan make America great again, well, it rose many questions for many, where Jews, blacks, gays, and Hispanics included in the return of America to her great glory years, or will some of us be left out? Well, I was legitimately unsure. But absent more conclusive evidence, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I can no longer do that, Mr. President. No more benefit. All doubt.   In a moment where you could have been crystal clear where you stand on the issue of inclusion, standing up against white supremacy and domestic terrorism, you very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and equivocate. All sides, Mr. President? Please. President Trump, I do not know your heart, but what I do know for sure is that you've done the math. You've decided that your portion of the base that is absolutely racist is so significant, so valuable that you hesitate, even in the face of blatant flagrant hatred to risk turning them off, and thereby crippling your political stronghold. Do you remember when you said that your base would stick with you even if you shot someone on Fifth Avenue? Guess what, I think you're right. I think they will stick with you through anything. They will even stick with you while you calm their fears and deep-seated anger around their perceived depreciation of the intrinsic value of whiteness in this country. And let's be honest. That's what this is all really about. So while you personally might not be a racist President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support, and you even tacitly encourage them with evasive, irresponsible statements. Instead, maybe try this. I don't know what cause or campaign promise you think you are fulfilling lot because our campaign promise you think you are fulfilling, when you take to the streets and terrorized nonwhite Americans. But that is not what I meant when I said make America great again. And yes, I'm talking to you, David Duke. You represent the very worst of America, and you do not represent me, the right, or conservatism. But I know, I know. But what about black lives matter? What about Obama?   Well, guess what? Obama had a lot of missed opportunities to effectively lead a national dialogue around race in America, and his legacy will carry those shortcomings, but he is no longer in the oval. This moment is on you, President Trump. This is your legacy in the making. Mr. President, I am making a personal plea to you, you're actually uniquely positioned to forcefully call out evil, anti-American domestic terrorists, but we certainly cannot change what we fail to acknowledge. So I'm asking you to address their anger, address their misplaced fears, let them know that this is America, land of opportunity and there is indeed enough to go around. President Trump, they will listen to you, and they will follow your lead. Guy Benson, response.",

I think there is some truth to your theory that he's looking at his based and figuring that he shouldn't maybe alienate a portion of it. A portion that he ought to, loudly. But I think there's two other things going on here. One is just the character of Donald Trump is to have an allergy to criticizing people who say nice things about him. And I think that that's sort of a cheap and juvenile calculation that he sometimes makes which can lead to moral failures. And the second thing is, he does not like being pressured by the media. There was immense pressure for him to come around and say something different. He eventually did, but I think that was part of the reason that he resisted.",

I will say this in lewd of what he said, the original comment, I really felt it would have been best he say nothing. I thought the first one was that egregious, but I would have respected and appreciated it more, Kat, if the president just choose to abstain from any words in the moment."

He's the author of the New York Times best-selling book, The Operator, the co-founder of Your Grateful Nation an organization committed to transitioning special operation veteran to his next successful career, and he's the man who killed the worlds most wanted terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, so he obviously specializes in killing terrorists, Rob O'Neill is here. And she is the director of the Lawfare Project, a legal think tank, she's a former director of the Legal Project at the Middle East Forum, and she's an award- winning documentary film maker for her work on the Making of a Martyr, so she specializes in legal and Middle East affairs, Brooke Goldstein is here. All right. Rob, so President Trump ran on, one of the main thing was we have to call radical Islamic terror by its name. We can't hesitate. So if you're going to say that, you also have to say that we have to call out white supremacists violence by its name and not hesitate."

But he's kind of get hit with political correctness and anti-political correctness because if he doesn't say what it is, the people that are against him are going to totally use it against him. And something like what happened with the KKK or the neo-Nazis they said online we're so happy that President Trump is with us. You need to say what it is. You can't be suckered into just, you know -- if I say all things matter or against all hate, someone is going to hit you for it. You need to be very, very specific. And I think that it's fair because he was saying that about radical Islamic terrorist, you need to say it with the neo-Nazis. No doubt about it."

      "speaker": "BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, LAWFARE PROJECT DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Trump knows that the media it's going to jump on him, whatever he does to criticize him. So why feed them something to criticize? So it's curious that he delayed 48 hours, OK. But he did come out. But remember during the Obama administration we were constantly told after every terrorist attack, wait, let's see what the motive is, you know, give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they're lone wolf attackers. Maybe they're not. So perhaps the Trump administration wanted to verify who indeed carried out the attack. Now, on the other hand, if we are to have a serious conversation call hate what it is, the conversation about neo-Nazis and Nazi rhetoric can't just be about the alt-right. I mean, I just flew in from Chicago. The same day the so-called left-wing group had a protest called the slut walk in Chicago using terminology straight out of David Duke's playbook, the Zionist controlled foreign policy, the Zionist are evil. So let's have a conversation. Let's call it all by its name both on the alt-right and on the alt-left."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Right. I'm skeptical that this was an instance of the president using discretion on his twitter feed because that doesn't seem to happen all that often. The other spin that we heard yesterday from the White House was he didn't want to name them specifically because he didn't want to dignify them. He names groups and people all the time that tick him off. Whether it's appropriate or inappropriate, right? Like he'll go after MS-13 and ISIS by name all the time, appropriately so. He'll also go after Mexican-Americans judges and Goldstar families by name in a very aggressive way. So again, the explanation for the delay, we've seen a few of them and they're shifting, I don't buy them, but I would still much prefer finally the president coming around and doing the right thing than never doing it out of some sort of stubbornness. So he came around to it so he deserves credit from people who've been saying he has to do this, we demand that he do this. And then, immediately they start saying, well, he finally did it but it's not enough, or he waited too long. You've got to give some props to someone for doing what you want them to do. And in this case, that thing was the correct thing."

Let's talk about it all and not be ashamed about it."

I think it becomes distracting for some because then they can run wherever you are in the issue to a safe comfortable space that allows you to deflect the actual issue that is on the table, and kind be comforted by the fact in this moment now we're talking about the anti-Zionist movement or whatever, which is very horrible. I know what you're talking about and it's absolutely despicable. But if we were to remain focused around this issue in this moment, I think sometimes people get falsely comforted by those types of arguments."

I think it's a good thing that he did come out and restated and specifically said what his distractors said he needed to say. That's almost an admission of OK, I was wrong. And I'm sort of negotiating on this. I think it's good he came out, but I don't think -- does anyone really think that he's a racist? Is that what Trump is? That's what President Trump is? That's what a lot of people are saying. It's just not fair. They're talking about words now. Who used what words and who's offending? I mean, these guys kind of have it coming because if you come out -- the very nicely calling it the Tiki march. You know they admitted these are white supremacist Nazis. A lot of people say violence doesn't prove anything. I've seen it prove stuff before. I saw a picture of one of those guys, those Nazis giving a sign and get punched in the face, that didn't upset me too much. You got that it's coming, because -- it's out there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",

Even before he has the information he has been wrong before. He doesn't have to jump on that, but to take a weekend even when we have the facts that this person, people saying this is a Nazi sympathizer, he was in a march, a KKK Nazi march and doing this, for him to take that long, it's a really, really stark contrast."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "The other thing is, look, it took the White House -- not just the president, took the White House three or four tries to finally confirm on the record, although it was on background, that the president decries white supremacy. It should not take that many tries. There's no good excuse for that. I will say though, to leftist double standards which I think it's a fair thing to bring up in some cases, when the left demands certain actions from conservatives, you look at senators like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who came out with very strong statements about this very early on. There was a New York Times reporter who tweeted yesterday, saying, well, I think what they're doing is posturing for their own political careers. I mean, that is a damned if you do, damned if you don't, no matter what a Republican says. The worst motives are attributed to them and I think that's grotesquely unfair. Especially, I mean, there's reasons why maybe two Latino leaders would be opposed to white supremacy other than their own career advancement."

And I don't think that's a coincidence. And what we're saying is, we're giving oxygen. If Trump doesn't come out right away and criticize what happened in Charlottesville, we're giving oxygen to that movement. But were also giving oxygen to other movements if we refuse to concentrate on them when the new cycle is the exact same story, that we have neo-Nazi, anti-Sematic rhetoric happening in extreme groups. It's the exact same thing."

I think that's certainly where the entire mainstream media news cycle has chosen to focus, and I think that is actually problematic. I think he is the leader of the free world and our commander-in-chief, so what he thinks and how he responds is critically important. But there's I think a bigger issue actually at play.

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"The Fox News Specialists.\" This is the docket. This afternoon, President Trump gave a second response to the racist domestic terrorism that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia. Today, we learned that there will be a federal investigation from the DOJ around the tragic events that led to the deaths of Heather Heyer, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, and also injured 19 others. It's a solid first step toward technical justice. Mr. President, your initial remarks were cowardly and dangerous, and they indeed warranted a second statement. Here's why. Your presidential campaign slogan make America great again, well, it rose many questions for many, where Jews, blacks, gays, and Hispanics included in the return of America to her great glory years, or will some of us be left out? Well, I was legitimately unsure. But absent more conclusive evidence, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I can no longer do that, Mr. President. No more benefit. All doubt. In a moment where you could have been crystal clear where you stand on the issue of inclusion, standing up against white supremacy and domestic terrorism, you very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and equivocate. All sides, Mr. President? Please. President Trump, I do not know your heart, but what I do know for sure is that you've done the math. You've decided that your portion of the base that is absolutely racist is so significant, so valuable that you hesitate, even in the face of blatant flagrant hatred to risk turning them off, and thereby crippling your political stronghold. Do you remember when you said that your base would stick with you even if you shot someone on Fifth Avenue? Guess what, I think you're right. I think they will stick with you through anything. They will even stick with you while you calm their fears and deep-seated anger around their perceived depreciation of the intrinsic value of whiteness in this country. And let's be honest. That's what this is all really about. So while you personally might not be a racist President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support, and you even tacitly encourage them with evasive, irresponsible statements. Instead, maybe try this. I don't know what cause or campaign promise you think you are fulfilling lot because our campaign promise you think you are fulfilling, when you take to the streets and terrorized nonwhite Americans. But that is not what I meant when I said make America great again. And yes, I'm talking to you, David Duke. You represent the very worst of America, and you do not represent me, the right, or conservatism. But I know, I know. But what about black lives matter? What about Obama? Well, guess what? Obama had a lot of missed opportunities to effectively lead a national dialogue around race in America, and his legacy will carry those shortcomings, but he is no longer in the oval. This moment is on you, President Trump. This is your legacy in the making. Mr. President, I am making a personal plea to you, you're actually uniquely positioned to forcefully call out evil, anti-American domestic terrorists, but we certainly cannot change what we fail to acknowledge. So I'm asking you to address their anger, address their misplaced fears, let them know that this is America, land of opportunity and there is indeed enough to go around. President Trump, they will listen to you, and they will follow your lead. Guy Benson, response."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "I mean, a lot of profound sentiments there, Eboni. And I agree with many of them. I think when we're trying to figure out what the motivations here are, and you're right. We can't peer into the heart of the president. I personally don't believe that he's a crypto racist, or he's an undercover anti-Semite. I think there is some truth to your theory that he's looking at his based and figuring that he shouldn't maybe alienate a portion of it. A portion that he ought to, loudly. But I think there's two other things going on here. One is just the character of Donald Trump is to have an allergy to criticizing people who say nice things about him. And I think that that's sort of a cheap and juvenile calculation that he sometimes makes which can lead to moral failures. And the second thing is, he does not like being pressured by the media. There was immense pressure for him to come around and say something different. He eventually did, but I think that was part of the reason that he resisted."

I'm just thinking that because there were a couple different elements there that were sort of promoting violence, you knew it was going to happen. It's kind of a perfect storm in there. I think he was trying to stay away from it. But Kat made a very interesting point today, how fast he is to say Islamic terrorism. So you're kind of winning me over on this argument. And so, I'm happy that he came out and did say -- you know, he called it racial terrorism. I think he called it today, he said they're going -- to the fullest extent of the law, prosecute this guy. I hope to see -- I'm not an attorney, but I think I know the difference between second and first degree. And I think that they should push up the first degree because there's no doubt in my mind this animal that was behind the wheel, he thought about what he was doing. He went there on purpose with the car to go to the rally to do just what he did."

But that's the issue of terrorism. This was, in my opinion, very much looking like domestic terrorism. It's all about obviously the motive of the attacker, whether or not he attacked a civilian population for the purposes of instilling fear or for political motives. And if that is proven, then absolutely he should be charged and convicted with domestic terrorism."

North Korea can potentially can bring it back to the bargaining table and we're going to need Chinese influence in this regardless whether we like it or not because someone needs to deal with that -- with the spoiled little brat, Kim Jong-un up in Korea and it's either going to be with Chinese Special Forces assassinating him which wouldn't surprise me if he just choke on some food one day or -- but also just getting him to the table potentially once he starts losing a lot of them. You know, he doesn't care if he feeds his people, that's not his concern, but if he starts running out of the luxuries in life, the suits that he wears, and the vodka and all that stuff..."

So don't see it as an escalation."

So, we saw a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed today from the secretary of state, secretary of defense (INAUDIBLE) saying we are moving from strategic patience of the Obama era to strategic accountability. Are those just words?"

And now, accountability, we need to put it -- we need to put in and I mean, China is stealing stuff from us all the time, they're lying about sanctions, you know, turns out a lot people when we negotiate, they lie to us if you can believe that. So, I mean, I am hoping -- and, you know, I don't want to -- I don't want to see this escalate into a war nobody wants especially a nuclear type war but even tomorrow is a holiday for North Korea. They're going to test something. What are we going to do about it? What if they shoot one of those missiles over Japan? That's not cool."

They signed up for the resistance right away. I think they are still embarrassed that they got it the election so wrong. But I think some of the objections that I can at least buy into here over this ad, first, the timing. Given what just happened in this country, and we're talking about unity and we're talking about coming together and then bang, here's an ad slamming our enemies. And that's the other part of it. I really don't like employing the term \"enemies.\" That should be reserved for the likes of actual enemies like North Korea and ISIS and Iran. Not fellow citizens. Adversaries, sure. Resistance, sure. Critics, that's fine. Enemies to me, I don't like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "OK. Rob, let me ask you this, I actually think when the president positions himself against the mainstream media and clearly makes a point that they are against him, which I agree they are, did it actually strengthens a much of his (INAUDIBLE) it strengthens a lot of his argument, that he is the change candidate, he is the antiestablishment whether that's democrat or republican candidate and I think that actually serves him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'NEILL",
      "utterance": "It does serve him and he is fortunate because he can reach people via Twitter. Again, some of the stuff the media does because there's no question most people in the media don't like him, they don't like what he's doing. I agree with Guy that you cannot call -- you don't want to call your friends across the aisle the enemies. Adversaries is good. You -- he's going to keep his base, he's not going to get a lot of new support by attacking them like that and one of the problems in D.C. in the swamp and he said he's (INAUDIBLE) is party politics. There are too many people in D.C. that love their career job as a politician and love their party more than they love the country. They want the party's agenda. And this is not uncommon. I mean, even with President Obama there weren't a lot of republicans ready to let him do his job either. This happens on both sides and instead of running for your party, you need to run on the issues that you really believe in. Not a lot of that's happening. I don't think attacking them is the right way to do it now especially now. And again, the enemy -- the word enemies. I've seen enemies before and they didn't look like Bernie Sanders."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Fair point there. Brooke, what do you think? Do you think the timing is an issue or maybe the more important issue is he's got to get ready to reclaim the narrative that he is the change candidate and the antiestablishment candidate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, I think we're all in agreement that the word enemies, not so good. The timing not so good, but, you know, this is a typical ad. And, you know, Trump is not a typical guy. And I'd like to see some more creative advertisement here and there's probably a lot of public relations guy behind him. And, you know, I think examples play really well. You're calling people -- you know, people names, you're calling people out. How about, you know, give the people concrete examples of when you tried to do something and you were blocked or when the media has, you know, failed its responsibility to be objective to the people. Give us examples."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'NEILL",
      "utterance": "Well, I noticed even there when he tried to do something a few weeks ago and he was blocked by his own party.

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "It sounds technical coming from you, Rob O'Neill, but Kat, let me ask you this. I thought the obvious ad here was are you tired of winning yet? And that President Trump would, kind of to Brooke's point, lay out all of the accomplishments that he has from an economic perspective. Those narratives out there. And really just double down on his, I'm a winning guy, this is a winning White House. You are on a winning ticket and kind of go with kind of a more optimistic message."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Examples are always better even if someone tells if you're working on a resume or a cover letter that includes specific examples. Enemies, didn't like the word enemies, agree with that. It's also just not something I'm super mad about. You know, there's a lot of stuff that happened over the weekend that I'm way more mad about. So I come out, it's not a huge deal. But if the timing was bad, the word enemies is bad and examples would have been better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Guy, let me ask you, when it comes to the obstruction issue which I think Rob is absolutely right, it happened to both sides. And I do think a lot of American people are tired of feeling like it's the party, so no matter which party that are reigning supreme at the expense of hardworking taxpaying Americans here. Is there a way for President Trump to continue kind of to criticize and go toe to toe with McConnell and Ryan? But ultimately, when it comes to the issue of health care, when he needs these republican leaders to be on his team reconcile that relationship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "I think that the president thrives on getting into spats with various people and sometimes that includes members of his party that he's adopted recently. And that's fine, like, people are wringing their hands. Oh my gosh, he's been criticizing McConnell, how does it affect his agenda? I don't think it affects it at all. Mitch McConnell wants to reform taxes. Donald Trump wants to sign that bill. They're going to work together even if they're going at each other a little bit over Twitter. I think that whole thing was overblown. That was sort of an August news story, right?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I think what happens in Washington, this is my general observation, is the president is not a representative of the political establishment class and so for whatever reason, people have made a decision they want to eject him. I think there are elements inside Washington, also inclusive in the White House that are not necessarily of betting the president's interest or his agenda. I absolutely believe that, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Adding to intrigue, Axios is reporting that President Trump has told close associates that he believes Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist is behind damaging leaks about fellow administration officials. All right. First of all Guy, great to see the mooch back on TV again. I think that everybody can agree very, very wonderful. I wouldn't really be too bummed out to see Bannon go myself or overall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, then you might be unlocked because if you read into what Scaramucci said, saying that he believes that the president thinks or suspects that Bannon is one of these leakers, that's one strike against Bannon. Another big one this weekend on \"Meet the Press,\" Chuck Todd pressed H.R. McMaster over and over again if he can work with Steve Bannon, if Steve Bannon is the type of person he wants in the White House. And it was just Deflection City from McMaster. I think between those two things, that might suggest that Bannon's on his way out. Although we were all saying the same thing about Jeff Sessions a few days ago and then that blew over. So who knows? But the knives may be out for Steve Bannon."

And back to the McMaster thing, one of the things that is being reported is that, well, there's a schism between the two because Breitbart is publishing negative articles about McMaster, but then again, on the other side, could you imagine the story if someone so close to the President of the United States would go after and try and suppress articles being written by third parties even though he worked there? I mean, I don't think he would have the power to do that. On the leaks on the other hand, I think the signal..."

      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Right, right. So they're saying because he didn't censor it, then that's -- you know, there's a schism there. But the other thing is I want to point out, the message of the American people are getting right now on both sides is that those in the White House are more concerned with party politics than they are with national security. When you have this amount of leaks come out of the White House, it is a really scary thing."

McMaster has a problem with Bannon and Bannon's obviously got people over at Breitbart. He's possibly going to do that. He looks like he is on his way out though for sure, a couple of reasons, one, Breitbart is doing it, Trump hates the leakers or possibly illegal of this classified information. He was the only person not golfing and he didn't comment. That's, like, guilty, guilty, guilty."

And you cannot have that happen inside the White House."
    },

John Kelly is not messing around and this is a part of the reason the mooch is gone is because everybody thought that they had, like, direct access to the president. Now, it's, like, no, I'm the boss and you need to come through me and again, you got four more stars there that's going to start throwing them around."

      "utterance": "Yes, on the China command. You know, the transcripts, Guy, you're exactly right. It's hugely problematic. Not just disrespectful to President Trump but very dangerous for all of us as Americans because if I'm an international leader and I fear that my conversation with the President Trump is going to be leaked, my goodness. What am I not sharing? What intelligence am I not sharing? What hesitation do I have around critically important pathways, you know, to sharing information. And that's a serious problem. So if any truth is to Bannon being that leak, he absolutely rightfully should be out of there."
