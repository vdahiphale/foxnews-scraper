So much has been focused on your Republican colleagues Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, that sometimes we have lost sight of Democrats, like Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin, et cetera.  Do you think, if it's a report that comes out that cannot corroborate -- corroborate any of the charges that have been made, not only by Dr. Ford, but Deborah Ramirez and this Michael Avenatti client Julie Swetnick, that it's a good bet not only will those Republicans vote for him, so will those Democrats?",

But, you know, when you look out -- I was just listening to the report from North Dakota. It's interesting that is the same report you were getting from today's survey in West Virginia. It's a 60-30. It's a 2-1 in favor of Kavanaugh.  Now, that puts someone like Joe Manchin in a really awkward situation, because he -- he will have to make a decision. Is he going to give a vote to the Democrats or to the people of West Virginia? That's a strong margin, 2-1. So that's what is going to be at play here.",

We do know through P.J. Smyth's attorney that he said he didn't know about the allegations at all, so refuting it, to your point, again, no one corroborating at this point any of the charges that have been directed at the judge. But something has developed in the meantime concerning the judge's behavior when he met with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Hillary Clinton calling it his temperament. Now, obviously, he was accused of some awful things. So a lot of people, to your point, would say he was justified giving that response.   But this seems to be the new wrinkle here the part of Democrats, who are saying, well, he proved right then in there that he's not fit for the high court. What do you think?",

And then, of course, just a couple hours ago, Chuck Schumer said that we have to have time to evaluate. Here's the problem with that. The FBI doesn't have that authority. They don't conduct criminal investigations.   And when they do, they do not reach conclusions. I mean, that's by design. And so they're doing -- they're asking them to do something that they can't do. And, by the way, let's keep in mind this was none other than Barack Obama who came forth with the rules that they would use. That rule was that the FBI would give the report to the White House, the White House then would share it with Congress. And, of course, that's not happening.  So they are precluded from doing exactly what Chuck Schumer says he wants them to do. Another stall, that's all. And it's going to happen, by the way.",
