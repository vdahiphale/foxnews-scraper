They will look at this thing for any impropriety they can find within the administration, within the campaign, anything about Trump, and use it to help fuel their own investigations, which they launched prior to the release of even the summary when it became evident that collusion was far less likely.

But I think that he did an incredibly masterful job at tapping into what the consumers hate most about our current health care system, which is lack of affordability, high premiums, high deductibles, while steering clear of all the things that would be really difficult to cope with if we were to have Medicare for all -- big cost, big tax increases, long wait lines, lack of availability of doctors, getting your health care declined by the government, all these things which if consumers had more details might be more skeptical and wouldn't have roared with applause, as they did. He was so good at just getting the audience to say, don't you hate that way things are, let's change it. Yay, everyone was cheering. But again, the devil is in the details."

      "utterance": "Right. Elections are won at the margins, and so Bernie Sanders was smart to do a FOX News town hall. You're going to win back some of those blue-collar Democrats who went for Donald Trump. This isn't winning the majority of them, just like, look, in the evangelical world, Buttigieg is talking about his faith. He is not going to win white conservative evangelicals. But if he picks off a percentage or two from Trump, that could be game, set, match for Donald Trump. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
