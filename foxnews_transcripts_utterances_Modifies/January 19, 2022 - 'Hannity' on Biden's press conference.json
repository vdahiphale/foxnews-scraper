      "sentences": "All right. And thank you, Tucker, and welcome to HANNITY. And after days and days and days of resting, studying, prepping, Joe Biden finally trotted out to the podium for just the second solo press conference ever as president. And as expected, it did not go well at all. In fact, it was the longest, frankly most painful even embarrassing presser I've ever witnessed. No doubt he still has lucid moments here and there, but more often than not, Joe is clearly lost. He is confused especially off prompter. Frankly, knowing the world is watching this, to be honest, I felt humiliation for the country. I really did, you know? And that's just the delivery. the substance was an unmitigated disaster that could have ramifications all around the globe. In what was a blatant attempt to look strong and competent, Joe Biden looked deeply unwell. Now, tonight, coming up, we're going to fact check his many lies. We'll call out his election conspiracy theories. We'll actually answer one of his dumb rhetorical questions, and we'll tell you how his pathetic rhetoric surrounding Russia and NATO could have potentially explosive and very deadly consequences around the entire globe. Peter Doocy, who just faced off against Biden, will join us again. The great one Mark Levin, we'll get his take, and Greg Gutfeld, moments away. We'll show you President Trump's initial reaction as well. But we begin with perhaps the biggest lie of the day and that is despite major crises on multiple fronts and an all-time low approval rating at 33 percent, Joe Biden just proudly announced that his administration has exceeded all expectations. Oh, okay, sure.",

      "sentences": "All right. Since you asked, Joe, let's take a look at Donald Trump's first year in office, shall we? In 2017, President Trump, he signed 117 bills into law, that included dozens of major legislative achievements. He repealed the individual mandate and Obamacare. He signed what was the biggest tax cut in American history. He eliminated more regulations than the last, what, five, eight presidents combined. He opened up oil exploration in ANWR in Alaska. He oversaw massive economic growth. He nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He set a record for first year judicial appointments to federal appellate courts. He oversaw a historic reduction in illegal immigration. He bombed the living Adam Schiff out of ISIS and destroyed the caliphate. He also forced NATO members to up their contributions to the military alliance. So what did Joe do over the past year? Okay, Joe, true, you spent so much money on handouts that inflation is now at a record 40-year high while the worker shortage remains dire in the country. The average American family because of your policies is now spending five thousand dollars more this year because of your inflation tax. Biden shut down the Keystone exile pipeline, but he did green light Putin's pipeline, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe. He blocked oil exploration on federal lands. He ended Trump's energy independence policies. A year ago, this country was a net exporter of energy and energy independent. And now, he's begging and pleading with OPEC and Russia to produce more energy. That too is a national embarrassment and worst of all, for you the American consumer, all of us are paying -- well, about a buck more a gallon for gasoline. We're going to pay close to a thousand dollars more on average heating our homes this year, and we now pay more for every single product we buy at every store that we go to. And there's no end in sight as now the price of a barrel of oil worldwide is now headed to a hundred bucks a barrel and maybe higher. That's a huge reason for the 40-year high in inflation and Joe obviously has zero understanding of economics 101 because he never tied those two things together. Instead, he's lashing out, blaming businesses and industries and saying his policies did not cause this. And remember, he also ended Trump's border policies he stopped construction of the border wall. He also ended the stay in Mexico policy that was working. It caused record levels of illegal immigration we had not seen in what, 20, 25 years. Now, we can never forget the 13 Americans who were killed because of Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan or the thousands of Americans and green card holders and allies that he abandoned when he said he wouldn't do it. Remember, he also promised to shut down the virus. That never happened either. Joe was lying the entire time. We not -- not only did he not shut it down, we had more people that died from COVID in 2021 than 2020. He said, I didn't see omicron coming, and in the meantime when we needed most, he ran out of COVID test. He ran out of monoclonal antibodies. He's done nothing to mass-produce the antivirals that for the first time today even mentioned. We have now more Americans dead under his watch than Donald Trump. But according to the White House, Biden did build a lot of new windmills and electric charging stations. Okay, that is really helping us all out a lot. But as for the unity that Joe promised, in his inauguration speech -- well, today, Joe couldn't even be honest about that. Take a look.",

Because my list is expansive. Let's start with energy independence that you took away from this country. Let's start with the Keystone XL pipeline. Let's get it back online. Drilling on federal lands, lowering taxes, ending burdensome regulation, open schools, school choice, parents in control of their kids education, law and order, safety, security, so every American can pursue happiness, free and fair trade deals, peace through strength, free market solutions to health care. Yes, that also protect pre-existing conditions. We believe in liberty and freedom and capitalism in our Constitution, and the U.S. Bill of Rights upheld by constitutionalists on the bench. But Joe isn't particularly familiar with any of those beliefs because Joe doesn't actually talk to any Republicans or conservatives and he doesn't reach across the aisle. Republicans were pushed out of any negotiation with Bill Back Better or build back broke as I call it. They would not at all involve in this power grab that they're trying even at this hour tonight, which we'll talk about in a minute. Instead, he is hiding away at the White House and spending 25 percent of his time at the beach somewhere in Delaware, all while his socialist handlers are fundamentally trying to transform this country into a new Green Deal socialist utopia with the slimmest of majorities in the House and the Senate. So I guess congratulations, Joey, he might be the worst president in modern American history. But don't worry, Joey, you know, you will be the last to know it, because it appears your steep cognitive decline is only getting worse. Here with reaction, our very own Peter Doocy was in the room. I saw and I did notice -- and I will say I'm a very harsh critic of the media, I felt there were a number of pretty good questions asked today. And now, were they the questions I would have asked? No. But with that said -- and I liked your question today because he is moving hard left and he just didn't want to he just wanted to dismiss it.

So that from Jen Psaki a lot harder than what we heard from President Biden. But being in the room, I tell you, I've been with Joe Biden on the beat for more than three years now, and that is the longest I have ever seen him by himself talking. And there were 30 reporters in the room, 24 got questions. There was a lot of Russia. If I had been given a follow-up, I was going to ask him about crime, especially because he had a new line that I had not heard him use before, he was saying that people in this country just want three squares and to be safe. Well, as we know, a lot of people right now in this country do not feel safe as the murder rate has risen to a near 25-year high and even the new mayor of New York says he doesn't feel safe riding the subway.

I mean, just today, Sean and Joe, Morning Consult/Politico poll came out with a report card on Joe Biden, but it's not Joe Biden's report card on Joe Biden. It's America's. And 37 percent gave Joe Biden's first year in office an F, combined 31 percent gave him an A or a B. That's important because it takes an awful lot for Americans to want to fail the president and the presidency. We live during these times. We want -- we want the country to be prosperous and successful and intact and secure, and people just don't feel that. So, for two hours today, Joe Biden reinforced why he's an unpopular president. Why his polling numbers, according to the Gallup poll, 40 percent approve, 56 disapprove after one year. It's the lowest on record, yes, lower than Donald Trump's, who did not have the mainstream media pushing for him, covering for him and, of course, voting for him. I would have asked the media a different question which is, do any of you regret voting for him? Do any of you regret covering up stories about his corrupt son? Do any of you regret not pushing him more on the policies and the issues and forcing him out of his Groundhog Day basement when he was campaigning or not campaigning? Because this is -- this is what we have, and it's a serious point that his numbers have cratered among independents, even CNN had to admit today, Sean, that among independents, Joe Biden at this point a year ago was over 60 percent. He is now at 33 percent approval. Among Democrats, he was at 98 percent one year ago. He is at 82 percent. So, the attrition is not just right-wingers and conservatives and people who don't like poor Joe Biden. It's all around now.

And when you watch any presidential press conference, you look for, what are the big three headlines you could take out of it, right? And here's what I have: headline one, Biden says Republicans will change vote totals if voting legislation doesn't pass. Wait, I thought that such rhetoric was chilling attacks on democracy. This is a president of the United States sowing doubt in future elections and every political pundit out there who said it was wrong for the 45th president when he did it is awfully silent tonight as far as when Joe Biden does it. And it shows you how phony all the outrage on TV was around that. Headline two: Biden says he's accomplished more in his first year than any president in history. Given the 40-year inflation that you just mentioned or given record violent crime homicides or more than 2 million people crossing the southern border illegally, that's a fascinating claim to make. Speaking of crime, despite two hours, dozens of questions, not one -- not one on violent crime impacting so many Americans. I know Peter Doocy had that in question too, but he didn't have the opportunity. So here's where we are, that was an unmitigated disaster today, Sean, and those praising the president for longevity of this press conference, it's all about quality, not quantity as far as the answers.",

She has left. In order to execute this nuclear option, you need 51 votes. Here's the problem, Democrats only have votes on their side. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema will vote no.

Putin's watching this too, and he's just and he says he's made enormous progress more than any president in history this time. The hell is he talking about? He's the John Tyler of our time, the James Buchanan of our time. More progress? You know what's made the most progress? The regime in Iran, the regime in North Korea, the regime in China, the regime in Russia, they're making a hell of a lot of progress. You know who's making progress? Illegal aliens are making progress. They're making a lot of progress. There's like two Americas here. The Democrat Party that lives in this sort of cocoon and the rest of the nation. There's inflation. He says it's no big deal. We didn't talk about heat (ph) in schools today, crime people have mentioned, that's true. The borders totally out of control, the issues that affect Americans across the board. He talks about -- well, we voted to spend this, and we voted to spend this, and we passed this law and we did this law, because that's how these clowns in the Democrat Party in Washington, D.C. think. You passed the law so my life is better? No, that's not the way it worked. And he talked about other things he seemed to suggest if the Democrats lose in the midterm election, then it's not legitimate. He was specifically asked, the upcoming election won't be fair, fairly conducted, quote/unquote, without passing the voting rights bill. This is not a voting rights bill. Can anybody tell me a single provision that actually protects voting rights? They keep talking about the Republicans don't want blacks to vote. This is poisonous, cancerous language. Tell me, where all these people that can't vote? Where's the class action lawsuit that's been brought in federal court? Where the lawsuits have been brought under the 1965 Civil Rights Act? For all these people who couldn't vote? You can vote. I'm going to tell you how to vote. You want me to do a public service announcement, Sean? Get off your ass on election day and go to the precinct and vote. There, I did it. So every election prior to this one has been illegitimate, you see. So the election of Barack Obama was illegitimate? And it's amazing thing -- Concha touched on it -- Donald Trump's brings up the election. Some of his supporters bring it up. Some of the Republican legislatures, they have real serious substantive issues. Joe Biden in anticipation of the Democrats losing the House and maybe the Senate has already said effectively this election will be illegitimate. In 2016, they try to depose an elected -- a legitimately elected president. No commission on that with Russia collusion. The FBI, the intelligence agencies, the Democrat Party, Hillary Clinton, law firms, slip and fall lawyers, all involved in it, 2016. But you can't talk about 2020. Look, I think the president will be better off and I really do slamming away on Joe Biden and his agenda. Donald Trump had a fantastically successful presidency in four years time. This is one of the things that drives the left in the media nuts, a fantastically successful president. Despite the war against him, despite these Never Trumpers led by McConnell and others trying to undermine him, I don't think we've ever seen anything like that. In fact, Joe Biden's wrong. He says enormous progress more than any president in history at this time. No, Trump did more than any president in history at this time. All right. I hear the music.

Now, the lawsuit stems from a post that Baldwin shared on Instagram earlier this month. That is after he gave $5,000 to the widow of Rylee to help with their newborn daughter, but after Baldwin discovered that McCollum's sister was pictured at the Washington monument on January the 6th, Baldwin wrote to her, quote, when I sent the money for your late brother, out of real respect for his service to this country, I did not know you were a January 6th rioter. Roice McCollum then responded, protesting is perfectly legal in the country and I have already had my sit down with the FBI, thanks, have a nice day. Baldwin then went on to repost her photo and called Roice an insurrectionist, to his 2.4 million Instagram followers, which prompted a wave of hateful and threatening comments. We reached out to Baldwin for comment. Shockingly, aren't surprised we have not heard back. Here with more is Roice McCollum and her attorney Dennis Postiglione is with us. Thank you both. Roice, let's start with you. OK, you were there January 6th. You went to the rally, and you did not go into the Capitol, correct?",

And after days and days and days of resting, studying, prepping, Joe Biden finally trotted out to the podium for just the second solo press conference ever as president. And as expected, it did not go well at all. In fact, it was the longest, frankly most painful even embarrassing presser I've ever witnessed. No doubt he still has lucid moments here and there, but more often than not, Joe is clearly lost. He is confused especially off prompter. Frankly, knowing the world is watching this, to be honest, I felt humiliation for the country. I really did, you know? And that's just the delivery. the substance was an unmitigated disaster that could have ramifications all around the globe. In what was a blatant attempt to look strong and competent, Joe Biden looked deeply unwell. Now, tonight, coming up, we're going to fact check his many lies. We'll call out his election conspiracy theories. We'll actually answer one of his dumb rhetorical questions, and we'll tell you how his pathetic rhetoric surrounding Russia and NATO could have potentially explosive and very deadly consequences around the entire globe. Peter Doocy, who just faced off against Biden, will join us again. The great one Mark Levin, we'll get his take, and Greg Gutfeld, moments away. We'll show you President Trump's initial reaction as well. But we begin with perhaps the biggest lie of the day and that is despite major crises on multiple fronts and an all-time low approval rating at 33 percent, Joe Biden just proudly announced that his administration has exceeded all expectations. Oh, okay, sure."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Since you asked, Joe, let's take a look at Donald Trump's first year in office, shall we? In 2017, President Trump, he signed 117 bills into law, that included dozens of major legislative achievements. He repealed the individual mandate and Obamacare. He signed what was the biggest tax cut in American history. He eliminated more regulations than the last, what, five, eight presidents combined. He opened up oil exploration in ANWR in Alaska. He oversaw massive economic growth. He nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He set a record for first year judicial appointments to federal appellate courts. He oversaw a historic reduction in illegal immigration. He bombed the living Adam Schiff out of ISIS and destroyed the caliphate. He also forced NATO members to up their contributions to the military alliance. So what did Joe do over the past year? Okay, Joe, true, you spent so much money on handouts that inflation is now at a record 40-year high while the worker shortage remains dire in the country. The average American family because of your policies is now spending five thousand dollars more this year because of your inflation tax. Biden shut down the Keystone exile pipeline, but he did green light Putin's pipeline, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe. He blocked oil exploration on federal lands. He ended Trump's energy independence policies. A year ago, this country was a net exporter of energy and energy independent. And now, he's begging and pleading with OPEC and Russia to produce more energy. That too is a national embarrassment and worst of all, for you the American consumer, all of us are paying -- well, about a buck more a gallon for gasoline. We're going to pay close to a thousand dollars more on average heating our homes this year, and we now pay more for every single product we buy at every store that we go to. And there's no end in sight as now the price of a barrel of oil worldwide is now headed to a hundred bucks a barrel and maybe higher. That's a huge reason for the 40-year high in inflation and Joe obviously has zero understanding of economics 101 because he never tied those two things together. Instead, he's lashing out, blaming businesses and industries and saying his policies did not cause this. And remember, he also ended Trump's border policies he stopped construction of the border wall. He also ended the stay in Mexico policy that was working. It caused record levels of illegal immigration we had not seen in what, 20, 25 years. Now, we can never forget the 13 Americans who were killed because of Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan or the thousands of Americans and green card holders and allies that he abandoned when he said he wouldn't do it. Remember, he also promised to shut down the virus. That never happened either. Joe was lying the entire time. We not -- not only did he not shut it down, we had more people that died from COVID in 2021 than 2020. He said, I didn't see omicron coming, and in the meantime when we needed most, he ran out of COVID test. He ran out of monoclonal antibodies. He's done nothing to mass-produce the antivirals that for the first time today even mentioned. We have now more Americans dead under his watch than Donald Trump. But according to the White House, Biden did build a lot of new windmills and electric charging stations. Okay, that is really helping us all out a lot. But as for the unity that Joe promised, in his inauguration speech -- well, today, Joe couldn't even be honest about that. Take a look."

We, the American people, can see what's going on. You're witnessing an obvious cognitive decline. But the saddest part of all this are so are America's enemies. You know, Vladimir Putin, President Xi, the mullahs in Iran, in fact, Putin is now amassing troops at the border of Ukraine, ready to attack, cause a massive war in Europe. Putin likely thinks Biden is too weak to respond. And today, Biden essentially -- well, not only confirmed but fast-tracked Putin's plan to invade Ukraine so long as it's -- it's -- well, is it going to be a minor incursion. Wow. Take a look."

U.S. intel officials, they're now reportedly deeply concerned and troubled. But, by the way, they were at the start of this day. Our NATO allies, frankly, are terrified of what they saw today and what might happen next, because of what Biden said at this press conference. Now, clearly, war by Putin is imminent and he kind of got a -- the green light from Joe Biden that there's not going to be any real significant consequences. We're going to put sanctions on them. Oh, okay, that's going to work. You don't know how to put sanctions on them because if you did, you'd have to out produce them as far as energy goes and that would mean you'd be supplying our Western European allies with the lifeblood of the world's economy that we have the ability to provide that you prevent us from providing. Now, this is why we cannot have a president with -- that's a cognitive mess in our White House. The consequences will be felt all over the world.

      "utterance": "Well, for the record, I'm a registered conservative but I vote Republican because that's pretty much the only party that's even near conservative. Now, just one, Joe? Because my list is expansive. Let's start with energy independence that you took away from this country. Let's start with the Keystone XL pipeline. Let's get it back online. Drilling on federal lands, lowering taxes, ending burdensome regulation, open schools, school choice, parents in control of their kids education, law and order, safety, security, so every American can pursue happiness, free and fair trade deals, peace through strength, free market solutions to health care. Yes, that also protect pre-existing conditions. We believe in liberty and freedom and capitalism in our Constitution, and the U.S. Bill of Rights upheld by constitutionalists on the bench. But Joe isn't particularly familiar with any of those beliefs because Joe doesn't actually talk to any Republicans or conservatives and he doesn't reach across the aisle. Republicans were pushed out of any negotiation with Bill Back Better or build back broke as I call it. They would not at all involve in this power grab that they're trying even at this hour tonight, which we'll talk about in a minute. Instead, he is hiding away at the White House and spending 25 percent of his time at the beach somewhere in Delaware, all while his socialist handlers are fundamentally trying to transform this country into a new Green Deal socialist utopia with the slimmest of majorities in the House and the Senate. So I guess congratulations, Joey, he might be the worst president in modern American history. But don't worry, Joey, you know, you will be the last to know it, because it appears your steep cognitive decline is only getting worse. Here with reaction, our very own Peter Doocy was in the room. I saw and I did notice -- and I will say I'm a very harsh critic of the media, I felt there were a number of pretty good questions asked today. And now, were they the questions I would have asked? No. But with that said -- and I liked your question today because he is moving hard left and he just didn't want to he just wanted to dismiss it. What was it like in the room especially you notice that the media kept going back to Putin and Ukraine because it seemed like Joe was giving Putin a green light?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, to talk about first the president appearing to give Putin a green light, very, very shortly after he said that a minor incursion might be treated differently, Jen Psaki came out with a statement cleaning that up. She said any kind of Russia -- if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that is a renewed invasion that would trigger the U.S. response. So that from Jen Psaki a lot harder than what we heard from President Biden. But being in the room, I tell you, I've been with Joe Biden on the beat for more than three years now, and that is the longest I have ever seen him by himself talking. And there were 30 reporters in the room, 24 got questions. There was a lot of Russia. If I had been given a follow-up, I was going to ask him about crime, especially because he had a new line that I had not heard him use before, he was saying that people in this country just want three squares and to be safe. Well, as we know, a lot of people right now in this country do not feel safe as the murder rate has risen to a near 25-year high and even the new mayor of New York says he doesn't feel safe riding the subway. But being in the room, everybody that was there, even though it was an hour and 51 minutes, a lot of time to be anywhere.

And 37 percent gave Joe Biden's first year in office an F, combined 31 percent gave him an A or a B. That's important because it takes an awful lot for Americans to want to fail the president and the presidency. We live during these times. We want -- we want the country to be prosperous and successful and intact and secure, and people just don't feel that. So, for two hours today, Joe Biden reinforced why he's an unpopular president. Why his polling numbers, according to the Gallup poll, 40 percent approve, 56 disapprove after one year. It's the lowest on record, yes, lower than Donald Trump's, who did not have the mainstream media pushing for him, covering for him and, of course, voting for him. I would have asked the media a different question which is, do any of you regret voting for him? Do any of you regret covering up stories about his corrupt son? Do any of you regret not pushing him more on the policies and the issues and forcing him out of his Groundhog Day basement when he was campaigning or not campaigning? Because this is -- this is what we have, and it's a serious point that his numbers have cratered among independents, even CNN had to admit today, Sean, that among independents, Joe Biden at this point a year ago was over 60 percent. He is now at 33 percent approval. Among Democrats, he was at 98 percent one year ago. He is at 82 percent. So, the attrition is not just right-wingers and conservatives and people who don't like poor Joe Biden. It's all around now. America also -- some of them believe he's incapacitated, but even a higher number believe that he's incompetent. And I think the incompetence measure is the most durable one because it is a reflection on the entire Democratic Party."

And when you watch any presidential press conference, you look for, what are the big three headlines you could take out of it, right? And here's what I have: headline one, Biden says Republicans will change vote totals if voting legislation doesn't pass. Wait, I thought that such rhetoric was chilling attacks on democracy. This is a president of the United States sowing doubt in future elections and every political pundit out there who said it was wrong for the 45th president when he did it is awfully silent tonight as far as when Joe Biden does it. And it shows you how phony all the outrage on TV was around that."

Speaking of crime, despite two hours, dozens of questions, not one -- not one on violent crime impacting so many Americans. I know Peter Doocy had that in question too, but he didn't have the opportunity.

They did not get 60 votes. So what Chuck Schumer is teeing up here in the next hour or so here is what we call a nuclear option. This is an effort to change the filibuster provisions. And what Chuck Schumer is going to propose on the Senate floor in just a few minutes ago here is a one-time exception to the Senate filibuster exclusively for this bill. Essentially, what he's going to propose is that senators can talk twice as long, elongating this. Now, Vice President Harris serves as president of the Senate. She was here just a few minutes ago. She has left. In order to execute this nuclear option, you need 51 votes. Here's the problem, Democrats only have votes on their side. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema will vote no. So even if they were here to vote yes, then you would need Kamala Harris to break the tie.

I don't know if he knew what he was saying because it was -- he said that as part of another question and he was a little confused.

      "utterance": "-- live with him. He probably talks to himself a lot. But anyway, here's the thing, president's exactly right. What he said about Russia -- you know, Putin might act and so forth, that was an incredibly provocative statement. It was outrageous. Putin's watching this too, and he's just and he says he's made enormous progress more than any president in history this time. The hell is he talking about? He's the John Tyler of our time, the James Buchanan of our time. More progress? You know what's made the most progress? The regime in Iran, the regime in North Korea, the regime in China, the regime in Russia, they're making a hell of a lot of progress. You know who's making progress? Illegal aliens are making progress. They're making a lot of progress. There's like two Americas here. The Democrat Party that lives in this sort of cocoon and the rest of the nation. There's inflation. He says it's no big deal. We didn't talk about heat (ph) in schools today, crime people have mentioned, that's true. The borders totally out of control, the issues that affect Americans across the board. He talks about -- well, we voted to spend this, and we voted to spend this, and we passed this law and we did this law, because that's how these clowns in the Democrat Party in Washington, D.C. think. You passed the law so my life is better? No, that's not the way it worked. And he talked about other things he seemed to suggest if the Democrats lose in the midterm election, then it's not legitimate. He was specifically asked, the upcoming election won't be fair, fairly conducted, quote/unquote, without passing the voting rights bill. This is not a voting rights bill. Can anybody tell me a single provision that actually protects voting rights? They keep talking about the Republicans don't want blacks to vote. This is poisonous, cancerous language. Tell me, where all these people that can't vote? Where's the class action lawsuit that's been brought in federal court? Where the lawsuits have been brought under the 1965 Civil Rights Act? For all these people who couldn't vote? You can vote. I'm going to tell you how to vote. You want me to do a public service announcement, Sean? Get off your ass on election day and go to the precinct and vote. There, I did it. So every election prior to this one has been illegitimate, you see. So the election of Barack Obama was illegitimate? And it's amazing thing -- Concha touched on it -- Donald Trump's brings up the election. Some of his supporters bring it up. Some of the Republican legislatures, they have real serious substantive issues. Joe Biden in anticipation of the Democrats losing the House and maybe the Senate has already said effectively this election will be illegitimate. In 2016, they try to depose an elected -- a legitimately elected president. No commission on that with Russia collusion. The FBI, the intelligence agencies, the Democrat Party, Hillary Clinton, law firms, slip and fall lawyers, all involved in it, 2016. But you can't talk about 2020. Look, I think the president will be better off and I really do slamming away on Joe Biden and his agenda. Donald Trump had a fantastically successful presidency in four years time. This is one of the things that drives the left in the media nuts, a fantastically successful president. Despite the war against him, despite these Never Trumpers led by McConnell and others trying to undermine him, I don't think we've ever seen anything like that. In fact, Joe Biden's wrong. He says enormous progress more than any president in history at this time. No, Trump did more than any president in history at this time. All right. I hear the music. So, Joe and I are going to leave. That's it."

In this case, he said voter suppression happens because of Republicans and then he says the 2020 election was an amazing record turnout. So in just literally like 20 seconds, he contradicted and negated the need for this voting bill.

Now we understand why the Democrats hit him in a basement, chased him chained him to a radiator next to an old solo flex, because they knew that more is bad. The thing is, it's actually -- it's actually -- I feel bad. It's not his fault in a way. To me, he seems wistful and done. So when you talk to him about the big issues that Americans face, crime especially, no mention of crime, the economy, inflation, the cost of food. He's at a point in his life where you know what, that stuff's going to pass, because his most of his life is behind him, so he's wistful and he's done and he's not bothered by the things that bother most of America because for his -- you know, these are -- these are the twilight years, right?

Now, the lawsuit stems from a post that Baldwin shared on Instagram earlier this month. That is after he gave $5,000 to the widow of Rylee to help with their newborn daughter, but after Baldwin discovered that McCollum's sister was pictured at the Washington monument on January the 6th, Baldwin wrote to her, quote, when I sent the money for your late brother, out of real respect for his service to this country, I did not know you were a January 6th rioter. Roice McCollum then responded, protesting is perfectly legal in the country and I have already had my sit down with the FBI, thanks, have a nice day. Baldwin then went on to repost her photo and called Roice an insurrectionist, to his 2.4 million Instagram followers, which prompted a wave of hateful and threatening comments. We reached out to Baldwin for comment. Shockingly, aren't surprised we have not heard back. Here with more is Roice McCollum and her attorney Dennis Postiglione is with us. Thank you both.
