The Senate Intelligence Committee had just asked in a series of questions about his practice of writing memos, who had access to them, who he has transmitted information about those memos to, and he declined to answer that.

I think he failed but I think that was his motive. Here there is one question -- did the president obstruct justice? That's what everybody is waiting for. I don't think there's anything of great interest other than that.  And his answer I think is going to be obvious.

We need the travel ban as an extra level of safety.\" Then in the morning, 5:25, \"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!\" \"The Justice Department should have stayed with the original travel ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\" Supreme Court. \"The Justice Department should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the Supreme Court and seek much tougher version.\" \"In any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political.\" In reaction to this, George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, said, quote, \"These tweets may make some people feel better but they certainly won't help OSG get five votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters.

But listen, I think the interesting conclusion from today was you can add Donald Trump to the list of people who are frustrated with the actions of Donald Trump and his administration. You've got Trump saying that he didn't like this watered down travel ban that he watered down himself. You have got him talking about how frustrated he is that he doesn't have -- it's taking forever to get ambassadors. You had him considering using executive privilege to try to keep his former FBI director from testifying. That's a little bit difficult when you fired someone because executive privilege is easier to use to keep someone, a government official from releasing information.

He's the person who signed that. If he had a problem with it, he didn't have to sign that. And there are many areas where the bureaucracy in the administrative state are kind to unaccountable to any source of authority. This is not one of them. This is something where he could have had control over the situation. At the same time, I think there's a little bit too much reaction going on here. He's been calling it a travel ban for a really long time. People act like it just happened again now. He did it after Sean Spicer said it wasn't a travel ban in January. He did it a few days after that.  And also there's a larger issue here which is a bigger discussion about whether countries have the right to have conversations about immigration who's allowed in the country and not. And if they're not allowed to have that in the context of what's happening in London, this is something that is actually to Donald Trump's advantage that he's willing to talk about immigration, he's willing to talk about how immigration affects national security and economic policy and other people aren't.

If, as the president has tweeted today, we already are doing that, then the ban disappears, the rationale evaporates, and what is it all about? It's moot.

I am told that, yes, Trump was aware of tensions with Qatar between Saudi Arabia and some of these Gulf countries with Qatar and the reports about Qatar being too friendly with Iran at the time of the meeting. But they were not aware at this particular advancement was going to happen, that these new documents came out, which of course Qatar is denying.

The Egyptian government is in a war against the brotherhood, Hamas, and it's got Al Qaeda and the Sinai, all of which are supported indirectly or directly by the Qataris. This I think this is Egypt, Saudi Arabia acting together, saying, we now have an umbrella of American protection, a president who supports us. We're going to have to end this game. And the way to end it is to say to the Qataris, you are not free agents. We control the borders, we control your intake of food, we control the sea, we control the airways. We are not going to invade, like North Korea and China, but this is a serious step. This is not just withdrawing ambassadors. You're going to shape up or not.

That does make it a little more delicate. As President Trump has wisely decided to move away from President Obama's policy favoring Iran to the Sunni regions, that is going to naturally cause a conflict with those countries that do have good relations with Iran. So it's really in America's interest that this all be worked out peacefully. I think you heard that with what Tillerson was saying. Please, everybody just kind of work this out.

He's got a good track record of answering questions obliquely in a way that's favorable to him, declining to answer questions that might actually shed light on exactly what's going on at the FBI. So I think that it will be important for both the Republicans and the Democrats to ask really good question. The Senate Intelligence Committee had just asked in a series of questions about his practice of writing memos, who had access to them, who he has transmitted information about those memos to, and he declined to answer that. That is par for the course. Hoping on Thursday we actually get some good answers with Comey."

Part of the reason why Reince Priebus flew back early from the foreign trip was to get their house in order to work on their domestic agenda. And they have made this week infrastructure week. Next week they told us it's going to be workforce development week. So they are trying to stay on message and they're trying to keep reporters feeding us talking points about how they are rebuilding and retraining America. So they're doing their best to keep us focused on the topics that they would like to be talking about, but meanwhile they are preparing."

Since he has left, also that he has been behind the scenes. He has not craved publicity. So I suspect that would be right, as you suggest, that this might not be as exciting as some people are gearing up for it to be, both on that point of the man's personal character, but also because of the context of an ongoing investigation."

      "utterance": "Well, there will be, but he has a history and a talent for navigating, what he says, his remarks, his status, his own history in a way that minimizes its impact. You can interpret everything the last year as a way for the director of the FBI caught in a unique situation with a candidate who's under investigation, a campaign under investigation, a unique situation that put him out in the spotlight as a way to avoid determining the election. I think he failed but I think that was his motive. Here there is one question -- did the president obstruct justice? That's what everybody is waiting for. I don't think there's anything of great interest other than that. And his answer I think is going to be obvious. He will navigate to a point where he says, well, there might have been some pressure, but it's not obstruction. Why? Because if it were obstruction then he's indicting himself."

So what we will hear is something navigating in between and saying, well, it wasn't really pressure. He was speaking on behalf of an associate, a friend. It could be interpreted in various ways. That's what I think is going to happen and that's why I think it's going to be a bust."

I want to go through the tweets really quickly, in chronological order on the travel ban. This is in the wake of the London attack. \"We need to be smart,\" this is Saturday, 6:17 p.m., \"vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban as an extra level of safety.\" Then in the morning, 5:25, \"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!\" \"The Justice Department should have stayed with the original travel ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\" Supreme Court. \"The Justice Department should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the Supreme Court and seek much tougher version.\" \"In any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political.\" In reaction to this, George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, said, quote, \"These tweets may make some people feel better but they certainly won't help OSG get five votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad.\" That is the solicitor general's office making the case to the Supreme Court, Jennifer."

      "speaker": "JACOBS",

The same morning you had Kellyanne Conway on NBC talking about how the press obsesses over everything that the president says on Twitter, you've got her husband saying, listen, this gives ammunition to the other side, to critics to make it more difficult for the solicitor general to make their case. But listen, I think the interesting conclusion from today was you can add Donald Trump to the list of people who are frustrated with the actions of Donald Trump and his administration. You've got Trump saying that he didn't like this watered down travel ban that he watered down himself. You have got him talking about how frustrated he is that he doesn't have -- it's taking forever to get ambassadors. You had him considering using executive privilege to try to keep his former FBI director from testifying. That's a little bit difficult when you fired someone because executive privilege is easier to use to keep someone, a government official from releasing information. And then you've got Trump expressing frustration with what members of his own administration are saying on behalf. So he went on Twitter today to speak for himself."

He's the person who signed that. If he had a problem with it, he didn't have to sign that. And there are many areas where the bureaucracy in the administrative state are kind to unaccountable to any source of authority. This is not one of them. This is something where he could have had control over the situation. At the same time, I think there's a little bit too much reaction going on here. He's been calling it a travel ban for a really long time. People act like it just happened again now. He did it after Sean Spicer said it wasn't a travel ban in January. He did it a few days after that. And also there's a larger issue here which is a bigger discussion about whether countries have the right to have conversations about immigration who's allowed in the country and not. And if they're not allowed to have that in the context of what's happening in London, this is something that is actually to Donald Trump's advantage that he's willing to talk about immigration, he's willing to talk about how immigration affects national security and economic policy and other people aren't. So it's not entirely as out there is people are making it."

This is a process question about whether tweets speak to a White House policy or it's the president on social media.

But as Mollie points out, the idea of the politics, the substance of the executive to be able to protect the American people, firmly I think President Trump does hold the cards there because if you look, for example, what happened in London, and you look at the threat reporting of European passport holders trying to use visa waiver to travel to the United States, behind the scenes, which he's getting briefed on, of course, there's a lot of issues."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "The one tweet among all of these that I think is the most astonishing and got the least amount of coverage is the one where he says we are already doing extreme vetting. The point of the travel ban was to give 90 days during which the administration could redo the vetting procedure and come up with extreme vetting. If, as the president has tweeted today, we already are doing that, then the ban disappears, the rationale evaporates, and what is it all about? It's moot. This undermines the case the administration has before the Supreme Court more than anything else, and it's sitting out there in broad daylight.

And they suggest they are meddling inside other countries. And this is affecting us because as you look, we have a big air base there. We also have an army base that forward deploys material for Central Command. So there are basically two U.S. bases there. And now the question is, what happens? The Qataris put a statement today, saying, \"Qatar has been exposed to an instigation campaign based on allegations that amounted to absolute fabrication that proving that they are premeditated intentions to cause damage to the state. Qatar is an active member of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\" the GCC, \"committed to its charter, respects the sovereignty of other countries, does not in interfere in their internal affairs, and carries out its duties in combating terrorism and extremism.

Remember, Trump called him a longtime friend, said the nations have been longtime friends, talked about selling our beautiful military equipment to Qatar, very warm. I am told that, yes, Trump was aware of tensions with Qatar between Saudi Arabia and some of these Gulf countries with Qatar and the reports about Qatar being too friendly with Iran at the time of the meeting. But they were not aware at this particular advancement was going to happen, that these new documents came out, which of course Qatar is denying. But I was told by a couple of officials that, yes, Trump would like to see the Arab states united. He would. But this is also, they said, demonstrative of these countries taking President Trump seriously when he said you need to isolate Iran. So that is how they are seeing it as the silver lining."

Here is our pay back to you in reciprocity. I think the interesting thing is, though, about threatening the potential relationship going forward with Qatar is that in that sense, in this development, there is a multilateral diplomatic success here for President Trump because you can be sure that nations in Europe, for example, and the NATO defense spending, which might seem peripheral, will also pay attention if the United States is saying everything is -- we are shaking the board here but in a way that might not be so good for you because we're the superpower."

But right now I think what we are seeing out of the Gulf States deciding that the double game, the dirty game the Qataris have been playing for 30 years, which is to play the Iranian side and the Arab side. Also, within the Sunni world, to play the terrorists, they support the Muslim Brotherhood. They have given indirect to Al Qaeda, to ISIS, they support Hamas. The Egyptian government is in a war against the brotherhood, Hamas, and it's got Al Qaeda and the Sinai, all of which are supported indirectly or directly by the Qataris. This I think this is Egypt, Saudi Arabia acting together, saying, we now have an umbrella of American protection, a president who supports us. We're going to have to end this game. And the way to end it is to say to the Qataris, you are not free agents. We control the borders, we control your intake of food, we control the sea, we control the airways. We are not going to invade, like North Korea and China, but this is a serious step. This is not just withdrawing ambassadors. You're going to shape up or not. And I think this is a result of the Trump visit. And it's a culmination of a situation which was untenable. Qatar was playing both sides and it has to declare itself. And this is a statement you have got to declare yourself."

Just three years ago there were cuts of diplomatic ties between some of these countries. And Qatar is one of those countries that has very good reason to be playing different sides of the field, as well. They share a large liquid natural gas field with Iran. That does make it a little more delicate. As President Trump has wisely decided to move away from President Obama's policy favoring Iran to the Sunni regions, that is going to naturally cause a conflict with those countries that do have good relations with Iran. So it's really in America's interest that this all be worked out peacefully. I think you heard that with what Tillerson was saying. Please, everybody just kind of work this out. They did it three years ago when they got some commitments from Qatar in terms of not finding the Muslim Brotherhood so much. But they need to do more quickly."
