We have a lot more of this coming up tonight. Also tonight, the President of the United States Donald Trump will join us  for an exclusive one-on-one interview. We'll talk about the nonstop, never  ending hysteria on the left, the lies about his coronavirus response, the double standard, the hypocrisy that is frankly never ending. It hasn't  ended in four years.   The violence from Biden supporters and in Democratic-run cities, and blue states, and so much more. Also, our own Lawrence Jones will be here with the full report, a rare  Biden campaign stop today in the state of Michigan, but get this, more than  -- they have more Trump supporter's showing up than Biden fans. Does anyone actually like Joe Biden? Does anyone, you know, get excited by Joe Biden?   We'll have a report tonight. First, we begin with something I call, this is now the insanity season.  Fifty-five days away from a tipping point election, the lying, the smears,  the slander, buckle up, the hysteria is not reaching a fever pitch, and with just 55 days until you become the ultimate jury, the anti-Trump insanity is going to be nonstop.   I hate to report it will only get worse in the days and nights to come,  leading to what is, to me, the tipping point election in this country. There is a well-coordinated, a newly manufactured scandal, pretty much  every hour of every single day. For the past few hours, this crisis of the  day involved a series of interviews between author Bob Woodward and President Trump. Most of that hysteria surrounds this moment when the  president talked about the seriousness of COVID-19 on February 7th. Let's listen in.",

Trump haters, the media mob are now accusing the president of hiding the  truth about the deadly virus from the American people. Why did he put the  travel ban in effect if he wasn't taking it seriously?  Even have a \"Washington Post\" accusing him of misleading the public. Well, it would actually be the media mob lying to you, as they have for four  consecutive years. Remember, they are the one that peddled one conspiracy theory, one hoax one right after another, they never corrected the record, they've never admitted they are wrong. The media lies on a daily basis. They are nothing but state-run Democratic  socialist TV and print. This is just the latest political smear.  Here are the facts. By the time that interview was conducted on February the 7th, the president had already taken what was in unprecedented steps to protect the American people.  Again, January 31st of this year, only 10 days after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States, which was January 21st, President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency. He also announced an unprecedented travel ban to and from China. On the same day, the president   ordered the first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years in this country. Shortly thereafter, the president formed a task force, he filled it with top scientific and medical professionals led by the vice president of the United States.  On March 11th, the president extended the travel ban to most of Europe. These were serious, severe, quick actions by the president. He took it seriously.  According to public health officials, they saved countless American lives and prevented untold suffering and death. On February 1st, Joe Biden, the day after the president but the travel ban in effect, he suggested that travel ban was racist. He called it hysterical, xenophobia, and fearmongering. On April 3rd, this is 62 days later, Joe Biden now, as per usual, you know, like on fracking and nonviolent protests, well, he reversed course.  A campaign surrogate announced the Biden now supported the travel ban that he had called the day after it was implemented, hysterical, xenophobic, and fearmongering. And tonight, let's play it again, brand-new bombshell video, Joe Biden, February 28th, telling a crowd not to panic over the coronavirus. Now, that's a month after Donald Trump already implemented the travel ban that he opposed and called xenophobic. Take a look.",

The plan was a few paragraphs long and included things that the president was already doing. Perhaps he was taking his daily nap and missing with the president was doing. All the while, Joe Biden was campaigning without a mask, he was hugging, he  was touching, speaking closely to the view Biden supporters that actually showed up at those few events. It wasn't until June the 26th, then Biden called for a national mask mandate. And then, by the way, September 2nd, after getting a lot of blowback for his mandate, Biden reversed course yet again, and said he did not actually support federally mandated mask wearing. OK. Clearly, there is one candidate playing politics with the pandemic, even  Biden admits the worst in 100 years, and it's not President Trump. If Joe Biden were in charge, it's not a question of if more Americans would have contracted the virus and died, but how many hundreds of thousands more Americans would've contracted this virus? How many more thousands would have died? And, by the way, it wasn't just Joe Biden. Nearly every powerful Democrat in America was playing down the coronavirus, all while trying to score  cheap political points against President Trump. In other words, typical day in the swamp.

      "sentences": "Now, while Democrats and the media mob spin in circles -- well, let's look at some perspective with a brief \"Hannity\" history lesson. As many of you know, all four of my grandparents, I talked about them a lot, they all came to this country from Ireland at the turn of the last century. They didn't have any money. My own parents, they grew up or during the Great Depression, my dad spent four years fighting in the Pacific in World War II, but during the time they were growing up and the Great Depression, unemployment was nearly 25 percent. GDP down 30 percent, 2 million Americans were homeless, the stock market down 90 percent, people's life savings were wiped out, average incomes were down by 40 percent. And in every city, every town, there was soup lines around the block. My parents, like millions of other Americans, they struggled. Those were tough times, they were poor. Did President Roosevelt fan the flames of misery? Did he call for panic and anxiety? No, he actually rallied a nation in a time of need. He focused on making Americans stronger by staying positive, and he got to work and he rolled up his sleeves. During World War II, with the country on the brink, FDR proclaimed we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Well, those were brutally tough times. The media attack him? Of course not. What about in the aftermath 9/11, 2001, two days, what was President Bush supposed to say? America is going down in flames, you better go hide in your basement bunker? Of course not. The president's job is to maintain order, and by the way, right the ship during and after a crisis, not spread panic, not spreading fear among the population. Let's make one thing perfectly clear, President Trump has never misled or distorted the truth about this deadly disease. No, he acted faster than anyone else. Don't take my word for it. Let's listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci. Dr. Fauci, I have a lot of respect for him, and guess what, he is very well respected, especially by Democrats on the left. Well, guess what? Here's what Dr. Fauci had to say about the pandemic on February 29th. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Well, yeah, but he went over the top today and the fact that the media didn't call him to count or doesn't seem to see any problem with that. I've got three points I want to make, and I got a three board tonight. We've got a record going here. First of all, I was intrigued by his rhetoric in his speech. He said the president failed to do his job on purpose. That is to say, the president wanted people to die, he wanted them to get sick, and he did it on purpose. He said, this is a life and death betrayal. I mean, that's really over the top. He said, experts say if the president acted one week earlier, 36,000 lives would have been saved. Earlier in the year, he was saying, if the president had listened to what I was saying in January, he had acted one week earlier, 36,000 lives would have been saved. \"The Washington Post\" said this was completely inaccurate. This was not accurate. He said the recession was created by Trump's negligence, so it is not the responsibility of the coronavirus, it's Trump who created the recession. And how did the president create that? By shutting down the economy as the science told him to do and have us quarantine at home, would Joe Biden have said, no, we should -- we should not do that? I mean, is he going to listen to the science or not? So, he deliberately attacks the president in an over-the-top way. Here's the more important point to me: I'm interested, what did Joe Biden know, and when did he know it, and what was he thinking at the time this coronavirus came on? Because right now, he is saying, President Trump did everything wrong, I'm a genius, if you would only listen to me, if I'd only been in charge. So, I'm interested in, what did Joe Biden say during -- as this came on, and what did the people around him advising him say? January 27, he writes an op-ed, says this is a dangerous disease, and here's my plan. In 2021, after I'm elected, we are going to set up a public health emergency fund, we are going to give the president the power to declare a pandemic disaster, emergency, which he already has, and we're going to set up what he called the global health services to help countries around the world. Does any of that sound like this guy was confronting what we were facing at that point? That was the 27th of January. On the 31st, Trump puts in the China ban, and you know what he said. He said this is a xenophobic, this is racist. On the 28th, two days before, three days before Trump puts in the travel ban, Ron Klain, who's a big advisor to him on health issues says, if he does, this would be premature. On the 30th, the day before, Zeke Emanuel, who is a top health care advisor to him and constantly being heard, says, stop -- stop panicking over the prospect of what the coronavirus is going to do. Stop panicking, he says. On the second -- excuse me, on the 6th of February, he had an expert, a guy named Irwin Redlener said the idea that this is going to be a serious pandemic is not likely and the odds of it being a lethal form is negligible. That was the guy advising Joe Biden. On the 11th and 13th, we hear from Klain. Klain says: This is not serious, we don't face a health epidemic, we face a, quote, \"fear epidemic\" -- attacking President Trump for raising concerns about it unnecessarily. On the 20th, Zeke Emanuel says this is all an overreaction. We then have Nancy Pelosi go out and say, come to Chinatown, don't worry about this. That happened on the 23rd. On the 29th, Zeke Emanuel says, you know what, the masks aren't going to work, don't use a mask. This is the day the first American dies from coronavirus and they are on television, don't worry, don't go out and run and get a mask, it's not going to do any good. And then on the 12th, as President Trump is putting into place a travel ban on Europe, Lisa Monaco, a top advisor to Biden, and Biden himself go out and double-team on the issue of the European travel ban and say we don't need to do this, this is premature. We don't hear the word mask from Biden, we don't hear the word social distancing from Biden. We don't hear the idea of a lockdown. We don't even hear the idea of invoking the National Defense Production Act in order to get control of the PPE problem that the Biden Obama administration created by not refilling our stockpiles. We don't hear those until after the middle of March when President Trump is already talking about all of those things. So I'm sitting here saying, here is a guy lecturing the country, saying Donald Trump killed people deliberately, and if he'd only listen to me, would he and his people are not saying we need to shut down the economy, we need to have everybody wear a mask, we need to quarantine in place, we need to do this, we need to do that. In fact, they are saying, that's a fear epidemic and the idea that this is going to be a serious pandemic is very unlikely. Final point, final point: this guy is tone-deaf. What value is a promise? What is the worth of a president's word? Does he do what he says he's going to do? We have a different philosophy when it comes to giving our word. Well, I remember Joe Biden being the guy who said we got shovel-ready jobs when we were talking about the stimulus bill in 2011. I remember him joining in all of those lies that were told to sell Obamacare. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when he ran for president in 1987 and got kicked out of the race because he was caught plagiarizing his speeches from the Labour Party leader of Great Britain. I even remember when he was running around the countryside saying I had a full scholarship to Syracuse Law School, I graduated at the top of my class, and it turned out he got a half scholarship for need, and was near the bottom of his class. I remember when that got caught up. So, here is a guy lecturing about President Trump, he said I have a different philosophy about what your word means when he has lied to the American people he was vice president, and lied to the American people when he first ran for president in 1987, and lied about his academic background I got caught on it a national television before that. So, please, can we have just a little bit of humility? Can we -- can we just sort of take a step back from these grandiose, you know, President Trump the literately killed people? Can we really, you know, President Trump doesn't know how to tell the truth, we have a different standard -- can we please step back and look at ourselves first? I mean, this is just over the top.",

It wasn't a big deal. I speak to him, and let's see. I don't know if the book is good or bad. I have no idea. Probably, almost definitely won't read it, because I don't have time to read it. But I gave it a little bit of a shot. Sounds like it's not going to be good. But if you look at what I said today, I said, don't panic. We don't want to be jumping up and down and going wild. Don't panic. I'm a cheerleader for this country. And I don't want to see panic. And I thought what Matt said was fantastic, because we would have lost two million, 2.5 million lives, instead of the number we're talking about. Anything above one is no good. It's no good.

But, as usual, with the books he writes, that didn't work out too well, perhaps. I don't know. Maybe it was -- maybe it's good. Who knows? But, as far as the timing is concerned, I did something very important, as you know. At the end of January, I banned -- I banned China, because -- the people from China, because they were heavily infected. And I had a lot of people, including Dr. Fauci -- and I don't say that with disrespect. I -- it's really what he believed. But a lot of people believed that, that we shouldn't ban them, it was no reason to ban them. And Biden was going around for many, many weeks after that saying, it's not even going to be a problem. You covered it incredibly. Actually, Karl Rove covered that incredibly tonight, and just incredibly, actually. And they were all going around, no problem, no problem, everybody, practically everybody. Nobody had any idea it would be as violent as it turned out to be. And we studied it. We understand it. Now we're opening up. But we could have lost two million, 2.5 million, maybe even more than that, if we did it a different way. And we have done a really good job. But, if you look at our numbers, our fatality numbers compared to other countries, we're in -- we're in really - - I mean, it's amazing, what we have done.

If I wasn't here, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. You wouldn't have a right to guns. You would -- whether you had it or it was just almost totally obliterated, but it would be in a very different form than you have right now. I've kept it totally as it was, and it's, you know, something I'm very proud of, and people -- I think it's a real voting issue, Second Amendment. Life, you look at that. So these judges are going to be making massive decisions. And the next president is going to get one, two, three, or four justices of the Supreme Court. I have two. That's actually considered a lot. You've had many -- you've had many presidents, frankly, where they didn't have -- I think they had none, many of them had none. You know, they stay on there a long time. You don't have many, and they stay on there for a long time. So, you've had presidents with none that have been there for a long period of time. But I've already had two. And you could have, literally, anywhere from one to four additional. That changes the entire fabric of the nation for many years. You know, they are on the court for 25, 30, 40 years, depending on the age, depending on what age you choose. And frankly, most of them are young, because you want to pick young, you want them on as long as you can have them on. So, it's a very, very important thing that's happening. And I felt that I should announce the list -- and from which I will only pick. So, we had 22 or 23, and now, I added 20. So we have about 43. And it will only be from that list that I'll pick, whether it's one, two, three, or four, it will only be from that list. So everyone can look at that list, and they'll be happy or not happy. Joe has to put up a list. This is something that I came up with the last election. I think it might be one of the reasons for my success in the election, because people weren't sure who would I pick. And I actually put out a list of 20, and then 25, and I said, only from that list. Well, only from this list and the previous list will I pick. Joe has to come up now with a list. He should come up with a list. Otherwise, people can't vote for him. But the reason he possibly won't is because he's going to come up with far radical left judges. I mean, these will be people that are very, very far to the left, that are, you know, revolutionary in a sense, I think, and he's got to come up with them. I don't know that they're going to allow, because they control him totally. They control Joe Biden. He's not controlled -- he is not in control of himself. He is controlled by the radical left, it's a very dangerous part of our society, and he is totally controlled. And he is not going to be able to name Democrats judges that are in the middle someplace, or normalized, you know, people that are, like, normal people. He will be forced to pick extremely radical left judges, and I don't think you can get elected if you do that. If you do what he has to do, which is name the judges that he's going to pick, or the justices, soon to be, that he's going to pick, I don't think it's -- I don't think he would be electable. So he's got a real problem.",

They made up the story.

It was raining as hard as I've ever seen it rain. And it was foggy, so foggy you couldn't see anything. It was serious Paris fog. And like you couldn't see anything. So I knew immediately you couldn't take the helicopter. The drive would have been a very long one which I would have been -- I had nothing else to do. I went there for that.

It took -- you saw it, 45 minutes to one hour, and it was all over. This was going on for weeks. And we would do the same thing -- we were ready to go into Seattle. They took over 20 percent of the city, a big chunk in the middle of the city. And they heard -- we told them we're coming in. And then, they sent their police. And their police are fine. They're good, if they let them do what they are supposed to be doing. But they don't do that. These -- they are all Democrat-run cities. And they're not a well-run.

And you need that, it is basically your fossil fuels, your energies. We would have to close many of the plants, a big percentage of the plants in our country if we didn't do this. We have these massive plants and they are not going to run by wind. And they're not going to run by solar at this point, and maybe at no point. But we have natural gas, which is really very environmentally friendly. We have all sorts of things. We are the number one in the world now in energy. We've done a great job with energy. And you look at what you are paying, a price per gallon at your car, people are saying it's unbelievable, they're paying less than $2 in many cases, and going down, even. And they can't believe how well we have done. We don't need to be in the Middle East other than for the protection of Israel. There is no reason to be there from the standpoint of oil. But we have allies, Saudi Arabia and others, that have been really spend a lot of money here, and treat us well, and, you know, will take care of a lot of our people. We have some very good allies over there. And Israel, of course, we help Israel a lot. We took out Soleimani. We took out -- a lot of problems, they were having over there, or they would have without us. Without us, I don't think any of them would survive for very long. So but we don't need it for energy anymore. We are energy independent. It is an incredible feeling. I guess it's the first time we have ever been, or at least for many, many decades, energy independent. And you look at the price of energy, if Biden ever got in -- he was talking about no fracking, very strongly, and his super liberal running mate, who is the most liberal person, more so than Bernie, rated the most liberal in all of the Senate, Kamala, if you look at what she said about fracking, there won't be any fossil fuels, there won't be any fracking. And they are all disciples of AOC, and AOC plus three. And it is ridiculous. But they constantly talk about no fracking. Then all of a sudden, he sees his poll numbers going down, and he sees, you know, Texas wants oil, I say, they are against guns. They are against oil. And they are against religion. That doesn't do well in Texas or Pennsylvania or North Carolina, or just about any other place that I can think of. And it's -- you know, it's incredible. But they will change in an instant and pretend like nothing ever happened. They'll say, oh, no, I'm OK with fracking. He said it the other day. Biden said it the other day. He said, no, no, no, fracking is OK. We are going to grandfather it. We are going to do something with it, but fracking is OK. And yet he just ran for months and months of where he is fighting fracking. And she -- I don't think she could possibly say it, she has been fighting it for years. But the bottom line, they will go back to where they come from. Where they come from is no oil, no fracking, no drilling. Religion, look at what they are doing to religion. They don't let your churches open. They let a casino open. But they won't let your churches open. They will let protesters protest in the streets without masks by the thousands. But they won't let your churches open. So there -- it's religion, it's oil, and it's guns. And those three items alone, how can anybody even run? George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, as a combo, as a combination, couldn't win. But this is what we're up against. They change their view. But where they are going from, and where they are going to is where they originally came from. And that is none of this stuff, you are not going to frack, you are not going to have energy. And our nation is going to have one of the best years it ever had next year. Last year was the best year we've ever had. Next year is going to be better.

We have a lot more of this coming up tonight. Also tonight, the President of the United States Donald Trump will join us for an exclusive one-on-one interview. We'll talk about the nonstop, never ending hysteria on the left, the lies about his coronavirus response, the double standard, the hypocrisy that is frankly never ending. It hasn't ended in four years. The violence from Biden supporters and in Democratic-run cities, and blue states, and so much more. Also, our own Lawrence Jones will be here with the full report, a rare Biden campaign stop today in the state of Michigan, but get this, more than -- they have more Trump supporter's showing up than Biden fans. Does anyone actually like Joe Biden? Does anyone, you know, get excited by Joe Biden? We'll have a report tonight. First, we begin with something I call, this is now the insanity season. Fifty-five days away from a tipping point election, the lying, the smears, the slander, buckle up, the hysteria is not reaching a fever pitch, and with just 55 days until you become the ultimate jury, the anti-Trump insanity is going to be nonstop. I hate to report it will only get worse in the days and nights to come, leading to what is, to me, the tipping point election in this country. There is a well-coordinated, a newly manufactured scandal, pretty much every hour of every single day. For the past few hours, this crisis of the day involved a series of interviews between author Bob Woodward and President Trump. Most of that hysteria surrounds this moment when the president talked about the seriousness of COVID-19 on February 7th. Let's listen in."

Trump haters, the media mob are now accusing the president of hiding the truth about the deadly virus from the American people. Why did he put the travel ban in effect if he wasn't taking it seriously? Even have a \"Washington Post\" accusing him of misleading the public. Well, it would actually be the media mob lying to you, as they have for four consecutive years. Remember, they are the one that peddled one conspiracy theory, one hoax one right after another, they never corrected the record, they've never admitted they are wrong. The media lies on a daily basis. They are nothing but state-run Democratic socialist TV and print. This is just the latest political smear. Here are the facts. By the time that interview was conducted on February the 7th, the president had already taken what was in unprecedented steps to protect the American people. Again, January 31st of this year, only 10 days after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States, which was January 21st, President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency. He also announced an unprecedented travel ban to and from China. On the same day, the president ordered the first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years in this country. Shortly thereafter, the president formed a task force, he filled it with top scientific and medical professionals led by the vice president of the United States. On March 11th, the president extended the travel ban to most of Europe. These were serious, severe, quick actions by the president. He took it seriously. According to public health officials, they saved countless American lives and prevented untold suffering and death. On February 1st, Joe Biden, the day after the president but the travel ban in effect, he suggested that travel ban was racist. He called it hysterical, xenophobia, and fearmongering. On April 3rd, this is 62 days later, Joe Biden now, as per usual, you know, like on fracking and nonviolent protests, well, he reversed course. A campaign surrogate announced the Biden now supported the travel ban that he had called the day after it was implemented, hysterical, xenophobic, and fearmongering. And tonight, let's play it again, brand-new bombshell video, Joe Biden, February 28th, telling a crowd not to panic over the coronavirus. Now, that's a month after Donald Trump already implemented the travel ban that he opposed and called xenophobic. Take a look."

The plan was a few paragraphs long and included things that the president was already doing. Perhaps he was taking his daily nap and missing with the president was doing. All the while, Joe Biden was campaigning without a mask, he was hugging, he was touching, speaking closely to the view Biden supporters that actually showed up at those few events. It wasn't until June the 26th, then Biden called for a national mask mandate. And then, by the way, September 2nd, after getting a lot of blowback for his mandate, Biden reversed course yet again, and said he did not actually support federally mandated mask wearing. OK. Clearly, there is one candidate playing politics with the pandemic, even Biden admits the worst in 100 years, and it's not President Trump. If Joe Biden were in charge, it's not a question of if more Americans would have contracted the virus and died, but how many hundreds of thousands more Americans would've contracted this virus? How many more thousands would have died? And, by the way, it wasn't just Joe Biden. Nearly every powerful Democrat in America was playing down the coronavirus, all while trying to score cheap political points against President Trump. In other words, typical day in the swamp.

      "utterance": "Now, while Democrats and the media mob spin in circles -- well, let's look at some perspective with a brief \"Hannity\" history lesson. As many of you know, all four of my grandparents, I talked about them a lot, they all came to this country from Ireland at the turn of the last century. They didn't have any money. My own parents, they grew up or during the Great Depression, my dad spent four years fighting in the Pacific in World War II, but during the time they were growing up and the Great Depression, unemployment was nearly 25 percent. GDP down 30 percent, 2 million Americans were homeless, the stock market down 90 percent, people's life savings were wiped out, average incomes were down by 40 percent. And in every city, every town, there was soup lines around the block. My parents, like millions of other Americans, they struggled. Those were tough times, they were poor. Did President Roosevelt fan the flames of misery? Did he call for panic and anxiety? No, he actually rallied a nation in a time of need. He focused on making Americans stronger by staying positive, and he got to work and he rolled up his sleeves. During World War II, with the country on the brink, FDR proclaimed we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Well, those were brutally tough times. The media attack him? Of course not. What about in the aftermath 9/11, 2001, two days, what was President Bush supposed to say? America is going down in flames, you better go hide in your basement bunker? Of course not. The president's job is to maintain order, and by the way, right the ship during and after a crisis, not spread panic, not spreading fear among the population. Let's make one thing perfectly clear, President Trump has never misled or distorted the truth about this deadly disease. No, he acted faster than anyone else. Don't take my word for it. Let's listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci. Dr. Fauci, I have a lot of respect for him, and guess what, he is very well respected, especially by Democrats on the left. Well, guess what? Here's what Dr. Fauci had to say about the pandemic on February 29th. Take a look."

You've got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don't need to change anything you're doing.

Constantly at state of confusion, seems to be using the teleprompter, move that up a little bit, something is obviously wrong, but the media, and, of course, Democrats, they want us all to ignore the obvious truth.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, yeah, but he went over the top today and the fact that the media didn't call him to count or doesn't seem to see any problem with that. I've got three points I want to make, and I got a three board tonight. We've got a record going here. First of all, I was intrigued by his rhetoric in his speech. He said the president failed to do his job on purpose. That is to say, the president wanted people to die, he wanted them to get sick, and he did it on purpose. He said, this is a life and death betrayal. I mean, that's really over the top. He said, experts say if the president acted one week earlier, 36,000 lives would have been saved. Earlier in the year, he was saying, if the president had listened to what I was saying in January, he had acted one week earlier, 36,000 lives would have been saved. \"The Washington Post\" said this was completely inaccurate. This was not accurate. He said the recession was created by Trump's negligence, so it is not the responsibility of the coronavirus, it's Trump who created the recession. And how did the president create that? By shutting down the economy as the science told him to do and have us quarantine at home, would Joe Biden have said, no, we should -- we should not do that? I mean, is he going to listen to the science or not? So, he deliberately attacks the president in an over-the-top way. Here's the more important point to me: I'm interested, what did Joe Biden know, and when did he know it, and what was he thinking at the time this coronavirus came on? Because right now, he is saying, President Trump did everything wrong, I'm a genius, if you would only listen to me, if I'd only been in charge. So, I'm interested in, what did Joe Biden say during -- as this came on, and what did the people around him advising him say? January 27, he writes an op-ed, says this is a dangerous disease, and here's my plan. In 2021, after I'm elected, we are going to set up a public health emergency fund, we are going to give the president the power to declare a pandemic disaster, emergency, which he already has, and we're going to set up what he called the global health services to help countries around the world. Does any of that sound like this guy was confronting what we were facing at that point? That was the 27th of January. On the 31st, Trump puts in the China ban, and you know what he said. He said this is a xenophobic, this is racist. On the 28th, two days before, three days before Trump puts in the travel ban, Ron Klain, who's a big advisor to him on health issues says, if he does, this would be premature. On the 30th, the day before, Zeke Emanuel, who is a top health care advisor to him and constantly being heard, says, stop -- stop panicking over the prospect of what the coronavirus is going to do. Stop panicking, he says. On the second -- excuse me, on the 6th of February, he had an expert, a guy named Irwin Redlener said the idea that this is going to be a serious pandemic is not likely and the odds of it being a lethal form is negligible. That was the guy advising Joe Biden. On the 11th and 13th, we hear from Klain. Klain says: This is not serious, we don't face a health epidemic, we face a, quote, \"fear epidemic\" -- attacking President Trump for raising concerns about it unnecessarily. On the 20th, Zeke Emanuel says this is all an overreaction. We then have Nancy Pelosi go out and say, come to Chinatown, don't worry about this. That happened on the 23rd. On the 29th, Zeke Emanuel says, you know what, the masks aren't going to work, don't use a mask. This is the day the first American dies from coronavirus and they are on television, don't worry, don't go out and run and get a mask, it's not going to do any good. And then on the 12th, as President Trump is putting into place a travel ban on Europe, Lisa Monaco, a top advisor to Biden, and Biden himself go out and double-team on the issue of the European travel ban and say we don't need to do this, this is premature. We don't hear the word mask from Biden, we don't hear the word social distancing from Biden. We don't hear the idea of a lockdown. We don't even hear the idea of invoking the National Defense Production Act in order to get control of the PPE problem that the Biden Obama administration created by not refilling our stockpiles. We don't hear those until after the middle of March when President Trump is already talking about all of those things. So I'm sitting here saying, here is a guy lecturing the country, saying Donald Trump killed people deliberately, and if he'd only listen to me, would he and his people are not saying we need to shut down the economy, we need to have everybody wear a mask, we need to quarantine in place, we need to do this, we need to do that. In fact, they are saying, that's a fear epidemic and the idea that this is going to be a serious pandemic is very unlikely."

We have a different philosophy when it comes to giving our word. Well, I remember Joe Biden being the guy who said we got shovel-ready jobs when we were talking about the stimulus bill in 2011. I remember him joining in all of those lies that were told to sell Obamacare. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when he ran for president in 1987 and got kicked out of the race because he was caught plagiarizing his speeches from the Labour Party leader of Great Britain. I even remember when he was running around the countryside saying I had a full scholarship to Syracuse Law School, I graduated at the top of my class, and it turned out he got a half scholarship for need, and was near the bottom of his class. I remember when that got caught up. So, here is a guy lecturing about President Trump, he said I have a different philosophy about what your word means when he has lied to the American people he was vice president, and lied to the American people when he first ran for president in 1987, and lied about his academic background I got caught on it a national television before that. So, please, can we have just a little bit of humility? Can we -- can we just sort of take a step back from these grandiose, you know, President Trump the literately killed people? Can we really, you know, President Trump doesn't know how to tell the truth, we have a different standard -- can we please step back and look at ourselves first? I mean, this is just over the top."

You set up the task force, Birx and Fauci, the CDC, the NIH were out there every day giving the recommendations, far more restrictive than what Joe Biden laid out. And here's what I would be doing, early vote, right now, in Florida, I'm going to give you an example. The early vote is at 4.8 million ballots have been requested as of today in Florida. That's 2.5 times where we were in 2016. The campaign should be spending five times the money on TV, telling the American people, just like you laid out in your monologue, the real story of coronavirus. Do not get outflanked, do not let anyone rewrite your history, and go on offense, no defense. That's what I would do."

When he takes aggressive action, they call him a racist. A great nation cannot respond to a pandemic by panicking or hiding in the bunker. President Trump had a well-executed, focused plan, initial estimates said that 2 million people could have died from the coronavirus, it is going to be far less than that, and we're going to have an economy capable of rebounding because we have had strong leadership of President Trump."

But let's go to the things that Karl Rove was pointing out that Biden said today. Ten days after the first identified case, 10 days, you put the travel ban in effect. And it was a subsequent ban, the first quarantine in over 50 years. He said it was hysterical, xenophobia, and fearmongering on your part. Two-and-a-half months later, he reversed himself, at least according to a campaign ad. Why -- what do you believe that one decision, at 10 days after the first case in America, what impact did that have, and what were you saying to Bob Woodward?"

      "speaker": "TRUMP",

He even did it on Obama, but constant hit jobs. On Bush, I guess they did three books. They were all terrible. So, I figured, you know, let's just give it a little shot. I'll speak to him. It wasn't a big deal. I speak to him, and let's see. I don't know if the book is good or bad. I have no idea. Probably, almost definitely won't read it, because I don't have time to read it. But I gave it a little bit of a shot. Sounds like it's not going to be good. But if you look at what I said today, I said, don't panic. We don't want to be jumping up and down and going wild. Don't panic. I'm a cheerleader for this country. And I don't want to see panic. And I thought what Matt said was fantastic, because we would have lost two million, 2.5 million lives, instead of the number we're talking about. Anything above one is no good. It's no good. We can't have it. It was China's fault. They sent this to us. And it's no good. But I thought I'd give the -- Bob Woodward some time. I gave him some time. But, as usual, with the books he writes, that didn't work out too well, perhaps. I don't know. Maybe it was -- maybe it's good. Who knows? But, as far as the timing is concerned, I did something very important, as you know. At the end of January, I banned -- I banned China, because -- the people from China, because they were heavily infected. And I had a lot of people, including Dr. Fauci -- and I don't say that with disrespect. I -- it's really what he believed. But a lot of people believed that, that we shouldn't ban them, it was no reason to ban them. And Biden was going around for many, many weeks after that saying, it's not even going to be a problem. You covered it incredibly. Actually, Karl Rove covered that incredibly tonight, and just incredibly, actually. And they were all going around, no problem, no problem, everybody, practically everybody. Nobody had any idea it would be as violent as it turned out to be. And we studied it. We understand it. Now we're opening up. But we could have lost two million, 2.5 million, maybe even more than that, if we did it a different way. And we have done a really good job. But, if you look at our numbers, our fatality numbers compared to other countries, we're in -- we're in really - - I mean, it's amazing, what we have done. We have been able to do something that a country, especially with the kind of size we're dealing with -- we have done an incredible job."

And the general tone of the questioning was that you misled the country because you told Bob Woodward on February 7, this looks like it's going to be five times as bad as a normal flu virus. I think most Americans may not even know that there are years with the influenza virus that we lose tens of thousands of Americans. It's not uncommon. And -- but your actions just seven days earlier were, you put a travel ban in effect, and a quarantine in effect. Again, it hasn't been done in 50 years. So, actions mean something. And you taking it seriously was very clear then. And then, when you said, well, I don't want people to panic, they say, well, you must have been downplaying it. Wouldn't your actions contradict that narrative?"

But if you look that, and multiply that times five, it's actually more than we lost. Now, we could have lost two million, 2.5 million, as Matt said, if we did it a different way. But what I want to show is, I want to show a calmness. I'm the leader of the country, I can't be jumping up and down and scaring people. I don't want to scare people. I want people not to panic. And that's exactly what I did. And if you look at the representatives of Joe Biden, you see what they were saying. They were saying, no problem, this won't be a problem. He didn't think it was going to be a problem until months later. He was way late. Pelosi was way, way late. And I was at the end of January, far ahead of everybody, because I did something nobody wanted me to do. Nobody wanted me to do the ban on China. And then, as you know, shortly thereafter, I did a ban on Europe. That was, frankly, even more controversial. And that was good, because I saw what was going on in Italy and in Spain and in France. And we did a ban there. And if we didn't do those bans, we would have had numbers that were much, much more. And if we didn't do the shutdown and now the reopening -- and they should do the opening faster. If you look at some of the states, like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, you look at what they're doing, they're taking so -- they're shut down. They're still shut down. Michigan is terrible. It's still shut down. And that's a shame. It's a shame. They don't know what they're doing, frankly."

You know, we're going to have probably over 300 by the end of my first term, which is a record, over 300 federal judges, and Court of Appeals judges, too. So, that's a -- that's a number that nobody thought even possible. And we will have that number, and it'll be all confirmed and done and great. And also, Supreme Court judges or justices. And you -- the whole country, it depends on these decisions, which way you go, whether you have a Second Amendment or not. I mean, the Second Amendment would be under siege. If I wasn't here, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. You wouldn't have a right to guns. You would -- whether you had it or it was just almost totally obliterated, but it would be in a very different form than you have right now. I've kept it totally as it was, and it's, you know, something I'm very proud of, and people -- I think it's a real voting issue, Second Amendment. Life, you look at that. So these judges are going to be making massive decisions. And the next president is going to get one, two, three, or four justices of the Supreme Court. I have two. That's actually considered a lot. You've had many -- you've had many presidents, frankly, where they didn't have -- I think they had none, many of them had none. You know, they stay on there a long time. You don't have many, and they stay on there for a long time. So, you've had presidents with none that have been there for a long period of time. But I've already had two. And you could have, literally, anywhere from one to four additional. That changes the entire fabric of the nation for many years. You know, they are on the court for 25, 30, 40 years, depending on the age, depending on what age you choose. And frankly, most of them are young, because you want to pick young, you want them on as long as you can have them on. So, it's a very, very important thing that's happening. And I felt that I should announce the list -- and from which I will only pick. So, we had 22 or 23, and now, I added 20. So we have about 43. And it will only be from that list that I'll pick, whether it's one, two, three, or four, it will only be from that list. So everyone can look at that list, and they'll be happy or not happy. Joe has to put up a list. This is something that I came up with the last election. I think it might be one of the reasons for my success in the election, because people weren't sure who would I pick. And I actually put out a list of 20, and then 25, and I said, only from that list. Well, only from this list and the previous list will I pick. Joe has to come up now with a list. He should come up with a list. Otherwise, people can't vote for him. But the reason he possibly won't is because he's going to come up with far radical left judges. I mean, these will be people that are very, very far to the left, that are, you know, revolutionary in a sense, I think, and he's got to come up with them. I don't know that they're going to allow, because they control him totally. They control Joe Biden. He's not controlled -- he is not in control of himself. He is controlled by the radical left, it's a very dangerous part of our society, and he is totally controlled. And he is not going to be able to name Democrats judges that are in the middle someplace, or normalized, you know, people that are, like, normal people. He will be forced to pick extremely radical left judges, and I don't think you can get elected if you do that. If you do what he has to do, which is name the judges that he's going to pick, or the justices, soon to be, that he's going to pick, I don't think it's -- I don't think he would be electable. So he's got a real problem."

It was raining as hard as I've ever seen it rain. And it was foggy, so foggy you couldn't see anything. It was serious Paris fog. And like you couldn't see anything. So I knew immediately you couldn't take the helicopter. The drive would have been a very long one which I would have been -- I had nothing else to do. I went there for that. In fact, the next day, I went to another cemetery. And, by the way, it was pouring, but not nearly as hard, but it was pouring and I made a speech in the rain. No umbrellas, no anything.

And you need that, it is basically your fossil fuels, your energies. We would have to close many of the plants, a big percentage of the plants in our country if we didn't do this. We have these massive plants and they are not going to run by wind. And they're not going to run by solar at this point, and maybe at no point. But we have natural gas, which is really very environmentally friendly. We have all sorts of things. We are the number one in the world now in energy. We've done a great job with energy. And you look at what you are paying, a price per gallon at your car, people are saying it's unbelievable, they're paying less than $2 in many cases, and going down, even. And they can't believe how well we have done. We don't need to be in the Middle East other than for the protection of Israel. There is no reason to be there from the standpoint of oil. But we have allies, Saudi Arabia and others, that have been really spend a lot of money here, and treat us well, and, you know, will take care of a lot of our people. We have some very good allies over there. And Israel, of course, we help Israel a lot. We took out Soleimani. We took out -- a lot of problems, they were having over there, or they would have without us. Without us, I don't think any of them would survive for very long. So but we don't need it for energy anymore. We are energy independent. It is an incredible feeling. I guess it's the first time we have ever been, or at least for many, many decades, energy independent. And you look at the price of energy, if Biden ever got in -- he was talking about no fracking, very strongly, and his super liberal running mate, who is the most liberal person, more so than Bernie, rated the most liberal in all of the Senate, Kamala, if you look at what she said about fracking, there won't be any fossil fuels, there won't be any fracking. And they are all disciples of AOC, and AOC plus three. And it is ridiculous. But they constantly talk about no fracking. Then all of a sudden, he sees his poll numbers going down, and he sees, you know, Texas wants oil, I say, they are against guns. They are against oil. And they are against religion. That doesn't do well in Texas or Pennsylvania or North Carolina, or just about any other place that I can think of. And it's -- you know, it's incredible. But they will change in an instant and pretend like nothing ever happened. They'll say, oh, no, I'm OK with fracking. He said it the other day. Biden said it the other day. He said, no, no, no, fracking is OK. We are going to grandfather it. We are going to do something with it, but fracking is OK. And yet he just ran for months and months of where he is fighting fracking. And she -- I don't think she could possibly say it, she has been fighting it for years. But the bottom line, they will go back to where they come from. Where they come from is no oil, no fracking, no drilling. Religion, look at what they are doing to religion. They don't let your churches open. They let a casino open. But they won't let your churches open. They will let protesters protest in the streets without masks by the thousands. But they won't let your churches open. So there -- it's religion, it's oil, and it's guns. And those three items alone, how can anybody even run? George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, as a combo, as a combination, couldn't win. But this is what we're up against. They change their view. But where they are going from, and where they are going to is where they originally came from. And that is none of this stuff, you are not going to frack, you are not going to have energy. And our nation is going to have one of the best years it ever had next year. Last year was the best year we've ever had. Next year is going to be better. And this third quarter coming up, and the numbers are going to be out before the -- before the election, those numbers are going to be fantastic, you watch."

And when you have small races, like a congressional race in New York, with two people, where the ballots are a mess and --"

And this is just a small congressional race --Carolyn Maloney, a small congressional race. And then you look at New Jersey, what happened in Paterson, what happened in Virginia, what happened in a most every place. And these are small little races that are easy to -- you would think it would be very easy, but it's terrible. And now, we are sending out 80 million ballots. And they are unsolicited. So when you send out an -- that means people are going to get ballots that don't even know they are getting them. And that takes the enthusiasm away a little bit, because we have this massive -- the largest ever, they say, the difference in enthusiasm. But if people are going to start walking up to your door and saying, do you want to sign this? They'll say, I don't want to vote. Well, sign this. OK, I'll sign it. There is no enthusiasm necessary there. It's really a corrupt system. And you watch, they have a plan, and the plan is not a good plan. They look to tie it all up, because they can't control the ballots on a small congressional race and smaller races even than that. And now you're going to control 80 million ballots? I don't think so."

If I needed extra, I'll put it up myself. I just -- I said that two days ago. I said, if there's any necessary extra cash. But we have a lot of money coming in and small donors. I haven't been heavy on big donors, because I don't want to call them. You know, when you call big donors (AUDIO GAP), in a very compromising (ph) position, when somebody puts up a lot of money, you are in a compromised position. Whether you say it, whether you don't say it, it doesn't matter. And what I like are the small donors. But, no, we have substantially more, two to three times more than we had four years ago at this time. And four years ago, we won. But if we need it anymore, if I saw that we were going to need more, I would put it up myself, absolutely."
