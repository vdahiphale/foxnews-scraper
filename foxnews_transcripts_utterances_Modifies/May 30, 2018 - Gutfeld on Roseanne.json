Roseanne disappeared faster than a classified email on a Clinton server. ABC saw the handwriting, hit warp speed. It's new crisis P.R., one-stop liquidation while you wait. But I'll be honest, I'm kind of sad, I'm not shocked, I'm sad. And I'm not sad for Roseanne, I'm sad that this experiment failed. When Roseanne first aired, why did it intrigue us? It wasn't the content, the show was a mess. It wasn't because we loved Roseanne. We knew she was kind of nutty. No, we like it because maybe it signaled progress in civil discourse, where the pros and the cons could break bread instead of bones, but not anymore. And, so the world moves on to whoever is next.

She once said Wall Street bankers should be executed. She believed the Boston marathon was staged. Is that on Obama's since they happened when he was in office and she was a hard-core leftist? No, that's absurd. But this current blanket of blame that's now being spread suggests it's always been there regardless of Roseanne. If it wasn't her, it would be someone else.

Just going back to Roseanne for a second, there's a great scene from The Office where Michael Scott says to Dwight, what's the most inspiring thing I ever said to you? And Dwight said, don't be idiot. It changed my life. And then he looked at the camera and said, whenever I'm about to do something I think to myself would an idiot do that, and then I don't do that thing. That's what Roseanne should have done.  It's just idiotic to do. She's self-destructive. People do it for many reasons, drugs, pressure, they're risk takers. Charlie Sheen did it, blew off his entire career over nothing, over absolutely nothing. We've seen people plant a little time bomb in their careers, and then all of the sudden the Me Too Movement finds them. It's what happens and it's just a sad case.

He gets out. For the next year and a half, he works at a food pantry -- volunteers at a food pantry; gains employment; gets a house, a vehicle; reconnects with his family; goes to church every week. And then he finds out, oh, actually, the new U.S. attorney, they say, \"Oh, he should have been a career -- classified as a career criminal, a career offender. So therefore, he shouldn't have been eligible for this.\" And so they sent him back to prison. Now, the public defenders that were defending Matthew Charles, they thought it would be better not to try to do any publicity about the case so that it wouldn't hurt his chances. And now, he is back in prison. There is publicity about it now. I absolutely believe that the president, I think that the president will do the right thing and pardon Matthew Charles, or at least commute the sentence.",

We're talking about specific cases here, and understand that. And I think these are really important cases, and it's good news. And I hope they are free. But we have to be very careful with prison reform, because people obsess over incarceration rates while crime rates have fallen. Crime rate goes down when criminals are locked up. I know that incarceration sounds mean-spirited, but it's not supposed to be a reward. And it is a fact, cause and effect, that we have seen dramatic declines in crime because of incarceration. Now, we get into this point where we talk about this is based on race. There are differences in sentencings that may not be due to discrimination. And I'm going to take a benign example. There's something where studies show that blacks get pulled over more for speeding. Five percentage over Asian- Americans. You would immediately think it's racist. But as Thomas Sowell points out, it -- it's a reflection in age difference. The average age for an Asian-American is about 20 years higher than black Americans. So it's young people who are speeding more. It's not about race. So when we look at these things, we have to be very, very careful about what we're saying and what we want to change.

The female panda has not yet been named -- come up with a good name -- is the second offspring of giant pandas Liang- Liang and Xing-Xing. The healthy cub weighs 19.8 pounds, could you imagine that? So it's very cool. And they've invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on a panda complex. And that's why we have this great production of this gorgeous panda.",

She once said Wall Street bankers should be executed. She believed the Boston marathon was staged. Is that on Obama's since they happened when he was in office and she was a hard-core leftist? No, that's absurd. But this current blanket of blame that's now being spread suggests it's always been there regardless of Roseanne. If it wasn't her, it would be someone else.

The Democrats and the media will circle the wagon around their soldiers, and they will go for Republicans scalps. That's just the way it is. You can't argue with it. That's the reality of it. Just going back to Roseanne for a second, there's a great scene from The Office where Michael Scott says to Dwight, what's the most inspiring thing I ever said to you? And Dwight said, don't be idiot. It changed my life. And then he looked at the camera and said, whenever I'm about to do something I think to myself would an idiot do that, and then I don't do that thing. That's what Roseanne should have done. It's just idiotic to do. She's self-destructive. People do it for many reasons, drugs, pressure, they're risk takers. Charlie Sheen did it, blew off his entire career over nothing, over absolutely nothing. We've seen people plant a little time bomb in their careers, and then all of the sudden the Me Too Movement finds them. It's what happens and it's just a sad case.

And then when you combine that with the crumbs of the tax cuts they're going to run on two Pelosi's gaps. So, that was an unforced error by the Democrats. Usually, midterm elections are base election, it's about turn out and the president's popularity at the time. The president personal popularity a little different than his policy popularity. Right now he's surging on three issues, immigration, the economy and trade. And he's number is really going up with millennials, people's age 50 to 64, church goers and non-church goers, figure that one out, and men. So, that is a very large swath of Americans. And when you put a thing like immigration at the front and center of your message it's not just immigration, you talk about national security, identity, law and order, wages, it touches on a lot of things.

We're talking about specific cases here, and understand that. And I think these are really important cases, and it's good news. And I hope they are free. But we have to be very careful with prison reform, because people obsess over incarceration rates while crime rates have fallen. Crime rate goes down when criminals are locked up. I know that incarceration sounds mean-spirited, but it's not supposed to be a reward. And it is a fact, cause and effect, that we have seen dramatic declines in crime because of incarceration. Now, we get into this point where we talk about this is based on race. There are differences in sentencings that may not be due to discrimination. And I'm going to take a benign example. There's something where studies show that blacks get pulled over more for speeding. Five percentage over Asian- Americans. You would immediately think it's racist. But as Thomas Sowell points out, it -- it's a reflection in age difference. The average age for an Asian-American is about 20 years higher than black Americans. So it's young people who are speeding more. It's not about race. So when we look at these things, we have to be very, very careful about what we're saying and what we want to change.
