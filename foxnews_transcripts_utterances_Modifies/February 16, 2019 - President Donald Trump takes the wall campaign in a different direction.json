And for that reason, he's seen as a jerk by the others who aren't us because anyone who stands outside the consensus is considered a jerk. Anyone who believes in order, rules, borders, cause and effect science. We're all jerks now. Anyone who believes in punishment, in profit, in competition, companies -- were jerks.  Jerks get stuff done, and then stuff gets done to them. Hence, all the tell-alls about Trump, jerks make great subjects. The latest one now by Andrew McCabe has him admitting to launching a probe into the President. Why? Because Trump is different. He's no boring civil servant in pleated khakis quietly weeping to Dave Matthews in his slightly used Toyota that stinks of hand lotion.  No, he is the orange skunk at the garden party piercing the elitist bubble. So McCabe thought there's no way America could have voted for this jerk. This has to be the work of the Russians.

Which means I could probably never be President. Until now. Trump has shown you that you can win without the phony BS. Trump's your rich uncle who couldn't give a crap. The Dems are the opposite, sanctimonious grad students lecturing you on evil capitalism as a trust fund pays for their weed. But political fakery exists because we expect it. We know it's phony, but we pretend it's real. I would say it's like pro-wrestling. But Tyrus would crush me like a ladybug between his thumb and index finger. Yes, it's real. And the media plays along turning every issue into a phony game of team sports with just two sides. But on the outside of all of this are jerks. Everyday society becomes more intolerant of them. Anyone who isn't part of the universal consensus is doomed.

And for that reason, he's seen as a jerk by the others who aren't us because anyone who stands outside the consensus is considered a jerk. Anyone who believes in order, rules, borders, cause and effect science. We're all jerks now. Anyone who believes in punishment, in profit, in competition, companies -- were jerks. Jerks get stuff done, and then stuff gets done to them. Hence, all the tell-alls about Trump, jerks make great subjects. The latest one now by Andrew McCabe has him admitting to launching a probe into the President. Why? Because Trump is different. He's no boring civil servant in pleated khakis quietly weeping to Dave Matthews in his slightly used Toyota that stinks of hand lotion. No, he is the orange skunk at the garden party piercing the elitist bubble. So McCabe thought there's no way America could have voted for this jerk. This has to be the work of the Russians.

Which means I could probably never be President. Until now. Trump has shown you that you can win without the phony BS. Trump's your rich uncle who couldn't give a crap. The Dems are the opposite, sanctimonious grad students lecturing you on evil capitalism as a trust fund pays for their weed. But political fakery exists because we expect it. We know it's phony, but we pretend it's real. I would say it's like pro-wrestling. But Tyrus would crush me like a ladybug between his thumb and index finger. Yes, it's real. And the media plays along turning every issue into a phony game of team sports with just two sides. But on the outside of all of this are jerks. Everyday society becomes more intolerant of them. Anyone who isn't part of the universal consensus is doomed.

I fight -- one of the things I do about comedy and humor is I feel like it needs to talk about situations like toxic masculinity or racism or sexism or whatever. That's what humor does. It makes us laugh at real life things and bring us together where we can all make jokes and understanding about different ways of looking at things, so you always want to support artists when they do those things and then you have someone who's trying to make a change, so he now wants to bash everything he did before because he wants you to watch this new movie now. And that's what I have the issue with. If you're -- it's comedy. \"Superbad\" wasn't a documentary on how to behave and have friends, you know I'm saying, like - and Jonah Hill, with all due respect, sir, I don't think anyone's ever accused you of being toxic masculine."

I don't get - you know, Rudyard Kipling, \"You'll be a man, my son,\" that was toxically masculine."
