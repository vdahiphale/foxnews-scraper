And the focus there, as you just went through was on Stephen Ross, known in Miami as the owner of the Miami Dolphins, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as the alum who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars. He also heads the Related Group, which owns some of the newest and biggest buildings in some of America's largest cities. His portfolio also includes investments in the luxury workout chains Equinox and Soul Cycle. Here's the issue. Some customers and anti-Trump activists are now calling for a boycott of those workout spots because he held this fund-raiser for the president.  Before for the event, though, Ross tried to back away from some of the president's policies by saying in a statement -- quote -- \"I have known Donald for 40 years. And while we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others. And I have never been bashful about expressing my opinions.\"   The RNC and the Trump campaign ahead of this were saying that Stephen Ross was simply exercising his First Amendment right. And when the president was asked about this morning as he left the White House, he said that he believes this is going to raise Ross' profile for the better.",

Jenna Ellis, when you hear that sort of thing, do you agree with that, you have free rein; this is an American right; you don't like something, you can boycott, you can do all of that, and that Republicans themselves just exercised it in the Mitch McConnell situation, where Twitter took down his site because he simply showed a video of people threatening him?  So they were threatening a boycott. They were threatening not doing business and getting their social media message on alternatives. So what do you think? JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Yes, well, Neil, I certainly agree that Americans have the right to spend money in any way that they choose. And if they choose to boycott a company for whatever reason, I mean, even if it's just that they simply don't like the product, of course, that's their right to exercise that however they want to. However, I don't think that this is a good idea to not draw the distinction between looking at a company for what its policies are and actually what its product is.   So, for example, if you're going to boycott Planned Parenthood because you don't like the fact that they are -- their entire purpose is to have abortions, that's a very different reason than saying, we are going to try to suppress political speech through our financial actions. And I certainly don't agree that this is a good strategy moving forward to say, hey, let's take down a company simply because of the private beliefs of investors or the people that work for that company. I mean, there's a -- what if you did that for someone -- for some company that just because its employee happens to have a sign in their yard that says \"Go Trump\" and then suddenly the company is trying to -- going to try to suppress the individual's political speech, based on the fact that they work for the company.

But like Jerome Powell, who's criticized sometimes for holding these press conferences and confusing people, the president was criticized on the floor at least today for making these comments and sort of just holding it in the face of investors and sort of reiterating the fact China is still a problem.",

But that seems to be what it's shaping up to be. The Democrats are a little concerned about Joe Biden and his slipping poll numbers slightly after the Detroit debates. He didn't do as well, he survived, but he didn't do as well as expected. Elizabeth Warren nipping at his heels a little bit after the debates, we saw that in this Pennsylvania poll. She's now only seven points, within range of him. He polled at 28 percent. And she's polling at 21 percent. So we're seeing that, the last poll that came in, what, about 12 percent spread between the two of them. So we do see some momentum on Elizabeth Warren's side.

But one of the standard lines you hear from both is that he's slipping up, he's making mistakes, he's not saying things the way they should be said.

But, right now, they're really amping up the efforts to try to what they're doing -- what they're calling early detection of these kind of emergency situations. And, really, what that sounds like to most people...",

He also heads the Related Group, which owns some of the newest and biggest buildings in some of America's largest cities. His portfolio also includes investments in the luxury workout chains Equinox and Soul Cycle. Here's the issue. Some customers and anti-Trump activists are now calling for a boycott of those workout spots because he held this fund-raiser for the president. Before for the event, though, Ross tried to back away from some of the president's policies by saying in a statement -- quote -- \"I have known Donald for 40 years. And while we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others. And I have never been bashful about expressing my opinions.\" The RNC and the Trump campaign ahead of this were saying that Stephen Ross was simply exercising his First Amendment right. And when the president was asked about this morning as he left the White House, he said that he believes this is going to raise Ross' profile for the better."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, fair enough. I just don't want it to go too far afield here. Jenna Ellis, when you hear that sort of thing, do you agree with that, you have free rein; this is an American right; you don't like something, you can boycott, you can do all of that, and that Republicans themselves just exercised it in the Mitch McConnell situation, where Twitter took down his site because he simply showed a video of people threatening him? So they were threatening a boycott. They were threatening not doing business and getting their social media message on alternatives. So what do you think? JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Yes, well, Neil, I certainly agree that Americans have the right to spend money in any way that they choose. And if they choose to boycott a company for whatever reason, I mean, even if it's just that they simply don't like the product, of course, that's their right to exercise that however they want to. However, I don't think that this is a good idea to not draw the distinction between looking at a company for what its policies are and actually what its product is. So, for example, if you're going to boycott Planned Parenthood because you don't like the fact that they are -- their entire purpose is to have abortions, that's a very different reason than saying, we are going to try to suppress political speech through our financial actions. And I certainly don't agree that this is a good strategy moving forward to say, hey, let's take down a company simply because of the private beliefs of investors or the people that work for that company. I mean, there's a -- what if you did that for someone -- for some company that just because its employee happens to have a sign in their yard that says \"Go Trump\" and then suddenly the company is trying to -- going to try to suppress the individual's political speech, based on the fact that they work for the company. I mean, where does this end? I think..."

So, what I'm saying is, do we go too far with this?"

You don't like it, you can always turn off the channel. In that case, you don't like it, you yourself cannot frequent that establishment if you're strong about it.

And I think that if you're targeting economic harm for the intention of suppressing political speech, that's much, much more dangerous than saying, just because I personally -- like, for Tucker Carlson, was personally doxed. And that's a completely different situation. And when you have someone like Castro, who's saying, I'm going to now put the investors and the donors to President Trump out in the marketplace, and I'm going to put that out in the public for the intentional purpose of telling people, think twice before you support this political candidate, that is absolutely going a step too far. This isn't just about..."

So it did rebound off the session lows, but still we were negative for the week. And this market wasn't for the faint of heart, Neil. It was difficult to navigate these waters, if you will. And there were traders on the floor who said to me today, look, the president didn't say anything that we didn't already know. He said we don't have a deal or we're not close to a deal with China. We knew that. And that's why we saw this turbulence this week. But like Jerome Powell, who's criticized sometimes for holding these press conferences and confusing people, the president was criticized on the floor at least today for making these comments and sort of just holding it in the face of investors and sort of reiterating the fact China is still a problem."

How quickly can U.S. companies move their supply chains outside of China? And really get down to business and figure out what's the new normal, if we're facing all these higher tariffs. But as long as we have these constant headlines, one day, it's really bad, it's not going to happen, the next day, maybe it will happen, investors' reaction -- reacting emotionally to all this different information and all these different theories or hopes, and then their hopes being dashed."

But, certainly, as long as we have these tariffs, that hurts the global economy, which means, yes, we are much more likely to get a rate cut and keep those equities propped up.

And that's really important, because that brings us back to the fundamentals of companies and how they're doing. No, it wasn't exactly gangbusters in terms of the percentages, but it wasn't bad either. What people are worried about and where the China story comes back in is the next quarter, because we didn't hear a lot of commentary about China, companies being worried about it or seeing an issue act as a result of it. But now, with this second round of tariffs that the president said he will impose on September 1, that could potentially be a problem. And that could start to hit these companies. And that's where some of the concern comes in, because, when the numbers don't look good, and the fundamentals start to weaken, then you really have a reason for selling."

And what's been propping up equities, despite having lower earnings growth and lower profitability expectations and a global slowdown, is that we're getting these rate cuts, right? So that's balancing the two, is, well, you're not getting any -- any return in fixed income, so you might as well prop up the equities. But, ultimately, I think we're going to have to face the fact that, if we're still looking at significantly lower profit growth -- and for third and fourth quarter, it's come down about 3 percent just in the past two weeks."

RealClearPolitics' Susan Crabtree, Susan, by all indications, that's the read you're getting from the White House, that, collectively, they think it's going to be Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, and they're sort of revving up for that possibility. But I'm wondering if that secretly concerns the president. He is the guy, after all, the former vice president, who's polling the best against him. That doesn't mean anything this early, but it is telling that he's saying, all right, I want Joe Biden. What do you think?"

We have this sort of septuagenarian knife fights being set up, these two old guys going to go at it and really go have a Twitter street brawl. It's something strange that we have in politics, that it's coming out to be, shaping up to be two 70-year-old white males going at it, when there's so much call, especially on the Democratic side, for diversity. But that seems to be what it's shaping up to be. The Democrats are a little concerned about Joe Biden and his slipping poll numbers slightly after the Detroit debates. He didn't do as well, he survived, but he didn't do as well as expected. Elizabeth Warren nipping at his heels a little bit after the debates, we saw that in this Pennsylvania poll. She's now only seven points, within range of him. He polled at 28 percent. And she's polling at 21 percent. So we're seeing that, the last poll that came in, what, about 12 percent spread between the two of them. So we do see some momentum on Elizabeth Warren's side. So Joe Biden has to be a little concerned about, but, right now, he is still the front-runner, and nobody's punctured that yet."

And obviously, after Elizabeth Warren's opening the way -- I think she was the first night -- she's been doing very, very well in raising of money. And I often find that that closely parallels the type of support you get in the polls. But, having said that, Joe Biden is a big constant. It's not that many guys are pulling away from him. They're just not adding that much to him. So all that could be wrong. But one of the standard lines you hear from both is that he's slipping up, he's making mistakes, he's not saying things the way they should be said. And it's reinforcing an image, hey, he's an older guy. Now, he's, what, four years older than the president, who is 72. So you could make an argument these are both old white men running for the office. But, having said that, though, it's reinforcing an image that Biden's lost his fast ball. Is that fair?"

      "speaker": "CRABTREE",

And we haven't seen him come out with those really sharp one-liners that we expected with him, that he's kind of the scrappy fighter. That was supposed to be his strength. What he's really suffering from is a lack of momentum on his side and passion. The passion seems to be on the left. But that's not going to -- it seems like from the polling, is not going to get their party elected and oust Trump. So we have a dichotomy here, a real problem on the Democratic side, because Joe Biden seems to be the front-runner, yet the passion to really get out the voters, to really compete with Donald Trump's ability to rally people, get people out to these stadiums, we just don't see that.

If the president decides to back a bill, and if Senator McConnell thinks that he can just shape it in such a way as to get 60 votes, then that's going to give -- if you have got a choice between the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, saying to Republican voters, I'm in favor of this, and the NRA saying, we're not in favor of this, the president's going to win that argument, particularly when you have the public polls. In public polls, support for universal background checks -- and, granted, that's an amorphous title. That's not a bill. That's not the detail. That's a title. But if you look at the support for that concept, it is up there at 90 percent, and almost 90 percent among Republicans. Now, like with a lot of things in legislation, the devil is in the details.

It is a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. So unless you change that amendment, it's going to be hard to, in essence, confiscate somebody's semiautomatic weapon. Remember, we said assault weapons, but, essentially, that was cosmetic. We have other -- plenty of other rifles, long rifles, that don't look as menacing as an AK-47 -- AK-47 or an AR-15, but are still the same concept. That is to say, they have a magazine. And if you pull the trigger once, it shoots a bullet, and if you pull the trigger again, it shoots another bullet.

The president of Marvel is a big Trump supporter. Do we see the boycott on Marvel's side? I think it's something right now that feels really hot-button. People want to gather around it.
