New invention to your game. So, a couple of things I think were really important in what Joe Biden was talking about beyond the politicization of it, I would say of course, but he and Kamala Harris were both talking about a Trump recommendation versus a scientist recommendation. But the increase in testing sites and the reimbursement for home testing kits is going to be really crucial here. The difference in price between how much it costs for us to get a test versus in mainland Europe. In Germany, you can get a home test for one euro. Here it's $24. That's a huge differential. So, making this more equitable so that people can not only get vaccinated and get boosted, which seems like the key to keeping yourself healthy with the delta variant, which seems much more powerful than omicron, and having these cheaper kits is going to make a huge difference so I was really thrilled to see that.",

You don't think the Republican Party wants to knock out COVID? Second of all, COVID is his excuse for everything. He blames smash and grab robberies on COVID, supply chain crisis on COVID. You knock out COVID you knock out all of his excuses. Do you remember how much mileage Joe Biden got politically by going after DeSantis when cases were high in Florida? Now cases are dead low in Florida. Do you think DeSantis is sitting around in the governor's mansion hoping for a winter surge for political purposes? Of course not. Republicans don't want a permanent pandemic. We don't want to see Fauci on T.V. anymore. Republicans want Fauci in prison. It's the Democrats that want the permanent pandemic. They are the ones who wanted to shut the schools and the small businesses and use the thing as an excuse to bail out the blue states and spend trillions of dollars. Republicans don't want cases to go up. Democrats will just use that an excuse to grow government. And I don't know if he has spoken to a Republican recently. Republicans don't act like there is a pandemic anymore. We haven't after we have been vaxed, and a lot of us weren't before we were vaxed. We were going to holiday parties. We were at the beach. We were flying. Go outside John Heilemann. See someone with a double mask and a face shield on, that is a Democrat. That is not a Republican, all right. And I'm not an NBC News political analyst.

You have DAs not prosecuting crimes like you know whether it has to do with transients or public urination or whatever. We've gone reversed from the broken windows of philosophy. Accusations of racism, when you discuss law and order, because we've turned that into a press versus oppressor, so if you're pro-police, you must be a racist. That worked during the riots. When you then redefined violence as mostly peaceful, that means if you're trying to police the riots, you're actually going after the protesters. And this is the problem with perception.

New invention to your game. So, a couple of things I think were really important in what Joe Biden was talking about beyond the politicization of it, I would say of course, but he and Kamala Harris were both talking about a Trump recommendation versus a scientist recommendation. But the increase in testing sites and the reimbursement for home testing kits is going to be really crucial here. The difference in price between how much it costs for us to get a test versus in mainland Europe. In Germany, you can get a home test for one euro. Here it's $24. That's a huge differential. So, making this more equitable so that people can not only get vaccinated and get boosted, which seems like the key to keeping yourself healthy with the delta variant, which seems much more powerful than omicron, and having these cheaper kits is going to make a huge difference so I was really thrilled to see that."

I'm confident in saying that. Joe Biden, the only thing keeping him in the low 40s is COVID. You get rid of COVID, he is in the 30s, in the 20s on inflation, crime, immigration. You don't think the Republican Party wants to knock out COVID? Second of all, COVID is his excuse for everything. He blames smash and grab robberies on COVID, supply chain crisis on COVID. You knock out COVID you knock out all of his excuses. Do you remember how much mileage Joe Biden got politically by going after DeSantis when cases were high in Florida? Now cases are dead low in Florida. Do you think DeSantis is sitting around in the governor's mansion hoping for a winter surge for political purposes? Of course not. Republicans don't want a permanent pandemic. We don't want to see Fauci on T.V. anymore. Republicans want Fauci in prison. It's the Democrats that want the permanent pandemic. They are the ones who wanted to shut the schools and the small businesses and use the thing as an excuse to bail out the blue states and spend trillions of dollars. Republicans don't want cases to go up. Democrats will just use that an excuse to grow government. And I don't know if he has spoken to a Republican recently. Republicans don't act like there is a pandemic anymore. We haven't after we have been vaxed, and a lot of us weren't before we were vaxed. We were going to holiday parties. We were at the beach. We were flying. Go outside John Heilemann. See someone with a double mask and a face shield on, that is a Democrat. That is not a Republican, all right. And I'm not an NBC News political analyst.

There are more deaths under his watch than there were under Trump, which is something the media doesn't have tickers on their screens to count every single day for. But on the issue of politics, when I was listening to him speak today at the NIH and when I read the White House readout and the details of what he was going to say, I noticed that there is an emphasis on keeping schools open so long as parents vaccinate their children. Now there have been a number of stories in places like \"The New York Times\" saying lots of parents got vaccinated but they actually have concerns and questions about running out and vaccinating their children.

And whether they again try to extort the system and say well then we're not going to go into the classrooms because we don't feel like its safe.

This is how we're going to mess around with the field in 2024. It's amazing to watch this happen so soon. And then you have people that can read the writing on the wall. Kamala's not the heir apparent, right? So they're trying to get out before the Kamala stench sinks in too deeply. These people, a lot of them are about resume building, you know. You know these people. You're in D.C. It's about, you know, where you went to college, who you work for in the campaign, what your title is in the V.P.'s office. The minute it looks like she's not going to be the one, they're out. She's also pushing people out and that's how she's done her thing the whole time she's been in public life.

They teach you how to walk with your stroller, how to get in and out of your car with a baby, all those things. Even in California, they have them take advantage of it. The other thing is, these are feel-good policies that left his campaign on like George Gascon, like oh, it's going to be more humane when there are fewer people in prison, and we're going to release people not on bail because it's nicer and the system is mean. This is the result because criminals are emboldened, they're not keeping them in jail, and the left tends to care about crime when it comes to their neighborhood. They're fine with it in people -- places like Chicago and Washington D.C. But once it starts coming into their neighborhood, then they mount to recall and they're frustrated by it, when everybody deserves no matter where you live or what your zip code is, what your income level is to live in a safe society, free from criminal activity. But the people who are running these cities believe that crime should be legalized and we're seeing the results of that and it's getting worse. People are getting killed as a result of it."

You know, and even when you say Soros, you go like, oh my God, people are going to consider it blasphemous or somehow anti-Semitic. It's like no, it's like -- it's just basically just connecting the dots. He's not the only variable, however. He's like the owner of a football team. He pays the players. But the players engage in certain things that have nothing to do with COVID, nothing to do with COVID but led to crime. The no cash bail, probably one of the worst ideas in modern history. You have DAs not prosecuting crimes like you know whether it has to do with transients or public urination or whatever. We've gone reversed from the broken windows of philosophy. Accusations of racism, when you discuss law and order, because we've turned that into a press versus oppressor, so if you're pro-police, you must be a racist. That worked during the riots. When you then redefined violence as mostly peaceful, that means if you're trying to police the riots, you're actually going after the protesters. And this is the problem with perception. I don't know who said it -- you said it I think -- that crime is no longer a problem that needs to be eradicated.

And it wouldn't -- even if it went off by itself, which I -- which is so rare, it doesn't take away this idea that he was negligent in not checking the firearm for live ammunition, claiming that he was handed the gun and no one told him it was loaded with live ammunition. It is his job as an actor to understand how to safely handle firearms and it was his obligation to check to make sure there was not live ammunition in the gun, not to mention he keeps talking about well, there was live ammunition on the set and there shouldn't have been. Well, he was in charge of this production. And allegedly, the day before, you know, there was shooting practice going on. So, that -- he's also negligent and responsible for that as well. And also, I just have to say that the music and the drama surrounding this is pretty gross considering what happened, and like it's this big dramatic thing that he's the victim here and not taking any responsibility when he was in charge of the set.

Like, the moment -- like, if it -- if you were actually holding a gun, and like you said, it was a rare chance, I'd be going -- I'd be screaming that, like yelling and everybody would be going, Baldwin was running around going I didn't touch it, I didn't -- like, you know what I'm -- but there's nobody who's actually said that yet.

So, the President and the First Lady, and I'm assuming the Vice President and the Second Gentleman will be there, so check that out if you want. It's a, well, always a lovely ceremony when the Christmas Tree is lit there at the White House. There he is.

He's like, wow. That's a llama seeing its reflection and freaking out. Often animals don't recognize their reflection, don't know what it is. But this llama is obviously highly intelligent just like Greg."

He had double bypass heart surgery earlier this month and he got a good well card from a lifelong friend as he recovered and he was given three of these $5 million tickets and he scratched off three letters and ended up taking home $650,000 pre-tax, so he'll probably only took home half of that."
