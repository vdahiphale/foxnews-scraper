I don’t know if we will make it all, but between now and October the 1st.   Now, I share some of the president’s concerned about the border. We have not protected our border for 30 or 40 years. And it’s gotten worse and worse. And he wants more money. We don’t know how we -- where we can get the money. But, at the same time, that will be something we will have to work out between the House and the Senate. But, right now, we’re going to continue to work the appropriation process and try to avoid the specter of a shutdown come October the 1st.",
