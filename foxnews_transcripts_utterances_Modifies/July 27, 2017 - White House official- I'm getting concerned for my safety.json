Some brothers are like Cain and Abel. Other brothers can fight with each other and then get along. I don't know if this is repairable or not. That will be up to the president.

We're here at the White House today, and if he walks by or any other official walks by, we'll try to get them to come over and talk to us. But he has just released that tweet that we just brought you. He also is responding to an article in The New Yorker, to reporter Ryan Lizza in which whether he didn't know whether he was on the record, we know that he didn't say it had to be off the record because there are a lot of quotes about Reince Priebus and who leaked the details of a meeting at the White House and a dinner of the White House. And then it gets very vulgar in this article that we won't go into too much detail about, about a number of different officials saying at one point he's going to fire them all.  A White House senior official responding to FOX News producers just said this, quote, \"This is getting out of hand. I am honestly getting concerned for my safety in the office tomorrow. This type of behavior is unbelievable. Working in the White House and something like that is said, it is a disgrace.\" So with that let's bring on our panel: Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for The Washington Times; Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at USA Today, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Susan, we've all covered Washington for a long time. We've often said this, there's not been anything like this.",

Do you think this hurts Anthony Scaramucci with President Trump or does it help him because he's so combative and he's pushing back so strongly?

The rules of the game, off the record, what does that mean, and figuring out that component as well. And I think that part of that comes with experience. So I think for Scaramucci it would have been more opportunity to do maybe less talking and more organizing the White House. He came in to purge, to make changes in the White House communication staff because the president was not liking the way the messaging was coming out. But here's the problem. When you have stories like this, it continues to be a distraction in talking about what matters to the president, which is that is his legislative agenda, which is health care reform, tax reform, getting jobs back for Americans.
