He's been talking up the economy, talking up the prospects for a trade deal, eventually, amid word that we just got moments ago that the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, does indeed plan to go to China. No time frame has been announced here, but that the talks could continue. We just don't know how soon.  We do know that at the corner of Wall and Broad they liked these developments. We were up about 210.5 points, off our highs for the day, and making up a little less than half the ground that was lost yesterday.  So what's really going on, on the trade front?

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil. Well, a lot of the products that were targeted by the Chinese, not surprisingly, are agriculturally based. So the Chinese are doing this for political strategy purposes. They know that the states that produce a lot of what we export, at least in agribusiness, are states that voted for President Trump.   So decaf coffee is just one of the items on the list, nuts, frozen fruits. So a lot of these items are the ones facing tariffs. So, long story short, any Chinese person who wants to buy any of these American products, Neil, will just have to pay more for then as of June 1. Now, last week, President Trump also threatened, but didn't yet put into effect, additional tariffs on a new list in the thousands of Chinese goods. On June 17, the office of the U.S. trade representative, of course, as we know, led by Robert Lighthizer, began the formal process that could lead to those new tariffs.  So the public hearing, that's on the 17th. And that public comment period lasts until June 24. So tariffs in theory could not be imposed until after that day, but that would really up the ante. What they're talking about is thousands, as I mentioned, of new Chinese goods worth about -- on $300 billion worth of imports per year.  So, currently, as we know, the U.S. has about a 25 percent tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. All of these decisions, of course, increasing the stakes ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28 and 29, when the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and President Trump are expected to meet. So, Neil, obviously, they're going to have a lot to talk about -- in the meantime, back to you.",

No time frame has been announced here, but that the talks could continue. We just don't know how soon. We do know that at the corner of Wall and Broad they liked these developments. We were up about 210.5 points, off our highs for the day, and making up a little less than half the ground that was lost yesterday. So what's really going on, on the trade front?

Again, just to review here, June 1 is when all of this kicks in, the tariffs higher on our side, tariffs higher on their side, affecting thousands of goods.

      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Well, a lot of the products that were targeted by the Chinese, not surprisingly, are agriculturally based. So the Chinese are doing this for political strategy purposes. They know that the states that produce a lot of what we export, at least in agribusiness, are states that voted for President Trump. So decaf coffee is just one of the items on the list, nuts, frozen fruits. So a lot of these items are the ones facing tariffs. So, long story short, any Chinese person who wants to buy any of these American products, Neil, will just have to pay more for then as of June 1. Now, last week, President Trump also threatened, but didn't yet put into effect, additional tariffs on a new list in the thousands of Chinese goods. On June 17, the office of the U.S. trade representative, of course, as we know, led by Robert Lighthizer, began the formal process that could lead to those new tariffs. So the public hearing, that's on the 17th. And that public comment period lasts until June 24. So tariffs in theory could not be imposed until after that day, but that would really up the ante. What they're talking about is thousands, as I mentioned, of new Chinese goods worth about -- on $300 billion worth of imports per year. So, currently, as we know, the U.S. has about a 25 percent tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. All of these decisions, of course, increasing the stakes ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28 and 29, when the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and President Trump are expected to meet. So, Neil, obviously, they're going to have a lot to talk about -- in the meantime, back to you."

We do know that around June 1, thereabouts, if nothing changes, a lot of goods are going to get a lot more expensive, up to 25 percent more expensive. I had the former president of Wal-Mart here who was saying they're worried about that. All the retailers are very worried about that, because you can pass along smaller increases like the ones we have already absorbed -- 25 percent is another matter. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "HITHA HERZOG, RETAIL WATCHER",

      "speaker": "HERZOG",

So footwear right now, 69 percent of footwear is produced in China, and then 42 percent of apparel is produced in China. So, inevitably, the consumer will have to pay for that price hike. The issue is, will it even happen? So I think that people -- I tend to be on the other side of the argument, saying, you know what, let's just take a step back here. Let's not get our knickers in a bunch, I guess I should say."

There are -- there is that speculation on the markets. I think, though, given what's happening in the Chinese economy, there's a high wall of debt at this point. You have slowing growth.

What some of the Democrats seem to be wanting to do is conflating an investigation that Senator Burr is pursuing with a complete report that found that the president wasn't guilty of collusion, nor guilty of obstruction. They need to move on from that. But when you -- look, when you have got in the House a guy bringing a bucket of chicken and the spectacle that we're seeing over there, treating these high-ranking officials, I could absolutely understand why Trump Jr. is not going to come before Congress."

It is not a re-prosecution of the special counsel investigation. What I want people to do here is take a look at the reality that that investigation is over. And then I defer to my senior senator on whatever other actions he wants to take. But I do think that Donald Jr. is rightfully hesitant to come before this Congress because most of the behavior that I have seen on the other side of the aisle, not Senator Burr's, is purely politically motivated."

But this is a battle with the left and the moderate members of the party that could erupt come convention time next year. Let's go to The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior. We have got Democratic strategist Max Burns and Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour.

And she's not really backing down from that. And so I think the risk is on the left. You saw that Obama's policies, which were, theoretically, compared to what she's doing, middle-of-the-road policies, are no longer considered acceptable. And I think even if she doesn't get what she wants, in this case, she's pushed the conversation much, much further left. And I think the American public needs to know that if you have a candidate that's being drawn left by that far, far, far left wing on climate change, you're probably going to end up with some pretty extreme policies."

Look, not a long time ago, you had Barney Frank, who I classify in the total liberal column. He came out and said that some of these policies, some of these things that they had are not even sustainable. If you introduced them all to the economy, it would shock the economy."

This is something that is going to be fundamentally operating like a regressive tax. I mean, I know families that are having a hard time paying for air conditioning in the summer already. That's with our current system.

Four oil tankers anchored off the United Arab Emirates were damaged Monday. This image shows the damage to a Norwegian oil tanker. A U.S. official says a preliminary investigation blames Iran or one of its proxy forces, but the U.S. military and White House have not provided any proof those claims. Rising tension with Iran prompted General Frank McKenzie, the new head of U.S. Central Command, to send the USS Abraham Lincoln to the Persian Gulf region two weeks early.

We shouldn't escalate. We shouldn't send more forces to the region. So it plays into their hands. They're able to do it with proxies. Our country will ask for evidence. And they're able to muddy the waters and operate in the gray, which questions everything we do. So we have to look at this. We have to look at Iran's proxies, what they're capable of doing and negate that threat and then tie it directly to Iran. They exist because of Iran. They were created by Iran. They were trained by Iran and paid for by Iran. So we have to hold the..."

It was just about 4 percent growth, which is a phenomenally strong number. And we had high employment, no inflation anywhere to be seen. And I think Trump's frustration -- and I share his frustration -- is in the midst of this beautiful picture of the economy, the Fed starts spraying cold water on it by raising interest rates. And, remember, we had a -- the fourth quarter was not good."

I have said this many times. I think the December rate increase was a catastrophically bad decision and they should cancel it. Now, that's a quarter-point reduction. The president wants a 1 percentage point reduction. I wouldn't go that far. But I do think that there's more of a danger of falling prices right now than raising prices. Now, look, you -- but you can't -- I think the president is a little bit wrong on this. This trade war that we now have with China, you can't reverse the effects of that by printing money.

I'm not sure that's the best strategy. I think Mr. Comey is a little bit vulnerable himself, because now he has three separate investigations taking a look at how the FBI under Jim Comey and his special team that he assembled initiated a counterintelligence investigation against a presidential campaign. They're going to dig and they're going to dig hard. And what -- their findings might directly address the character of the former FBI director."

And so Mr. Rosenstein might have felt a little emboldened to make those comments with some -- with supreme confidence. Look, we have got a former FBI director acting as no other FBI director ever has, to Mr. Rosenstein's point, going out on a book tour and holding town halls and being so public in his statements, caustic statements. It really does give those of us who spent a career in the FBI pause."

There are early indications that there may have been some coloring outside the lines, maybe not following the attorney general guidelines in all the way from the initiation of the case , to using certain investigative techniques, like confidential human sources, undercover investigators, as they call them, and, of course, the FISA application itself.
