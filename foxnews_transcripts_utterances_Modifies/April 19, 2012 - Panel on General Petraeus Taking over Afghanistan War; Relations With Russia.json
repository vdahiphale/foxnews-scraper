We did not say that starting July, 2011, suddenly there would be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan. We didn't say we'd switch off the light and close the door behind us.   BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: President Obama today talking about the policy in Afghanistan after his decision to put General David Petraeus at the helm there on the ground. Now here is how Defense Secretary Robert Gates described the change. He said that, \"General Petraeus is absolutely behind the president's strategy. He agrees with the December review and he also agrees with the timeline to begin a drawdown,\" Gates said, \"in July of 2011 that is conditions-based.\" That is a word that you did not hear from President Obama today.  What about all of this? Let's bring in the panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Steve, did you detect nuance here and how it was phrased about the July, 2011 drawdown?",

      "sentences": "Yes. There was some. You still didn't have the president say it's all off. Everything we talked about before, the recommendation that came from the political team to have the July, 2011 withdrawal date is off. And it would have been great to hear that, because that's the most important thing the president could have said today.  Having said that, there were things I think in his statement today and also in his statement yesterday that indicate that he understands that there needs to be flexibility on that and that there will be changes that come in with David Petraeus. He said today, for instance, he said he is going to be insisting on the unity of purpose, on all branches of the U.S. government in such a way that reflects the dedication of the military. Now, who is he talking to there? He is clearly not talking to the military, not talking about Gates, not talking about Petraeus. My interpretation of that is he is talking about Richard Holbrooke, Karl Eikenberry the ambassador there, and that he is talking about Joe Biden, saying you need to get on the same page, you need to stop taking shots at one another. And David Petraeus is going to come in and change the culture here. And I think that's a very good thing. It's not a withdrawal date, but it's a good thing.",

It doesn't mean that the president doesn't want to get rid of anybody else. I think what happens with the withdrawal date is I think it's implicit. I think when he brought in Petraeus and asked him to take the demotion and make a sacrifice for the mission, it was clear that David Petraeus won't be boxed in by any kind of withdrawal date he doesn't believe in that isn't conditions-based. And so the president realized these divisions are so poisonous and dangerous, the important thing is unity. Right now it's unity of rhetoric. Everyone means the same thing but they say we agree on the mission. They just don't want to use words \"conditions-based\" and make it sound like there is disagreement. So they're all talking about it in a strange way, but that is what I take away from yesterday and today.",

You can do all the interpretation and parsing of words that Gates said, that the president is saying today, we're not going to leave, what did he say, and turn the lights out on that date.
