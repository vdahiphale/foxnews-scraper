      "sentences": "Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. We now know that the text sent by Peter Strzok that showed enough bias against the president to get him kicked off the case will be turned over to congressional investigators soon. The new revelations about bias on the Mueller are raising questions that should matter to everyone who is watching this story regardless of your party. Can these investigators be fair? Can they be just in the Russia case? Very basic question. The Wall Street Journal editorial looked at it today and they put it this way: \"While there's no evidence so far of Trump-Russia collusion, house investigators have turned up enough material to suggest that anti-Trump motives may have driven Mr. Comey's FBI investigation. The public has the right to know whether the Steele dossier was the inspiration for the Comey probe, and whether it led to intrusive government eavesdropping on campaign satellites -- such as Carter Page and others. All of this reinforces our doubts about Mr. Mueller's ability to conduct a fair and credible probe of the FBI's considerable part in the Russia-Trump drama. Mr. Mueller ran the bureau for 12 years and is fast friends with Mr. Comey, whose firing by Mr. Trump triggered his appointment as special counsel. The reluctance to cooperate with the congressional inquiry compound doubts related to this clear conflict of interest.\"  Tonight, we are learning more about the two men apart of both the Clinton and Trump investigation, and whether based on their own statements they can be impartial in this case. So, in a moment, Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who is concerned about what he sees going on here and behind the scenes; Mollie Hemingway is also with us tonight of The Federalist; and constitutional law attorney, Jonathan Turley. But first, chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, joins us live from Washington tonight. Good evening, Ed.",

      "sentences": "Martha, you know that breaking tonight, we're going to get a look at these text messages from Peter Strzok -- that FBI Agent -- they're going to be turned over to the House Intelligence Committee. Fascinating, because the mainstream media has been throwing shade at President Trump for lashing out at the FBI in recent days, but the more we learn about this very senior FBI official, the more questions are being raised about whether the president is right on target about a double standard.  New tonight, we're learning, two top aides to Hillary Clinton who never faced charges in the email probe, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills, were interviewed about the private serves by, yes, Peter Strzok. The lead agent on the Clinton investigation who was recently pulled off of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe because of a perceived pro-Clinton bias. Remember, we learned from WikiLeaks that after a March 2015 interview in which then-President Obama claimed he learned of the private server from news reports, it was Cheryl Mills who emailed John Podesta that they needed to adjust and coordinate the story because the president had exchanged emails with Clinton on her private address. Mills writing to Podesta, \"We need to clean this up. He has emails from her. They do not say state.gov.\" Well, late yesterday, we learned why team Clinton may have been treated with kid gloves. When it's revealed that before James Comey cleared Clinton during the summer of '16 in her e- mail probe, Strzok had intervened. He shifted Comey from saying it was \"grossly negligent,\" which hinted that potential crimes to the much more lenient \"extremely careless\" when it came to the email server.  Strzok has pulled off the Mueller probe as I noted this summer because he'd been sending his girlfriend, another top FBI official, texts that were very pro-Clinton and extremely anti-Trump. It turns out Strzok also helped conduct the FBI interview of Retired General Mike Flynn that sparked charges that National Security Adviser lied to the FBI, months after Strzok led the interview of Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as being gentle, and that's why critics are lashing out.",

He believes that it was only, actually, four of the 17 that came to that conclusion. Here now, Fred Fleitz, Senior Vice President at the Center for Security Policy. Good evening, sir, it's really good to have you with us tonight. You know, I think a lot of people -- and as I say, regardless of where they stand politically, are looking at this and saying that this isn't the way things should work.

The Trump campaign is made up of outsiders, they're likely to get caught up in this investigation. After all, when Michael Flynn talked to the FBI, he didn't have an attorney with him.  And these last-minute policy decisions by the Obama administration to close diplomatic -- Russian diplomatic facilities and to sanctions the Russians. You know, administrations in the last three weeks don't normally do that. That was at least an effort to sabotage Trump policy when he was president. But I think it was baked. It was baked to get Trump officials to do something. I think they were being monitored by intelligence agencies. The FBI was watching this. The NSC was watching this. They were looking for evidence to get the Trump transition team with. And because I think this was all a trap by the Democrats -- if this could be established, I think President Trump should pardon everyone.

I like people who weren't captured. McCain spent five years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, after his plane was shot down. The anti-hero comments were condemn by senior members of the Republican Party, but those senior members were also far from sacred. When Senator Lindsey Graham called Trump a lightweight and an idiot, Trump read Graham's phone number on national television. And from that point, the controversial comment became a weekly occurrence. Trump went after Megyn Kelly for aggressively questioning him during a presidential debate.

      "utterance": "Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. We now know that the text sent by Peter Strzok that showed enough bias against the president to get him kicked off the case will be turned over to congressional investigators soon. The new revelations about bias on the Mueller are raising questions that should matter to everyone who is watching this story regardless of your party. Can these investigators be fair? Can they be just in the Russia case? Very basic question. The Wall Street Journal editorial looked at it today and they put it this way: \"While there's no evidence so far of Trump-Russia collusion, house investigators have turned up enough material to suggest that anti-Trump motives may have driven Mr. Comey's FBI investigation. The public has the right to know whether the Steele dossier was the inspiration for the Comey probe, and whether it led to intrusive government eavesdropping on campaign satellites -- such as Carter Page and others. All of this reinforces our doubts about Mr. Mueller's ability to conduct a fair and credible probe of the FBI's considerable part in the Russia-Trump drama. Mr. Mueller ran the bureau for 12 years and is fast friends with Mr. Comey, whose firing by Mr. Trump triggered his appointment as special counsel. The reluctance to cooperate with the congressional inquiry compound doubts related to this clear conflict of interest.\" Tonight, we are learning more about the two men apart of both the Clinton and Trump investigation, and whether based on their own statements they can be impartial in this case. So, in a moment, Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who is concerned about what he sees going on here and behind the scenes; Mollie Hemingway is also with us tonight of The Federalist; and constitutional law attorney, Jonathan Turley. But first, chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, joins us live from Washington tonight. Good evening, Ed."

      "utterance": "Martha, you know that breaking tonight, we're going to get a look at these text messages from Peter Strzok -- that FBI Agent -- they're going to be turned over to the House Intelligence Committee. Fascinating, because the mainstream media has been throwing shade at President Trump for lashing out at the FBI in recent days, but the more we learn about this very senior FBI official, the more questions are being raised about whether the president is right on target about a double standard. New tonight, we're learning, two top aides to Hillary Clinton who never faced charges in the email probe, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills, were interviewed about the private serves by, yes, Peter Strzok. The lead agent on the Clinton investigation who was recently pulled off of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe because of a perceived pro-Clinton bias. Remember, we learned from WikiLeaks that after a March 2015 interview in which then-President Obama claimed he learned of the private server from news reports, it was Cheryl Mills who emailed John Podesta that they needed to adjust and coordinate the story because the president had exchanged emails with Clinton on her private address. Mills writing to Podesta, \"We need to clean this up. He has emails from her. They do not say state.gov.\" Well, late yesterday, we learned why team Clinton may have been treated with kid gloves. When it's revealed that before James Comey cleared Clinton during the summer of '16 in her e- mail probe, Strzok had intervened. He shifted Comey from saying it was \"grossly negligent,\" which hinted that potential crimes to the much more lenient \"extremely careless\" when it came to the email server. Strzok has pulled off the Mueller probe as I noted this summer because he'd been sending his girlfriend, another top FBI official, texts that were very pro-Clinton and extremely anti-Trump. It turns out Strzok also helped conduct the FBI interview of Retired General Mike Flynn that sparked charges that National Security Adviser lied to the FBI, months after Strzok led the interview of Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as being gentle, and that's why critics are lashing out."

So, my next guest has over two decades of experience in the Intelligence Committee, serving as a CIA analyst and holding positions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department. Earlier this year he exposed the truth behind the widely-circulated Democratic talking points that claim that 17 intelligence agencies agreed that there was Russian collusion in the election, which everybody took at face value. He believes that it was only, actually, four of the 17 that came to that conclusion. Here now, Fred Fleitz, Senior Vice President at the Center for Security Policy. Good evening, sir, it's really good to have you with us tonight. You know, I think a lot of people -- and as I say, regardless of where they stand politically, are looking at this and saying that this isn't the way things should work.

I think the Democrats paid for this dossier, the purpose of which was to set off an FBI investigation. The Trump campaign is made up of outsiders, they're likely to get caught up in this investigation. After all, when Michael Flynn talked to the FBI, he didn't have an attorney with him. And these last-minute policy decisions by the Obama administration to close diplomatic -- Russian diplomatic facilities and to sanctions the Russians. You know, administrations in the last three weeks don't normally do that. That was at least an effort to sabotage Trump policy when he was president. But I think it was baked. It was baked to get Trump officials to do something. I think they were being monitored by intelligence agencies. The FBI was watching this. The NSC was watching this. They were looking for evidence to get the Trump transition team with. And because I think this was all a trap by the Democrats -- if this could be established, I think President Trump should pardon everyone. And I think that's what Republicans on the Hill should be calling for."

And also, you know, their emails, that obviously there's a lot of people involved in the intelligence agency who really didn't like the idea of President Trump becoming President Trump, right?

But the texts we're seeing from these various officers involved in the FBI and the Mueller investigation, and what we're seeing from Peter Strzok who apparently changed a key document on the prosecution -- the possible prosecution of Clinton so that she would get off.

That is looking like that's what led to the probe, and this is something that really needs to be investigated. We do need to know what payments were going on, and just why they were even using this information, whether it was used as a pretext to start this probe.

I was astonished that he was on the list given the fact that he was involved in the aftermath of the Comey firing. But having said that and despite all of the troublesome stories, I think Mueller will do a fair job. I think he knows that history will be his judge. He knows the rest of us will be, even if it wasn't. But I think your point is still the most important one. This is not like a normal criminal case. Our Constitutional system turns on this. And people have lost faith on both sides -- the Democrats and Republicans. They think it's all rigged, it's all deep state stuff. We need to bring back an element of trust. And you're only going to get that by getting all the stuff out on both sides. Not only the Russian investigation but the Clinton investigation, and to disclose what happened. Because I think we're past that, we've crossed the Rubicon of the normal criminal case and we're going to have to have greater disclosure."

That is unprecedented, I think -- I hope it's unprecedented. But also, we just have so many things we need to know about that. And we need to know that our intelligence agencies aren't playing politics in going after political opponents. There have been times in our country's past when we have broken open just exactly what intelligence agencies are doing against the American people. We had the church commission in the 1970s. This might be a time where we really get to find out just how much surveillance of political enemies is going on, and how much the FBI and other aspects of the Justice Department have been protecting -- keeping information from coming out about what happened during the Obama administration."

And if you look at the list that you just had up on the big board, there's a number of congressmen and women on the list who have been the subjects of ethics violation investigations, including Maxine Waters, who has been there for a very long time. So, now that we see Representative Conyers resigning, yes, he had did some good things in his career, but the fact that he now wants his son to step in and continue his legacy, really, is quite rich since he's been there so long."

And quite frankly, him appointing or his son as next successor was really an eyebrow raiser, because, for me, I went and stopped that his great nephew Ian Conyers would've been the person who he named as he's the rising in the Democratic Party. But what's really interesting here, where it has been overlooked, it's how -- for me, Conyers has been cannibalized by the Democratic Party. And there has been this level of inequity when it comes to what has happened. You know, I am not a fan of sexual assault by any means, but whether it's Al Franken with the photographic evidence, we have Roy Moore, we have Donald Trump. Why is there not an outcry for all of these people to step down as well? And let's be honest here. Often the Democrats say that the Republicans don't have a heart. Well, you know, to be quite honest, the Democrats lack a spine here. We have to start sticking up for those individuals or we say all people need to resign, not just one.

And, of course, this comes down to how much power each party is willing to give up. Then, the Senate might not be willing to give up a seat to -- in terms of Franken seat whereas a House seat is easier to replace. So, there's a double standard. There is case by case instances that have to look at in terms of the extreme nature of allegations that are taken.

And this investigation, it's out of the White House in so far as whatever is going on over there is going on over there. It's a special counsel investigation. We're all complying. But the president also made very clear there's no collusion. And Martha, let's be very clear and very fair here, that is what the media and the Democrats promised for over a year now.

It is been a miserable 18 hours here in this part of California. Now we know of at least four other fires that are burning across Southern California. The winds have really kicked up. In the distance you can see just how far this fire has burned. This isn't the wild lands. This is going to a major metropolitan area of Ventura where they've lost hundreds of homes. At some point the winds kick up right now. They've come back. They've died down for maybe a half an hour, but here they come again.

And the reason as he suggested is because there was this massive doping scandal where they were giving their athletes performance enhancing drugs. It involved the Russian Olympic committee, the ministry of sport, and not only that, the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB was involved. What they apparently did, Martha, was they built a secret lab right next to the room, the storage room where the urine samples were held with a hole in the wall. And they would do in the middle of the night, they would take the sample of the athletes that have been doping, put it through the wall, they would give it to a KGB-FSB officer who would take it away, somehow magically get the tamper proof cap off and return it with clean urine.

Quoting, they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people. The comments were widely excoriated, but two weeks later when Kate Steinle was shot and kill by an illegal immigrant, Trump's call to build a wall picked up momentum and his provocative statement continued. When Senator John McCain criticized Trump's portrayal of Mexican immigrant, Trump lashed out saying, quote, he's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured. McCain spent five years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, after his plane was shot down. The anti-hero comments were condemn by senior members of the Republican Party, but those senior members were also far from sacred. When Senator Lindsey Graham called Trump a lightweight and an idiot, Trump read Graham's phone number on national television. And from that point, the controversial comment became a weekly occurrence. Trump went after Megyn Kelly for aggressively questioning him during a presidential debate. And during an interview with Rolling Stone in September of 2015, Trump criticized Carly Fiorina's appearance, quoting, look at that face. Would any one vote for that?

And so, Reince, when he said it, he was courageous for having done it in the sense that he's the chairman of the RNC. He had a different role than Corey or I or others on the team. We were Trump's campaign step. He was the chairman of the RNC, and he was being, you know, assaulted by different leaders, donors who wanted Trump to drop out. So Reince Priebus stepped up and helped Donald Trump get ready for these debates. His assistance in debate prep for St. Louis, and for the third debate in Las Vegas, without that, I don't know that things would have gone as well. The president stepped up on the stage and delivered a masterful performance in both. But some of that was the preparation."

When I put myself back in that moment, you remember that everybody thought Hillary was going to win based on the polls, right? I mean, because the polls have always worked basically before. And I asked him -- everybody asked him if he was going to concede. Is he going to concede or he's going to fight this thing, right? Play this little clip, and then I want to get Corey's response."

He had no speech if he lost written, because he was going to wait to see what the results were. And the mainstream media narrative, which was so unfair to President Trump was, are you going to make a concession speech when you lose. No one asked Hillary Clinton that. And what we saw that night was the failure of Hillary Clinton. Her true colors came out that night where she lost the election and she refused to stand before the American people and say I concede this race. That's the cowardness of Hillary Clinton. But everybody in the mainstream media, we talk about this in the book, was pushing Donald Trump to say will you make a concession speech. And all of those pundits they were wrong and he was right."
