      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning everybody. We have a huge week ahead. As soon as tomorrow, there may be an arrest in the Robert Mueller Russia probe. House Republicans are expected to release their tax plan on Wednesday, and congressional investigators take a deeper look at the Obama era Uranium One deal. Good morning everyone I'm Maria Bartiromo, welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Wall Street Journal reporting that at least one person has been charged in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, an arrest possibly coming tomorrow. Where does the probe go now? I'll talk with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Counter Terror, and Intel Subcommittee Chairman Peter King, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee coming up.  I will also speak with Congressman McCarthy about the Republicans' Tax Plan set to be released this Wednesday, what are the remaining sticking points, we'll talk about it coming up.  Plus the road ahead for Saudi Arabia part of my conversation with his royal highness, the future king, Crowned Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and what may be the start of a revolution of sorts there. All that and a lot more coming up right now as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  Well, tax reform will be the talk of the town this week in Washington as the House Ways and Means Committee prepares to release its tax plan on Wednesday. The measure will then go through a markup session before advancing to the floor. House leaders also hoping to address concerns expressed by the 20 GOP lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the budget bill last week. Joining me right now, Republican California Congressman and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Great to see you, Congressman.",

We have the criteria, we want it to be simple, we want it to be pro-growth and we want to help the hard-working Americans. So we double the standard deduction, so a family -- a couple may now get their first $24,000 tax-free. You want to lower that corporate rate down to 20 so we can compete around the world. Latest study show that means 4000 more dollars into the household income by getting that up. Small businesses create more jobs, lower that to 25 percent, the lowest it's been in 80 years, and simplify it so people could actually just fill it out on a postcard.

What you really want to look at and we've been sitting down with all those individuals, Kevin Brady numerous meetings and there's been a lot of great ideas they proposed looking at -- dealing with the property tax portion. And the one thing you'll have to remember, if you double the standard deductions, if you lower the rates and you eliminate AMT, if people look at the overall tax plan and they live in those states, they're going to like the final outcome of what it deals with, especially if you're that middle- income hardworking American, you're going to get a tax savings in the process. And if you're eliminating the AMT, that really offsets what people are doing when it comes to that. So we're looking at property tax because some of the states have very high property tax and I think Kevin Brady is going to have something coming forward that the majority of those members are going to like.",

I mean, you could retain the property tax deduction but he continues to say that New York pays into the federal government more than it's getting back. That in fact, even Governor Cuomo tweeted just recently under this tax plan, every New Yorker will get a tax increase, so how could the President say this is the biggest tax cut in history when in fact a big portion of the country is going to get a tax increase by eliminating that deduction?",

First, Nancy Pelosi said the same thing and she just got two Pinocchios because it's not true, because it actually helps the middle class. Secondly, I come from California. The argument that you're not getting back your federal money? Well first of all, California and New York, they have to live within their means. Federal government borrows so they spend more than they actually bring in. Secondly, what you really look at the biggest payments that are going out are to Medicare and Social Security, so if you come from a state that has an old population, you're going to get more than what you come from, more than what you pay in.   I like the idea of California being more prosperous and being a younger generation. That gives us a better future. So you really got to compare apples-to-apples, that's an argument that doesn't play when you're talking about state and local tax deductions. If you're lowering the rate, letting people keep more of what they earn. So if I go from giving the first 12,000 tax rate to 24, that helps me save to buy a new home, that helps me to determine whether I want to send my kids to private school and others. And then I lowered the rate you're paying from 10 percent to 0, from 15-12, I'm actually keeping more of my own money. So it offsets any difference when it comes (INAUDIBLE) and actually lets me keep more and grow the economy.",

I say let's look to see what Kevin Brady brings out on Wednesday, but the one thing that is very important, those members that come from the state they have been so productive in expressing there what their districts are looking at.

So the more that you could put away earlier, the more you'll have later. And if you can do it and not be taxed later on, there is a way to make Americans more self-insured, have greater resources, so the way we'll look at the 401k, we will protect it, we'll expand the amount that you can invest but we'll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life, not to have that tax burden hovering over you in the future but actually have greater income in the future.",

Where does the probe go now? I'll talk with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Counter Terror, and Intel Subcommittee Chairman Peter King, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee coming up. I will also speak with Congressman McCarthy about the Republicans' Tax Plan set to be released this Wednesday, what are the remaining sticking points, we'll talk about it coming up. Plus the road ahead for Saudi Arabia part of my conversation with his royal highness, the future king, Crowned Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and what may be the start of a revolution of sorts there. All that and a lot more coming up right now as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Well, tax reform will be the talk of the town this week in Washington as the House Ways and Means Committee prepares to release its tax plan on Wednesday. The measure will then go through a markup session before advancing to the floor. House leaders also hoping to address concerns expressed by the 20 GOP lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the budget bill last week.

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

We have the criteria, we want it to be simple, we want it to be pro-growth and we want to help the hard-working Americans. So we double the standard deduction, so a family -- a couple may now get their first $24,000 tax-free. You want to lower that corporate rate down to 20 so we can compete around the world. Latest study show that means 4000 more dollars into the household income by getting that up. Small businesses create more jobs, lower that to 25 percent, the lowest it's been in 80 years, and simplify it so people could actually just fill it out on a postcard. Keep the home deduction, keep charitable, and expand child tax credit."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

What you really want to look at and we've been sitting down with all those individuals, Kevin Brady numerous meetings and there's been a lot of great ideas they proposed looking at -- dealing with the property tax portion. And the one thing you'll have to remember, if you double the standard deductions, if you lower the rates and you eliminate AMT, if people look at the overall tax plan and they live in those states, they're going to like the final outcome of what it deals with, especially if you're that middle- income hardworking American, you're going to get a tax savings in the process. And if you're eliminating the AMT, that really offsets what people are doing when it comes to that. So we're looking at property tax because some of the states have very high property tax and I think Kevin Brady is going to have something coming forward that the majority of those members are going to like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "That's not enough though for Peter King. I mean, you could retain the property tax deduction but he continues to say that New York pays into the federal government more than it's getting back. That in fact, even Governor Cuomo tweeted just recently under this tax plan, every New Yorker will get a tax increase, so how could the President say this is the biggest tax cut in history when in fact a big portion of the country is going to get a tax increase by eliminating that deduction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's two points where you have to look at. First, Nancy Pelosi said the same thing and she just got two Pinocchios because it's not true, because it actually helps the middle class. Secondly, I come from California. The argument that you're not getting back your federal money? Well first of all, California and New York, they have to live within their means. Federal government borrows so they spend more than they actually bring in. Secondly, what you really look at the biggest payments that are going out are to Medicare and Social Security, so if you come from a state that has an old population, you're going to get more than what you come from, more than what you pay in. I like the idea of California being more prosperous and being a younger generation. That gives us a better future. So you really got to compare apples-to-apples, that's an argument that doesn't play when you're talking about state and local tax deductions. If you're lowering the rate, letting people keep more of what they earn. So if I go from giving the first 12,000 tax rate to 24, that helps me save to buy a new home, that helps me to determine whether I want to send my kids to private school and others. And then I lowered the rate you're paying from 10 percent to 0, from 15-12, I'm actually keeping more of my own money. So it offsets any difference when it comes (INAUDIBLE) and actually lets me keep more and grow the economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Is there a way that you could sort of adjust that to a cap on certain incomes so if you make more than $200,000 then you will not be able to deduct that but if you make below$200,000 you can, in fact, keep that deduction or you just not generating enough revenue to put caps and (INAUDIBLE)?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, we want to look at overall. And the one thing you have to remember, only about a third itemize, after we raise the standard deductions, fewer will itemize in the process too because they have a better savings. We were looking at the property tax. There's a lot of different ideas going forward. I say let's look to see what Kevin Brady brings out on Wednesday, but the one thing that is very important, those members that come from the state they have been so productive in expressing there what their districts are looking at. We've been looking at the numbers, they've been expressing what they want to see, and I think at the end of the day their voice is being heard in what we're able to put forward for them."

But more than individuals can invest their own money, the better off we are in the long term. They have more capital, they can protect themselves in the future and they're not looking to govern it."

I recognize you're talking about a budget that was half a trillion dollars overspending, the next year's budget half a trillion dollars overspending. You need to look for as much money as possible to pay for these tax cuts, but will you really get sizable money by doing anything to change 401k?"

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

So the more that you could put away earlier, the more you'll have later. And if you can do it and not be taxed later on, there is a way to make Americans more self-insured, have greater resources, so the way we'll look at the 401k, we will protect it, we'll expand the amount that you can invest but we'll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life, not to have that tax burden hovering over you in the future but actually have greater income in the future."

It is devastating what its caused down there. And what you really want to look at, we would look at certain areas that have been wiped out but the house next door survived perfectly because of new building standards. The building standards matter. So when we go back and make an investments here, we should prepare ourselves that there'll be a future hurricane sometime in the future.

Bill Clinton's worst year, his growth year was higher than Barack Obama's best year. We just went through our second quarter of having 3 percent growth. President Trump has done an amazing job eliminating a lot of this regulation, cutting the federal register, getting growth back up there. Tax is the part that will keep more money in Americans hands, getting small business moving again, and more jobs created. At the end of the day, I'd love to run on that."

This has been out there for a number of months sitting there. And what's more importantly here, those that want to keep their loopholes, yes they're going to argue and they're going to pay lobbyists a lot of money, but this is exactly why this President won the election, because he's listened to the middle class. He's fighting for the middle class and that's what this plan will do.

The Wall Street Journal out with an op-ed on Friday last week basically asking Mueller to resign. Let's take a look at that headline right here in the Journal and I want to ask you your thoughts on this. It says, it is no slur against Mr. Mueller's integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. Given all of his conflicts, he could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest. Your thoughts Congressman King?"

We have Michael Cohen, whose President Trump's attorney in this week. He answered every question. I've been there for almost all of the witnesses. There's not one word of evidence linking in any way the Trump campaign to any Russian collusion. And as far as Director Mueller, you know, serious issues have been raised certainly involving the uranium investigations coming up, the role the FBI had in that. Now, I have a great regard for Director Mueller, but I think there are issues here which he's going to have to address because it is going to involve the investigation in what the FBI was doing and not doing at a critical time during our relationship with Russia when he was head of the FBI. So I'm not calling on him to resign but there are issues he's going to have to address and discuss them publicly."

Is he going to actually investigate effectively the fact that John Podesta's brother Tony Podesta was -- had a lobbying firm, that he was actually lobbying against sanctions against Russia? All of these things are so front and center and yet we're still talking about the potential collusion with the President."

And yet, this was approved by the cabinet, by the Treasury Secretary, the Secretary of State and the President. Did the FBI notify the administration, the Obama administration at the time this investigation was ongoing and all of the allegations are being made, and if so what was done as they didn't (INAUDIBLE) us?"

I've heard nothing since then at all from anyone out. Kevin McCarthy did say about the property tax. Again, that is a step forward but by not allowing the state income tax deduction, that has to be fully analyzed because that is a major issue in my district also and throughout the state of New York, so this is coming out on Wednesday. They've had nine months to put it together. This is a bill which is going to affect generations to come with the impact that's going to happen. It's been 30 years since the last tax reform. We can't afford to have this go wrong so I'm not going to sign on to anything until a full package is fully examined by economist and analysts in my district. And not just from my district, but also for adjoining districts, the City of New York and New York State with all our economies interrelated and interconnected and to lose that deduction which by the way goes against the principle we've had since 1913 that you don't have a double tax, you don't pay tax on a tax.

I mean, I asked the President this when I sat down with him a week ago, when we were at the White House and I asked him how important it is to have better relations with these Senators, watch this Governor I've got to get your reaction to what he said."

So you know at the end of the day, what are they thinking when they do this? But you know here's what I wonder. Why is it that some of these Republicans are so anxious to get a tongue bath from Charles Schumer and the national media which is what they get if they are willing to go criticize President Trump? Why aren't they more interested in doing what their constituents at home want and look at the numbers. Corker and Flake went to the toilet with their approval ratings in their home states once they decided that they were going to spend their time attacking the President rather than solving the problems of their citizens in their home states."

What are you expecting to see? I mean, you saw the sound bite earlier or the clip from the Wall Street Journal that's basically saying look, Mueller is way too conflicted with his relationships within the FBI having run it. He needs to step down particularly since we've been following this witch hunt of an investigation looking for collusion with the Trump administration that doesn't exist and all the other collusion is right in front of our noses with the Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well I think it's easier to find Bigfoot and Amelia Earhart than it is to find collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump. The fact is, what they really need to be looking at is the $972,000 that Obama for America paid the Perkins Coie Law Firm. Why Hillary Clinton paid them $5.6 million in 2016, that same law firm who in turn funded the Fusion GPS research on the dossier that turned out to be total fabrication. There's some smoke but it's not in the camp of the Trumps. It's in the camp of the DNC and the Hillary campaign. If Mueller doesn't go after that, then I think that he shows that all those people he hired who were Hillary donors were in fact there as shields for the Democrats in trying to protect her rather than protect America. One important point, Maria that I feel like we've got to focus on. People have said particularly Democrats and a lot of the media people, but then I repeat myself. Well, Hillary is not elected so it doesn't matter. Well, it does matter for the simple reason. This is not about who won the election. This is about who broke the law and broke faith with the American people."

I mean, this whole dossier, I'm glad you brought up this dossier because I want to know what evidence came from the dossier which now we know is a completely fabricated piece of nothing.

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "That's a good question that we need an answer to. And if they did, then where in the Obama administration was the push to do the wiretap -- and let's be clear about a wiretap. We're not talking about just tapping a phone but listening in and having surveillance that could be in many, many different forms. But why was that done, to whom it was done, who had a look at it, and how high up did both the approval go and the surveillance actually end up? Those are important questions. And again, forget the politics of it. This is important because anytime an American's liberties, their civil liberties are trampled upon by a federal government who can do pretty much anything they want to do, all of our liberties are at stake and we better never forget that."

We only want to go back to what we were. The moderates Islam that is open to the world, open to all the religions. 70 percent of the Saudi people are less than 30 years old and quite frankly, we will not waste 30 years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas. We will destroy them today. We want to live a normal life, a life that translates our moderate religion, our good customs, we co-exist and live with the world and contribute to the development of our country and the world. This is something that -- there are steps that have taken -- we have taken in the past that are clear. I believe that we will eradicate the rest of extremism very soon, so I don't think this is a real challenge because we represent the moderate teachings and principles of Islam and we have the right.

You're most concerned about Iran, you're most concern about the rise of terrorism in your own backyard. Israel-Palestine is a long, long forgotten priority and so they're willing to talk to the Israelis behind the scenes much more than before. Netanyahu feels like he's in a very comfortable position."

And we all want him to succeed. The ambition is kind of staggering and breathtaking. Some of the stuff is great and very long overdue but let's be clear Saudi's society is really conservative and the support that exists internationally for the Crown Prince is a little more consistent than what he has within his own country."

So number one, everyone wants to know what Kim Jong-un does or doesn't do while Trump is there. Is he going to test a weapon, is he going to -- an ICBM, is he going to test an H bomb and how do the Americans react to that. Number one -- so number one --"

Number two is how much time is Trump going to give China to get something done on North Korea before the U.S. starts moving on U.S.-China trade, by far the most important issue for your viewers. So I mean, I think that this is a really big one. I just came back from Tokyo. His relationship with Abe is awesome and certainly that at the beginning of the trip is going to go very well. The rest of this is going to be a lot harder to orchestrate."

When Trump was willing to take the call from the Taiwanese President, all of that. Then, with the Mar-a-Lago visit, things got much better. But they got better predicated not on the charisma between the two men, predicated that there was going to be some support from China on resolving the North Korea issue. And I will tell you, no one believes that either the Chinese can reign in the North Koreans or that they are willing to push the North Koreans suitably hard, cut off all their energy --"

It comes amid revelations that Fusion was first paid to conduct research during the 2016 election on then- candidate Trump by the conservative Washington free bacon and then it was paid by Hillary Clinton's Campaign and the Democratic National Committee. I want to bring in our panel on that. Caitlin Huey-Burns is National Political Reporter for Real Clear Politics, Ed Rollins is a former White House Advisor to President Ronald Reagan and a Fox News Contributor. It is a pleasure to see you both. Thanks so much for joining us. So is the whole Russia thing turning on the Democrats? Explain what's going on right now Ed?"

Now clearly we're finding out this fusion which is an opposition research company, most of former reporters was being paid by the Democrats and by the DNC and by the Clinton campaign who also denied any knowledge of it. At the end of the day, four things is going to happen this week that are going to have big consequences. One is who gets indicted tomorrow out of the Trump world, the second is who has been -- who is the lobbyist in Washington who worked for the FBI as an under -- as confidential informant in all this stuff and that's supposed to be disclosed this week. Then the fusion bank records, who did pay them and what have you, that's the third thing. The fourth thing obviously is the budget -- the budget bill which--"

      "utterance": "Well, you know, there are arguments to be made that some of it well pretty salacious obviously. And other elements could have been, you know, it hasn't been completely disproven. I think Republicans have lacked a counter-narrative this whole time to the allegations surrounding Trump and Russia. And so, you're seeing the House Intelligence Committee, you're seeing Republicans say we've had majority in Congress for a while now. Why are we not being more proactive in going after this? So I think among the Republican Party base, I think this is a way for them to have a counter- narrative. I do think, however, though that with this indictment coming down tomorrow and again, we don't know who it is."

I think that that issue is going to take center stage at a time that Republicans really can't afford it, because they have this tax bill coming out this week, the President as you just mentioned was -- is going -- preparing to go abroad after really key important trip and this is hanging over. And it just points to the idea that who knows what's coming next and It's kind of this living in fear of things just dropping down."

      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "The one thing that needs to be made very clear, when Comey, when he was the FBI Director had his meeting with the President and basically presented this document and the17 memos they're all put together. Normally opposition research is press clippings, bank loans that kind of stuff. It's not salacious information. In this document, there was salacious information that was unfounded or unproven. For him to walk in and say, Mr. President, I think you should know this was pretty outrageous because I would assume if I was the President, I was sitting there as saying, is this your document or whose document is this in your first meeting. Equally as important, it turned out he had made that same presentation to President Obama. President Obama's team got very active in looking at everything after this and I think what you'll really find out that all of the stuff gets started by these documents that were not basically tested out and certainly the FBI basically is going to black eye if they didn't do that."

We don't know what the catalyst for all this was. My assumption is this document had a big role in all that and if it did, then I think the FBI failed on its mission."

But as we saw, I think the budget vote was very revealing. 20 Republicans voted against it, which shows they have so little margin for error in the House, let alone the Senate and as we were talking about earlier, the Senate is really going to be the difficulty here. And you talk to Republicans and they're concerned a little bit about this relationship because they want to be able to present a united front because this tax bill is going to be a proxy for showing that they can govern by passing some legislation."
