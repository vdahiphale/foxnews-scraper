Citing yourself is the opposite of objective, speaks to a larger problem in a modern debate that plagues all arguments, not just ones about drugs. In every single debate these days, you know it's pointless when someone says, \"But it happened to me!\" Or, \"I know! I was one!\" See Jenny McCarthy and her vaccine quackery. Subjective experience is good, but it ain't proof. The point of science is to override subjectivity. Like miracles, your personal experience must be verifiable. It doesn't mean you don't have answers. It just means you need the facts, too. Perry's right about an addict's helplessness, but the word \"disease\" bugs me, for as the night winds down, I can throw my cocaine, my vodka, my rare German pornography out the window. I have. But you cannot do the same thing with cancer. That kind of disease rages independent of your choices. So, Dr. Krauthammer, you're a psychiatrist.

Look, I can understand how they think they were able to, by using media and contact and high-tech stuff, to reach and to get out the vote on everybody out there who is a potential Democrat and succeed in 2012. But a vote is free. It's quite different to go out and to purchase health insurance if you're young, healthy, invincible and you don't need it. And the premium is twice what it ought to be. So, this idea that they have discovered a technique that will turn out the young -- yes, if it's for something that costs you nothing, but it's not going to work for ObamaCare.

The fact is, no matter how much you like Perry and dislike Hitchens' ruthlessness, Perry needs to come with the facts. When someone asks for objective evidence, you can't say you are your own evidence. Citing yourself is the opposite of objective, speaks to a larger problem in a modern debate that plagues all arguments, not just ones about drugs. In every single debate these days, you know it's pointless when someone says, \"But it happened to me!\" Or, \"I know! I was one!\" See Jenny McCarthy and her vaccine quackery. Subjective experience is good, but it ain't proof. The point of science is to override subjectivity. Like miracles, your personal experience must be verifiable. It doesn't mean you don't have answers. It just means you need the facts, too. Perry's right about an addict's helplessness, but the word \"disease\" bugs me, for as the night winds down, I can throw my cocaine, my vodka, my rare German pornography out the window. I have. But you cannot do the same thing with cancer. That kind of disease rages independent of your choices. So, Dr. Krauthammer, you're a psychiatrist. What is the research -- this is a very, very heated debate that's going on and has been going on for years. What does the research say about addiction as a disease?"

There now is a growing body of evidence that there is a genetic connection. I think it also is true that people who are depressed and do have a sense of doom in their lives fill that hole with something that numbs them.

And if you eliminate the DNA part of it, you're dealing with a young person who probably has been given it by a friend, and it was cool, and it was more social than like you said, genetic and/or solving a depression problem."

And thus you will want, in raising a child, and with that history, you'd want to be all the more careful about exposing them to drugs or alcohol because of the predisposition that would suggest otherwise."

These are recovering druggies who would actually be the judges in those courts. I'm not sure if that's going to be favorable. Some recovering alcoholics or druggies are pretty tough. So, I guess -- I also don't like that because then Greg then is the rationale, if I want to commit a crime, I get really high because then I get to go to the softy drug court. It also, I think, destigmatizes it where people will say yeah, he went out and robbed a bank after doing a bunch of blow. Oh, OK, you know, he was high, so I guess he goes to drug court.

And maybe the idea is to drive Christians just out of the Middle East."

This is sort of a recapitulation of what happened in the Middle East 60 years ago, where Jews who lived in Iraq, Baghdad, Egypt for over 2,000 years were driven out. And this is another example of this sort of exclusion or ethnic cleansing of anything that is not Muslim on the part of radical Islamists.

I said, \"And, I don't want to go there. Let's talk about what's been going on, decades and decades or centuries of persecution of Christians in the Middle East.\" And people on Twitter really took me to task for not attacking the Obama administration for it. I don't think it's the right thing to do right now. I don't think -- I'm not saying that they're not doing enough or too much, but I just think this is a bigger picture. I think the world, not just the United States, like the royals, have to get involved. Really come down hard on the countries that are doing this and saying, like you said last night, Bob, you want to pull some aid from the U.S. Maybe something else, too."

The rest of us are making kale chips. Globally, it seems like Christians are becoming less fundamental, as Islam is becoming more fundamental."

The Coptics have a little boy pick out the pope if they get down to three -- the choice of three people who made the cut. Made the cut. Like in baseball. What do you think here? Is this something that is just ordained to happen and we just have to give up on it? Or is there a way to stop it?"

It matters if you are anything but a Muslim or if you are ruled by the Muslims. That's the ultimate goal. And to Greg's point, Christianity is started to diminish, and in the Koran, and if you read Bernard Lewis, which I went back and did yesterday, \"The Islamic Crisis,\" he talks about this. When radicals are dominated and outnumbered, they are more docile. Now they're not. That is why they're going on the offense. And my point about the administration is not that they're doing anything and they're sitting back. They're actually enabling and helping the jihadists rising up. And that's the biggest problem."

You should never, ever call in a bomb scare. People can get hurt; panic, et cetera. So don't try it at home. However, has any of us not had the fantasy of having a final exam and a bomb scare came up and canceled it? It reminds me of a movie, a wonderful movie about 10 or 20 years ago called \"Hope and Glory,\" about a child -- through a child's eyes the summer of the blitz in London. He's in the country having a wonderful summer, but then he needs to go back. When he arrives back to school and on the day he arrives at school, a German airplane appears overhead and look at what happens."

And I wanted, in my way (ph), to try to dispel some of the notions. You can see there's Walter. Can we bring up Charles' poster here? Charles was very upfront for Mondale, and I particularly thought that this was appropriate to bring it back up, because let me just say again, he had nothing to do with the '84 campaign that I managed to report at least accurately, a 49-state loss. He didn't get involved himself in 1980. Although I did, between '80 and '84 got some notes, some strategy suggestions for '84 from someone named Derrick Hammerkraut (ph). Now, I don't know who that was, but I kept taking notes of that advice. And 49 states later -- well, there you go. No, he's not. He became a conservative. It's too bad. He went the wrong way."
