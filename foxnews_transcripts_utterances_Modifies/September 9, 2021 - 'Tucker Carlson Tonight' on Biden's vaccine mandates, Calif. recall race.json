Just hours ago, Joe Biden delivered a speech that marks a clear turning point in his administration. It's a declaration of war against nearly 80 million Americans, and it's a promise from Joe Biden that he'll ignore the Constitution and basic principles of federalism just to get what he wants.  This afternoon, Joe Biden announced that most businesses in this country are required to start forcing employees to either get the COVID vaccine or submit to regular COVID tests.",

Now Republicans are responding. Republican Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has just announced that the Republican National Committee will sue the Biden administration over this order, quote: \"When this decree goes into effect, the R.N.C. will sue the administration to protect Americans and their liberties,\" unquote.   Matt Walsh is host of \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" He joins us to respond. Well Matt, this looked like a temper tantrum over Afghanistan. The President just taking out his anger on the country, on businesses. How do you see it? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, I think it's interesting that we were assured for four years that Donald Trump is a tyrant, that he is, you know Hitler incarnate, and meanwhile he was like the least tyrannical President we've had in in a very long time with his -- you know, with the way that he used his authority.  No, we had to elect this rotting bag of oatmeal to get a real tyrant. I mean, that's what -- Joe Biden as you point out, this is not the first time that he has explicitly said he doesn't have the authority to do something legally and then done it anyway.  So we can sit here until we're blue in the face and say he doesn't have the authority to do it, he doesn't have the authority to do. It doesn't matter, he admits he doesn't have the authority to do it, but he is going to do it anyway. I think, all of us as Americans, we have to understand this that that is as far as they are concerned, the powers that be, the legal justification is that they want to do it and what are you going to do about it? That's really their justification, which is why maybe this, in the end is a good thing in the sense that it's a time for choosing for Americans and American business owners and American citizens. Are we going to comply and lie down to this? Or are we finally going to stand up and say, you know what, it's not going to happen.   You want to send -- you want to send the Army in and shut down millions of businesses and start arresting business owners? Because that's what you're going to have to do. I think we have to draw that line. If we don't draw it here as Americans, then we might as well forget about this country and forget about freedom entirely.",

So, he is just going to run out of little boots on the ground to visit these businesses and hand them slips and fine them.  My assessment is that no one's going to trust Joe Biden anymore after he declared independence from the pandemic in July, after he said there weren't going to be mask mandates, after he said no vax mandates. He took off his mask in this big show and now he throws down the gauntlet and we go back to this permanent pandemic.  The same thing with Afghanistan.

There is already a problem of especially from the perspective of the Federal government and the people that are pushing the vaccines, there is a problem, people don't trust them. Well, you're not going to convince people to trust the vaccines when you go about it this way and if you're worried about quote-unquote \"conspiracy theories\" and all this kind of stuff, well, having the Federal government tear the Constitution up to force these substances into your arms, that is not going to quell those conspiracy theories.   And as you pointed out, if the vaccines work, as many of us have pointed out, do the vaccines work or not? Because if they do, then it shouldn't matter to you if you're a vaccinated person whether or not your co-worker has the vaccine. That's the question they cannot answer.  The other question they can't answer by the way is, what about natural immunity? Does that not exist? We're just pretending that natural immunity doesn't exist. In his order that he passed down today, natural immunity doesn't factor in. He is just -- we're just pretending that that's not a thing. Well, the science tells us that it is a thing and that it provides lasting protection, but we are throwing that on the burn pile, I guess.",

So OSHA is a very weird way to go about this, and OSHA has original set of regulations that were passed at the beginning of OSHA decades ago, then it has some additional regulations that were passed after you know, notice and comment. What he is trying to do here is announce them under this very rarely used emergency provision and the emergency provision provides that there has to be some kind of immediate, shocking, unusual threat to the workplace that's dire and there isn't time to go through the normal process to do this. That's obviously not the case here. We've been living with COVID for 18 months now. It's not even a pandemic anymore, it's an endemic. It's something that we're living with.   And Ron Klain, the Chief of Staff actually retweeted a comment from somebody on Twitter saying that this was actually a workaround, to get around his promise that he wouldn't do a Federal vaccine mandate, they're using OSHA wink-wink-nudge-nudge.

And you know, to the point where we're ignoring the science. I mean, I think a lot of what we're seeing here with the illiteracy about science is simply a product of our very lacking educational system in this country. This is scientifically baseless and you know, like Matt said, people are not going to trust public health officials going forward. What about a real threat to our health? People are not going to believe public health officials. That's a huge problem for our country.  So this is a shambles.

We can now add to that that under President Biden, unvetted, unverified, unauthorized Afghan nationals are also treated better than our veterans. Let me briefly break down for your audience what is in the proposal. Now, the Biden administration is relying on the fact that many in the media either won't understand or won't care to explain in their newspapers or their other outlets what is actually in the proposal and you have summarized it exactly and correctly.  It provides free lifetime welfare to all Afghan nationals that Biden has flown into the United States to date or that he may choose to fly here at any point over the next 13 months, and we can assume that if that were to be included in the upcoming government funding bill, it would just be continually extended every year thereafter. But that's only just part of it, it keeps going. They redefine an Afghan national to mean anybody who has ever lived for a length of time in Afghanistan, even if they're not living there now and haven't lived there in many, many years. So in other words, it allows Joe Biden to go to say for example, Pakistan, fill planes up with Afghan nationals who've been living in Pakistan for decades, fly them in the United States and give them lifetime welfare. It also gives them, as you correctly mentioned, green cards. What's a green card? Permanent residency and a path to voting citizenship. You know what else comes with that? Chain migration. So if you bring in say a hundred thousand people, they can then bring in 500, 000 people, and that's not all. They also include a catch-all waiver - - get ready for this -- a catch-all waiver that allows Mayorkas to waive the statutory, in other words the legal entry bars on people who are guilty of trafficking, who are guilty of human and sex trafficking, who are guilty of drug crimes, who are guilty of a wide variety of criminal offenses or who present a public health threat. So in other words, on the same day that you are being ordered to surrender to all of these government mandates, all health mandates are waivable for - - you guessed it -- Afghan nationals.

I'm a philosopher, I'm not a biologist. And among other things, I was brought on charge of that, I've been accused of a microaggression when I asked for the evidence for microaggressions. I've been accused of microaggressions when I asked by colleagues and by students -- when I asked for evidence of the policies that were engulfing like trigger warnings, why should there be a trigger warning on a syllabus? What is the evidence that safe spaces are helpful to students? So even asking for evidence was a microaggression, so you've created a kind of a culture in which even asking questions about things is viewed as a violation. It's become a dogma factory.",

It's a declaration of war against nearly 80 million Americans, and it's a promise from Joe Biden that he'll ignore the Constitution and basic principles of federalism just to get what he wants.

Matt Walsh is host of \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" He joins us to respond. Well Matt, this looked like a temper tantrum over Afghanistan. The President just taking out his anger on the country, on businesses. How do you see it? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, I think it's interesting that we were assured for four years that Donald Trump is a tyrant, that he is, you know Hitler incarnate, and meanwhile he was like the least tyrannical President we've had in in a very long time with his -- you know, with the way that he used his authority. No, we had to elect this rotting bag of oatmeal to get a real tyrant. I mean, that's what -- Joe Biden as you point out, this is not the first time that he has explicitly said he doesn't have the authority to do something legally and then done it anyway. So we can sit here until we're blue in the face and say he doesn't have the authority to do it, he doesn't have the authority to do. It doesn't matter, he admits he doesn't have the authority to do it, but he is going to do it anyway. I think, all of us as Americans, we have to understand this that that is as far as they are concerned, the powers that be, the legal justification is that they want to do it and what are you going to do about it? That's really their justification, which is why maybe this, in the end is a good thing in the sense that it's a time for choosing for Americans and American business owners and American citizens. Are we going to comply and lie down to this? Or are we finally going to stand up and say, you know what, it's not going to happen. You want to send -- you want to send the Army in and shut down millions of businesses and start arresting business owners? Because that's what you're going to have to do. I think we have to draw that line. If we don't draw it here as Americans, then we might as well forget about this country and forget about freedom entirely."

My assessment is that no one's going to trust Joe Biden anymore after he declared independence from the pandemic in July, after he said there weren't going to be mask mandates, after he said no vax mandates. He took off his mask in this big show and now he throws down the gauntlet and we go back to this permanent pandemic. The same thing with Afghanistan. Taliban wasn't going to take over, we got this under control. Next thing you know, Kabul is falling, and Americans are stranded. No one believes him anymore."

There is already a problem of especially from the perspective of the Federal government and the people that are pushing the vaccines, there is a problem, people don't trust them. Well, you're not going to convince people to trust the vaccines when you go about it this way and if you're worried about quote-unquote \"conspiracy theories\" and all this kind of stuff, well, having the Federal government tear the Constitution up to force these substances into your arms, that is not going to quell those conspiracy theories. And as you pointed out, if the vaccines work, as many of us have pointed out, do the vaccines work or not? Because if they do, then it shouldn't matter to you if you're a vaccinated person whether or not your co-worker has the vaccine. That's the question they cannot answer. The other question they can't answer by the way is, what about natural immunity? Does that not exist? We're just pretending that natural immunity doesn't exist. In his order that he passed down today, natural immunity doesn't factor in. He is just -- we're just pretending that that's not a thing. Well, the science tells us that it is a thing and that it provides lasting protection, but we are throwing that on the burn pile, I guess."

So OSHA is a very weird way to go about this, and OSHA has original set of regulations that were passed at the beginning of OSHA decades ago, then it has some additional regulations that were passed after you know, notice and comment. What he is trying to do here is announce them under this very rarely used emergency provision and the emergency provision provides that there has to be some kind of immediate, shocking, unusual threat to the workplace that's dire and there isn't time to go through the normal process to do this. That's obviously not the case here. We've been living with COVID for 18 months now. It's not even a pandemic anymore, it's an endemic. It's something that we're living with. And Ron Klain, the Chief of Staff actually retweeted a comment from somebody on Twitter saying that this was actually a workaround, to get around his promise that he wouldn't do a Federal vaccine mandate, they're using OSHA wink-wink-nudge-nudge.

I mean talk about vectors of disease who go around to every household in the United States, why are they exempted, whereas a lot of workers in America today for companies of over a hundred people are working from home, why should they get vaccinated? And you know, to the point where we're ignoring the science. I mean, I think a lot of what we're seeing here with the illiteracy about science is simply a product of our very lacking educational system in this country. This is scientifically baseless and you know, like Matt said, people are not going to trust public health officials going forward. What about a real threat to our health? People are not going to believe public health officials. That's a huge problem for our country. So this is a shambles. This is a disgrace, and I think we're going to see the courts clogged with litigation challenging this and other aspects of the Biden agenda that are really decreasing our confidence both in science and in the government, and also you know, frankly, coming at the worst possible time for a struggling American economy."

I was at a homeless encampment in Venice, and a lot of people are angry. Homeowners are angry. Families are angry. Children have to go and pass these people to and from school. And the homeless population is in danger and it's also a health hazard and nothing is being done about it, that's one of the many failures of this Governor. So, it was a very angry and ugly scene. You know, if I were a Democrat, obviously, this would be called systemic racism. They'd be calling it a hate crime. I don't like to play that game. During all this, there was a big article about me, a negative in \"The New York Times\" and never once mentioned that I'm black, never once mentioned that I would be the first black Governor of California.

In October 2018, for example, David Chipman told \"The Hill\" that AR-15s should be treated quote, \"just like machine guns.\" Well, machine guns are banned in this country. He believes AR-15s, the single most popular rifle in America should be banned. Chipman made that remark in this capacity as a policy adviser for an anti- gun group, one of the many funded by Michael Bloomberg. In 2012, he suggested MSNBC that the Secret Service shouldn't carry firearms, and last year, David Chipman openly mocked the millions of Americans who were buying firearms to protect their families from the crime wave that David Chipman's party has unleashed on the country."

We'll be watching very closely to see who Joe Biden nominates in David Chipman's place. And of course, we'll keep you informed. After the debacle in Afghanistan, China has realized that Joe Biden is weak. Now, China is testing Joe Biden with a major military operation. That's straight ahead."

      "utterance": "The White House is now asking Congress to provide green cards to tens of thousands of Afghan refugees so that they can stay in the country indefinitely. Joe Biden is also demanding that lawmakers provide more than $6 billion to help resettle Afghan refugees on U.S. military bases. According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the money would also provide quote, \"resettlement benefits\" to Afghans. Stephen Miller is a former senior White House adviser. He joins us to assess. Stephen, I remember back in the day when Afghan veterans died waiting in line for healthcare at Obama-Biden's VA Hospitals and then Obama-Biden bureaucrats paid them bonuses to cover up these wait lists. Now, they're bringing in Afghans, giving them green cards, healthcare, probably free college tuition, food stamps -- that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, President Trump used to say that under President Obama, illegal aliens were treated better than our veterans, which of course is true today under President Biden. We can now add to that that under President Biden, unvetted, unverified, unauthorized Afghan nationals are also treated better than our veterans. Let me briefly break down for your audience what is in the proposal. Now, the Biden administration is relying on the fact that many in the media either won't understand or won't care to explain in their newspapers or their other outlets what is actually in the proposal and you have summarized it exactly and correctly. It provides free lifetime welfare to all Afghan nationals that Biden has flown into the United States to date or that he may choose to fly here at any point over the next 13 months, and we can assume that if that were to be included in the upcoming government funding bill, it would just be continually extended every year thereafter. But that's only just part of it, it keeps going. They redefine an Afghan national to mean anybody who has ever lived for a length of time in Afghanistan, even if they're not living there now and haven't lived there in many, many years. So in other words, it allows Joe Biden to go to say for example, Pakistan, fill planes up with Afghan nationals who've been living in Pakistan for decades, fly them in the United States and give them lifetime welfare. It also gives them, as you correctly mentioned, green cards. What's a green card? Permanent residency and a path to voting citizenship. You know what else comes with that? Chain migration. So if you bring in say a hundred thousand people, they can then bring in 500, 000 people, and that's not all. They also include a catch-all waiver - - get ready for this -- a catch-all waiver that allows Mayorkas to waive the statutory, in other words the legal entry bars on people who are guilty of trafficking, who are guilty of human and sex trafficking, who are guilty of drug crimes, who are guilty of a wide variety of criminal offenses or who present a public health threat. So in other words, on the same day that you are being ordered to surrender to all of these government mandates, all health mandates are waivable for - - you guessed it -- Afghan nationals. That is a summary of the proposal."

You don't know what he's capable of. You don't know who is making his decisions for him, if he is even making his own decisions. So China is rattling at saber in Taiwan, in the straits. They've seen how we've dealt with our allies, our enemies throughout the world, so far. We burned NATO, just to get out on Biden's timeline and so, they're testing us. What are the implications?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",

So we could have conflict on both ends of the Eurasian land mass and basically, what we're talking about is the next world war."

You have the Russians probably going to hack again, remember Biden gave them that little list of things they weren't allowed to smoke, okay. I'm not so sure Putin is going to pay much attention to that anymore and the Chinese will probably cause problems for us and North Korea and basically see where we're soft.

There are a number of places that China is pushing right now. And remember, Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, he is the most ambitious person in history and he really needs to take Taiwan to preserve his legitimacy because that's what he talks about all the time. He has got so many domestic problems at home, Jesse, he needs a war. And by the way, as you point out, he looks at Biden and thinks he is incapacitated or incapable. So, what could go wrong?"

The university really made it difficult in terms of students were telling me that other professors had told them not to take my class. There were flyers around campus with a Pinocchio nose, but this isn't really about necessarily the things that happened to me, that's just a piece of the larger picture of the social justice ecosystem that's taken over our university system."

But what kind of things are professors like yourself experiencing where they're unable to do their jobs?"

      "utterance": "They are experiencing -- anyone who speaks out against the dominant moral orthodoxy, particularly with regard to race, gender, or sexual orientation, trans-issues for example -- let me just give you a quick example. In ethics, one of the issues that we're facing today as a society are trans-issues, trans-bathrooms would be an example of that or trans-women in sports, trans-men in sports and what that means. The trans is a protected class, and so I wasn't allowed to speak about protected classes among other things, so there was a censoriousness about the university and there was always, always the threat of investigation. I was investigated so many times for so many things and the total results of the investigation were nada, zilch. They found nothing. But they weaponized Offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and even the threat of going to be called in for a theft of your time and if nothing else, the investigators are incredibly thorough. So, they have these mechanisms in place in the university to enforce certain speech codes against professors, against dissident professors, against anyone who questions or challenges what's morally fashionable."

They weren't controversial, maybe 10 years ago, but now because everything has gone nuts are controversial. They threaten investigations or they do -- do they investigate microaggressions? Is that something that they're looking into? You can't even define many of these by the way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOGHOSSIAN",
      "utterance": "So, it's a small slight usually against race or gender or some kind of perceived status like ability status. One of the things -- they don't have an office for investigating microaggressions, but among the things that I was brought up on charges someone asked me if race was a social construct or a biological category, and I said I don't know. I'm a philosopher, I'm not a biologist. And among other things, I was brought on charge of that, I've been accused of a microaggression when I asked for the evidence for microaggressions. I've been accused of microaggressions when I asked by colleagues and by students -- when I asked for evidence of the policies that were engulfing like trigger warnings, why should there be a trigger warning on a syllabus? What is the evidence that safe spaces are helpful to students? So even asking for evidence was a microaggression, so you've created a kind of a culture in which even asking questions about things is viewed as a violation. It's become a dogma factory."

You can't ask questions. You just have to go along with the dogma and if you don't, you're in trouble."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOGHOSSIAN",

And so think about the injustice we're doing to our students when we're creating these large ecosystems that don't allow that. They don't allow questioning. They don't allow challenging. And so students are particularly brittle when they hear the other side of a debate. I believe, very strongly, as John Stuart Mill did, that we have to be taught by people who actually believe things. I believe there should be a Marxist in an Economics Department. I believe that there should be a Friedman in an Economics Department. I believe that there should be intellectual diversity and we give students the tools to figure out these issues and ask difficult questions, and we're not doing that."

The Governor of that state, Ralph Northam, better known as Governor Klan Robes Blackface, has ordered that time capsule to be replaced with one that better reflects the current climate. He doesn't care about the 19th Century, instead he wants the new time capsule to tell the story of last year's BLM riots and pandemic, so the new and improved woke time capsule will include the following: An LGBTQ pride pin, an expired vial of a COVID vaccine, and an African Kente cloth, worn at the 400th commemoration of the year, 1619. We're not sure they're taking recommendations, but we think a photo of Governor Klan Robes Blackface should make it into the time capsule, just to remind people that racist Democrats still existed in 2021.
