      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and we are full up here on \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. A lot to get to. Keep it right here because in moments, the best of President Trump's unbelievable speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition that I know you missed. You were working or doing something else, but guess what? We watched it, the best moments. I think it was one of the best speeches he has ever given. I said this as I was watching it live late this morning. Unbelievable. Ralph Reed will be here and he is going to tell us why it's this speech is setting the stage for evangelicals ahead of 2020. And also tonight, Joe di is here, as in diGenova, and Congressman Jim Jordan. Does Obama's former Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha-unmasked- Power, have a new issue of anti-Trump bias?  Plus, the administration was mocked for claiming Middle Eastern terrorists might try to exploit our poor Southern border. Tonight, those critics will be exposed as wrong again. And we have the details that prove that we were right.  And Raymond Arroyo is here on the pathetic attempt by Hollywood actors to, well, dramatize the Mueller report, and how a pair of A-listers are defining those same Tinseltown partisans.  But first, President Trump's rousing speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition today shows us what we'll likely see from the President on the campaign trail. Now, I want to give you a little background first. Born- again or evangelical Christians made up about a fourth of the 2016 electorate, a little bit more. And of those, nearly 80 percent cast their vote for President Trump. So he just reveled in this show today. And Ralph Reed, who runs Faith and Freedom, is committed to driving the number of evangelical voters in 2020 way up. So President Trump's mission today was to remind folks why they voted for him in the first place and why they should be proud to do so again.",

You were working or doing something else, but guess what? We watched it, the best moments. I think it was one of the best speeches he has ever given. I said this as I was watching it live late this morning. Unbelievable. Ralph Reed will be here and he is going to tell us why it's this speech is setting the stage for evangelicals ahead of 2020. And also tonight, Joe di is here, as in diGenova, and Congressman Jim Jordan. Does Obama's former Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha-unmasked- Power, have a new issue of anti-Trump bias? Plus, the administration was mocked for claiming Middle Eastern terrorists might try to exploit our poor Southern border. Tonight, those critics will be exposed as wrong again. And we have the details that prove that we were right. And Raymond Arroyo is here on the pathetic attempt by Hollywood actors to, well, dramatize the Mueller report, and how a pair of A-listers are defining those same Tinseltown partisans. But first, President Trump's rousing speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition today shows us what we'll likely see from the President on the campaign trail. Now, I want to give you a little background first. Born- again or evangelical Christians made up about a fourth of the 2016 electorate, a little bit more. And of those, nearly 80 percent cast their vote for President Trump. So he just reveled in this show today. And Ralph Reed, who runs Faith and Freedom, is committed to driving the number of evangelical voters in 2020 way up. So President Trump's mission today was to remind folks why they voted for him in the first place and why they should be proud to do so again."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, religious leaders, they want to feel emboldened and feel like they can speak out without fear of retribution in the workplace or anywhere in this country. But there's something else also emerging here. This is a President at such ease. He seemed just - he seems like, people say, in the zone or - but I think he just felt really authentic and that he is saying what he believes on this issue, the Hollywood elites be damned. Now, let me show you what I mean. The President reminded voters that no opponent can match his pro-life positions or advocacy."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We're preserving our country's wild tradition of faith-based adaption. And we're proudly defending the sanctity of life. Unfortunately, Democrat politicians have become increasingly hostile to pro-life Americans who want to help more children find a loving home and share their dreams with the world. Every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God, and that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit the late-term abortion of babies."

But how do you actually protect religious liberty in the constitutional rights of all Americans? Well, the President offered this answer."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Democrats are determined to pack the courts with radical left judges who will impose their own far left abuse on the American people. That is why I will soon appoint my 145th judge. And we have two new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "By the way, we cut the applause there, but it went on and on. The courts and the judges, huge, huge plus for Trump coming up in 2020. And given this current news cycle, it's important to draw policy distinctions with the other party as well. While some large religious groups are actively subverting immigration law, many faith-based voters want illegal immigrants to play by the rules."

And today, I honestly believe it's greater than it's ever been before. And America will forever remain one proud nation under God, together with the love, the prayers and devotion of everyone in this room and the millions and millions of patriots all across our land. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you."

But this seemed like a President to me - and I've watched pretty much every speech - who's so, again, as I said, at ease with who he is now and where he is now in his Presidency, knowing he has a lot of work to do. Was that the way the crowd there took it? RALPH REED, CHAIRMAN, FAITH & FREEDOM COALITION: Very much so. I mean, this was his sixth appearance at Faith and Freedom's Road to Majority Policy Conference. And he's been there twice as a private citizen, twice as a Presidential candidate. This was his second appearance as President. And I have to tell you, Laura, this will be my 11th Presidential campaign. I've seen a lot of candidates--"

He never gave a scripture verse. He talked about his heart, shared their values. He didn't try to be somebody he wasn't. He talked about shared values, policies, and most importantly, Laura, he said I will fight for you. I have your back. When it comes to the people who want to marginalize you, silence you, drive you out of the civic square and back into the stained glass ghetto where they kept you before, I will fight for you.

I think the one question all Americans have is, when did you first learn there was no collusion, no coordination, no conspiracy? And if you learned that early, why didn't you tell us that? That was your essential charge as a special counsel. We do know one thing. When we deposed Jim Comey, we ask him about any collusion or coordination, and he said after 10 months - we deposed Jim Comey before - after he got fired. But the time they started this in the summer of '16 until the day he was fired, May 9th, 2017, he said the FBI had found zero evidence of any collusion, coordination, conspiracy. So how long did it take Bob Mueller and his team of 19 Democrat lawyers to figure this out? And when they did, why didn't they tell us? Why they would talk (ph) in the mid-term? So that's one question I think everybody in this country has and we'll ask him I'm sure."

That's a nice deal. Tom, I wanted to take you through, and the audience, the exact route that the terrorists we referenced supposedly took. The men are believed to have entered through Panama from their respective countries in May. Three of the men crossed through to Costa Rica on June 9th with the other arriving in Costa Rica on June 14th. The alert then laid out that they wanted to continue that track into Mexico and possibly toward our border. So Tom, what makes Panama the best initial landing spot for them?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOMAN",
      "utterance": "First of all, we have a really good operation in Panama. HSI has an operation down there. We've identifying many suspected terrorists, and Panama is working very closely with us and we have stopped a lot of people from coming north of Panama. So Panama is a natural chokepoint. So it's a perfect place to HSI down there and do their special operations. But a lot of terrorists enter through Brazil and other countries down there because the immigration laws are so lax. So I applaud ICE, HSI for having such a big footprint in Panama. What people don't know, let's not talk about this. Let's talk about the hundreds they've encountered in Panama, and Panama has helped return them and deport them from Panama, so they never made it north. So it's a great program. I applaud ICE for that."

He's done more to try to secure this border than any other president has, and he has been successful."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "\"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive tonight, Trump 2020 pollster John McLaughlin joins us with brand-new numbers that show the Democrats have some work to do. So John, let's start with the president's job approval, which is at 47 percent this month, consistent with last month. And President Obama had about 46 percent approval at the same time. So what does this mean for Trump? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 POLLSTER: What it means is, first of all, this is a poll of likely voters. None of this adults or registered voters, this media bias. Likely voters 2020. And what it is, is George W. Bush got reelected with 51 percent when he had a 51 percent job approval. Same for Obama. So Donald Trump is only four-point where he needs to go. He needs to get over 50 percent and hold it. That is why the Democrats are going nuts and won't give him a single victory on everything, because they're just trying to block him."

      "utterance": "So Donald Trump ran to get the country back in the right direction. Now it's up to 43 percent. And also, they say the economy is getting better, 53 percent to 37 percent. So it's the economic optimism that is driving this."

We did the tracking in Ohio, and the president went there and told them that his policies on immigration and trade were going to work. Now it has produced jobs and brought manufacturing jobs back to Ohio. So the voters see there, see that it's working. The president is doing exactly what he promised."

I love Nikki Haley, but jettisoning your vice president, people are getting desperate on the female vote. And Trump laughed at that at the Faith and Freedom event today. He was like I always hear this thing with the women voters. I'm going to get a great percentage. He was really good on that. But is that optimism well-founded?"

They see that people in their family can get jobs, they are getting pay raises for the first times in years. So that's coming. By the way, Republican women are solid for him.
