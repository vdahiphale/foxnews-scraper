      "utterance": "On the Buzz Meter this Sunday, President Trump now calls the media America's greatest enemy. That according to interview with two of his closest outside advisers who have their own indictment of the press. Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie will be here. Media mania as Michael Cohen pleads guilty to lying to Congress over his role and planning of Trump Tower project in Moscow during the campaign. And the press calls him a threat to the president."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",

So he's lying about a project that everybody knew about.  CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC: The president of the United States has been lying to the American people for years now. Lying that he was ever doing any business with a foreign power which was at the same time committing criminal acts to help get him elected president.  LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS: Now, given Cohen's history of mistruths, let's put it that way, the question is, was he lying to Congress then or is he lying to Mueller now?"

      "speaker": "CHRIS CUOMO, CNN",
      "utterance": "It was in the works at a time when the president said he had no business with Russia. No investments. Not doing the deal doesn't excuse the president from lying about trying to get a deal done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Are the pundits siding with Michael ohen against his former boss? This as Paul Manafort and Julian Assange denounced the report of The Guardian about their supposedly secret meetings with WikiLeaks vowing to sue the paper. And the media say the president has signaled a possible pardon as Manafort's plea deal blows up, while The New York Times reveals his lawyer was secretly briefing the Trump team about his talks with prosecutors."

      "speaker": "LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Trump telling The New York Post that a Manafort pardon isn't off the table. Is the media chatter justified? Plus, the legacy of George Herbert Walker Bush, a president whose reelection slogan has annoyed the media but in the end was celebrated by the media. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz. There is a lot to get to on the coverage of Michael Cohen's guilty plea, but I want to start with this question of media credibility. The Guardian story about Paul Manafort looks like a bombshell and it sure was treated that way on television."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "If the story was true, it meant that Manafort met with Julian Assange as a Trump campaign official in 2016, months before WikiLeaks did that massive dump of Democratic e-mails hacked by Russian operatives. But this was followed by denials, Manafort claiming the story is totally false and deliberately libelous. Assange said the alleged meetings never happened. \"Remember this day when The Guardian permitted a serial fabricator to totally destroy the paper's reputation.\" WikiLeaks says it is willing to bet The Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange. WikiLeaks now raising money online to sue the London paper."

OK, Gillian, the part about the editor's head is creepy."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But I have a lot of respect for The Guardian which won a Pulitzer four years ago for reporting on leak on documents. But this story with the fierce denials seems a bit thin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Even if The Guardian was US Weekly, I would still go with that reporting because your choices are in terms of believability and trust are between Paul Manafort, WikiLeaks and, you know, outlet three. No matter who outlet three is, I'm going with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Manafort of course is an admitted liar. I doubt, Emily, we're going to see this million dollar bet by Julian Assange. Should the media have been more cautious about running with this, because if it's true, Julian says, we potentially devastating tying the Trump camp to WikiLeaks? But if it's true, I mean, you got all people involved saying absolutely it's not untrue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Right. And to Julian's point, I think it's very fair. You know, Paul Manafort is not necessarily the most honest man in Washington. That being said, the intensity of their denials, I think, is well worth noting because this is something that if it is true, there should be video footage, there should be evidence of travel, there should be plenty of evidence that if you are doubling down this hard, you're going to look really dumb. And so there's reports that The Washing Post, The New York Times are trying to confirm The Guardian story. That did not happen. The Guardian later softened its story a little bit, things like --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Apparent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry to jump it. I just have to clarify before everybody kills me online. I'm not saying that I believe that Paul Manafort went into the embassy and met with -- what I am saying is that if my choices are between the three of them, I believe The Guardian has by the far the most credibility."

      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "No, I lived in London for six years. I was on CCTV probably 23 hours of my day. If not on the news, there should be records of this. At the same time, The Guardian --"

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This is the surveillance --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "The surveillance in London which they are famous for and have been fighting terrorism very effectively for years now. There should be records of it. But at the same time, The Guardian, as you pointed out, is an incredibly reputable outlet. They stand by their story. They softened it a bit. But they say that they do have sources on this. We see how it plays out. But I would say that the journalists who were reporting it were saying according to The Guardian. This wasn't, you know, CNN running with it and not, you know, saying this is who came up with it. So, I think it is fair certainly to bring up. And on the same week that we find out that Paul Manafort violated his plea deal, again, I'm going with Gillian here --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We'll come back to that. But let me turn to this incredible media mob scene in Manhattan. We put that up on the screen. Michael Cohen sort of came out of the blue, pleading guilty a second in a second case to lying to Congress. There we go. This was treated, Gillian, as a bombshell. Liberal pundits were saying, well, the president's former fixer has finally nailed him. This of course having to do with Cohen's role in pursuing Trump Tower fixer lied in pursuing the Trump Tower project in Moscow. And conservatives are just following the president's lead and saying, hey, look, he has twice admitted lying in two different cases, how can you believe him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, Cohen has managed to do something that really not many people have been able to do which is put President Trump on the defensive, think now the media smells blood in the water. And so they are all over this like white on rice. You know, it's like a very -- I would say compromised or vulnerable position for President Trump to be in. His defense now is actually Michael Cohen is a liar. It is very hard to backtrack going from somebody once called the brilliant, trustworthy, terrific guy to calling him a liar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Cohen's version, Emily, is that he has decided to stop lying when he decided to sort of come clean and cooperate with Robert Mueller. And the media -- is the media consensus accurate when -- if he's telling the truth, then we already knew that the Trump organization was pursuing a real estate project in Moscow through January 2016, just before the primaries and caucuses start. Now, it's supposedly through June of 2016 when he's winning the nomination. And that's not according to Michael Cohen. Then BuzzFeed has additional detail that Vladimir Putin was promised a -- had been promised a $50 million condo in the building to help attract the rich Russians."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "If that story is true -- the whole thing with this lying is important. I think it is important that -- and President Trump said this week, you know, it's not as though nobody knew about this still. So while he's calling Michael Cohen a liar, he is also saying this deal was pretty widely known at the time. If it goes into June and we have the president on the record saying X, Y, and Z, I have no deals in Russia, I'm not doing --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He said that many times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "At the same time, it is not colluding with the Russian government. Both of those things can be true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think the media consensus, Emily, to jump on you there, is that well, he now would have a motive to cooperate with Russia, if you wish, trying to do this deal. And yes, we knew about it. But the president says, look, I was a businessman, there was a good chance I wouldn't win, this was my business and so what's wrong with my pursuing such a project which by the way never went anyway?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "There are two issues at play. One, the lying, saying multiple times I have no business dealings in Russian whatsoever which we know is not true. We have pictures of the whole Trump family out there in Moscow. We are in there first. We know this deal was happening. If there was a $50 million apartment promise to Vladimir Putin, that is actually a violation of our laws."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You say the deal was happening. I mean, it didn't happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "It was being pursued and you have Ivanka on e-mail talking about an architect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I mean, everyone was involved in there and they were not supposed to. And for you to say it can be a business deal and nothing to do with the government, nothing in Russia gets done without Vladimir Putin on that level. So it's not like doing a deal in the America and the president of the United States not being involved. Vladimir Putin controls every single thing that happens there because of his dictatorship. So --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "But that doesn't mean that we've had evidence, concrete evidence arise that the Trump campaign in and of itself was colluding with the Russian government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think it was claiming that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It is potentially a significant event but it comes down to this question of, do you believe Michael Cohen now? But not all the reporting on this has been 100 percent accurate. Emily, NPR is reporting that Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, contradicted Cohen by saying all the discussions about any deal ended in 2014. He was talking about a different deal. He is record as having discussed the fact that they were pursuing this Moscow project in 2015 and 2016. NPR kind of pulled it back, no apology, no full correction. We mischaracterized what Don Jr. said?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes. The update that added to their story, I think, was ridiculous. I think the story should have been retracted. This was an incredible blunder because what they ended up updating the story to reflect was in the transcript that they were working off. It was readily available. You could read it. It didn't take, you know, Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist, it didn't take her that long to connect the dots here and get the story put together showing that the NPR's narrative here was easily disputed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It shows shadow reporting and that the reporter who put this story together didn't actually bother to read through the whole transcript."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, it was there in plain sight and Don Jr. has called this a desperate attempt to smear me, a desperate and sloppy attempt. I think -- I'm not saying it was a smear, but, man, it was a bad mistake. So, coming back to Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, there was a kind of a media explosion when Mueller said he has violated his plea deal, he is still lying to us and so forth. And then it really intensify when The New York Times reported Rudy Giuliani, that while he was supposedly cooperating with Mueller, his lawyer was briefing the Trump team's lawyers. Some in the press characterizing Manafort as being a double agent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it was this triangulated deal whereby somehow Paul Manafort's attorneys were hoping to ingratiate him, continue to ingratiate him with the Trump campaign, but also continue to lie to Mueller's team. It's sort of have your cake and eat it, too. That is just not really feasible. It also intensified the debate this week with the pardon issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You queued it up for me. So the president spoke to New York Post. He was asked about this by reporters. Let's hear what he had to say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The question was asked to me by The New York Post and I said, no, I have not offered any pardons. And I think they asked or whatever, would you? I said, I'm not taking anything off the table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, the media interpretation is Trump is sending a very clear signal that he could potentially pardon Manafort and here are some of the anchors on other channels saying he is obstructing justice by even talking about this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Yeah. This goes back -- President Trump has been very nice to Paul Manafort publicly. Remember when he was on trial, he was tweeting this is terrible, he is a very fine man, very nice man, and the contrast between him and Michael Cohen start there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Because Cohen caved at the time Manafort did, yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "It seems like he isn't. but Judge Napolitano last week was making the case that actually what Bob Mueller has done that is very smart is make Paul Manafort pardon proof by having federal crimes and state crimes, because President Trump can pardon him on federal level but can't on the state level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Regardless of whether that will happen, Emily, what do you make of the pardon coverage? Do you think it is a fair reading of the president's comments in interview or do you think it set off just a wild speculation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I think that the speculation about obstruction of justice is too far. I mean, I don't think that this is obstruction of justice. I think Jessica is right to point to the contrast between Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort and that this is a president who clearly values loyalty and to the extent that he's treating him differently, that's a real story. But to say that this is obstructive of justice, I think of course --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I think the media though is saying it's unethical for the president to be commenting about a potential pardon, period. And that's a reasonable position to take. President Bush was bombarded with media questions in the last few years of his administration about pardoning Scooter Libby."

We put it up quickly. When do the trial for treason begin? Again, he was just re-tweeting. We see there Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, but also Rod Rosenstein, Bob Mueller. Kind of a unique thing for a president to do."

Joining us now, Brit Hume, Fox's senior political analyst who covered him in the White House. Brit, what do you make of the contrast between just, you know, bipartisan praise across the media landscape, across the political landscape and that famous bumper sticker from 1992?

George Bush was the blue blood aristocrat from a New England family who went into politics. He was looked at with certain condescension because he had been such a silent and loyal figure under Reagan and fill all these different jobs. He wasn't a terribly talented public speaker."

I mean, they said that he had no vision. But what was happening when he became president was, the vision of many who have come before him was coming to fruition. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin wall and the rest of it. His job was to manage that skillfully to make sure it didn't fall apart, which he did."

The task at hand for him of course is getting elected and assuring the Republican base that he had steel in him. Dan Rather was not a popular figure on the American right and when he took him on in a way he did in that interview, encouraged by our founder, Fox News Roger Aisles, the late Roger Aisles, it rallied people behind him. The people in the Republican base really liked that interview."

This covers a World War II hero and yet this was the meme that Newsweek immortalized. So he had a lot to overcome in terms of the media's perception."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "He did. And, Howard, you know, he was the youngest naval aviator ever when he enlisted as a young man prior to going to college which he could certainly have done. But he chose to enlist and he was shot down over the Pacific and rescued in the nick of time by an American submarine. That's not the behavior of a wimp. It persisted nonetheless. Even after he was out of office, 1995, Maureen Dowd writing in The New York Times, she never cared for Bush, described him as Bertie Wooster, the silly British aristocratic character of the comic novels by P.G. Wodehouse. That image of him persisted. This was after he had managed the collapse of the Soviet Union after he had mounted the coalition that won the Gulf War. He achieved quite a lot, but nonetheless it persisted. It's that kind of reverse snobbism about class that you see that permeates the media. Now, you see the media exemplifying it in somewhat different way towards Donald Trump."

He had a real blessing in a way because he has a forgiving spirit. And so he endured the slings and arrows from the media with only a handful exceptions.  He was forgiving about it. He didn't stay mad at people for very long. And I think that helped him a lot. His press relations really weren't bad. His news conferences were fairly frequent and orderly. He basically did fine. I want to add one other thing, Howard. During the run-up to the Gulf War, he had a lot of meetings with the press, many of them impromptu. And he became in that moment, Howard, extraordinarily articulate and precise in his discourse. We had not seen that in him before."

The press trades on the emotions of their audience. The more they stir them up, the more they get them to buy their newspapers, tune into their channels, or click on their website. And that's true. It's true on both left and the right in my view. But doesn't the president, like many other politicians, also play on the emotions of the voters? Why single the press out?"

Look, Howie, you talked about it earlier on your show today. The Guardian story, it became on for 24 or 48 hours, about whether Paul Manafort even went to London to do a meeting. Nobody did any homework on this. Look, Paul is a very bad guy. He has spent a lot of time in jail for a lot of crimes that he committed that had nothing to do with the campaign. But somebody, media outlets should have verified the story before they just ran with the Guardian story, because they want click bait. And that's what happens.

Now, commentators have the right to express their opinions, but that incendiary phrase, from the river to the sea, caused him his cable news contract. A gripping New York Times investigation has documented how Les Moonves already ousted as CBS Chairman over multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, allegedly assaulted a young actress named Bobbie Phillips more than two decades ago. And then, tried to buy her silence this year by arranging a bit part or two of CBS shows, one them paying just $1500. Phillips said he ruined her career by promising her movie parts, this is back in 1995, and then forcing her to briefly perform oral sex. Moonves says it was consensual. But the Times shows through interviews and lots of text messages that Moonves was so desperate while fighting for his job, again this year, that he told his agent, if Bobbie talks, I'm finished. The episode prompted CBS board members to finally turn on him. And I can't see how they can now possibly pay him $120 million in severance. Finally, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, making some news of their own."
