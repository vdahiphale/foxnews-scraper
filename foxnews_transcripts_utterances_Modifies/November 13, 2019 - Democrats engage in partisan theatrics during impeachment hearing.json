Congressman Chris Stewart and Mark Meadows were both at the hearing today and are here exclusively to cut through all the noise. Also tonight President Trump's Former Attorney General says Democrats impeachment push is irreparably damaging our republic. Jeff Sessions is here with his exclusive reaction. Plus Raymond Arroyo is going to break down the most hilarious moments. You missed all of this stuff by the way. From faulty video cues to a certain hair implement in one Congresswoman's bouffant.  Let's just say the Dems and the witnesses weren't ready for prime time. And it's this week's \"Seen and Unseen\" coming up but first, the big four takeaways that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  Day one of this impeachment farce, it was supposed to be a banner day for the Democrats. But what actually unfolded was a complete and utter disaster for Adam Schiff and his solemn band of inquisitors. Here are the big four takeaways.  Number one Democrats still don't have a real crime. In fact, from what I heard the Democrats and their two star witnesses, is the only thing that Trump is guilty of is not giving away his foreign policy powers to unelected bureaucrats.",

Why do other Democrats in the House even bother showing up at this point? A collection of potted plants would be just as effective and, frankly, nicer to look at. But Democrats should be really worried. Here's why. Number one, the Fed came out with an upbeat economic outlook, no recession. And today markets are hitting another high. Phenomenal news. Number two, the Democrats have no credible platform to make the country better and no strong 2020 candidate. Number three, the House Democrats who ran as moderates in 2018 along with House Democratic leadership have been exposed as nothing more than puppets of AOC. And number four, the Mueller report didn't bring down Trump, neither will Schiff's impeachment sham. So in 2020, the voters have to decide whether they want to reward the one person in D.C. who's actually delivering results or rewarded Democrat Party that has literally done nothing for Middle America. Easy choice. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team have all the best analysis and they take it from here. Big day of news, Shannon.

Congressman Chris Stewart and Mark Meadows were both at the hearing today and are here exclusively to cut through all the noise. Also tonight President Trump's Former Attorney General says Democrats impeachment push is irreparably damaging our republic. Jeff Sessions is here with his exclusive reaction. Plus Raymond Arroyo is going to break down the most hilarious moments. You missed all of this stuff by the way. From faulty video cues to a certain hair implement in one Congresswoman's bouffant. Let's just say the Dems and the witnesses weren't ready for prime time. And it's this week's \"Seen and Unseen\" coming up but first, the big four takeaways that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Day one of this impeachment farce, it was supposed to be a banner day for the Democrats. But what actually unfolded was a complete and utter disaster for Adam Schiff and his solemn band of inquisitors. Here are the big four takeaways. Number one Democrats still don't have a real crime. In fact, from what I heard the Democrats and their two star witnesses, is the only thing that Trump is guilty of is not giving away his foreign policy powers to unelected bureaucrats."

One of today's star witnesses contradicted the Democrats main talking point. Oops. Now what really became apparent today is that Democrats - they should have never gone down this road. It was a cataclysmic mistake for them. The first public hearing did nothing to make their case and in fact probably did the opposite. I think American see right through this, the web or web of lies. And despite Democrat's feeble attempt to spin this as some huge victory it was really just a huge dud. I kind of think if there were any winners today they weren't in the political arena."

They expected John Dean to appear and have this dramatic moment where people listen and say this is a real problem. It just didn't materialize, and by the way it's not going to materialize. We know what these witnesses are going to tell us. As you know they have been in closed depositions with them there are no surprises coming. I think a week from now after about a half a dozen of these most Americans are going to say, is that all? You are going to remove the President of the United States less than a year from an election, over this? I just don't think it's going to sell."

      "speaker": "REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.",
      "utterance": "Well, four Pinocchio's ago we also heard Adam Schiff say that he wasn't coordinating with the whistleblower. We know that's just not the case that's why they don't want the whistleblower to it coming and to testify. Listen today's hearing was a swing and a miss for the Democrat. And I was the 31 Democrats that won in Trump districts not only would I be shaking in my boots tonight I would be worried that Nancy Pelosi is going to send them down a path that will ultimately try to impeach the President with really no predicate there. You covered it extremely well Laura as we look at this. What we have got to make sure of is that there is an impeachable offense and what we really saw today was two bureaucrats that have a Ukraine first really sentiment versus the President that has an America First sentiment. So those collided together and what we saw was that the President wasn't really being vigilant about the American taxpayer dollars."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

There were several points in the hearing when the witnesses were clearly expressing their deep sense of anxiety, that there are country of focus, namely the Ukraine, was not going to get the blank check from the American taxpayers. They were actually - strings would be attached. And I don't mean strings like looking into Biden. I mean, you can't play around with our elections. The Democrats used to care about that right election meddling? That's what Trump was clearly getting at that's why he brought it up in that kind of casual way in the call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there is two things, actually during this hearing I had a couple people text me and they said, they seemed disproportionately concerned with Ukrainian's interest versus America's interest. I'm not saying that they actually feel that but they certainly had that as a priority for them and the second thing is this. They are individuals whose responsibility is to carry out the policies of the duly elected President of the United States regardless of who that is. They don't get to say I disagree. And I'm going to see - I think that's what they were concerned about as much as anything. It wasn't necessarily that they love it Ukraine more than the U.S. they were offended that the President's policies were different than they thought it should be."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I tweeted out today Congress Meadows that, look if they disagree with the President's policies, there are a lot of people that disagree with the President's policies that's fine. Then I have an idea for them. Run for office and that actually go to the American taxpayers and say, you know we want to give out more foreign aid, we know we're 22 a trillion in debt and we don't want to worry about corruption or concerns about human rights. We want - let them try to run a campaign on that. You know they will get killed if they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "You know that they well but here's the interesting thing. Both of them were concerned about what might happen with this policy. Indeed, what happened with the policy is, it's stronger than the previous Obama Administration and yet both of those people who testified today, they both still work for the U.S. citizens and for the President of the United States. They're still diplomats. And so to suggest that they are at odds with the President, they were at odds with the President on what they thought might have happened based on what someone else told someone else. At the end of the day the President is delivering on behalf of what all Americans elected him to do and what they will again elect him to do a little over 11 months from now."

Congressman Stewart close it out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",

Out of the dozens of corrupt nations there are in the world to come out of the hundreds of corrupt government officials there are in the world, there's only one time that did the Vice President go to that nation and demand the removal of a specific prosecutor and it just happened to be that that was the individual who was responsible for investigating the company that was paying his son. Most Americans here that they think oh, my God, what is that? Is that not worth asking a few questions about?"

This is an impeachment case which is a political remedy. So at the end of the day what you have to have is misconduct that is so serious that there will be a public consensus for the removal of the President that would be strong enough to push two-thirds of the Senate to vote to remove the President. Now if you have to sit through six hours or whatever that was today, and when you get to the end of it, you are not quite even sure what it was about or what they were trying to prove. You may be able to go back and fix that and say maybe we can come up with some kind of technical violation but impeaching a President."

You either lied or you didn't. But this is - if you're going to call it bribery can, the bribery has to mean something and even though it's not a legal preceding the word bribery does have a legal connotation. So it can't be completely devoid of any legal grounding. They just literally threw that term out there, I think yesterday or the day before it was bribery extortion lions and tigers and bears all - I mean, it was just thrown together."

If you don't like the President mentioning Joe Biden in the context of rampant corruption, including - and one of the other things that became clear today was corruption in the Ukraine is not only serious in the endemic, it's endemic in the energy industry and that's Burisma. So it's quite understandable that in that context of this sort of issue would pop up. This is so far removed from bribery from extortion and the like. And to me it is quite unreasonable. And that's putting it in my own way, for the Democrats to say we have evidence here of a crime and certainly two witnesses and I think we're being a little bit harsh to these witnesses. They were subpoenaed to testify and a lot of what they said I think should be reaffirming and reassuring to the American people that we have honest public servants. And I really mean that and that they said nothing that suggested that the President should be impeached, nothing, not one word."

I actually expect that as we go further in this, maybe we will hear more about what that view is because to my mind we are hearing fantasy about the Ukraine that's been built over the last number of years. There is an alternative version of the Ukraine.

I have been working in phones talked to three different Senior Republicans who all said that after the first hearing in the hallways, they are having private conversations with Democrats who seemed absolutely deflated that they did not get very far at all today. Listen to what \"The Washington Post\" has reported. Look at that, Democratic aide telling \"The Post\", \"We are screwed this week on hearings\". No bombshells no revelations the onus is on us to wow some people this week. To and be sure, Democrats are insisting that they are happy they got Bill Taylor to reveal some new information today but even his big reveal that one of his aides overheard a phone conversation in which President Trump was allegedly more personally involved in making sure that there were investigations in exchange for aid and even that was third hand. Taylor being told by an aide who overheard a phone call at a restaurant. So Democrats deflated by a whole series of events. Jim Jordon, declaring all of this is third and fourth hand information, six people having four different conversations. At one point Jordon said he had seen Church prayer chains that are easier to understand then this narrative. Republican Jonathan Ratcliffe, pressing the star witnesses both Bill Taylor and George Kent did you see anything impeachable? Didn't have anything. Adam Schiff again on defense today on whether or not he knows who the whistleblower is he insists he doesn't even though we've been like to believe that at least his staff talk to the whistleblower. And finally George Kent we've been talking about went on camera with has concerns that he raise conflict of interest questions way back in 2015 about Hunter Biden raking in over $80,000 per month from Burisma while his father was overseen Ukrainian policy. Jim Jordon at one point was asking did Hunter Biden speak Ukrainian. The witness was saying no. Another point he says, was he hired for his expertise on corporate governments? Of course no. So Laura, there were lots of problems today for the Democratic narrative that's what Republicans might tonight be breathing bit of a sigh of relief. Laura."

That raises all new questions about whether this was just the board looking at the corporate governance issues or whether in fact they were lobbying Hunter Biden's own father and his administration the Obama/Biden Administration when remember, Joe Biden was overseeing all Ukrainian policy laws."

When you've decided the person is guilty and then you pretend to have a trial for show. So this is the kind of thing that I think is concerning to a lot of people. The Constitution says impeachment is not anything Congress says it is. It says it's for conviction of treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. Those are restraining laws in our Constitution that restrains Congress, and they need to be faithful to their responsibilities. And fundamentally I would just urge our Democratic members of Congress to think deeply about the future of this country, the danger to this republic that would occur if we continue to prosecute people basically because we don't like them or we have a political disagreement."

On this impeachment, I think they've got to speak out pretty aggressively and say where's the beef, what is the charge, does it meet the constitutional standards, and be open about that. I think we have a lot of members that are, hopefully. But that message needs to be strongly put out there. And Republicans need to be confident that if the evidence does not support impeachment, they are perfectly safe, and it's the honorable thing to do, the only thing to do is oppose impeachment."

A lot of people think all we did was deal with Russia, but we had a tremendous revitalization of federal criminal prosecutions throughout the country, a revitalization of partnerships with our state and local allies. We stood out for religious liberty and issued a new policy. We helped the president appoint the best group of federal judges ever been appointed. We advanced his agenda. We reduced regulations. There was so much that was done. We started a new group to intensify our efforts to prosecute frauds in the I.T. networks and particularly China. So a lot of good things that occurred, and I had 15 years in the department, I knew a lot about it, and I feel like we did a good job.

He's trying to defend our borders in way that affects the rule of law in America. So I just think he's been conservative consistently to a degree I think very few people expected.

      "utterance": "Thank you, counselor. That's the Democratic Party in a nutshell, isn't it? It revolves around two people now, AOC and Adam Schiff, the socialist and the inquisitor. Why do other Democrats in the House even bother showing up at this point? A collection of potted plants would be just as effective and, frankly, nicer to look at. But Democrats should be really worried. Here's why. Number one, the Fed came out with an upbeat economic outlook, no recession. And today markets are hitting another high. Phenomenal news. Number two, the Democrats have no credible platform to make the country better and no strong 2020 candidate. Number three, the House Democrats who ran as moderates in 2018 along with House Democratic leadership have been exposed as nothing more than puppets of AOC. And number four, the Mueller report didn't bring down Trump, neither will Schiff's impeachment sham. So in 2020, the voters have to decide whether they want to reward the one person in D.C. who's actually delivering results or rewarded Democrat Party that has literally done nothing for Middle America. Easy choice. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team have all the best analysis and they take it from here. Big day of news, Shannon.
