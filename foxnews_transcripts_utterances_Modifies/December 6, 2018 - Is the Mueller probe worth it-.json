      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the most bewildering parts of our current moment, and there are many, is watching the American Left become the mirror image of what it once was.  Not so long ago, do you remember when Liberals supported free speech and due process, when the ACLU had principles? Remember when they sided with wage earners over billionaires when they kind of cared about you or pretended to? Seems like about a 100 years ago.  Liberals also, by the way, used to care about the environment, not the politicized abstract stuff like climate policy, but the actual physical environment of America, our land, and our water, and our trees, even our sidewalks.  Liberals were worried about mass immigration and overpopulation then. They didn't want to live in a crowded, dirty country. Well after a whole lot of searching, we have located the last Liberal in America who feels that way. We'll talk to him in just a minute. But, first tonight, speaking of Liberals, they are thrilled by the Mueller investigation these days. It seems like all upside to them. Their political opponents are being harassed day and night. Some of them may soon be indicted. The Administration can barely govern with all the noise about Russia.  Now, Robert Mueller is said to be a Republican. They always tell us that. But, in effect, Mueller is doing the heavy lifting of the Democratic Party. If you're a progressive who hates Donald Trump, this is like Christmas every single day. Or, is it? Writer T.A. Frank has his doubts about that. Frank is no Right-winger. He doesn't like Donald Trump, actually. But he's thought this through carefully. In an insightful piece for Vanity Fair, Frank wonders if Liberals will look back on this moment and consider the Mueller investigation worth doing.  In response to criticism from the Left, for example, Frank notes, \"Trump's White House has pursued what is arguably the harshest set of policy to -- policies toward Russia since the fall of Communism. That's hardly something to celebrate. Yet nearly all of the pressure from the center-Left as much as from the Right, is toward making it even tougher on Russia.\"   So, the question is, is it really wise to risk war with a nuclear-armed power solely for short-term partisan political advantage? Is that a precedent you want to set, Frank wonders. And then this, which ought to be printed and taped to the fridge in the kitchen of every political consultant on the Democratic side in Washington, here it is. \"The weapons you create for your side today will be used by the other side against you tomorrow. Do we really want the Special Counsel investigation to become a staple of presidential life? It's a creation with few boundaries on scope and a setup that encourages the selection of a suspect followed by a search for the crime, rather than the other way around.\"   Well, that's a good point. Democrats are now telling us that Robert Mueller is somehow above the reach of government. Any Executive Branch oversight of his investigation qualifies, they tell us, as an impeachable offense. In their view, Mueller is something like a God prosecutor, accountable only to himself. But the question is will Democrats be comfortable with that standard when the next Independent Counsel investigates the next Democratic President? And more to the point, whatever happened to representative government? Shouldn't all federal employees answer to elected officials who in turn answer to voters? That's what representative government is. Well, not anymore.  In the name of defending democracy, the Left is weakening democracy. Democrats don't seem to understand that now. They're having too much fun watching their enemies suffer. But they will understand it and, likely, they'll deeply regret it.   Robin Biro is a former Obama Campaign Regional Director. He joins us tonight. Robin, thanks a lot for coming on. So--",

The Executive Branch run by Trump can't rein him in because that would be an impeachable offense, and Congress has no authority because he's an Executive Branch employee, technically.

      "sentences": "Don Lemon, ladies and gentlemen. So, Trump is \"Taking the Saudi side for money.\" Now, for the record, as a factual matter, there is no evidence of that. But there is definitely strong precedent for it here in Washington. Half the country's elites have made a good living taking the Saudi side for money. They've been doing it openly for decades now. In fact, if it weren't for Arab Petrodollars, Washington would have far fewer swimming pools and $80 entrees. Certainly Bill and Hillary Clinton would be a lot poorer without the Saudis. The Clinton Foundation received as much as $25 million from the Saudi government. They took another $5 million from the Royal Family's PR operation. Now, why did the Saudis give the Clintons all that money? Because they care deeply about AIDS in Africa and the childhood obesity crisis? If you believe that, get your resume ready. CNN has a reporting position open for you. But it wasn't just the Clintons that got rich from the Saudis. Their allies did too. The Podesta Group was co-founded by Tony Podesta and his brother John Podesta. You remember he served as Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff in the White House, and then Hillary Clinton's Campaign Chairman. Well, immediately after the last election, the Podesta Group was hired by, yes, the Saudis to lobby the U.S. government. In 2017, the Podesta Group earned nearly $2 million from that contract alone. Meanwhile, the Democratic lobbying firm, Glover Park Group did almost as well from the Saudis. They made $700,000 just last year and another $600,000 from the Saudis this year, before bad publicity from the murder forced them to end that contract. But nobody, maybe in the world, tried to cash in like Democratic fundraiser Ari Emanuel. His talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, cut a deal to receive $400 million in investment from the Saudi government from its Sovereign Wealth Fund. This April, Ari Emanuel co-hosted a dinner in L.A. for the Crown Prince, the one who apparently ordered Khashoggi's murder. Jeff Bezos from Amazon was there, of course, so was Bob Iger from Disney. Here's how Vanity Fair described that evening. \"Topics that were deemed off-limits included the Prince's bombing campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, his abduction of Lebanon's Prime Minister in November, and the repression of independent media and journalists, one of whom was recently imprisoned for five years for insulting the Royal Court.\" So, Ari Emanuel and his fellow Hollywood Liberals wanted to make sure that nobody asked the Saudis these uncomfortable questions. The Left cares deeply about human rights but not when it gets in the way of business with the Saudis. We should pause here and note in the interest of fairness two things. First, it's not just Democrats who've taken truckloads of Saudi money. Republicans in Washington definitely have done so too. And second, the Saudis are not the only despites (ph) currently making America's ruling class richer, hardly. Many of our leaders, again, on both sides are being paid off by the Chinese government. That's a dictatorship far more bloodthirsty than the Saudis. The Chinese, remember, have kidnapped children and harvested the organs of executed political prisoners. They threw a Nobel Peace Prize winner behind bars until he died. As we speak tonight, the Chinese are throwing hundreds of thousands of ethnic majorities -- minorities into concentration camps. Earlier this year, China disappeared the Head of Interpol. How much of that have you heard on MSNBC? Probably not much. Now, none of this is a defense of the Saudis or their behavior. In fact, twice in the last two years, this show has attacked the Saudi government for pushing the Administration into pointless bombings in Syria. The rest of official Washington, especially the media, applauded those bombings. Now, amazingly, the very same people are pretending to be shocked that a primitive desert theocracy killed somebody. Please, spare us the sanctimony. It is nauseating. Well, up next, the Miss Universe pageant is 10 days away. And there's something very notable about the person favored to win.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the most bewildering parts of our current moment, and there are many, is watching the American Left become the mirror image of what it once was. Not so long ago, do you remember when Liberals supported free speech and due process, when the ACLU had principles? Remember when they sided with wage earners over billionaires when they kind of cared about you or pretended to? Seems like about a 100 years ago. Liberals also, by the way, used to care about the environment, not the politicized abstract stuff like climate policy, but the actual physical environment of America, our land, and our water, and our trees, even our sidewalks. Liberals were worried about mass immigration and overpopulation then. They didn't want to live in a crowded, dirty country. Well after a whole lot of searching, we have located the last Liberal in America who feels that way. We'll talk to him in just a minute. But, first tonight, speaking of Liberals, they are thrilled by the Mueller investigation these days. It seems like all upside to them. Their political opponents are being harassed day and night. Some of them may soon be indicted. The Administration can barely govern with all the noise about Russia. Now, Robert Mueller is said to be a Republican. They always tell us that. But, in effect, Mueller is doing the heavy lifting of the Democratic Party. If you're a progressive who hates Donald Trump, this is like Christmas every single day. Or, is it? Writer T.A. Frank has his doubts about that. Frank is no Right-winger. He doesn't like Donald Trump, actually. But he's thought this through carefully. In an insightful piece for Vanity Fair, Frank wonders if Liberals will look back on this moment and consider the Mueller investigation worth doing. In response to criticism from the Left, for example, Frank notes, \"Trump's White House has pursued what is arguably the harshest set of policy to -- policies toward Russia since the fall of Communism. That's hardly something to celebrate. Yet nearly all of the pressure from the center-Left as much as from the Right, is toward making it even tougher on Russia.\" So, the question is, is it really wise to risk war with a nuclear-armed power solely for short-term partisan political advantage? Is that a precedent you want to set, Frank wonders. And then this, which ought to be printed and taped to the fridge in the kitchen of every political consultant on the Democratic side in Washington, here it is. \"The weapons you create for your side today will be used by the other side against you tomorrow. Do we really want the Special Counsel investigation to become a staple of presidential life? It's a creation with few boundaries on scope and a setup that encourages the selection of a suspect followed by a search for the crime, rather than the other way around.\" Well, that's a good point. Democrats are now telling us that Robert Mueller is somehow above the reach of government. Any Executive Branch oversight of his investigation qualifies, they tell us, as an impeachable offense. In their view, Mueller is something like a God prosecutor, accountable only to himself. But the question is will Democrats be comfortable with that standard when the next Independent Counsel investigates the next Democratic President? And more to the point, whatever happened to representative government? Shouldn't all federal employees answer to elected officials who in turn answer to voters? That's what representative government is. Well, not anymore. In the name of defending democracy, the Left is weakening democracy. Democrats don't seem to understand that now. They're having too much fun watching their enemies suffer. But they will understand it and, likely, they'll deeply regret it. Robin Biro is a former Obama Campaign Regional Director. He joins us tonight. Robin, thanks a lot for coming on. So--"

The Executive Branch run by Trump can't rein him in because that would be an impeachable offense, and Congress has no authority because he's an Executive Branch employee, technically. So, that's not a democratic system where you have someone with the power to destroy your life and put you in prison, who can't be accountable to anybody elected by voters?

It's kind of the functional equivalent of having tenure as a professor. It's very difficult to get rid of him. And if you do dare to try to fire him, if Trump did it or if Whitaker or a future Attorney General tried to do it, you could be sure that there would be investigation after investigation after investigation, and cries of obstruction of justice.

So, what I would do -- because these people on the Committee have had access to millions of records and done a lot of interviews over the last couple of years, they have a lot of information. So, what I would try to do here, because I think the -- the key here is to find out from Jim Comey if he ever thought there was political interference in what he was doing in the FBI, and the decisions he was making. And if he did, who were the people behind that because after all the questions that have been asked and even these questions have been asked, we still don't have simple answers to simple questions.

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Don Lemon, ladies and gentlemen. So, Trump is \"Taking the Saudi side for money.\" Now, for the record, as a factual matter, there is no evidence of that. But there is definitely strong precedent for it here in Washington. Half the country's elites have made a good living taking the Saudi side for money. They've been doing it openly for decades now. In fact, if it weren't for Arab Petrodollars, Washington would have far fewer swimming pools and $80 entrees. Certainly Bill and Hillary Clinton would be a lot poorer without the Saudis. The Clinton Foundation received as much as $25 million from the Saudi government. They took another $5 million from the Royal Family's PR operation. Now, why did the Saudis give the Clintons all that money? Because they care deeply about AIDS in Africa and the childhood obesity crisis? If you believe that, get your resume ready. CNN has a reporting position open for you. But it wasn't just the Clintons that got rich from the Saudis. Their allies did too. The Podesta Group was co-founded by Tony Podesta and his brother John Podesta. You remember he served as Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff in the White House, and then Hillary Clinton's Campaign Chairman. Well, immediately after the last election, the Podesta Group was hired by, yes, the Saudis to lobby the U.S. government. In 2017, the Podesta Group earned nearly $2 million from that contract alone. Meanwhile, the Democratic lobbying firm, Glover Park Group did almost as well from the Saudis. They made $700,000 just last year and another $600,000 from the Saudis this year, before bad publicity from the murder forced them to end that contract. But nobody, maybe in the world, tried to cash in like Democratic fundraiser Ari Emanuel. His talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, cut a deal to receive $400 million in investment from the Saudi government from its Sovereign Wealth Fund. This April, Ari Emanuel co-hosted a dinner in L.A. for the Crown Prince, the one who apparently ordered Khashoggi's murder. Jeff Bezos from Amazon was there, of course, so was Bob Iger from Disney. Here's how Vanity Fair described that evening. \"Topics that were deemed off-limits included the Prince's bombing campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, his abduction of Lebanon's Prime Minister in November, and the repression of independent media and journalists, one of whom was recently imprisoned for five years for insulting the Royal Court.\" So, Ari Emanuel and his fellow Hollywood Liberals wanted to make sure that nobody asked the Saudis these uncomfortable questions. The Left cares deeply about human rights but not when it gets in the way of business with the Saudis. We should pause here and note in the interest of fairness two things. First, it's not just Democrats who've taken truckloads of Saudi money. Republicans in Washington definitely have done so too. And second, the Saudis are not the only despites (ph) currently making America's ruling class richer, hardly. Many of our leaders, again, on both sides are being paid off by the Chinese government. That's a dictatorship far more bloodthirsty than the Saudis. The Chinese, remember, have kidnapped children and harvested the organs of executed political prisoners. They threw a Nobel Peace Prize winner behind bars until he died. As we speak tonight, the Chinese are throwing hundreds of thousands of ethnic majorities -- minorities into concentration camps. Earlier this year, China disappeared the Head of Interpol. How much of that have you heard on MSNBC? Probably not much. Now, none of this is a defense of the Saudis or their behavior. In fact, twice in the last two years, this show has attacked the Saudi government for pushing the Administration into pointless bombings in Syria. The rest of official Washington, especially the media, applauded those bombings. Now, amazingly, the very same people are pretending to be shocked that a primitive desert theocracy killed somebody. Please, spare us the sanctimony. It is nauseating. Well, up next, the Miss Universe pageant is 10 days away. And there's something very notable about the person favored to win. We'll tell you what it is after the break."
