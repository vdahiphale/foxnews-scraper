Now, we're not talking about the whistle-blower complaint, which was filed back on August the 12th, but other things that have sort of trickled out over the last little while. Bolton was very much at odds, there's no question about that, with the president on several foreign policy issues, including Syria, Iran, Russia and North Korea. The latest thing to dribble out was what former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill told the congressional committees yesterday, that John Bolton once described Rudy Giuliani as a -- quote -- \"hand grenade\" on Ukraine who was going to blow everybody up. I spoke with Giuliani about what Fiona Hill said yesterday this morning. And he told me the following -- quote -- \"I am disappointed in John. I'm not sure he realizes I received all of this evidence as part of my representation of the president. It was all part of the evidence and suppression of evidence involving Ukrainian collusion and the origin of some of the false information against the president.\" Rudy Giuliani says that he still considers John Bolton to be a friend.  Now, to what you said at the top of all this, Neil, Giuliani did tell me a little more than an hour ago that he is not going to comply with a subpoena that he received from the three House committees that are conducting the impeachment inquiry. He said, there's a number of reasons for it. A lot of them follow along the same lies as the reasons that the White House articulated to Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen of the three committees that letter from Pat Cipollone. It also goes to executive privilege. It also goes to attorney- client privilege. So, unless and until Congress decides that it tries to enforce the subpoena, they are not going to get any cooperation from Giuliani -- Neil.",

He made a campaign promise back in 2016 that he was going to end these endless wars. And I think he's dealing with that struggle of, on the one hand, we don't want to create a vacuum. We don't want to give fertile ground for ISIS or the next terrorist organization to grow. But, on the other hand, he really does want to bring down some of the dangerous situations we have our men and women in. It's a tough job. The president's got a lot of things that he has to consider. But I also believe that the president will hold Turkey accountable. He will implement more sanctions. He will -- he will do what he needs to get to what he thought moving out of Syria would have produced. If it -- if it's going in the direction that we see it today, I think you can count on the president for taking the proper action.",

There will surely be questions about impeachment and his son Hunter Biden, who resigned from the board of a Chinese company this weekend. FOX News is told the former vice president plans to emphasize the need to keep the focus on what he believes is President Trump's unprecedented abuse of power. The RealClearPolitics average has Biden leading the field, but we have seen Senator Warren slide to the top in a number of recent polls. In recent days, Senator Bernie Sanders seemed to try and separate himself from his longtime friend, saying that Warren is a capitalist and he is not. Senator Sanders is taking the stage after suffering a heart attack roughly two weeks ago. In addition to impeachment and all that surrounds it, other topics likely to come up tonight include health care, the situation involving the Turks and the Kurds in Northern Syria, as well as immigration.

      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. There's nothing definitive, but there is a lot of chatter, I will tell you, around here at the White House among staffers, even the president, as to whether or not some of this information that's dribbled out over the last few days might have come from the former National Security Adviser John Bolton himself. Now, we're not talking about the whistle-blower complaint, which was filed back on August the 12th, but other things that have sort of trickled out over the last little while. Bolton was very much at odds, there's no question about that, with the president on several foreign policy issues, including Syria, Iran, Russia and North Korea. The latest thing to dribble out was what former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill told the congressional committees yesterday, that John Bolton once described Rudy Giuliani as a -- quote -- \"hand grenade\" on Ukraine who was going to blow everybody up. I spoke with Giuliani about what Fiona Hill said yesterday this morning. And he told me the following -- quote -- \"I am disappointed in John. I'm not sure he realizes I received all of this evidence as part of my representation of the president. It was all part of the evidence and suppression of evidence involving Ukrainian collusion and the origin of some of the false information against the president.\" Rudy Giuliani says that he still considers John Bolton to be a friend. Now, to what you said at the top of all this, Neil, Giuliani did tell me a little more than an hour ago that he is not going to comply with a subpoena that he received from the three House committees that are conducting the impeachment inquiry. He said, there's a number of reasons for it. A lot of them follow along the same lies as the reasons that the White House articulated to Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen of the three committees that letter from Pat Cipollone. It also goes to executive privilege. It also goes to attorney- client privilege. So, unless and until Congress decides that it tries to enforce the subpoena, they are not going to get any cooperation from Giuliani -- Neil."

Well, the bomb, the market up 237 points, despite lingering doubts about that trade deal and whether it will be formally signed off, and what's happening in Turkey. It is really back to basics here. John Layfield says, markets move in the longer term on fundamentals, like earnings, and those earnings that are sort of petering out now as part of this quarterly ritual we go through, by and large, they have been better than expected. And, by and large, they have offered some nice guidance. John Layfield, you like that, right?"

We have got a lot of geopolitical potential headwinds out there that look to be mitigated too a little bit with respect for this, with Brexit and with the trade war right now. At least no more bad news is coming out right now, a little bit of positive news. But I think, more importantly, it's what happened in December is the same thing that happened today. December, we had a pretty big pullback in the market, a lot of uncertainty. J.P. Morgan reported first. You know, general electric, as you know, used to be the bellwether for the economy."

The Chinese are raising hackles that, first, you got to remove those December tariffs that are going into effect. No movement on that. Then the Turkey stuff, we don't know when that's ending. We just know it's accelerating. And we have upped the ante with sanctions, and Congress says even tougher sanctions. Then we have got this impeachment thing, which goes on and on and on. And yet the market climbs and climbs and climbs."

I think it also goes, portends to the -- the IMF just came out and said that the global GDP growth was going to be around 3 percent, which is the lowest that we have had since 2009, when we actually had a contraction in GDP. So I think you're seeing a global slowdown right now. You see a lot of problems in the world. So you want to put your money where it's safe. And there's no yield to put your money. So, to me, dividend stocks , especially, but stocks that are more -- a lot -- fragile assets that are dependent upon this trade war or geopolitical events to me are the place to put it. And the only place to do that right now is the United States."

What do you make of that?"

Any time you have somebody running against an incumbent -- you saw this in 2008, where you're running basically against President Bush, who wasn't running, but that style, that incumbent of a Republican, and 2012, 2016, you're seeing a lot of money being spent on putting a damper on this economy, because you want to get somebody elected. That folds into consumer sentiment as far as spending that goes on right now. We're going to see that a lot more going forward. But I think the consumer is very strong, which is great for our market."

He is the biggest superstar. Now, he goes beyond basketball. He is a global superstar when it comes to brand and all that. And he could have stood up for America here and American values and all that. And, instead, he didn't, for two reasons. One, he didn't want to be inconvenienced. He said that, when the players went over there, they were bothered by the tweet, et cetera, and the response from China. Also financially, because LeBron James reportedly has a $1 billion lifetime deal with Nike. And that is why he essentially sold out to the Chinese here."

However, I would say that, look, it is protecting about business interests. When you have 600 million NBA viewers, you're selling a lot of jerseys, a lot of shoes. He is one of the main endorsers for Nike, which makes about 20 percent of their sales in China. He's protecting business interests."

We have to keep in mind that Turkey is a NATO ally. And he's -- I think the president's trying to strike the balance. But I also think the president will move more on his own with the authority that he has. We just need to see whether or not the additional sanctions would be helpful.

He made a campaign promise back in 2016 that he was going to end these endless wars. And I think he's dealing with that struggle of, on the one hand, we don't want to create a vacuum. We don't want to give fertile ground for ISIS or the next terrorist organization to grow. But, on the other hand, he really does want to bring down some of the dangerous situations we have our men and women in. It's a tough job. The president's got a lot of things that he has to consider. But I also believe that the president will hold Turkey accountable. He will implement more sanctions. He will -- he will do what he needs to get to what he thought moving out of Syria would have produced.

Let the facts come out. Let's have it be an open process, and get a decision, and move on, and start thinking about some of the things that affect our families. One of them, Neil, is this health care business. I mean, it costs so much. And even when you have your health care, you think about the co-payments and the deductibles. How do families do it? This whole system has got to be reviewed. And turning it over the government isn't going to fix it."

Those are the two big ones, many others. FOX News' Ellison Barber in the middle of it all in Ohio, what we can expect later tonight. Hey, Ellison."

    {
      "speaker": "ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. So there are 12 candidates on one stage tonight. The candidates leading the group, they're going to be standing in the middle of the stage, Sanders, Biden and Warren. Those with lower polling numbers will be further out. All eyes, of course, will be on former Vice President Joe Biden. There will surely be questions about impeachment and his son Hunter Biden, who resigned from the board of a Chinese company this weekend. FOX News is told the former vice president plans to emphasize the need to keep the focus on what he believes is President Trump's unprecedented abuse of power. The RealClearPolitics average has Biden leading the field, but we have seen Senator Warren slide to the top in a number of recent polls. In recent days, Senator Bernie Sanders seemed to try and separate himself from his longtime friend, saying that Warren is a capitalist and he is not. Senator Sanders is taking the stage after suffering a heart attack roughly two weeks ago. In addition to impeachment and all that surrounds it, other topics likely to come up tonight include health care, the situation involving the Turks and the Kurds in Northern Syria, as well as immigration. This morning, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro visited an undocumented immigrant who has been living in sanctuary for two years in a church in Columbus not far from here -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Ellison, thank you very much, Ellison Barber in the middle of all that in Ohio, the big debate, of course, among those one dozen candidates. Keep in mind, who would raise Hunter Biden as an issue, whether it's the moderators or one of the candidates who might want to seize on this and see how much capital they can gain from it? Tulsi Gabbard comes to mind. There are others as well. We have a lot more coming up, including the latest on the markets today and why they did what they did today, what that could be portending for tomorrow."

      "utterance": "All right, up about 237 points today. I left out the possibility not only that there was optimism about what's going on in this country, but optimism what's going on in Great Britain. I don't know if you heard, but a Brexit deal that looked dead, gone, not going to happen, no way, well, apparently, way. At the last second, it looks like Boris Johnson might have cobbled together a deal that would get European approval, would get approval in Parliament, and save the day for Britain to go ahead and bolt from the European Union. Then, of course, the details and what a Britain would look like and what that new Europe would look like. We're all over that on FOX Business tomorrow, the new look, in fact, the rest of my torso.
