The Broward County supervisor of elections may soon be out or worse. Tonight, a criminal investigation is now underway as Republicans Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott now look poised for victory. We will bring you the very latest updates from Florida.  Plus, get this. Jim Acosta, fake news CNN, they are now suing the president in a complaint that is chock-full of abject lies and distortions.  Acosta and his employer CNN, they're actually claiming that the White House is stripping his constitutional rights by not allowing him inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Jim must really be crying himself to sleep at night.  All right. So, coming up, we will break down the bogus lawsuit. We'll show you just how Jim's hyper-partisan unprofessional behavior is unbefitting to the industry that he claims to be serving. And also tonight, we will preview a looming feud inside the Democratic Party between the far left and the far, far, far extreme radical left. And speaking of which, believe it or not, Hillary Clinton clearly may be gearing up for yet another presidential run.  Also tonight, Monica Lewinsky speaking out about her infamous affair in the Oval Office. She wants an apology and I think she deserves one. We'll show you the tape. Also stay tuned, we got a lot to get to. Time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

And we begin in Florida where the recount is moving forward and barring any kind of disaster, Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott will rightfully be Florida's next governor and senator. Now, with that said, what we have seen out of liberal Broward and Palm Beach Counties has been an absolute national disgrace. Over at Broward County, election supervisor Brenda Snipes magically dislocated over 75,000 new ballots days and days after the election.   Now, earlier this week, a box containing provisional ballots was actually found by an employee at a rental car company left behind an airport in Fort Lauderdale. Multiple state election laws, we now know they were broken, disregarded altogether. A court has ruled that Snipes acted inappropriately and now, the Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are investigating claims of criminal voter fraud. Now, we have embattled election supervisor Brenda Snipes who might be out of a job soon. Take a look.",

Acosta is still free to spew his anti-Trump hatred anywhere he wants, just not inside the walls of the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But now, Acosta and CNN are suing President Trump and other officials in the administration.   Now, the lawsuit laughably claims that Acosta's constitutional rights have been violated. The complaint also goes on to list the following lies as facts: they say that Acosta merely asked a question during the press conference.  Well, you just saw it. That's a lie. He tried to grandstand, he gave his commentary, and he wanted to debate the president. Next, the suit suggests that Acosta didn't put his hand on the White House intern. Well, you can see right there on your screen, well, the intern tried to get the microphone back, and there was contact. I'm not saying anything bad happened with that.  But the complaint also claims that Acosta has been a journalist -- this is my favorite -- for more than two decades and is widely respected for his diligence and independence. That's the biggest lie.  Jim Acosta is a lot of things. He is not a fair, balanced, independent journalist. Now, he is a far left, grandstanding, sycophant, left-winger, capitalizing on his blatant anti-Trump bias.

He set a record. 2010, his first midterm, Democrats lost a whopping 63 House seats and six Senate seats. Now, the Democrats are in disarray.

So, as a Florida recount is underway, Broward County has come into focus for its history of incompetence and controversy, especially under the leadership of election supervisor, there she is, Brenda Snipes.

Christian Adams, Snipes' misdeeds include prematurely destroying ballots after the 2016 primary race, reporting more registered voters than citizens, doctoring reports about cleaning voter rolls and losing the manual on removing dead voters. Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been very vocal with his concerns about the election and all these era galaxies. He joins us right now. Senator, honestly, you were the first that really brought this to my attention, thank you. Fifty-seven thousand-vote lead, now dwindling down to 12,000. Now, they are going to have even more time.

By law, those were supposed to be downloaded and sent to the state by 7:30 p.m. on the night of the election. And then you have to process the absentee ballots, the mail ballots that have come in before that time. And then there's always some that come in Monday and Tuesday before the election. Those should be shortly thereafter. They didn't follow any of that. It is also additional votes added to every county, because people are voting for overseas, or because you haven't fully processed all the ones that you had by 7:30. But you're supposed to update that every 45 minutes.  They didn't do that. We know for example that is part of the Broward County's vote count, it includes at least 19 people who were disqualified from voting by their own canvassing board, who they only took the ballots to after being forced, after being cut, and we don't know how many others that may have happened in. And now we know they didn't start the recount, the machinery count until this morning, after -- everybody else started Saturday or Sunday, Miami-Dade is almost done. So, it's irregularity after irregularity. And as far as stealing is concerned, let me just make this one point on that, that's what election lawyers -- the election lawyers are not coming to Florida to make sure every vote is counted. The reason why election lawyers get involved is to make sure as many votes as possible for their client is counted, and as many votes as possible for their opponent is disqualified. And when you have in office -- this in office, an election office this incompetent, and in this lawbreaking, it creates enormous opportunity for those sorts of arguments to be made.

I, for the life of me, especially after all we went through, dimpled, pebbled, scattered, smothered, covered, and everything else in 2000, this keeps happening. This keeps happening.

So, they said, all right let's find the 21. It's too late. Once you pull the ballot out of the envelope there's no way to match one with the other. So, that's just one example of the kinds of things that have been going on top of some of the history that you've outlined already over this sort of thing.

Now the canvassing board, if the accounting teams don't do it, have to sit down and determine did the voter intend to vote or not.

Nothing that goes to the core of the original assignment for Robert Mueller which was to investigate so-called Russia collusion which our friend Gregg Jarrett has called aptly the Russian hoax. They did their best during the campaign, Sean, to block Donald Trump from becoming president. Once he became president it moved to a different phase, which was trying to undermine and ultimately destroy his presidency with this investigation, which is essentially tantamount to the cover up. Now I'm gratified to see that the president has an excellent legal team including a new White House counsel, presumably they are doing everything they can to protect the president and to defend against any kind of legal exposure here by making sure that answers are properly done and in writing.",

We will bring you the very latest updates from Florida. Plus, get this. Jim Acosta, fake news CNN, they are now suing the president in a complaint that is chock-full of abject lies and distortions.  Acosta and his employer CNN, they're actually claiming that the White House is stripping his constitutional rights by not allowing him inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Jim must really be crying himself to sleep at night. All right. So, coming up, we will break down the bogus lawsuit. We'll show you just how Jim's hyper-partisan unprofessional behavior is unbefitting to the industry that he claims to be serving.

Over at Broward County, election supervisor Brenda Snipes magically dislocated over 75,000 new ballots days and days after the election. Now, earlier this week, a box containing provisional ballots was actually found by an employee at a rental car company left behind an airport in Fort Lauderdale. Multiple state election laws, we now know they were broken, disregarded altogether.

Acosta is still free to spew his anti-Trump hatred anywhere he wants, just not inside the walls of the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

He tried to grandstand, he gave his commentary, and he wanted to debate the president. Next, the suit suggests that Acosta didn't put his hand on the White House intern. Well, you can see right there on your screen, well, the intern tried to get the microphone back, and there was contact. I'm not saying anything bad happened with that. But the complaint also claims that Acosta has been a journalist -- this is my favorite -- for more than two decades and is widely respected for his diligence and independence. That's the biggest lie. Jim Acosta is a lot of things. He is not a fair, balanced, independent journalist. Now, he is a far left, grandstanding, sycophant, left-winger, capitalizing on his blatant anti-Trump bias.

Now, Republicans, yes, they lost the House, but they made gains in the Senate, something that has only happened three times in 100 years of midterm elections. 1994, let's look at the tape. Bill Clinton's first midterm election, they got shellacked. They lost 52 House seats and eight Senate seats. It was even worse under Obama. He set a record. 2010, his first midterm, Democrats lost a whopping 63 House seats and six Senate seats. Now, the Democrats are in disarray. Serious battle brewing tonight on Capitol Hill between far left Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and even further left-wing Democrats like the socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

      "utterance": "All right. So, as a Florida recount is underway, Broward County has come into focus for its history of incompetence and controversy, especially under the leadership of election supervisor, there she is, Brenda Snipes. According to former DOJ official J. Christian Adams, Snipes' misdeeds include prematurely destroying ballots after the 2016 primary race, reporting more registered voters than citizens, doctoring reports about cleaning voter rolls and losing the manual on removing dead voters. Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been very vocal with his concerns about the election and all these era galaxies. He joins us right now. Senator, honestly, you were the first that really brought this to my attention, thank you. Fifty-seven thousand-vote lead, now dwindling down to 12,000. Now, they are going to have even more time. I'm concerned. You actually said -- you used the word \"steal\". Do you believe there's been an effort here, corruption here to steal an election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "Well, here's what I believe. I believe the law hasn't been followed from the beginning. You know, those early votes, the last time they were cast was the Sunday before election. By law, those were supposed to be downloaded and sent to the state by 7:30 p.m. on the night of the election. And then you have to process the absentee ballots, the mail ballots that have come in before that time. And then there's always some that come in Monday and Tuesday before the election. Those should be shortly thereafter. They didn't follow any of that. It is also additional votes added to every county, because people are voting for overseas, or because you haven't fully processed all the ones that you had by 7:30. But you're supposed to update that every 45 minutes.  They didn't do that. We know for example that is part of the Broward County's vote count, it includes at least 19 people who were disqualified from voting by their own canvassing board, who they only took the ballots to after being forced, after being cut, and we don't know how many others that may have happened in. And now we know they didn't start the recount, the machinery count until this morning, after -- everybody else started Saturday or Sunday, Miami-Dade is almost done. So, it's irregularity after irregularity. And as far as stealing is concerned, let me just make this one point on that, that's what election lawyers -- the election lawyers are not coming to Florida to make sure every vote is counted. The reason why election lawyers get involved is to make sure as many votes as possible for their client is counted, and as many votes as possible for their opponent is disqualified. And when you have in office -- this in office, an election office this incompetent, and in this lawbreaking, it creates enormous opportunity for those sorts of arguments to be made. And suddenly the elections are decided by a judge or by lawyers, not by voters the way they are supposed to be."

I, for the life of me, especially after all we went through, dimpled, pebbled, scattered, smothered, covered, and everything else in 2000, this keeps happening. This keeps happening. There are 57 counties, 65 of them got it right. And more importantly, 35 of those counties had been victimized by the hurricane, especially the Panhandle. They got it right."

And what supposed to happen is you present those to the canvassing board to decide whether or not they are allowed to vote. She didn't do that. She opened it up. She basically decided they were going to count and she counted the votes. Then she got caught. She said, I submitted to the canvassing board and they found that 21 of them should not count. So, they said, all right let's find the 21. It's too late. Once you pull the ballot out of the envelope there's no way to match one with the other. So, that's just one example of the kinds of things that have been going on top of some of the history that you've outlined already over this sort of thing. And so, yes, it's deeply concerning that they are not following the law. They are not following the law and that's why we have election laws.

What will happen after the machine recount is any race in the state that's within less than a quarter of one point which will be the Senate race and the agriculture race, there will have to a hand recount of the over votes and under votes, basically that somebody skip the ballot and not vote for this race. Now the canvassing board, if the accounting teams don't do it, have to sit down and determine did the voter intend to vote or not. And that's where lawyers get involved and start arguing that a mark here and cross here and circle over here was voter intent. Now the statute is pretty clear, but what that should be that doesn't mean anyone is going to follow it or that they are going to follow it. So, there's a lot to be concerned about and that's why it's so important that they had scrutiny and transparency and that we watch it every step of the way."

Then of course we're are finding ballots in the back of rental cars in Tampa from that county. So, are you confident when they do over/under votes, if there is a mark like 400, you know, so far away that they are going to try and argue that those are real votes and that they intended to vote when you miss the entire oval or whatever way you do it?"

Two sources familiar with the discussions told Fox tonight that the written answers are being finalized and could be submitted to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team as early as the end of this week. Contacted by Fox the president's lawyers had no immediate comment. We recently reported the president's legal team was preparing written responses about alleged coordination with Russia during the 2016 campaign and not obstruction of justice over the president's May 2017 firing of FBI director James Comey. The president's legal team consider those questions infringe on the president's constitutional power to hire and fire. Returning to Capitol Hill, earlier today Democrats also ramped up attacks on Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general. With the Senate judiciary committee's ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein calling for emergency hearings with Whitaker and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The committee's Republican chairman who controls the Senate committee calendar and knows Whitaker from Iowa politics pointed to the ongoing Justice Department ethics reviews."

Joining us now with reaction, author of the number one New York Times bestseller \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Framed Donald Trump\" Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, along with Washington Times columnist, Monica Crowley is with us. You know, if it's now what written answers, that would suggest that the whole issue that we had discussed in the past about a potential subpoena of the president, would not be happening. The fact that it seems exclusively to focus on the original mandate, if you will, which is Russia collusion we have no evidence of collusion up to this point, none whatsoever, except for Hillary Clinton. And they didn't seem to go into that too deeply paying for the phony Russian dossier that was used to commit a fraud in a FISA court, and influence the American people before the 2016 election and then undermine the president post his victory."

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "So, the lawyers for Donald Trump were very smart in refusing an in-person interview, because even if the president tells the truth, Mueller is so unscrupulous and on principled he would charge the president or accuse him of lying. So, the way to go is written answers. They're also limited the scope and no obstruction of justice. So, these answers to questions will only be about collusion and the answer is, quite frankly, which will be prepared by the lawyers to ensure the president isn't in legal jeopardy will be very brief. I don't know anything about collusion, I didn't talk to Russians about the election. And the next question, the answer will be the same answer as before. So, it's going to be very brief, it will not put the president in legal jeopardy. It is a win for the president and his team, and a loss as it should have been for the guy on your screen, Robert Mueller."

It has never been to me just the appearance of the people he selected to me has been so over the top. I want specifically -- the only thing we're hearing now that Jerome Corsi is suggesting that he is been told that he might face charges of lying which would be in the vein, if I guess Michael Flynn, although the two FBI agents claimed he never lied. And maybe Papadopoulos. But if that's it, and Roger Stone is who they want to go after, I'm not sure what that would all be about but it doesn't seem connected to Donald Trump in any way."

      "speaker": "MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES",
      "utterance": "Yes. So far what we now and what we've seen from the Mueller team are essentially process crimes, right. Nothing that goes to the core of the original assignment for Robert Mueller which was to investigate so-called Russia collusion which our friend Gregg Jarrett has called aptly the Russian hoax. They did their best during the campaign, Sean, to block Donald Trump from becoming president. Once he became president it moved to a different phase, which was trying to undermine and ultimately destroy his presidency with this investigation, which is essentially tantamount to the cover up. Now I'm gratified to see that the president has an excellent legal team including a new White House counsel, presumably they are doing everything they can to protect the president and to defend against any kind of legal exposure here by making sure that answers are properly done and in writing."

And people, actually on other networks -- lawyers are actually making the case that it's not a valid legal appointment. I called you, and you cited the Federal Vacancies Act. It is 5 USC 3345, I can read it or you can tell everybody, whatever you prefer."

But the double standard is obvious. All right. Thank you both. We appreciate it. When we come back, here we go again. This is getting more insane.
