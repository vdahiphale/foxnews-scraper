Let's just say it could have been a lot worse, stocks clawing to come back today, after being down more than 800 points, equaling yesterday's big sell-off, and that despite a stronger-than-expected employment report.  We will get to that in a second. But with the drops today, and as bad as it looks today, it could have been a lot worse. The Nasdaq had been about 300 points worse, and that average had fallen close to 10 percent, the technical definition of a correction, in a matter of two days.  It's not done that since going back to March and the height of the pandemic sell-off, but that was then. This is now, a market that rebounded from the worst levels. Now the only question they're asking is, which is real, what happened yesterday or what they tried to call back today?  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World,\" And, man, oh, man, this was one for the crazy record books.  Jackie DeAngelis to sort out the data and then, well, the dumping of stocks, and then the return to stocks. It was that crazy. Hey, Jackie.",

      "sentences": "Good afternoon to you, Neil.   Well, the markets did come back from session lows, especially the Dow there, finishing down only 160 points. And that was after that big 800- point sell-off that you mentioned that we saw yesterday. A few things to note here. Wall Street is worried about stimulus coming out of Washington. It's concerned about the pace at which the market has moved here. It's also cautious as we're going into a long holiday weekend. So, most of the selling that we're seeing right now, I'm told, in big tech, for example, looks like it's profit-taking. It's Amazon and Facebook and Microsoft, and Apples saw some pressure too. The financials, the industrials, they were also part of the pull lower today.   It's pretty broad-based across the board. Now, the mixed reaction that we're seeing is coming off the back of that August unemployment report; 1.37 million jobs were added in August. It was slightly lower than what Wall Street was expecting. But the unemployment rate, that was the good news, it did move lower from north of 10 percent to 8.4 percent. The bulk of the jobs coming back from the retail and the leisure and hospitality sectors, those were hit so hard by the pandemic, so that was some welcome news. Still, Wall Street wants these numbers to improve and they want them to improve quickly. Pre-pandemic, unemployment was at a 50-year low. So we know it's going to take a while to get back there. And, of course, we still don't know about the virus, about a second wave, about a vaccine, about so much as we head into the fall -- Neil.",

There were also security concerns about the president being so far away out of the country from Air Force One, in case there were some sort of international emergency, and the president didn't particularly feel like sitting in the limousine for four hours.  He was going to do a wreath-laying out at Aisne-Marne, but then the next day he was scheduled to do a full speech at the Suresnes Cemetery. That went off. I was actually there about 30 feet away from the president. So, those are the explanations for everything that happened. The president did not go to Aisne-Marne. It was talked about being a weather call, but the president also did not want to go in the motorcade.

We're way down from where we were, of course, at the height of this, when we were looking at north of a 15 percent unemployment rate, now at 8.4 percent. But, again, we're way up from the best of days, well before the epidemic, when we were at 3.6 percent.   The president says the trend is his friend and he likes what he's saying. Do you?",

I do think there are some potential risks coming, because some of the bad news is not necessarily priced in, just because, statistically, we can't really get there quite yet. We don't have enough data. We have 100 million loans in forbearance; 8.2 percent of the mortgages are in forbearance, right? What statistically percentage of those people are going to end up in a default situation? You have 26.5 percent of the country feeling like they can't make their next housing payment.  You have people trading $70-an-hour jobs for $10-an-hour jobs. And you have the food-insufficient or -insecure houses going up still. So we're not out of the woods yet.

Their wages, hourly wages, are strengthening, average 3 percent. And then they're working longer each week.

So, if you have a hot zone, an area, a city where there's a lot of COVID-19 transmission, opening schools is just not a smart idea. And it's not something we recommend. That being said, when we talk about reopening of schools, we're not just talking about one specific route. There's many different variables that we can take when it comes to opening schools. That could be hybrid models of opening schools, schools that will have some in-person classes on certain days of the week, others online. And it really needs to be tailored to that individual city, individual community, because only then can we make some sort of sense of what's going on.

We will get to that in a second. But with the drops today, and as bad as it looks today, it could have been a lot worse. The Nasdaq had been about 300 points worse, and that average had fallen close to 10 percent, the technical definition of a correction, in a matter of two days.

And that was after that big 800- point sell-off that you mentioned that we saw yesterday. A few things to note here. Wall Street is worried about stimulus coming out of Washington. It's concerned about the pace at which the market has moved here. It's also cautious as we're going into a long holiday weekend. So, most of the selling that we're seeing right now, I'm told, in big tech, for example, looks like it's profit-taking. It's Amazon and Facebook and Microsoft, and Apples saw some pressure too. The financials, the industrials, they were also part of the pull lower today. It's pretty broad-based across the board. Now, the mixed reaction that we're seeing is coming off the back of that August unemployment report; 1.37 million jobs were added in August. It was slightly lower than what Wall Street was expecting. But the unemployment rate, that was the good news, it did move lower from north of 10 percent to 8.4 percent. The bulk of the jobs coming back from the retail and the leisure and hospitality sectors, those were hit so hard by the pandemic, so that was some welcome news. Still, Wall Street wants these numbers to improve and they want them to improve quickly. Pre-pandemic, unemployment was at a 50-year low. So we know it's going to take a while to get back there. And, of course, we still don't know about the virus, about a second wave, about a vaccine, about so much as we head into the fall -- Neil."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "So, he talked about John Kelly's recommendation. There was a backup plan that was potentially being formulated that the president could take a motorcade out there. The White House initially said that it would disrupt traffic. There were also security concerns about the president being so far away out of the country from Air Force One, in case there were some sort of international emergency, and the president didn't particularly feel like sitting in the limousine for four hours. He was going to do a wreath-laying out at Aisne-Marne, but then the next day he was scheduled to do a full speech at the Suresnes Cemetery. That went off. I was actually there about 30 feet away from the president. So, those are the explanations for everything that happened. The president did not go to Aisne-Marne. It was talked about being a weather call, but the president also did not want to go in the motorcade. But all of the people that I have talked to about this, again, including John Bolton, who is no fan of the president, say at no time did he ever refer to U.S. dead as -- quote -- \"suckers or losers\" -- Neil."

But if you look back at the Nasdaq, as you mentioned, over the last several years, we have had days like this. We have had weeks like this, even months like this, only to have all-time new highs. And I think, as Frances pointed out, with the economic data backing up what is going to be a strengthening economy as we go into a possible vaccine release, there's a lot to be excited about in stocks here."

I think new fiscal stimulus, despite the gridlock, is largely priced in. So I think most of the good news is priced in. I do think there are some potential risks coming, because some of the bad news is not necessarily priced in, just because, statistically, we can't really get there quite yet. We don't have enough data. We have 100 million loans in forbearance; 8.2 percent of the mortgages are in forbearance, right? What statistically percentage of those people are going to end up in a default situation? You have 26.5 percent of the country feeling like they can't make their next housing payment. You have people trading $70-an-hour jobs for $10-an-hour jobs. And you have the food-insufficient or -insecure houses going up still. So we're not out of the woods yet. I think the market is just pricing so far into the future that we are eventually going to come out of this thing, but we're not there yet as far as the economy goes."

A lot of future growth is coming into stock prices here, Neil. It's a Biden election victory, frankly, that I don't think the market has really taken to heart, because that means higher taxes. That means more government regulation, more government involvement in everyday life. And I think the market is still hoping that, say, Trump is going to pull this thing out, and he just might. But that will be something that will affect markets, to your point, as far as the volatility trade going into, say, the end of the weeks in October, certainly into early November, at some of the polls maybe tighten up here, as some things get clearer as to what may happen in the outcome after November 3."

The truth of matter is, Joe Biden presided over the worst economic recovery in our lifetime. With this report today, President Trump has presided over the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history. Joe Biden never dreamed of 1.4 million new jobs a month. And it's true, we are not through this yet. But gaining back half, nearly half the jobs we lost from COVID in a fairly short time is impressive. And I think, looking at the numbers today in that report, Neil -- you probably noticed it too -- but, for households, their job prospects are up. The number of laid off population has shrunk. Their wages, hourly wages, are strengthening, average 3 percent. And then they're working longer each week. These are, directionally, really -- this is -- given August was supposed to be the month our economy dropped off the cliff due to the flare-ups, this is an extraordinary report."

I guess what I'm asking you is, if it's consistent and it's steady, and that was an environment where taxes were being raised, who's to say that they can't do the same thing again?"

      "speaker": "BRADY",

And the recovery is extraordinary -- at this point, I think is better then expectations by a significant way.

We're tight on time, but maybe you can help me with this, that the argument right now is that the economy is going to have a tougher time moving forward from here, that there might be a bit of a drag. It might not matter now we have got employment -- unemployment back down to single digits, but this might be as good as it gets for a while. How do you counter that? Because a lot of these same doom-and-gloomers missed the strength and the ferocity of this comeback, period? But I want you to respond to that, because Joe Biden is saying, unless I do something drastic here to address this, we're going to topple in and stay in something bad at for a long time."

Look, as we recover more and more from the pandemic, the growth, the trajectory may slow, but the direction is going exactly the way we want it to go. If we can continue to add a million jobs a month, we will be working out of this crisis in a significant way. Taxes will slow back down. Also, higher regulation, lifting taxes on -- or raising taxes on businesses competing around the world will ship our jobs overseas.

Look how many North Carolinians have done that so far, some 643,000 people planning to vote by mail. That's out of the seven million registered voters here in the state. President Trump, he was in North Carolina Wednesday. And while he was here, he said he wanted his supporters to make sure that they did all they can that their votes were counted, and potentially show up to vote a second time, if they were concerned it wasn't counted.

But this idea -- I think part of what he may be doing is kind of challenging what's been sort of a mantra in much of the media, that this is really nothing to worry about. But going too much more mail-in voting in many states across the country with very tight timelines, I think, does raise problems. as the Postal Service has warned, it doesn't work perfectly. There can be delays. The count can be drawn out. And, of course, when you're sending out unsolicited ballots, millions of Americans move every year, you do open up the possibility of fraud in a way you don't have with in-person voting."

I was amazed at hundreds of thousands of examples from just the last election. So, there is that. And that gets to be part of a recount effort in a very close election.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "I think the problem here is that some states are almost designing it that way. You think of New York, Michigan, where you have very tight deadlines, the ability to send in a ballot. And there are going to be a lot more of them by mail than there normally are. Right before the election, Postal Service normally will deliver something within five days, but not always. It almost guarantees that you're going to have disputes and litigation for days and perhaps weeks after Election Day. And that's not the system we want. We want a clean, respected system that gives us an election night result. And so I think, at a minimum, as this issue is raised, those states should think about moving deadlines, so that we can declare a winner on election night. That should be the goal."

But I am now wondering, to the issue you raise, that it's not so much the post office, but the reliability of what you're getting on those ballots, and then who's doing the counting and all that, right?"

If you're going to criticize someone, make sure you clarify that and make sure you're very focused on that. And, conversely, if something good is happening, make sure you get to that. But the same should apply to both sides.

I was then in a White House briefing where I posed questions to White House officials. And, generally, those questions are on news of the day. Now, the Atlantic article and what the president reportedly said is news of the day, and you should expect to hear questions about that when he has what we believe will be a news conference at 5:00 p.m. today. But he is often asked about comments that he has made or actions that his government has taken or not taken, particularly lately as it pertains to the economy and as it pertains to COVID-19. Joe Biden is not currently in government. So, it's not as easy, I would say, to pose questions to him about what he has or hasn't done, when he is not the one who is leading the country currently.

I am saying, Kristen -- I know you might share that view -- but I'm looking at it, saying, absolutely go on this Atlantic article and what's what, and it is true, and does it make sense? Does it jibe with what you have heard? Have at it. But this was this an economic address as well, in which he got into some of the details, certainly on the virus and what he would do. And I would just follow up to say, all right, some of the faster testing you want, check, it's being done. Some of the advanced testing you want, check, it's being done. The aggressive search for a vaccine, check, it's being done. No one held him accountable on the same things of which he was charging the president. Now, I know and I readily agree with what Francesca is saying. There is a different standard for the president, the guy who is in power and has the power to do a lot of these things presently. But he shouldn't get a pass. The guy who wants the job shouldn't get a pass. And I, frankly think, Kristen, that he got a pass. Your thoughts?"

I recognize the Atlantic story, and it's a news story in the moment. I get that. I would pursue the same. But to make it all about the president, what he said or what he didn't say, and not about the gist of the reason for Joe Biden's presser, to talk about the economy and what he would do differently, the virus, what he would do differently, and none of that came up, man, oh, man."

And I think they have been tough, tough on both sides. The interesting thing is, you will have a press briefing at the White House with the president where a reporter, a pool reporter, asks him, very basically, what would you say to -- what would you say to families, grieving families of victims of COVID, who have died of COVID? And he -- his response is to lash out at this news organization, to say, that's a terrible question. So, the president doesn't necessarily respond well, no matter what kind of questions he's asked."

And I have heard it and seen it, and, by the way, experienced myself, so -- but I'm -- all I'm saying, Nick Adams, is, when you get into that and the controversial stuff he says -- it's irrefutable you have to get into it. I just think this notion that both are treated the same by the press, it could be the genteel approach that Joe Biden takes. It could be the friendly approach, the fact that he constantly praises the press. I get that. That's very, very nice. But I do think, if you're going to be a jerk to one, it might be beneficial to just be the same jerk to all. I'm so used to negative, nasty e-mails. I don't pay attention. The ones that say I'm overweight, those bug me, but I dismiss them. I'm just saying, Nick, that there's got to be a sense of fair play here. I don't see it all the time. Your thoughts?"

When it comes to Donald Trump, the media is an attack dog. When it comes to Joe Biden, the media is a lapdog. They carry his water. They handle him with kid gloves. He doesn't get many questions. When he does, they're very, very easy. There are very few specific follow-ups. The media is carrying the water. He -- Joe Biden gets more difficult questions now from members in the audience than he does journalists. He's had two tough questions this year, both from African-American journalists, resulting in him snapping. And this is exactly why the media doesn't ask him the questions that they should be asking him, because they have a horse in this race. They don't want Donald Trump to be reelected. They want Joe Biden to be elected. And if that involves ignoring him..."

I will say this, though, that Francesca will not get as much of an opportunity. Now, she's obviously in the White House press corps to question the president, who routinely on his way out to Marine One or whatever at any venue takes reporters' questions on the scene. Joe Biden doesn't do much of that. And I think, from that angle, Francesca, he better start doing more of it. I'm not saying to invite nasty questions, but to get used to this idea that you're both running and -- for the highest office in the land, it comes with the territory to get questioned a lot."

And reporters had put pressure on the Biden campaign to put him in front of reporters to start taking more questions from them. And, as a result, you have seen him on two separate opportunities do that recently. And, absolutely, we would love to hear more from both President Trump and Joe Biden about what they would do, for President Trump, in his second term, Joe Biden, why he is seeking the office and the specific details into his policy. No doubt, we'd like to hear more of that from both of them. Of course, Neil, I wish that I had more opportunities to speak to President Trump about what he would do in his second term."

I want to be fair to everybody, even though, when you're doing that, sometimes, you just piss off everybody. But, on this, I think I'm touching on something that's got to be addressed for all the media. Let's all just go into this, whatever our peeves or annoyances that we get, just to do our job, to be tough on everybody, to be obnoxious with everybody, and maybe see your ratings hurt as a result.

Ahead of that, of course, this is Labor Day weekend. We're cruising it on it here right now. And as far as demand for travel is concerned, it's not what you think.

Meanwhile, companies like Delta are trying to ease the minds of those who are flying this holiday weekend, the airline giving concerned customers a look into how they sanitize its planes ahead of every flight. Additionally, airlines could implement a new rapid COVID-19 test, which can deliver results in about 15 minutes and boost airline activity. Abbott Laboratories received emergency authorization earlier this week to produce the rapid test."

I want to go to Dr. Mike Varshavski right now, a board-certified family medicine physician, Atlanta Medical Group, on all this news about colleges and the like that are delaying in-person classes because they get a quick spike, and, all of a sudden, the spike gets more worrisome. So they hold off on in-person, and the back-and-forth goes on and on. It has widened now to at least 28 colleges and universities. Others could similarly push things back. Doctor, what do you think of all that? It's inevitable people get back. There are going to be spikes. I guess you have to decide what's an acceptable spike."

      "speaker": "DR. MIKE VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely, Neil. Thank you so much for having me on. When we look at these spikes, what we need to pay attention to is more so what's going on in the community, rather than what's going on, on campus, because if you're part of a community where we're seeing widespread transmission, that ultimately is going to end up on campus or in the classroom. So, if you have a hot zone, an area, a city where there's a lot of COVID-19 transmission, opening schools is just not a smart idea. And it's not something we recommend. That being said, when we talk about reopening of schools, we're not just talking about one specific route. There's many different variables that we can take when it comes to opening schools. That could be hybrid models of opening schools, schools that will have some in-person classes on certain days of the week, others online. And it really needs to be tailored to that individual city, individual community, because only then can we make some sort of sense of what's going on. What happens in New Jersey is not the same as what's going on currently in Florida. And we can't treat them -- just like we can't treat patients the same, we can't treat those areas the same."

In a lot of cases, it's just they're congregating in numbers, let's say, at a quad at the University of Alabama, and then we get up to 1,200 cases, what have you, and, at other schools, where it has nothing to do with any big parties around. So, obviously, this is a very contagious virus. I get that. But then how, as a school, do you deal with something like that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VARSHAVSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, you have to have strict measures in place in order to keep social distancing measures in effect. That six-feet rule is not a perfect rule. It's not magical. But it is the best guidance we have at this time. So, if you have an area where you see students congregating, there should be steps taken to mitigate that situation. Now, as far as media goes, they love highlighting the parties, because that's what gets all of our emotions going, gets us angry. And while it certainly does happen, we see people who are not taking COVID-19 seriously, I don't think that holds true for the majority of students. I think the majority of my patients who fall into this age demographic are taking COVID-19 seriously. They're worried about not only their own health, but the health of those around them, including their parents, grandparents, and anyone that they can potentially get with the virus. So, I want to take a moment, unlike most media institutions, and celebrate those individuals that are taking the proper precautions, wearing masks, staying six feet away from others, and washing their hands frequently."
