Great to see all of you tonight. Byron, I'll start with you. An evolution in what we have been told about getting Americans and other allies out. We are at the mercy of the Taliban in nearly every way in that situation. Are you confident everyone left there who wants to leave will get out?  BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Absolutely not. You just played a story of increasing American weakness. If we didn't have weakness in influence when we had 5,000 troops in the country, we certainly don't now. So, today, you had Secretary of State Blinken saying, I'm going to quote it now, an immediate way the Taliban can demonstrate its willingness to respect freedom of movement is by allowing the departure of charter flights with properly documented passengers. Now, that would be great. That would be really, really nice. But we're in the position of actually asking the Taliban to do this. And our position seems to be weakening by the day.",

He's talking about local politics, things like the storm damage, people left in the dark, people suffering flood damage to their property and homes, left homeless in some cases, and also about the rise in COVID. He has got a speech scheduled for tomorrow, a major speech on COVID and what we should do going into the future.  So this is, to me, the politics of the moment.

And I have to disagree with Juan a little bit here. It was very, very clear from the beginning that the reason that this administration continued to push on with this artificial August 31st deadline despite being requested by allies, international allies, and members of Congress to please put the mission first, is they wanted to draw a line underneath this and turn and pivot back to their domestic agenda. I think the problem with that is it doesn't necessarily stop the headlines from coming. And we are still going to be hearing about the people who have been left behind, the terrorists who are taking over positions in the government. And Joe Biden can pretend, he can ignore it, but Americans understand the complete disconnect. And I think the real risk to the administration is it makes him end up looking callous. It makes him end up looking as though he is ignoring a crisis and a problem. And that will not be good for his poll numbers, and it will be harder for him to push through a domestic agenda as members of his own party try to begin to distance themselves from that.",

That's down with George W. Bush in the worst days of Iraq. But he's still underwater, the problem is he is still underwater with other things. His handling of the economy, approval of that is under water. And even with COVID, which has always been the most important part of his approval rating, the number of Americans who approve of the way he is handling this has gone down significantly.   And I think what you are going to see tomorrow is an effort to try to show the American people that his administration is on one page, and it knows what to do next in the COVID crisis because the administration has seemed confused. It has had mixed messages. And it, frankly, hasn't had a lot new to think and say about COVID in the last few weeks as people have been so worried about the Delta variant.

So I think this is all part of an effort by Democrats to focus on issues where they do have control. They got out 120,000 in the evacuation. I think they can take some pride in that.

      "utterance": "Well, I think that it's clear that long before the withdrawal, you had Afghanistan as the forever war, the forgotten war. And now without U.S. troops on the ground, Shannon, I think it's going to be in the rearview mirror pretty soon. What Biden is doing, though, politically is pretty sound strategy. He's talking about local politics, things like the storm damage, people left in the dark, people suffering flood damage to their property and homes, left homeless in some cases, and also about the rise in COVID. He has got a speech scheduled for tomorrow, a major speech on COVID and what we should do going into the future. So this is, to me, the politics of the moment. And I think that he is moving in the right direction in terms of his own political strategy."

      "utterance": "I thought it was interesting today, in \"Politico\" there was an article that talked about behind the scenes that there are staffers within the Biden administration that want him to stop talking, Kimberley, that they don't like some of his riffing or going off on topics when they need to so tightly control moving some of his domestic agenda forward?"

      "utterance": "Yes, that was a pretty remarkable story, saying that they actually mute him. But, again, this is something that everyone in America is seeing. And I have to disagree with Juan a little bit here. It was very, very clear from the beginning that the reason that this administration continued to push on with this artificial August 31st deadline despite being requested by allies, international allies, and members of Congress to please put the mission first, is they wanted to draw a line underneath this and turn and pivot back to their domestic agenda. I think the problem with that is it doesn't necessarily stop the headlines from coming. And we are still going to be hearing about the people who have been left behind, the terrorists who are taking over positions in the government. And Joe Biden can pretend, he can ignore it, but Americans understand the complete disconnect. And I think the real risk to the administration is it makes him end up looking callous. It makes him end up looking as though he is ignoring a crisis and a problem. And that will not be good for his poll numbers, and it will be harder for him to push through a domestic agenda as members of his own party try to begin to distance themselves from that."

      "utterance": "\"Wall Street Journal\" talking about those attempts to move forward with the domestic issues says this, \"He is seeking to press his legislative agenda and redouble efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic after Labor Day, but the tumultuous withdrawal from Afghanistan may cast a long shadow over the fall. The White House and congressional Democrats believe that the infrastructure and the broader legislative package are widely popular. It's a passage of those proposals as key to solidifying support ahead of the midterm elections.\" Byron, will it work?"

      "utterance": "Well, that's why he is desperately trying to change the subject, because, if you look at Biden's job approval for handling the mess in Afghanistan, it's in the 20s. That's down with George W. Bush in the worst days of Iraq. But he's still underwater, the problem is he is still underwater with other things. His handling of the economy, approval of that is under water. And even with COVID, which has always been the most important part of his approval rating, the number of Americans who approve of the way he is handling this has gone down significantly. And I think what you are going to see tomorrow is an effort to try to show the American people that his administration is on one page, and it knows what to do next in the COVID crisis because the administration has seemed confused. It has had mixed messages. And it, frankly, hasn't had a lot new to think and say about COVID in the last few weeks as people have been so worried about the Delta variant. So he really is trying, I think, to get control of what was his strongest issue."

You think about the future of the court, Shannon, something you know a lot about, but also even Senator Feinstein, who at 88 could retire any moment. So all of that is at play and driving. So I think this is all part of an effort by Democrats to focus on issues where they do have control. They got out 120,000 in the evacuation. I think they can take some pride in that. But this has been a messy exit, as we have all said today. And they have to deal with that reality."
