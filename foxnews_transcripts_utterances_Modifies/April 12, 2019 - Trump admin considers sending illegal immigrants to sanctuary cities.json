It's like when she was critiquing people about the way they say al-Qaeda, and how they overdramatize it. It was like she was saying that you place too much importance on the threat of terror, because, in her mind, the real importance about her as a victim.

The Santa Clara County administration voted overwhelmingly to soften the sanctuary policy because the point is those policies harm communities in multiple ways, including the immigrant community because it doesn't provide the clarity that they can use to understand how and when they can immigrate legally. And so, in Santa Clara County they're basically -- they're voting to soften it. And, as they say, the immigration laws there are dysfunctional, everyone is confused.

And what that does is by shifting the emphasis and the priority to that, it makes it seem like she cares less about 9/11. And the weird thing, I think, that I find troubling and persistent because she's made this mistake a number of times is that she finds an attachment to the never-forget element kind of tiresome. It's like when she was critiquing people about the way they say al-Qaeda, and how they overdramatize it. It was like she was saying that you place too much importance on the threat of terror, because, in her mind, the real importance about her as a victim. And so, even here when they're talking about like -- you better not criticize her because she could become a victim of something.

Do you remember in February when -- the woman, Larson, was like brutally murdered by a six-time civil detainer request, illegal immigrant. He had a history of violent felonies, etcetera. It was -- you know, it's kind of one of those token case of which, unfortunately, there are a lot. Point, guess what happened on Tuesday. The Santa Clara County administration voted overwhelmingly to soften the sanctuary policy because the point is those policies harm communities in multiple ways, including the immigrant community because it doesn't provide the clarity that they can use to understand how and when they can immigrate legally. And so, in Santa Clara County they're basically -- they're voting to soften it. And, as they say, the immigration laws there are dysfunctional, everyone is confused.
