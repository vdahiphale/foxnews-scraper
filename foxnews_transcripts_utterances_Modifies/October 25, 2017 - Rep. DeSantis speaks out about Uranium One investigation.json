You have millions of dollars going into the Clinton Foundation.   And we knew obviously a lot of that. That should have been investigated by now, to be honest. But here we are. But then we have this confidential informant who I believe is going to come forward very soon either by being released from the Justice Department or pursuant to a subpoena. He was an informant a year-and-a-half leading up to the CFIUS board approving this deal. So, he's in there with bribery, racketeering with all these Russians. So, how could that deal have gone through without that information not being disclosed to Congress? And what about some of the CFIUS board members?  Eric Holder was one of the members of that board. I would assume he would have to know that such an investigation was going on. Was that something that he disclosed to the other board members?   It's a very questionable policy decision that was made, and there were Republicans in the Congress at the time who complained on the policy grounds. But then when you undergird it with potential bribery and racketeering, this thing stinks to high heaven.",
