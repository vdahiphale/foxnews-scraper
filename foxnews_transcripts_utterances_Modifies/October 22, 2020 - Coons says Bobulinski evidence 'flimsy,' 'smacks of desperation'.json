We expect in the next few minutes, it was supposed to happen at 6:00 Central Time, which is right about now, but things typically don't come off exactly on time when it comes to the White House. We are expecting to hear from Tony Bobulinski, who was a business associate of Hunter and Jim Biden. Jim Biden, of course, being Joe Biden's uncle. We have been talking about this all day. There is an email that has been talked about for the last few days in which Bobulinski and Hunter Biden and Jim Biden are discussing this idea of what the percentage cuts will be of the deal of a Chinese energy company and of the cuts that are listed, 10 percent is for the big guy. Tony Bobulinski, in a statement to Fox News earlier today, saying that the big guy is referring to Joe Biden. He also goes on to say that the Chinese were not interested at least in any kind of financial return on investment. They were looking for influence, they were looking for political investment as well. We also understand that Bobulinski when he gives this small statement to the press will say at the end of it and this is the White House press pool that he will be talking to. I will say at the end of it that he is turning all of his electronic devices over to the FBI for examination. Bret, I said earlier on your program, we don't know if the FBI is interested in looking into these devices, but Bobulinski is going to make them available. Interesting to note as well but, Martha, while the Biden campaign has portrayed this as a smear, as Russian disinformation, they have not said that these emails and these text messages that we have seen from Tony Bobulinski are false. And we are not sure exactly what it is that Bobulinski will say other than that he's turning his devices over to the FBI, but we should find out in the next few minutes or so. This really will be throwing a new argument into the debate just a couple hours before it happens here in Nashville. President Trump has said that he wants to bring up Hunter Biden even if the moderator doesn't. Well, this will certainly give him reason to do this. We should say though, again, that Bobulinski's appearance here is being facilitated by the Trump campaign, so this is something that they really are trying to play to their advantage here in the last moments before the debate begins.",

This is an outrageous claim against Joe Biden, as you just heard from John Roberts, the Biden team has not denied the validity of these emails and that these were from Hunter Biden.

That is not something we are required to do, but we do it because we don't even want the faintest hint of impropriety. Donald Trump was a businessman, don't forget, before he became president of the United States, and it's just completely legitimate that he was obviously looking around the world for business deals and places to invest. It's very different than the Biden family, who got into international business after Joe Biden became vice president of the United States. Those are two very, very different things and I think people are starting to pick up on that and very clearly see that Joe Biden could possibly have been compromised by foreign entities while he was vice president of the United States.

This president has stood up against China, very, very strongly and thank goodness he has because now we have new trade deals that have been inked and are on the horizon. We know that from the onset of coronavirus, this president was always standing up strong against China. We know he stopped travel coming to the United States immediately from China at the onset of coronavirus.

Now we know there is a mute button tonight so it will be a little bit different, but I can assure you that if there's any question about the things that Joe Biden says about the president, about his policies, about what he's done for the American people, the president will respond. And look, he is a fighter and that is the reason that we have seen, I think, such success under President Donald Trump. It takes a fighter to do so many of the things that we've seen, to get this economy to the best in the world, as we know has happened under this president. The low unemployment numbers, high stock market numbers, renegotiating bad trade deals, rebuilding our military, doing things like inking these historic peace agreements in the Middle East.

      "sentences": "--involved in various successful businesses, both in this country and abroad. I'm making the statement to set the record straight about the involvement of the Biden family, Vice President Biden, his brother Jim Biden, and his son hunter Biden. In dealings with the Chinese. I've heard Joe Biden say that he's never discussed business with Hunter. That is false. I have first hand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden. I have also heard the Vice President Biden said on Tuesday, that Senator Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, should be ashamed for suggesting that Biden family sought to profit from their name. Well, here are the facts, I know. And everything I'm saying is corroborated by emails, WhatsApp chats,, agreements, documents and other evidence and American people can judge for themselves. I brought, I guess, for record, three phones that spanned the years 2015 to 2018. These phones have never been held by anybody else besides myself. I was told this past Sunday by somebody who was also involved in this matter that if I went public with this information, it would bury all of us, man. The Bidens including. I have no wish to bury anyone. I've never been political. The few contributions I have made have been the Democrats. But what I am is a patriot, and a veteran, to protect my family name and my business reputation, I need to ensure that the true facts are out there. In late 2015, I was approached by James Gilliar, whom I had known for many years, about joining him in a deal which he said would involve the Chinese state-owned enterprise, CFC China, energy, and what he called one of the most prominent families in the United States. I was informed first by Gilliar, and then by Hunter Biden, and by Rob Walker, who was working with the Bidens that the Bidens wanted to form a new entity with CFC, which was to invest in infrastructure, real estate, and technology in the U.S. and around the world. And the entity would initially be capitalized with $10 million, and then grow to billions of dollars of investment capital. After months of discussion, I agreed to Gilliar and Hunter Biden's request to become CEO of the entity to be called Sinohawk, sino representing the Chinese side, hawk, representing Hunter Biden's brother Beau's favorite animal. And between February and May 2017, we exchanged numerous emails, documents and WhatsApp messages concerning Sinohawk and its potential business. On May 2, 2017, the night before Joe Biden was to appear at the Milken conference, I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden. At my approximately hour long meeting with Joe, that night, we discussed the Biden's history, the Biden's family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level. After that meeting, I had numerous communications with Hunter, Walker, Gilliar and Jim Biden regarding the allocation of the equity ownership of Sinohawk. On May 13, 2017, I received an email concerning allocation of equity, which says 10 percent held by H for the big guy. In that email, there's no question that H stands for Hunter; big guy for his father, Joe Biden; and Jim for Jim Biden. In fact, Hunter often referred to his father as the big guy or my chairman. On numerous occasions, it was made clear to me that Joe Biden's involvement was not to be mentioned in writing, but only face to face. In fact, I was advised by Gilliar and Walker that Hunter and Jim Biden were paranoid about keeping Joe Biden's involvement secret. I also had a disagreement with Hunter about the funds CFC was contributing to Sinohawk. Hunter wanted in 5 million of those funds to go to himself and his family. So he wanted the funds wired directly to an entity affiliated with him. I objected because that was contrary to our written agreements, concerning Sinohawk. He said referring to the chairman, his father, that CFC was really investing in the Biden family that he held the trump card and that he was the one putting his family legacy on the line. He also said to me on May 17, 2017, that CFC wanted to be my partner, to be partnered with the Bidens. During these negotiations, I repeated to Hunter and others that Sinohawk could not be Hunter's personal piggy bank. And I demanded the proper corporate governance, procedures be implemented for capital distributions. Hunter became very upset with me. CFC through July 2017 was assuring me, the funds would be transferred to Sinohawk, but they were never sent to our company. Instead I found out from Senator Johnson's September report that the $5 million was sent in August 2017 to entities affiliated with Hunter. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the senate committee members concerning this matter. And I will be providing to the FBI the devices which contain the evidence corroborating what I've said, so I will not be taking any questions at this time.",

This is a matter that has been investigated over and over. And I seriously wonder if 12 days before a presidential election, where more than half the states are already voting and we have got Rudy Giuliani with one hand coming up with a hard drive and a computer, and this gentleman in the other hand coming up with last-minute cell phones, most of which aren't being sourced, aren't being verified, even Fox News hasn't verified the Giuliani allegations.

To me, it seems like distraction and spectacle when the average American who is tuning in tonight to hear these gentlemen on the stage, want to know not about their families but about the Middle American families who have been impacted by this pandemic and recession. We have got 8 million Americans infected, more than 220,000 American families have lost a loved one. And on that stage tonight, Joe Biden is going to lay out a clear and positive plan for how to get us out of this mess, this pandemic and recession and division that Donald Trump has led us into.

This is a long pattern of Chinese activity and from what these allegations are it sounds consistent. I assume the news media will at least I hope they'll investigate and get to the bottom of it, I also understand there is an FBI investigation, I understand this from just the open source press, that there is an FBI money laundering investigation into these allegations, and so I think we'll get to the bottom of it.

And I can also tell you -- I can't tell you the names of the countries but there are two or three other countries that we are keeping close tabs on and that we're concerned about their efforts to try to influence our elections. One point I do want to make, Bret, is that our elections, if you cast a vote your vote is going to get counted. We're hardened our election infrastructure. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing so. We're working with secretaries of state and lieutenant governors who handle the election state wide across all 50 states. I was just in Iowa and met with the Iowa National Guard and their cyber unit is stood up and these men and women are working with the Iowa secretary of state, for example, to make sure that the elections are free and fair and can't be compromised by adversaries.

We just brought the Beatles on and we're going to prosecute them for the death of Kayla Mueller and the other Americans, Sotloff, Foley, and Kassig. We brought peace to the Middle East through the Abraham accords bringing Bahrain and UAE and diplomatic relations and really an alliance with Israel. We're going to have more -- we're going to have more news on the Abraham accords in the not-too-distant future, as other countries, the momentum builds to have peace in the Middle East. We ended the JCPOA which the Obama-Biden administration had supported and gave $150 billion to the Iranians which they in turn used on proxy wars across the Middle East. On big power competition we put tariffs on China and stood up to China for the first time in 40 years. We've rebuilt the military. We've gotten our allies to pay $400 billion more in NATO defense spending over the next 10 years and to contribute troops to Afghanistan and Iraq and the president is ending our forever wars. So, you know, you look at that record, it's pretty -- it's pretty amazing, it's pretty unbelievable and then you put the trade agreements on top of it, USMCA, the agreements that I was just in Brazil to witness the signings of this past week.

His issue is not with Hunter. It's with Joe Biden saying the opposite of what he portrays on all of this information, and data, and phones, and WhatsApp messages, e-mails and text messages that he has presented. So I'm sure President Trump will bring that up and I'm sure he'll bring up a number of things when it comes to Vice President Joe Biden's record during the Obama administration and whether the country wants to go back again to four or eight years of those kinds of policies or if they want to look at why they elected him in 2016 on very tight margins to put the country in a different path.",

We expect in the next few minutes, it was supposed to happen at 6:00 Central Time, which is right about now, but things typically don't come off exactly on time when it comes to the White House. We are expecting to hear from Tony Bobulinski, who was a business associate of Hunter and Jim Biden. Jim Biden, of course, being Joe Biden's uncle. We have been talking about this all day. There is an email that has been talked about for the last few days in which Bobulinski and Hunter Biden and Jim Biden are discussing this idea of what the percentage cuts will be of the deal of a Chinese energy company and of the cuts that are listed, 10 percent is for the big guy. Tony Bobulinski, in a statement to Fox News earlier today, saying that the big guy is referring to Joe Biden. He also goes on to say that the Chinese were not interested at least in any kind of financial return on investment. They were looking for influence, they were looking for political investment as well. We also understand that Bobulinski when he gives this small statement to the press will say at the end of it and this is the White House press pool that he will be talking to. I will say at the end of it that he is turning all of his electronic devices over to the FBI for examination. Bret, I said earlier on your program, we don't know if the FBI is interested in looking into these devices, but Bobulinski is going to make them available. Interesting to note as well but, Martha, while the Biden campaign has portrayed this as a smear, as Russian disinformation, they have not said that these emails and these text messages that we have seen from Tony Bobulinski are false. And we are not sure exactly what it is that Bobulinski will say other than that he's turning his devices over to the FBI, but we should find out in the next few minutes or so. This really will be throwing a new argument into the debate just a couple hours before it happens here in Nashville. President Trump has said that he wants to bring up Hunter Biden even if the moderator doesn't. Well, this will certainly give him reason to do this. We should say though, again, that Bobulinski's appearance here is being facilitated by the Trump campaign, so this is something that they really are trying to play to their advantage here in the last moments before the debate begins."

      "utterance": "I really don't know a whole lot. These are rather new developments. Things are always changing and developing on this campaign, but what I can assure you tonight is that if the moderator does not bring up these emails that implicate Joe Biden as knowing while he was vice president that his name was being used to profit for his family to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from foreign entities, Donald Trump is going to bring it up because the American people deserve to know. This is an outrageous claim against Joe Biden, as you just heard from John Roberts, the Biden team has not denied the validity of these emails and that these were from Hunter Biden. So the American people deserve answers and they deserve to know quite frankly why Joe Biden has lied about this many, many times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We heard a little bit of a Democratic response from Mayor Pete Buttigieg earlier in the show, Lara, and it basically went something like this, \"If you want to ask questions about making money and families, turn to the Trump family and why don't you ask about a Chinese bank account that's still open, what bank is that at?\" That was the response. How do you respond to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, let's be very clear. When Donald Trump took the office of the presidency, our family got out of international business. In fact, we said we would do no new international business deals. We go so far as to pay the treasury any money that comes in from foreign entities to Trump properties. That is not something we are required to do, but we do it because we don't even want the faintest hint of impropriety. Donald Trump was a businessman, don't forget, before he became president of the United States, and it's just completely legitimate that he was obviously looking around the world for business deals and places to invest. It's very different than the Biden family, who got into international business after Joe Biden became vice president of the United States. Those are two very, very different things and I think people are starting to pick up on that and very clearly see that Joe Biden could possibly have been compromised by foreign entities while he was vice president of the United States. And should he even be running as president of the United States, if these claims are true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But clearly the parry to that is - and these are very legitimate questions, we've been discussing it for the past several days and we are waiting for Tony Bobulinski, we are going to see what he has to say about all of this. But if the answer, if the Joe Biden retort is going to be \"why do you have a Chinese bank account?\", which they are saying is a secret bank account, what's going to be the answer to that? Is there an open Chinese bank account and why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know all of the president's business dealings, but this was opened up long before he ever thought about running for president of the United States, and I think his attorney has spoken to that. So look, it was legitimate from the beginning, it continues to be legitimate. This president has stood up against China, very, very strongly and thank goodness he has because now we have new trade deals that have been inked and are on the horizon. We know that from the onset of coronavirus, this president was always standing up strong against China. We know he stopped travel coming to the United States immediately from China at the onset of coronavirus. It's very different than I think what we would have seen out of Joe Biden and it does beg the question, if he is put up against China, if he is put up against Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, where his family has seen very lucrative business dealings, how would he react?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Lara, what about the tone and tenor for tonight, is it going to be different from the president from debate one? There were some concerns from inside and outside of the campaign, supporters, who said that maybe his style in the first debate turned off some suburban women, in particular."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, look, this president is a fighter and I think it's very hard to sit there and not respond whenever your opponent, when Joe Biden is continuing to lie about the things that this president has achieved for the American people, to lie about his policies. He absolutely felt the need to respond to those things. Now we know there is a mute button tonight so it will be a little bit different, but I can assure you that if there's any question about the things that Joe Biden says about the president, about his policies, about what he's done for the American people, the president will respond. And look, he is a fighter and that is the reason that we have seen, I think, such success under President Donald Trump. It takes a fighter to do so many of the things that we've seen, to get this economy to the best in the world, as we know has happened under this president. The low unemployment numbers, high stock market numbers, renegotiating bad trade deals, rebuilding our military, doing things like inking these historic peace agreements in the Middle East. It takes a fighter to get those things done and I think the American people know that about the president."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Because we know that last time around, there wasn't a lot of that. And he said recently, this is my preparation just back and forth with the press every day, was it that kind of preparation again this time or was it different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, he does prepare. I mean, he has a team of people, we have a great campaign team that does prepare with him. But look, he's always been a person that doesn't feel like he needs the excessive preparation that Joe Biden needs, because we now know Joe Biden we haven't seen since Sunday. He has been at home resting, he has been at home getting ready for this debate. It's a little concerning when you think about someone running for president of the United States who doesn't have the stamina to be out on the campaign trail like we've seen the president doing and then have the ability to come to a debate. It's a 24/7 job when you are president of the United States. But look, this president has been preparing, he always does. It might not be the same way Joe Biden does by staying at home, but I can assure you he is prepared for this evening."

      "speaker": "TONY BOBULINSKI, CEO, SINOHAWK HOLDINGS",
      "utterance": "--involved in various successful businesses, both in this country and abroad. I'm making the statement to set the record straight about the involvement of the Biden family, Vice President Biden, his brother Jim Biden, and his son hunter Biden. In dealings with the Chinese. I've heard Joe Biden say that he's never discussed business with Hunter. That is false. I have first hand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden. I have also heard the Vice President Biden said on Tuesday, that Senator Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, should be ashamed for suggesting that Biden family sought to profit from their name. Well, here are the facts, I know. And everything I'm saying is corroborated by emails, WhatsApp chats,, agreements, documents and other evidence and American people can judge for themselves. I brought, I guess, for record, three phones that spanned the years 2015 to 2018. These phones have never been held by anybody else besides myself. I was told this past Sunday by somebody who was also involved in this matter that if I went public with this information, it would bury all of us, man. The Bidens including. I have no wish to bury anyone. I've never been political. The few contributions I have made have been the Democrats. But what I am is a patriot, and a veteran, to protect my family name and my business reputation, I need to ensure that the true facts are out there. In late 2015, I was approached by James Gilliar, whom I had known for many years, about joining him in a deal which he said would involve the Chinese state-owned enterprise, CFC China, energy, and what he called one of the most prominent families in the United States. I was informed first by Gilliar, and then by Hunter Biden, and by Rob Walker, who was working with the Bidens that the Bidens wanted to form a new entity with CFC, which was to invest in infrastructure, real estate, and technology in the U.S. and around the world. And the entity would initially be capitalized with $10 million, and then grow to billions of dollars of investment capital. After months of discussion, I agreed to Gilliar and Hunter Biden's request to become CEO of the entity to be called Sinohawk, sino representing the Chinese side, hawk, representing Hunter Biden's brother Beau's favorite animal. And between February and May 2017, we exchanged numerous emails, documents and WhatsApp messages concerning Sinohawk and its potential business. On May 2, 2017, the night before Joe Biden was to appear at the Milken conference, I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden. At my approximately hour long meeting with Joe, that night, we discussed the Biden's history, the Biden's family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level. After that meeting, I had numerous communications with Hunter, Walker, Gilliar and Jim Biden regarding the allocation of the equity ownership of Sinohawk. On May 13, 2017, I received an email concerning allocation of equity, which says 10 percent held by H for the big guy. In that email, there's no question that H stands for Hunter; big guy for his father, Joe Biden; and Jim for Jim Biden. In fact, Hunter often referred to his father as the big guy or my chairman. On numerous occasions, it was made clear to me that Joe Biden's involvement was not to be mentioned in writing, but only face to face. In fact, I was advised by Gilliar and Walker that Hunter and Jim Biden were paranoid about keeping Joe Biden's involvement secret. I also had a disagreement with Hunter about the funds CFC was contributing to Sinohawk. Hunter wanted in 5 million of those funds to go to himself and his family. So he wanted the funds wired directly to an entity affiliated with him. I objected because that was contrary to our written agreements, concerning Sinohawk. He said referring to the chairman, his father, that CFC was really investing in the Biden family that he held the trump card and that he was the one putting his family legacy on the line. He also said to me on May 17, 2017, that CFC wanted to be my partner, to be partnered with the Bidens. During these negotiations, I repeated to Hunter and others that Sinohawk could not be Hunter's personal piggy bank. And I demanded the proper corporate governance, procedures be implemented for capital distributions. Hunter became very upset with me. CFC through July 2017 was assuring me, the funds would be transferred to Sinohawk, but they were never sent to our company. Instead I found out from Senator Johnson's September report that the $5 million was sent in August 2017 to entities affiliated with Hunter. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the senate committee members concerning this matter. And I will be providing to the FBI the devices which contain the evidence corroborating what I've said, so I will not be taking any questions at this time."

And he says that it was supposed to go into Sinohawk into their shared entity, but it went into a fund that was controlled by Hunter Biden. He says he was concerned that that fund was going to become a piggy bank for Hunter Biden and he was not happy with that. So he found out about that in September from Ron Johnson as part of their investigation, which may be the answer to the question \"Why are we just hearing from Tony Bobulinski and what forced him to come out with more of this story?\""

      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Well, for your viewers who didn't hear that statement, the former Vice President Joe Biden said that \"We all know his finances and his taxes\". Joe Biden has been completely transparent with the American people, Donald Trump has not. We don't know the full extent of President Trump's holdings, his tax liability, the idea that perhaps he has a secret account in China and paid more to China in income taxes than he did to the United States was one of the things pointed out by the Biden campaign. This is a matter that has been investigated over and over. And I seriously wonder if 12 days before a presidential election, where more than half the states are already voting and we have got Rudy Giuliani with one hand coming up with a hard drive and a computer, and this gentleman in the other hand coming up with last-minute cell phones, most of which aren't being sourced, aren't being verified, even Fox News hasn't verified the Giuliani allegations. I frankly have to ask, is this seriously what we are going to do? To me, it seems like distraction and spectacle when the average American who is tuning in tonight to hear these gentlemen on the stage, want to know not about their families but about the Middle American families who have been impacted by this pandemic and recession. We have got 8 million Americans infected, more than 220,000 American families have lost a loved one. And on that stage tonight, Joe Biden is going to lay out a clear and positive plan for how to get us out of this mess, this pandemic and recession and division that Donald Trump has led us into. That's what I think is going to matter to your viewers and the American people about tonight's debate."

But I frankly think what matters is that Joe Biden is a man of compassion and character who I've known for 30 years and who is capable of leading our country forward with a positive vision for how to bring us together and get us out of this pandemic and recession. That's what I think is going to decide the election. And I frankly think this last-minute press conference smacks of desperation."

As you well know, there's no precedent in American history for the senate voting on a Supreme Court nominee 12 days before a presidential election, where a majority of states are already voting. This is something that we did, the senate judiciary Democrats, just to show that we don't accept the legitimacy of this timing and this process. I did participate in questioning Judge Barrett because I thought it was important for the American people to hear, based on her writings as a judge and as a law professor, about her views and how she is to the right of Justice Scalia and what the consequences may be of her being put on the court."

      "speaker": "SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX)",
      "utterance": "I thought that press conference was remarkable and it obviously raises serious questions about whether Joe Biden has personally enriched himself, whether he's been paid millions from communist China. The allegation is that he had a secret share potentially in this business deal that Hunter Biden held for him, I think those questions need to be answered and they need to be answered seriously. And two things strike me. Number one, it's worth underscoring what makes this story significant is not Hunter Biden. Hunter by all accounts has led a troubled life. But it is Joe Biden and the potential of Joe Biden's personal corruption that is being alleged here. Secondly, and I just checked a minute to go, as I understand it, Fox News is the only network that actually covered that press conference. CNN didn't cover it, MSNBC didn't cover it, ABC, CBS, NBC, none of them covered it. And it's part of a pattern. It's part of a pattern we saw last week when the New York Post broke the story and big tech, Twitter and Facebook censored it and essentially determined that the American people could not even hear the facts. And I think the degree to which the media and big tech are shilling for Joe Biden are protecting him, are covering him up, not even asking these questions I think is really shameful."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "It clearly is drafted carefully saying he didn't own stock -- well, the allegation I just heard which was news to me tonight was that Hunter Biden was holding the percentage for his dad. Now that is, if you're essentially, you know, using a strawman then the question is -- is Joe Biden, was he personally enriching himself from communist China? And as far as I can tell, Joe Biden hasn't answered that question, I haven't seen anyone ask him that question. I mean, what was stunning, the day the story broke in the New York Post, ABC hosted a town hall with Joe Biden and they didn't even ask him the question. They're not, the media is not even pretending to do their job and I think that's really dangerous, particularly when you combine it with big tech censorship where what is at stake in the selection is really fundamental about whether we are going to preserve our freedoms and our constitutional liberties."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",

I hope tonight what the president does is lays out competing visions for America and makes clear that what President Trump and Republicans are looking to do is reopen the economy, let small businesses reopen, let people go back to work, let them provide for their families. And what Joe Biden and the Democrats are proposing and what the Democratic governors are implementing is shutdowns that are destroying millions of small businesses. You know, I listened to your interview with Chris Coons, and I like Chris, I served with him on judiciary and he talked about how he wished Congress was doing something for COVID relief, and I had to admit I kind of felt nervous that lightning was going to strike him. Because he and every other Senate Democrat yesterday filibustered a $500 billion COVID relief plan and they don't get to filibuster emergency COVID relief to help small businesses reopen to help parents get their kids back in school. And then to go on TV and complain that nothing is passing. They are the ones blocking it. I mean, it really, and again, the media doesn't report on a word of it and it's really not doing the job journalists are supposed to be doing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think and I don't know all the facts and all the allegations that are taking place, they seem to be bubbling up pretty fast and furiously regarding Hunter Biden and the former vice president while the former vice president was in office. But what is consistent is this sort of behavior and what the Chinese have done for many, many years with American politicians and elites is offering them financial incentives, offering them business incentives, trying to influence mayors or congressmen or elected officials by providing Chinese businesses to their districts and using that to gain influence over the United States. This is a long pattern of Chinese activity and from what these allegations are it sounds consistent. I assume the news media will at least I hope they'll investigate and get to the bottom of it, I also understand there is an FBI investigation, I understand this from just the open source press, that there is an FBI money laundering investigation into these allegations, and so I think we'll get to the bottom of it. But it's entirely consistent with how China has used its influence whether money or blackmail or fawning press or that sort of thing to influence American politicians, and it's something we have to be very concerned about."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And we'll continue to follow it here. I want to ask about the interference in the election and we had the director of national intelligence, the FBI director talk about Russia and Iran. Are there other countries as well doing that? Which one is posing the biggest problem tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "There are. I think, look, the Iranians are the most recent to have engaged in this activity that was exposed by Director Wray and Director Ratcliffe and I commend them and their teams and our intelligence services for uncovering it, uncovering it quickly. And then for the administration coming forward and being transparent because we think transparency is the best deterrent to this sort of activity in the future. And so, the Iranians understand that we are very unhappy with this and there will be consequences for Iran as a result of it. But it's also Russia, it's China, as Attorney General Barr said recently China, you know, it attempts to influence American politicians, the American political system and our elections, it's an order of magnitude higher than what the Russians or the Iranians have done. And I can also tell you -- I can't tell you the names of the countries but there are two or three other countries that we are keeping close tabs on and that we're concerned about their efforts to try to influence our elections. One point I do want to make, Bret, is that our elections, if you cast a vote your vote is going to get counted. We're hardened our election infrastructure. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing so. We're working with secretaries of state and lieutenant governors who handle the election state wide across all 50 states. I was just in Iowa and met with the Iowa National Guard and their cyber unit is stood up and these men and women are working with the Iowa secretary of state, for example, to make sure that the elections are free and fair and can't be compromised by adversaries. So, we are confident in what we can do to protect the American people and protect our elections but it's concerning when we see foreign actors trying to get involved to either influence Americans or to interfere with the actual election day activities of our citizens."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president should just be asked to address the accomplishments, he's done more in the past three and a half years than most presidents have done in two terms. I mean, we brought peace to the Middle East, we've defeated the ISIS caliphate, we brought justice to Baghdadi. We just brought the Beatles on and we're going to prosecute them for the death of Kayla Mueller and the other Americans, Sotloff, Foley, and Kassig. We brought peace to the Middle East through the Abraham accords bringing Bahrain and UAE and diplomatic relations and really an alliance with Israel. We're going to have more -- we're going to have more news on the Abraham accords in the not-too-distant future, as other countries, the momentum builds to have peace in the Middle East. We ended the JCPOA which the Obama-Biden administration had supported and gave $150 billion to the Iranians which they in turn used on proxy wars across the Middle East. On big power competition we put tariffs on China and stood up to China for the first time in 40 years. We've rebuilt the military. We've gotten our allies to pay $400 billion more in NATO defense spending over the next 10 years and to contribute troops to Afghanistan and Iraq and the president is ending our forever wars. So, you know, you look at that record, it's pretty -- it's pretty amazing, it's pretty unbelievable and then you put the trade agreements on top of it, USMCA, the agreements that I was just in Brazil to witness the signings of this past week. It's really a tremendous record and I hope the president gets a chance to talk about it and compare it to what the Obama-Biden administration did, and what Joe Biden's position were. It's a pretty devastating comparison when you look at what the president has done for this country over the past four years."

But I have no doubt that President Trump will come in tonight and be very tough on Joe Biden and try to pin him against the wall on a number if issues that he finds to be important including again painting him as a corrupt politician. I think we saw the October surprise from the Trump campaign tonight when you had Tony Bobulinski, a former Hunter Biden business associate coming out and not taking issue with Hunter Biden, but taking issue with Joe Biden saying that he never spoke about his business dealings with Hunter Biden, that he wasn't involved with these things. His issue is not with Hunter. It's with Joe Biden saying the opposite of what he portrays on all of this information, and data, and phones, and WhatsApp messages, e-mails and text messages that he has presented.
