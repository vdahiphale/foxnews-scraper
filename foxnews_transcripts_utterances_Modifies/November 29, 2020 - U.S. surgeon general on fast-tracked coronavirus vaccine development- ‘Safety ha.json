But I also want people to know there's hope. We are mere weeks away from starting to vaccinate the vulnerable and we can significantly protect people who are at risk for this virus. So hang on just a little bit longer, understand that the science out there has never been stronger to support the wearing of masks. You shouldn't have to have a mandate to do the right thing to protect your neighbor, to keep schools open.

But what I want people to know is moving forward, again, the science has never been stronger in terms of what we can do -- simple, powerful measures. And wearing a mask is an instrument of freedom. It actually will let my kids go to school, it will protect my mother -- and you and I talked about this before the interview. My mother is in the hospital right now. I want people to understand that if cases and hospitalizations continue to go up, not only will it hurt our ability to care for COVID patients, but if someone is having a baby, they may not be able to get a bed. If someone is having a heart attack or potential stroke like my mother, they may not be able to get a bed.

We now know that over 50 percent of people according to the CDC who are spreading this virus in the community look and feel fine. That's why we want you to know that household gatherings, they've been super-spreader events. They've been opportunities that have led to viral spread, and it's why we need everyone to continue to be cautious. That's why we need you to think about what you did over the holidays.

And within 28 to 48 hours after submitting their EUA, we from a federal perspective have promised and have set everything up so that we can quickly review those EUAs and hopefully start sending out vaccines again within 24 to 48 hours. Our plan is to start by protecting the vulnerable. Older people, particularly in long-term care facilities, we want to immunize for impact with the recognition that we will have 40 million doses of the vaccine by the end of this year and that won't be enough for the whole country.

I want people to understand, safety has not been compromised. Efficacy has not been compromised. What we've done is really thrown a lot of money at this problem to lower the risk for companies and we've moved them to the front of the line in terms of evaluation so their applications are sitting on a desk. We decreased the amount of time that is wasted in the process without compromising safety or review or efficacy and at 90 to 95 percent -- or 90 to 95 percent efficacy, what I would hate is if we had a vaccine that could end this pandemic and people actually didn't get it, wouldn't end this pandemic. This vaccine will have more people who have been tested than any other vaccine in history at the point of authorization. About 5,000 people are normally enrolled in vaccine trials. These trials have 30,000 to 60,000 people. So I feel confident it's safe. I will get a vaccine when they tell me I can get a vaccine.",

During the last three weeks since we've had this most recent spike, the people of Arkansas are taking this extraordinarily seriously. I think we had a very subdued Thanksgiving. We're very thankful but at the same time, people understand the risk of large gatherings and the importance of social distancing. We're trying to take the approach that we want to make sure that our guidelines are followed, we've increased our enforcement efforts, we've worked with our hospitals to make sure that we have space there. We're not trying to shut down businesses that are doing a good job, we still have some limitations in spacing in our restaurants and gyms, those are important to be enforced.

I applaud President Trump for initiating that transition and making sure that that is happening. The worst thing that could happen is that we do not have a smooth hand-off when it comes to our vaccine distribution plans, our Warp Speed and that takes that transition to start now, and I'm grateful that it has. But I do think whenever you look at the elections, it would be good after the fact that we have a bipartisan review as to what's best practices because this is going to come up again as to how handle absentee votes, what's the best way to protect the integrity of those votes to give people confidence. And that's not to say everything was fraudulent in this election, it just says that we need to learn from each other, all the 50 states, into what we have done and how we can do it better.

The idea that we would want to return to that. You know, third quarter economic growth was record-breaking, more than 30 percent. The fourth quarter is off to a very good start. You see optimism among investors in the stock market. Why we are even talking about a shutdown I think is just ridiculous. And we -- you're right about the fatigue as well among people -- COVID fatigue, as they call it, and we saw more holiday travel than I think a lot of people were expecting and that reflects the COVID fatigue. But it also, I think, reflects the fact that people see these elected officials not following their own public health edicts.

We know better now how to treat it. We've got a vaccine around the corner. Trust the American people to make those same decisions.

I was -- you know, I'm disappointed when I hear him say, as we saw in that clip, just this week that he has evidence of massive fraud. We have not seen any evidence of massive fraud or fraud even at a level that would change significant numbers of votes and impact the outcome of the election. But he continues to perpetrate this notion and I think it particularly takes hold with his base and the Republican Party. And as you can see from what Ronna McDaniel was having to deal with there, it could impact what happens in Georgia. Now, the president has indicated this week that he might go down to Georgia to campaign, but again, how does he speak to this idea that he has driven so deeply into the Republican mind that there's something wrong with the voting system, with the very practice of democracy in our country and in Georgia -- I think it's a big problem for the Republicans now.",

And -- and -- and even if they're not Trump appointed judges, other Republican appointed judges are joining those decisions. So Trump isn't just losing these court cases, he's losing them quite thoroughly. In each case, he isn't coming close to winning over these judges. So at this point it remains a longshot. I think he -- a much better use of his time would be to go down to Georgia and -- and tell people what is in the balance here if -- if -- if Democrats control both the House and the Senate and the presidency.

It is a different world in Washington depending on who wins these two seats in Georgia. You'd assume that Republicans would be favored because Republicans hold every statewide office in Georgia and yet that's not the case. These are very competitive elections in part because of some legal problems that -- some ethics investigations that the two Republican incumbents are facing on stock trade. This is a big deal.

And right before Thanksgiving, we actually saw cases start to plateau in many states that have been aggressively mitigating and as I mentioned, there are steps you can take right now. But I also want people to know there's hope. We are mere weeks away from starting to vaccinate the vulnerable and we can significantly protect people who are at risk for this virus. So hang on just a little bit longer, understand that the science out there has never been stronger to support the wearing of masks. You shouldn't have to have a mandate to do the right thing to protect your neighbor, to keep schools open. Make sure you're watching your distance and make sure, again, if you've been in the gathering of more than ten people without your mask on over the last several days, please get tested in the next three to five days."

I wish that again this hadn't been superimposed on top of an election. I wish that we had been able to come together as a nation and really talk about the science instead of the politics, and that's on all sides. That's all around. But what I want people to know is moving forward, again, the science has never been stronger in terms of what we can do -- simple, powerful measures. And wearing a mask is an instrument of freedom. It actually will let my kids go to school, it will protect my mother -- and you and I talked about this before the interview. My mother is in the hospital right now. I want people to understand that if cases and hospitalizations continue to go up, not only will it hurt our ability to care for COVID patients, but if someone is having a baby, they may not be able to get a bed. If someone is having a heart attack or potential stroke like my mother, they may not be able to get a bed. Your actions have consequences and if you do the right thing, then it will bridge us to a vaccine. So hopeful, so hopeful that we can get to that vaccine with as few lives lost as possible."

    {
      "speaker": "ADAMS",

That means people spreading it who look fine, who feel fine, who don't have a fever. We now know that over 50 percent of people according to the CDC who are spreading this virus in the community look and feel fine. That's why we want you to know that household gatherings, they've been super-spreader events. They've been opportunities that have led to viral spread, and it's why we need everyone to continue to be cautious. That's why we need you to think about what you did over the holidays. If you traveled, if you -- if you were in a gathering with a mask off, with people outside of your household, you can take steps now to prevent you being in asymptomatic spreader and let turning into community spread. Still a chance for us to flatten this curve, get to a vaccine."

I talked to many family members who are trying to get the fast test in order to go feel safe at Thanksgiving dinner and it was three to five hours wait. It was -- maybe you didn't get the fast test. It was two to three days. Hasn't that been a vulnerability in how we as a country have dealt with this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly believe testing has been a challenge, but I want people to know that we are now over 160 million tests. We've tested more than anyone else in the world. I don't want to say that that's a reason to pat us on the back but I want people to know testing is available. And one of the things we are trying to help people understand, particularly public health officials, is that you can use these new antigen tests which return results in 15, 20 minutes. They are just as effective at practically understanding who can spread the virus as the PCR test. And so, we want them to aggressively use these tests so that people can get a quick answer and they know whether or not to isolate or to quarantine."

That's the plan for Moderna. And within 28 to 48 hours after submitting their EUA, we from a federal perspective have promised and have set everything up so that we can quickly review those EUAs and hopefully start sending out vaccines again within 24 to 48 hours. Our plan is to start by protecting the vulnerable. Older people, particularly in long-term care facilities, we want to immunize for impact with the recognition that we will have 40 million doses of the vaccine by the end of this year and that won't be enough for the whole country. If you're part of the public, I want you to understand it will probably be end of first quarter, beginning of second quarter next year before you can get a vaccine, but you can go to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=VkbVq-YonEbBIwUJaIvKV3SgloMTL-0dr1cdxo8ZLD8&m=aUkg9M4alA2UUeBFnnXws_zhtUcP1j6fwa18H_8u8LE&s=8ZS1f8NAuLuR9TG26AlM9MuiiWpuYIImSnhXpKmi0wA&e= , sign up for a study and you could be -- you could get a vaccine in just a few days to weeks if you sign up for a study and understand that our strategy that we are telling governors and states is to think about the vulnerable. If we protect them, then we can slow the spread of this disease and lower loss of life until everyone can get a vaccine, again end of first quarter into second quarter next year."

I'm a doctor and when they tell me I can get a vaccine, I will be first in line to get a vaccine because that's how safe I think this vaccine will be. I want people to understand, safety has not been compromised. Efficacy has not been compromised. What we've done is really thrown a lot of money at this problem to lower the risk for companies and we've moved them to the front of the line in terms of evaluation so their applications are sitting on a desk. We decreased the amount of time that is wasted in the process without compromising safety or review or efficacy and at 90 to 95 percent -- or 90 to 95 percent efficacy, what I would hate is if we had a vaccine that could end this pandemic and people actually didn't get it, wouldn't end this pandemic. This vaccine will have more people who have been tested than any other vaccine in history at the point of authorization. About 5,000 people are normally enrolled in vaccine trials. These trials have 30,000 to 60,000 people. So I feel confident it's safe. I will get a vaccine when they tell me I can get a vaccine."

Please tell him I said thank you. His wife and I have been working on maternal health, another thing that we have seen people really not pay attention to during this pandemic. Seven hundred women died during a time of child -- around the time of childbirth every year. Two-thirds are preventable and we'll be having a call to action coming out of the next few days.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the hospitalizations is the great concern and that is a record number of COVID patients that we've had hospitalized, it hopefully will stabilize. We have a hospital group that's working with me very closely to make sure that we continue to have adequate hospital space for both COVID patients, which is really a minority of those that are in the hospital as well as caring for all the other healthcare needs that we have. During the last three weeks since we've had this most recent spike, the people of Arkansas are taking this extraordinarily seriously. I think we had a very subdued Thanksgiving. We're very thankful but at the same time, people understand the risk of large gatherings and the importance of social distancing. We're trying to take the approach that we want to make sure that our guidelines are followed, we've increased our enforcement efforts, we've worked with our hospitals to make sure that we have space there. We're not trying to shut down businesses that are doing a good job, we still have some limitations in spacing in our restaurants and gyms, those are important to be enforced. But we realize that you can really increase problems across the board if you start shutting down businesses, putting people unemployed as we go into the Christmas season."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, in terms of our restaurants, our regulated industries, we have inspections, we're enforcing the mask mandate, the spacing requirements as well. In terms of the general population, we have to rely upon our local law enforcement and that's a gap because there's a lot of hesitancy about going out and arresting someone for not having a mask on. And so there's a warning that's given. We're working with our municipal officials to increase that education part of it and the compliance efforts on the mask. Everybody knows what needs to be done and we have that mandate in Arkansas, the vast majority are following that. We've put in millions of dollars into an ad campaign, stressing the science behind -- the reason we need to do that. I think that's the right approach but we're always looking  for more ways to strengthen that compliance and make it better."

      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if you ever say never. But that's the last thing that we want to do and particularly shutting down a business that has worked hard for the last eight months to comply with public health directive and they have safe positions within their restaurant and they have no cases coming out of it. And so, that to me to is just fundamentally wrong to say you're out of business now and that your workers are unemployed particularly whenever there's not any Cares Act relief package anymore. That money has been allocated, we've tried to help our small businesses but we're not able to compensate someone for their loss of a job, for their loss of an income and shutting down a business. So we want to be smart about it. And so we did put 11:00 pm curfew on bars and restaurants trying to break up the late night crowds but at the same time, we don't want to overly restrict our businesses that are doing a good job out there because that just makes the problem worse."

They had him stay over at a friend's house and the child was positive within days because of the friend. And so the important thing is that the school is a safe environment, we have the option to go virtual and to pivot there based upon local decisions and local cases. But to say carte blanche, we're going to close our schools, we're not going to have the in-classroom instruction as an option would really have some adverse consequences that we don't need and are not necessary. And so we want to be able to keep those open with the option to pivot to virtual based upon local circumstances but we want to minimize that effort when we can. Going to school is very important. On the higher education side, as our students come back we want them to get tested. We want them to -- if they've been in a hot zone or they've been among people that are not protected to make sure they isolate or they get tested as they come back."

And so that's why the General Service Administration recognized Vice President Biden as president elect. He is president elect, we need to work on that transition. I applaud President Trump for initiating that transition and making sure that that is happening. The worst thing that could happen is that we do not have a smooth hand-off when it comes to our vaccine distribution plans, our Warp Speed and that takes that transition to start now, and I'm grateful that it has. But I do think whenever you look at the elections, it would be good after the fact that we have a bipartisan review as to what's best practices because this is going to come up again as to how handle absentee votes, what's the best way to protect the integrity of those votes to give people confidence. And that's not to say everything was fraudulent in this election, it just says that we need to learn from each other, all the 50 states, into what we have done and how we can do it better.

We expect him to be sworn in in January, even though there's going to be some continued reviews which I respect.

But for the next two or three months, we're in -- we're in the fight of our lives. There's a lot of private setting transmission going on. So where we can strategically surgically get at transmission, we do that. So we closed our restaurants indoors at 10:00. We lowered indoor limits to ten persons. We beg people to have a somber, respectful, small Thanksgiving. And I want to give a shout out to New Jerseyans because I think overwhelmingly that's what happened. But there's a lot of fatigue out there, Bret. There's a lot of private transmission. The weather is cold, so folks are doing what they were doing three months ago outside, they're doing it inside, and that -- that cocktail, when you add that -- when you add to that the holiday season, we're in -- we're in for a rough ride here."

I'll tell you what would really make a difference here, a big federal stimulus sooner than later with a lifeline to small businesses, restaurants, folks who are unemployed. That would be a game changer. Not just in their lives and in their prospects, but it gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of dealing with the virus. So it's on the table in terms of a shutdown.

If you're unemployed since the spring, if you've got a restaurant or a small business or if you're like we are with a state budget or a local budget and you're trying to employ as many frontline workers as possible, my view is, let's not argue on the margins.

I don't think that's where the transmission is coming from, although we've reduced outdoor gathering limits effective tomorrow. I think most of this, Bret, is on the inside. And I do think it's folks letting their hair down. And they're fatigued. Who the heck could blame them? New Jersians did the unthinkable in the spring, we crushed a curve that was overwhelming. I have every confidence we can do it again. But I would just beg folks, particularly in the holiday season, particularly before we get to a vaccine, don't let your hair down, keep your guard up and remember, in particular, intergenerational spread from an asymptomatic, healthy young person to grandma and grandpa, that is our biggest fear."

In addition to Secretary Azar, you've got the likes of Tony Fauci, General Gus Perna, New Jersey's own, whose overseeing the distribution. Stephen Hahn, others. I also give the private sector players a lot of credit and I give decades of investment in public health a lot of credit. Having said that, we're not in the end zone yet. This is incredibly complex. I'm gratified that at long last the GSA has allowed both teams to begin to coordinate. I bemoaned that it took as long as it did, but they are now. But there's a lot of complexity ahead of us in distribution, federal support. This is going to be a very historic path that we're on. Again, I give them credit for the progress we've made, but we've got a distance yet to travel and the more we could be coordinated -- I think the other piece, Bret, is the more the president-elect and the president are speaking from the same playbook, the more confidence folks will have in taking that vaccine.

Susan, we were talking with the governors there about the success of Operation Warp Speed. The logistics of figuring out how to get these vaccines to various places and how to deal with it is still, as Governor Murphy said, a big hurdle. SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": That's right. And you have two separate problems. You have to decide who gets it first. There will be a lot of people very interested in being in the first group or the second group to get the vaccine. You also have to convince people who are reluctant to take it, which is a separate problem. But as I think Governor Murphy said, this is one issue on which President-elect Biden and President Trump agree, that the vaccine is safe, that it's been safely developed.

There is this pandemic fatigue out there, especially when it comes to businesses. JASON RILEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure, Bret. I think talk of a shutdown is just crazy talk at this point. I mean we lost more than 20 million jobs during the first shutdown. We saw depression era unemployment rates. The idea that we would want to return to that. You know, third quarter economic growth was record-breaking, more than 30 percent. The fourth quarter is off to a very good start. You see optimism among investors in the stock market. Why we are even talking about a shutdown I think is just ridiculous. And we -- you're right about the fatigue as well among people -- COVID fatigue, as they call it, and we saw more holiday travel than I think a lot of people were expecting and that reflects the COVID fatigue. But it also, I think, reflects the fact that people see these elected officials not following their own public health edicts. And people say to themselves, well, you know, I look at Governor Newsom out in California, I look at Andrew Cuomo in New York, I look at the -- the mayor of Denver and they don't seem to be following what they're telling us to do. I -- you know, I think all those elected officials take this seriously. They're just weighing the risks and taking precautions and saying, you know, if I get it, I'll be OK. We know better now how to treat it. We've got a vaccine around the corner. Trust the American people to make those same decisions. And, of course, the Supreme Court has now told us that just because there's a pandemic doesn't mean our civil liberties can be -- can be suspended. So I think people are taking that in mind too."

And I think that people there -- you know, the reason it was such a close decision, 5-4, is because, you know, you have to take into consideration, we're in the middle of a public health crisis. So, you know, the -- it becomes a matter of weighing one side versus the other. I mean we clearly have a right to gather in terms of religious practices.

We had the -- we had President-elect Biden appoint new members to his coronavirus task force and you see the two groups meeting together on this huge logistical challenge. You know, this is really going to be like on a war footing to disturb these millions of vaccines, some of them requiring very special handling in these super cool temperatures and disturbing them across the country as quickly as -- as possible.

We're back with our panel now. Juan, these legal challenges are continuing. One by one we have not seen judges, you know, signoff or buy into the arguments made by the Trump legal team, but they are continuing. Meantime, you have this upcoming runoff in Georgia. Two Senate seats that really hangs in the balance, the control of the U.S. Senate. And there is a concern among some that because of the efforts to call the election a fraud or completely stolen, that's going to hurt Republicans getting to the polls down here. Here is Ronna McDaniel, the RNC chair, taking questions from people in which they're saying, why should we vote, it's already done. Take a listen."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. And it starts here in Washington, Bret. I mean, clearly, this is the message that President Trump has been putting out, that you shouldn't have faith in the -- in the voting system, that it's corrupt somehow or that there was massive fraud. I was -- you know, I'm disappointed when I hear him say, as we saw in that clip, just this week that he has evidence of massive fraud. We have not seen any evidence of massive fraud or fraud even at a level that would change significant numbers of votes and impact the outcome of the election. But he continues to perpetrate this notion and I think it particularly takes hold with his base and the Republican Party. And as you can see from what Ronna McDaniel was having to deal with there, it could impact what happens in Georgia. Now, the president has indicated this week that he might go down to Georgia to campaign, but again, how does he speak to this idea that he has driven so deeply into the Republican mind that there's something wrong with the voting system, with the very practice of democracy in our country and in Georgia -- I think it's a big problem for the Republicans now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Jason, on that legal front, the hope, according to the Trump legal team, is that this goes all the way to the Supreme Court. They also hope the state legislatures step in and say they don't think that this election was fair, therefore the electors can't be seated. There's a bill in Pennsylvania moving forward earlier this week to do just that. It seems like a long shot in the biggest of terms, but where do you think this stands?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a very big long shot, Bret. I think what you have to keep in mind is, in some of these states, where Trump has asked for a recount, it's turned out that he lost by even more than we originally thought. And in other states you have Trump-appointed judges writing decisions that -- that -- that say that these claims have no validity. And -- and -- and even if they're not Trump appointed judges, other Republican appointed judges are joining those decisions. So Trump isn't just losing these court cases, he's losing them quite thoroughly. In each case, he isn't coming close to winning over these judges. So at this point it remains a longshot. I think he -- a much better use of his time would be to go down to Georgia and -- and tell people what is in the balance here if -- if -- if Democrats control both the House and the Senate and the presidency. I think that would be the best thing he could do for the country right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And the question is, Susan, whether that helps in Georgia, get out the vote, because that is what Republicans are most concerned about. Should they lose control of the U.S. Senate, it's a different ball game for an administration that would control all three branches."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Oh, no kidding. A Senate with 50 Republicans is very different from a Senate with 51 Republicans. It makes all the difference for Republicans' ability to shape who President-elect Biden can appoint two key jobs, what kind of relief package for coronavirus might finally get through the Congress, whether major proposals that we've seen pass the House and get stalled in the Senate might have a chance of going through. It is a different world in Washington depending on who wins these two seats in Georgia. You'd assume that Republicans would be favored because Republicans hold every statewide office in Georgia and yet that's not the case. These are very competitive elections in part because of some legal problems that -- some ethics investigations that the two Republican incumbents are facing on stock trade. This is a big deal. So you can tell how concerned Republicans are, although you don't really see that reflected as a top priority at the moment I think of President Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I said three branches there, I met the two chambers in Congress and the administration and the White House, if that happened in control. Finally, Juan, here is the president-elect talking to Lester Holt about what this process has been like as far as his transition."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "What do you think his choices have said so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, remember, I think many people see him as having campaigned, Bret, to bring government back to boring and normal. And I think so far that's what we've seen in terms of his reaction to President Trump's intransigence, difficulty in approving of the transition process. But I think I've been keeping an eye more on the cabinet appointments. And, again, the appointment have been middle-of-the-road. They are appointments that I think, for the most part, even a Republican majority, a Senate could approve those nominees. I'm keeping an eye on the attorney general whose yet to be -- that person has yet to be named. But if you're looking at people like Xavier Becerra, now attorney general of California, Sally Yates, the former deputy, if you're looking at people like Amy Klobuchar even, the former senator, I think you're looking at a more aggressive approach. On the other hand, if you look at people like Doug Jones or Merrick Garland, I think more pragmatic."
