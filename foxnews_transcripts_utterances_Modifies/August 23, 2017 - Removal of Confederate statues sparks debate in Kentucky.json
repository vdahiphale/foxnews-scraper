I mean, if you think about it, we are talking about putting these statues up. It is almost as if we want to do that because they wish that the south had one. They wish that the war had a different outcome. It makes no sense.  And so, the idea that we're the ones who are attempting to change history, it is absolutely insane. And the other part of it is, you don't have to have a memorial or a statue to be able to teach history. I think history is very important. It's the only way that you keep from making the same mistake. That being said, we can do that in a school setting, in a museum setting. You don't have to have monuments and Confederate flags to celebrate something that was so damaging. And so, the idea that we are really attempting to be inclusive in this country, not -- clearly not. We have, I think, people have dehumanized Black people and the Black experience so much that there is no ability to even see what this kind of -- what kind of damage something like this can cause. So, it's not about not talking about our history and not talking about what we have lived. We need to. And we want you all to do that. We want all of us to do that together.

And then there is the bitter nationwide debate over the removal of Confederate monuments which was first sparked by the deadly protest in neighboring Virginia.

Lexington was thrown into the national spotlight when its Democratic Mayor, Jim Gray, tweeted out his plans to speed up the removal of the two civil war era statues here. Kentucky's Republican Governor, Matt Bevin, however, says racist riots are disgusting and if the residents here want the statues removed, he will respect the will of the people. But he is concerned removing the statues erases lessons that could be learned from history. Listen to the governor in a radio interview, and then Lexington mayor's responds."

It's great to be with you here in Louisville, and thank you for having us. Let me start with you, Sadiqua.

The reality is, is that those in the majority and not even all, but these folks who have erected these statues to celebrate people who were murders, who were treasonous, who were willing to die in order to save slavery. I mean, if you think about it, we are talking about putting these statues up. It is almost as if we want to do that because they wish that the south had one. They wish that the war had a different outcome. It makes no sense. And so, the idea that we're the ones who are attempting to change history, it is absolutely insane. And the other part of it is, you don't have to have a memorial or a statue to be able to teach history. I think history is very important. It's the only way that you keep from making the same mistake. That being said, we can do that in a school setting, in a museum setting. You don't have to have monuments and Confederate flags to celebrate something that was so damaging. And so, the idea that we are really attempting to be inclusive in this country, not -- clearly not. We have, I think, people have dehumanized Black people and the Black experience so much that there is no ability to even see what this kind of -- what kind of damage something like this can cause. So, it's not about not talking about our history and not talking about what we have lived. We need to. And we want you all to do that. We want all of us to do that together. But to celebrate people who were willing to die to keep an entire people enslaved, no. Those statues need to come down."

But then there, you know, there is this other side of it that, you know, it was the most divisive battle in our nation's history. That there were young men on both sides who saw it that they were fighting for their state, that they were fighting for the people of their state, and, you know, they were trying to preserve what they were told was the right thing to try to preserve.

I think it's instructive and an important part of our history, I would hate to see these monuments all be taken down."

      "speaker": "REYNOLDS",
      "utterance": "And with all these monuments, Kentucky is one the most uneducated states in the country. So, if we were really about teaching history, why don't we do that? I mean, people can stand beside these monuments, in front of them and march and chant about wanting to celebrate the way things used to be, but they don't know their history even with the monuments there. So, I mean, I think we should be talking more about how we can change our community, our country, how we can bring people together. This doesn't help to do that. It's very divisive."

But I think it's hard to wrap your head around anyone, let alone a president of the United States, who in the wake of the tragedy that we had in Charlottesville an American woman being murdered in an American town can't seem to make the incident about anything other than himself. I mean, that's what this is all about. His grievances, how unfair his treatment was. And look, I have plenty of criticisms of the media. I think they do go out of their way just to have quick rating hits without focusing on a lot of the issues that matter most to Americans. That's all true, and that's all fair. But this president can't seem to get past the smallness of himself to try to bring the country together. And I think that is continually shocking to see."

I think people, in general, with this man, got elected with that frustration coming out. And I think when he continues to go to those rallies, you get in front of those crowds, people respond to him. They hear his words. They respond. You heard those comments earlier today about people saying that they support him and believe in what he has to say, and what the media has to say.

We never even got to vote on a repeal bill in the house. What we voted on was on was Obamacare light. At least in the senate, Senator McConnell has given them four or five votes. And what can you see over there is it's not just Senator McConnell, or it may not even be him at all. They don't even have 50 people over there who will vote to repeal ObamaCare. Now, in the house, we don't have 218, which is the number we need to get to. But, you know what? Paul Ryan won't put the repeal bill on the floor. We've done a discharge petition to try and force that bill, that repeal vote on the floor because we still haven't had it. This is sort of like a hot potato. And it was in Paul Ryan's hands for a while. And he passed the placebo. It wasn't a real repeal.

Not a fan of Jeff Flake, just in case you didn't get me last night, weak on crime and the border. But you know, some say that Jeff Flake is not on board with the agenda, and they are critical of him.

In the senate it's either 51 or 60, depending on what the issue is. And if you alienate somebody over one topic, then when you go to say infrastructure or tax reform, maybe Senator Flake will be there for the president on that vote.

They removed a sportscaster named Robert Lee from a game in Charlottesville because he has the same name as the confederate general. And just think about the idiocy of that for one moment.

And try to be sensitive to the things that maybe they would be sensitive to. But what I worry about is when that goes -- bleeds into tarring people who haven't maybe thought through all these issues or who didn't phrase things in the right way as all holding intolerant views. And I think we have gone too far in that direction. And it doesn't serve to bring the country together. It serves to pull people apart. If you call someone a racist or even imply that. That's going to be the end of the conversation not the beginning. So my concern with all of these issues is that it distracts us from the fact that wages are stuck, that healthcare is broken, that we have a no jobs crisis in the country.

You know, Kentuckians just want to know what's going on. How America and rural America helped to elect this president and I was proud to serve on his agriculture advisory board. And there are areas he's done very well. On agriculture he put a veterinarian in Sonny Perdue, as secretary of agriculture. He's been able to open up trade into areas that previously would not have like beef into China.

But look, he's got Republican control of the senate, he's got Republican control of the House of Representatives, and so it's really on the Republicans to get things done. And he'd rather spend his time on twitter and going back over the election results and rehashing media coverage and watching cable news than getting things done for the American people."
