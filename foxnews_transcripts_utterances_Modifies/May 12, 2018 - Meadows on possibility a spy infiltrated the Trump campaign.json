This concerns North Korea, and what some of the Democrats want to do is to shift the subject, as I say, ignore the fact that there is real progress here. That's what this president is doing. Secondly, as a businessman, he has been successful because he was willing to walk away from the table. I know that North Korea has gone back on some of its promises in the past. Well, there is a new sheriff in town, his name is President Donald J. Trump. And Chuck Schumer and Brenner and all of the others ought to be either cheering him on and hope that he is successful, or they should just shut up because that can do more damage than anything else."

This President, I think is going to keep John Kerry and his little bicycle far away from Singapore."

    {
      "speaker": "REINES",

I think every American including Democrats and everyone in Congress are first and foremost, thinking about the tens of thousands of American soldiers who are in South Korea, including on the DMZ. So, people want them to be safe and ideally come home at some point, so I don't think anyone is rooting against the President. People just want to want to make sure that that can happen. In terms of Iran and John Kerry, I think it might be a little early to be celebrating. It's easy to tear up an agreement. We don't know how it's going to go. I know the people who actually negotiated that agreement and I trust their judgment. They and our allies, and a lot of smart people who may be wrong, but they feel that this is a real problem."

If nothing else comes out of the Singapore summit, he at least has them to the table. I'm not saying that others weren't able to do that, but I believe Kim Jong-un knows he's dealing with a totally different person, where, if he does not do some of the things that the world wants, it's not just the United States and Donald Trump, if he doesn't do some things to enhance peace by giving up the nuclear program, then I believe, he believes that Donald Trump is not to be messed with.

And yet, here we are today having to talk about the possibility, if anything that was reported just yesterday was true, then we've got a number of other areas. I can tell you, I've seen enough documents that give me areas of concern that are not as large in scope as what has been reported within the last 24 hours. But indeed, we've got to make sure the American people see it, your viewers understand it."

And if Hillary had won this election, none of this abuse would have ever come to see the light of day. Also coming to see the light of day, thanks to Judicial Watch, we now believe that James Comey, after he was fired as the FBI Director colluded with Mueller, the special prosecutor about his testimony before the Senate committee. Do you think it's appropriate for the fired FBI director to talk to Robert Mueller who is investigating why he was fired, to talk to each other - about his testimony?"

And in fact, we're looking even at Congress that it appears there's a growing body of evidence that would suggest that he didn't give truthful testimony to Congress. So, he may have a bigger problem than that, but when you look at the Special Counsel, and you've got a person saying, \"Well, let's get together, so we have the right testimony before we go before Congress,\" that's inappropriate and certainly is not something that should happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Totally inappropriate and he was basically the chief witness in an obstruction of justice case. And he is now talking to special counsel, his mentor of ten years at the FBI, it doesn't look good. Lastly, you're trying to audit the Mueller probe, why would you be doing that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, here's the thing is - the American people supported the Mueller probe when it looked at Russia collusion. But what we're starting to see is that a lot of it has nothing to do with Russian collusion, it actually goes other areas, and the judge just the other day pointed out a good point. Are they really going after for political reasons or are they trying to go after it for Democratic reasons and making sure their elections are strong. And so, we believe in Congress, since we appropriate the funds, we need to make sure that those funds are being spent for collusion and not after a political witch hunt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm glad you're doing that. I've always said, this has been a witch hunt from the jump. It's been a frame job to lead to impeachment. We have not seen any evidence of collusion. I think the obstruction case is weak, the President wanted James Comey to look into potential colluders. James Comey said he was never obstructed and the investigation went on after he was fired, 13 out of the 17 lawyers in Robert Mueller's probe are Democrats, not one Republican. It doesn't add up. I think it's time to wind down this investigation. What you think the timing is of that?"

He owes about $1.2 million in taxes to the IRS, a partnership he created which went bankrupt that is being sued by about 50 states, owes about 4 million to Uncle Sam, and his law firm, he was involved with, went bankrupt, and at one point, $2.4 million.

It has now exploded into this off the rails investigation, it's going God knows where, Mueller was slapped down by a judge in court the other day for saying - for being outside the bounds of the investigation, for trying to take down Trump.
