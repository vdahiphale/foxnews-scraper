But President Trump is standing firm, saying one way or another we are still getting it.  Quoting, Mexico is paying indirectly for the wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA. Far more money coming to the U.S. because of the tremendous dangers at the border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow. The United States military will build the wall.  Though critics argue military money is already allocated and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says if the president tries to move money around, he'll have a fight on his hands. Even the Pentagon said last week, quoting: To date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall. And, yesterday, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders seemed ready to look elsewhere for money saying the president has asked his cabinet secretaries to look for funding in their budgets and that the administration is, quote, looking at other options.   Meantime, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE has released its fiscal year 2018 report. And along with the astounding fact, you noted that 90 percent of illegal immigrants arrested by ICE have criminal records, the report says nearly 400,000 people were booked in to an ICE detention facility, which is an increase of 22.5 percent over 2017. And the number arrested and detained by Customs and Border Protection went up by 32 percent.  Finally, of the roughly 250,000 illegal immigrants removed from the country, nearly 6,000 were classified as either known or suspected members of terrorists, an increase of 9 percent from last year -- Dan.",

But, look, here's the reality of where we are, Dan. This is a political fight. Fifty-four Democrats in the Senate under Barack Obama voted for a lot more than we're getting right now. They were on board on this.  The reason they are against it is because Trump is for it. This is -- what I think that we have lost though is control of the narrative. We are talking about fighting over a wall. We have got to stop talking about fighting over a wall and talk about national security, human trafficking, drugs coming over our border. We've got to start talking about the implications of porous border as opposed to a physical structure, because right now they want -- they know that they are winning the messaging war. This is what Trump is for and this is what we are for.  But we've got to get back to the fact that this is a national security issue, that there are women and children being trafficked over our border and that this is a massive flow of drugs over our border.

Yes, sure the Democrats are being pains in the neck.  But, remember, Republicans from the very beginning could have started the process of budget reconciliation from very early on. Brad Byrne over in Alabama, he is a congressman there, he started the process in the lower chamber, Republicans there didn't want to take up his bill. The Republicans in the upper chamber didn't want to start the process there. So, it really makes you wonder whether or not the Republican leadership in the upper chamber really wanted to get border funding because it could have gotten the process done very early on.

It's one of the reasons why we are in such a terrible position with our debt and deficit. They believe it just makes Republicans look callus. Having these fights we don't gain anything. So just get out of town.  And during the Trump era, there's been a re-thinking about all of these questions. The last shutdown as you will remember, the Schumer shut down, we actually won that shut down. I think Sean Spicer is right. If we look the American people in the eye and say we need to secure our southern border, we should only come in this country a legal way.  We shouldn't let liberal judges get to determine who gets to stay forever and ever and ever, just because you are waiting for your first hearing which you must likely dodge. We ought to secure our southern border. I think the American people will stand up for us. Shutdown doesn't mean you get all you want.

The problem is with our rules of engagement and what I faced, what Major Golsteyn faced and so many others is, there's no prison system in Afghanistan, there's nowhere to put these guys once you've captured them so you're faced with this horrible choice. Either you release them knowing they're going to kill every Afghan that worked with you and helped you and go back to killing Americans or take matters into your own hand which you can't do because getting them over to Guantanamo Bay or getting them somewhere to a prison system that doesn't exist in Afghanistan isn't an option.

You have Iran that could attack Israel, you have our Kurdish allies that are going to be hit by the Turks in the North and then even if you do think, we should just pull them out regardless of all those consequences, we should have gotten something from Russia, Turkey and Iran for it as a concession.

The Left is turned ineffectively into it like a medieval religion and she's a heretic in particular, she is a woman of beauty and of grace, and when she was first attacked for the White House decorations, she responded that people have different taste, right? She was not made upset by it and I think that upsets people, they're always looking for ways to disrupt and to make people miserable. I think that ultimately what the media wants to do and what those who are angry at the Trumps for is that especially for Mrs. Trump, she's not reliant on being invited to Vogue's parties. She isn't part of their system, she doesn't need to go to their cocktail parties or to be approved of by them and so that's what makes her a problem.

This is the holiday season. This isn't going to look good. But I think Rush Limbaugh had it absolutely right. Compromise in Washington terms is Republicans get nothing, Democrats get everything. But, look, here's the reality of where we are, Dan. This is a political fight. Fifty-four Democrats in the Senate under Barack Obama voted for a lot more than we're getting right now. They were on board on this. The reason they are against it is because Trump is for it. This is -- what I think that we have lost though is control of the narrative. We are talking about fighting over a wall. We have got to stop talking about fighting over a wall and talk about national security, human trafficking, drugs coming over our border. We've got to start talking about the implications of porous border as opposed to a physical structure, because right now they want -- they know that they are winning the messaging war. This is what Trump is for and this is what we are for. But we've got to get back to the fact that this is a national security issue, that there are women and children being trafficked over our border and that this is a massive flow of drugs over our border. We have got to get back for reminding people really what's at stake here."

But this border funding wall issue, I mean, you just -- Twitter is great. It's like one big, huge town hall. People are on -- not always the greatest town hall in the world.

And, keep in mind, Dan, this thing, as far as you have a number of Republicans who are saying well, the reason why we can't get this border funding is because all these Democrats are being obstructionists. Yes, sure the Democrats are being pains in the neck. But, remember, Republicans from the very beginning could have started the process of budget reconciliation from very early on. Brad Byrne over in Alabama, he is a congressman there, he started the process in the lower chamber, Republicans there didn't want to take up his bill. The Republicans in the upper chamber didn't want to start the process there. So, it really makes you wonder whether or not the Republican leadership in the upper chamber really wanted to get border funding because it could have gotten the process done very early on.

It's one of the reasons why we are in such a terrible position with our debt and deficit. They believe it just makes Republicans look callus. Having these fights we don't gain anything. So just get out of town. And during the Trump era, there's been a re-thinking about all of these questions. The last shutdown as you will remember, the Schumer shut down, we actually won that shut down. I think Sean Spicer is right. If we look the American people in the eye and say we need to secure our southern border, we should only come in this country a legal way. We shouldn't let liberal judges get to determine who gets to stay forever and ever and ever, just because you are waiting for your first hearing which you must likely dodge. We ought to secure our southern border. I think the American people will stand up for us. Shutdown doesn't mean you get all you want. But you send a message to liberals that you are going to fight for every inch of territory. That's why it's critical for the president to not sign a bill which is a white flag."

They shut down the government and they lose the messaging war. The last time this happened, Matt reminds everybody, the Schumer shut down, we finally won one because we were right on the issues. We were right on the policies. And we're right now. We are against human trafficking. We're against drugs coming over our border. And we are for making sure we protect our country and our people from those people who may be coming in here with nefarious reasons. We are right on this issue. This is a fight worth having."

You know, it's interesting when the Democrats fight for their issues, the liberals they lose elections. Obama got all this stuff passed Obamacare. Essentially outside of Obama, they wiped out the Republican Party, right? The Republicans lose elections when they don't stand on principles.

This once again goes back to what I was just saying because it appears that you have a number of Republicans who are concerned, particularly, in the upper chamber because now you have Republicans who are on the defense right now in the you were chamber who are thinking I have got to be careful with my votes. I have got to be careful with where things are going because, you know, perhaps over in Texas, for example, have you John Cornyn. He just saw how close that race was between Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz and he's thinking, uh-oh, I've got to be careful too.

It doesn't give a lot of confidence for someone coming in and doing the jobs and tasks that these men have been assigned to and given responsibility over. If you are taught and trained to make split second decisions to save the lives of those around you and especially those under your command and then to find out months or years later that a group of people sitting in an office somewhere are looking over regulations which were really not very effective at that time and decide that you did the right or wrong thing."

You see a bombmaker on the field of battle who is now resurfaced, you know is a bombmaker, you don't know if he's got some kind of a pressure device to detonate an explosive or not.

If you kill a bombmaker, Taliban commander, Al Qaeda in the heat of combat, that's combat, that's what we're over there to do is to take these guys out. The issue is if you capture one in the course of combat, they're now detainee or treated like a prisoner of war, you cannot then execute them, that is against the Geneva Convention, that's a war crime. The problem is with our rules of engagement and what I faced, what Major Golsteyn faced and so many others is, there's no prison system in Afghanistan, there's nowhere to put these guys once you've captured them so you're faced with this horrible choice. Either you release them knowing they're going to kill every Afghan that worked with you and helped you and go back to killing Americans or take matters into your own hand which you can't do because getting them over to Guantanamo Bay or getting them somewhere to a prison system that doesn't exist in Afghanistan isn't an option. And my point is, this dilemma, this flawed engagement strategy is happening right now as we speak and it needs to be fixed because men and women are out there, having to make this horrible choice every day right now."

We can't just let bombmakers back on the battlefield, then another point if you don't mind hitting it as well, what Michael has brought up as well is it's not just us, it's the sources who give these people up, these guys go right back and start taking out our sources, is there any solution to this?"

And then your second question is specifically, did we have field detention sites in place for the battle of Marjah, the biggest battle to occur in Afghanistan ever and had the command taken the necessary steps to make sure that there were military intelligence interrogators on hand to handle the detainee flow that they knew would occur from this battle. And the answer is no. It was a huge military intelligence failure and let's take a look at what was happening the time. Bradley Manning was giving us - selling WikiLeaks, you had Bergdahl that was already in captivity with the Taliban. You had more crystal that had McChrystal that had requested another you know, 50,000 troops or so and Obama was taking his sweet time to deliver them, had not delivered them yet and so they were under-resourced, military intelligence community had no positioned to field detention site and Major Golsteyn should have never seen this individual again. He should have been able to turn him over to interrogators, they should interrogated him and he was a threat to U.S. forces and he had intelligence value and he should have been processed up to Bagram Theater Internment Detention Facility."

If I can move on though to Syria, I'd love to get your expertise on this and I'll get to you, General Tata. This Syria situation, there's a real delicate balance over there between the Kurds, the Turks, ISIS. This is not a - this is another one of those situations where there's no yes or no answer, your opinion on President Trump's action today to start to remove our troops from Syria."

If we just pull the soldiers out, you have ISIS that can reconstitute, you have Iran running amuck, you have Russia running amuck. You have Iran that could attack Israel, you have our Kurdish allies that are going to be hit by the Turks in the North and then even if you do think, we should just pull them out regardless of all those consequences, we should have gotten something from Russia, Turkey and Iran for it as a concession.

That picture is lovely and they're actually happy. You know, Trump this is his bailiwick, this is his wheelhouse, he's enjoying himself and Mrs. Trump is as well but keep in mind, I think that this is less hate than it is jealousy and envy. The Left is turned ineffectively into it like a medieval religion and she's a heretic in particular, she is a woman of beauty and of grace, and when she was first attacked for the White House decorations, she responded that people have different taste, right? She was not made upset by it and I think that upsets people, they're always looking for ways to disrupt and to make people miserable. I think that ultimately what the media wants to do and what those who are angry at the Trumps for is that especially for Mrs. Trump, she's not reliant on being invited to Vogue's parties. She isn't part of their system, she doesn't need to go to their cocktail parties or to be approved of by them and so that's what makes her a problem. I think that Americans, for all of us, we can look to her obviously as an example for when you are under pressure, of handling it with grace, she's still has her opinions which she makes known to her husband, no doubt and I think she's a fabulous First Lady doing a great job."

      "speaker": "STUCKEY",

This is an objectively beautiful picture, has nothing to do with politics but I think it goes to show that the hatred of the Trumps really was never about politics, it's about something that's very personal. That's why the attacks towards Melania Trump really have nothing to do with policy differences but about who she is as a person. And they stoop down to these levels to try to minimize her, to try to belittle hard so they don't have to talk about the fact that she was an immigrant who became a First Lady, who's actually someone like Tammy said, that we can men and women look up to. And they just want to focus on these tiny petty things so that they continue to demonize her, to patronize her, to belittle her and to make her seem like someone who is not as significant, who we shouldn't be admiring and we shouldn't really be looking to. And I think it makes them look worse than it makes her look."

It's the woman who or the girl who shows up at a high school who's pretty, who's smart, maybe even a little shy and then they go on to it, with a magic marker at the locker because they're jealous. This is something, a woman like that probably has experienced before and rises above it."

      "utterance": "Good evening again Dan. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long said that Facebook users control their own data but the New York Times obtained hundreds of pages of Facebook documents and interviewed dozens of former Facebook employees. And apparently Zuckerberg's claim is untrue. For example, the Times says Facebook allowed Microsoft's Bing search engine to see the names of all Facebook users' friends without consent. Facebook also gave Netflix and Spotify access to Facebook users' private messages. Even allowed some companies to read and delete users' private messages. Turns out the deal benefited Facebook and 150 other companies. The New York Times says, quoting, \"Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive.\" Facebook argues that is giving its users more platforms to access their accounts and thereby enhancing social experiences, the company claims, \"None of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission.\" Facebook says it ended the partnerships months ago but also admits to needing, \"tighter management\" over how developers can access user information. Dan."
