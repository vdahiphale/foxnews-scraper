And then after the nomination, then I would just pick a woman. By announcing in advance, he took a chance there, but nothing (Inaudible) any less popular with Democrats because there's a strong feeling among Democrats for a woman and a person of color, for people of color very important because certainly black women are probably the most loyal group, demographic group that the Democrats have.

I'm thinking of that hypercritical coverage of her candidacy and the real scrutiny she got from the media. She was a surprise pick. We didn't know much about her. Obviously, we know a lot more about Harris because she's been a senator. She's already run for president. As you just said, her campaign didn't go very well. But she deserves a vetting in terms of her voting record. As Mollie said, she's a true progressive on these issues that are really important to some of these swing states, like gun control and abortion and immigration. Let's take a close look at that and see. Obviously, she's not a moderate in those areas. You can just take a quick look at her voting record.

But the fact is Kamala Harris among Democrats is definitely a moderate, no question, pretty much like Joe Biden and her belief and her approach to politics. And that is a big reason why you saw so many scatter shot criticisms of her that she was too far left, that she was too far right, or too centrist to appeal to the progressives, et cetera.

All right, Susan, let me put up for you two different front pages from the New York Times. One has to do with the day that Mike Pence was announced as Trump's VP.

We should not be frothing over a vice presidential pick, we in the media.   We need to be impartial. So often, the press takes a side once the nominees are picked and once we get into the general election. You're seeing it already with the very, very positive coverage of Harris. And you will see it with, I think, from the New York Times pretty well negative, especially with this whole birtherism issue with the president.  The media brought up the question of whether Harris was a citizen or not. The president didn't bring it up. The president was answering a reporter's question. Obviously, you can criticize the way he answered that question. The media brought it up. They baited him on this. Before I came on the set, Howard, I was reading a 2008 story from the New York Times questioning whether McCain is eligible to run for president because he was born in the Panama Canal.

But the results are in from the summer, and you had those 31 municipal elections, New Jersey with 10 percent of ballots deemed fraudulent. You had New Yorkers having to wait months to find out results from their mail-in balloting. In Nevada, there were 220,000 mail-in ballots that were sent to the wrong address.

Because there are huge issues with mail-in balloting that deserve good reporting, and then what the president is saying about not wanting to fund it has a lot to do with his concerns about the potential for fraud. And the press isn't covering that. They are also not covering what's really going on at the post office. They are  70 billion in debt.  The GAO has determined the post office to be on an unsustainable financial path. Nothing is being written about that. The president put in a new post master. His job was to go in and reform. Find ways to make it more financially sustainable. He's cutting back on the overtime hours. The combination of all that stuff is -- and the union is getting upset about it and creating this messaging war over what's happening at the post office.

I'll start with you, Mollie. Of course, Kamala Harris is a historic pick as the first black woman on a major party ticket and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. But what do you make of the way most media outlets are just absolutely cheering her selection with little to no mention of any possible negatives?"

      "utterance": "Yeah. When her presidential campaign faltered, the media seemed to delight in her deficiencies and failure to catch fire. But they just turned on a dime and they were praising her throughout this -- throughout this selection process. But more concerning than the hagiographic headlines and the full color photo spreads is that they were falsely claiming that she was a moderate. And that's a word that has actual meaning, and her actual voting record is on the far left, right, there with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders no matter the issue, whether it's abortion, or guns, or immigration, or government spending, or healthcare, or whatever the issue may be. She's on the far-left side. And you don't need to be as hostile as you are toward Republican picks, the media doesn't need to be as hostile as they are toward Republican picks, not even as friendly as they are to nearly every Democratic pick. They should just tell the facts honestly."

      "utterance": "We will come back to this question about her ideology. But Clarence Page, let me ask you first. What do you make -- what does this pick mean to you personally?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLARENCE PAGE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Well, he was pressured, you might say by the needs of political -- the national political campaign. What was surprising to me was that he telegraphed in advance that he was looking for a woman. If it would've been me, I would've just -- I'm certainly considering a woman. And then after the nomination, then I would just pick a woman. By announcing in advance, he took a chance there, but nothing (Inaudible) any less popular with Democrats because there's a strong feeling among Democrats for a woman and a person of color, for people of color very important because certainly black women are probably the most loyal group, demographic group that the Democrats have. And black folks put Biden over the top in South Carolina, which after he had lost three primaries in a row, put him back in the race at the front of the race. So that was not a big surprise."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

The media were filled with stories about what a terrible campaign she had run. And now, she's being cast by many of these same people as, you know, excellent, terrific campaigner and amazingly good choice. Whether she's the best choice or not possible for Biden is historical revisionism at work here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "It's early. And so in the coverage, so she was just chosen. Their campaign together is now underway. And Harris -- Senator Harris deserves as thorough a vetting as the vice presidential candidate as the press has always given past running mates, particularly if you look back to the last woman on the ticket, not Hillary Clinton, but prior to that Sarah Palin when she was picked to run as McCain's running mate. I'm thinking of that hypercritical coverage of her candidacy and the real scrutiny she got from the media. She was a surprise pick. We didn't know much about her. Obviously, we know a lot more about Harris because she's been a senator. She's already run for president. As you just said, her campaign didn't go very well. But she deserves a vetting in terms of her voting record. As Mollie said, she's a true progressive on these issues that are really important to some of these swing states, like gun control and abortion and immigration. Let's take a close look at that and see. Obviously, she's not a moderate in those areas. You can just take a quick look at her voting record. And what she said on the record to see that that's not a moderate. It's our job in the media to give that a thorough vetting."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and this is actually very common. You're seeing the media use this phrase, racist, to describe anything that they disagree with. And it's unfortunate because not only is it not true, it diminishes the power of that slur, which is something that people should avoid. And you saw this with coverage of Kamala Harris that any criticism of her is racist. That is not going fly. And it's not going to work well. It's not going to work well as a campaign message. It's also not going to work well for the media in terms of having them have any credibility or trust."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Donny Deutsch later apologized for using the phrase yellow man after he talked about black man and a brown man. Clarence Page, many in the media are strongly criticizing President Trump for repeating an argument made by a conservative lawyer. He was asked about this by reporters, the lawyer questioning Kamala Harris' American citizenship, and therefore her eligibility to run for vice president. Roll it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Clarence, as you know, Kamala Harris was born in Oakland and nobody questions that. That means that under the 14th Amendment, she's a citizen of the United States. Her parents were immigrants at the time getting their doctorates. What did you think about the way the president handled that question from the press?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm one of the members of the press who criticized President Trump for trying to revive birtherism. You can see my column on The Tribune website now. The fact is that you mentioned earlier about the lack of criticism of her when she was announced, partly because President Trump thought somebody else like a Karen Bass was going to be announced who is farther to the left, or some other person farther to the left, Elizabeth Warren, for example. But the fact is Kamala Harris among Democrats is definitely a moderate, no question, pretty much like Joe Biden and her belief and her approach to politics. And that is a big reason why you saw so many scatter shot criticisms of her that she was too far left, that she was too far right, or too centrist to appeal to the progressives, et cetera. The fact is it was an excellent choice. She got off to a great start. And certainly, the ample opportunity to pull her background which obviously is already going on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, well, just to button this up. The president seemed to slightly soften his stance at a news conference last night, saying he is not going pursue this question of her eligibility. Kamala Harris, in interview with the black news site, The Grio, it's her second interview she's done since her selection with an extremely sympathetic interview -- worked for liberal site accused the administration or the White House of lies and deception. All right, Susan, let me put up for you two different front pages from the New York Times. One has to do with the day that Mike Pence was announced as Trump's VP. And as we see that, you see it's circled. One story below the foal (ph), on the right, you see the Kamala Harris selection absolutely dominating the front page, four different stories on Senator Harris being chosen. What do you make of that disparity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Well, I justify it somewhat because she's more of a historic choice as a black woman on a Democratic presidential ticket as opposed to Mike Pence. You know, you could say another white person chosen to -- male chosen to be vice president. I get that. And it's the New York Times. I also get that. We should not be frothing over a vice presidential pick, we in the media. We need to be impartial. So often, the press takes a side once the nominees are picked and once we get into the general election. You're seeing it already with the very, very positive coverage of Harris. And you will see it with, I think, from the New York Times pretty well negative, especially with this whole birtherism issue with the president. The media brought up the question of whether Harris was a citizen or not. The president didn't bring it up. The president was answering a reporter's question. Obviously, you can criticize the way he answered that question. The media brought it up. They baited him on this. Before I came on the set, Howard, I was reading a 2008 story from the New York Times questioning whether McCain is eligible to run for president because he was born in the Panama Canal. The media has been doing these themselves to Republican candidates. Really, I think the whole story with the baiting the president, it's a big issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, short on time so I need short answers. Mollie, we're coming back to the question of ideology. Obviously, it's fair game to talk about Senator Harris' record. She had supported Medicare for all before walking it back. And New York Times news story described Biden and Harris as two moderates. But is it fair to say this former prosecutor is a Bernie Sanders radical?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, if you -- if people think that she's moderate, it really only says something about their own political perspective that they are so far to the left that they think she's moderate by comparison to their own views. Again, objectively speaking, you know, when you rate the voting records, Kamala Harris actually had the most liberal voting record in the Senate last year in a party that's already getting more and more fringed to the left. And so that's just more objective thing that should be talked about. And, you know, she had problems. She was one of the ring leaders of the anti- Kavanaugh circus. She actually tried to keep a judge from being confirmed because he was a member of the Knights of Columbus. These are not moderate positions. She tried to imprison pro-life journalists again --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "That's part of the trope (ph) that Joe Biden isn't capable of handling the job. I think -- well, that's up to Joe Biden to prove to us during his campaign that the whole notion of Kamala Harris thing person brought in to run the government, this is a crazy conspiracy theory."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump and the press have been in a war of words about the postal service with the president warning about widespread fraud from mail- in ballots, and his detractors say he's crippling the agency to influence the election. That battle escalated when Trump, with Maria Bartiromo, addressed the Democrats' demands that the postal service get extra an  25 billion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Now, they need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots. If they don't get those two items, that means you can't have universal mail-in voting because they're not equipped to have it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Mollie Hemingway, much of the press saying aha. The president said the quiet part out loud that the postal service can't handle the surge in expected mail-in ballots if it doesn't get the money, and you're not getting the money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think this week we've seen an explosion of conspiracy theories surrounding the U.S. postal service. It seems like this postal service conspiracy theory is replacing the Democrats' Russia conspiracy theory, which suffered another blow this week with the pleading of the FBI lawyer pleading guilty to altering evidence. But we have seen no good reporting on this. It is true that President Trump said that he didn't want to give them extra money, specifically for mail-in balloting, which he has opposed on the theory that it is not -- it would take years to get it up to speed, not the weeks that we have here. I think what's really happening with this story is that the media did push, as you note, this mail-in balloting. But the results are in from the summer, and you had those 31 municipal elections, New Jersey with 10 percent of ballots deemed fraudulent. You had New Yorkers having to wait months to find out results from their mail-in balloting. In Nevada, there were 220,000 mail-in ballots that were sent to the wrong address. And the media are now realizing that their push for mail-in balloting is not going so well, and they are trying to displace blame and blame Trump and set up this other conspiracy theory to replace the last one that they pushed, and that they are pretending didn't happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, again, I was referring to the president's own words. And Susan Ferrechio, at least the postal service now run by a major Trump donor has stopped removing mailboxes, because those produced them difficult images. It was the Washington Post that obtained a postal service warning to 46 states, saying we cannot guaranty that we can deliver all mail ballots or process them. You know, deliver them to be counted by the time of the election. And that's why I think what sent this story into the stratosphere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Well, it does, because mail-in balloting is coming. A lot of states have declared it to be part of the process in November. And that needs to be fixed. But as Mollie was saying, we are not up to speed on that. So really what I see a combination of confusing comments by the president and very poor reporting on the subject. Because there are huge issues with mail-in balloting that deserve good reporting, and then what the president is saying about not wanting to fund it has a lot to do with his concerns about the potential for fraud. And the press isn't covering that. They are also not covering what's really going on at the post office. They are  70 billion in debt. The GAO has determined the post office to be on an unsustainable financial path. Nothing is being written about that. The president put in a new post master. His job was to go in and reform.

The combination of all that stuff is -- and the union is getting upset about it and creating this messaging war over what's happening at the post office.

I mean, he's trying to manipulate the election now when it's obvious that more money is needed in order to handle mail-in balloting. He is doing all he can to cut it off. At the same time, the question about both fraud, I've been investigating vote fraud around Chicago off and on since the early 70's. I can tell you the issue should not be how the balloting is done and sent in. The issue is how are they counted. And I don't care whether it's mail-in or in-person -- the ballots are counted the same way. And President Trump says that it's going to be massive fraud.

That's what started this bogus argument we've talking about. Now, the column makes the ludicrous assertion, and maybe the Senator isn't an American because her Jamaican and Indian parents were in this country but weren't citizens when she was born. This is flatly untrue, because she was born in Oakland. The legal question was settled long ago. The editors defended the piece for a week, insisting it wasn't racist birtherism until criticism from its own staff prompted them to apologize, saying the column inevitably conveyed the ugly message that Harris was somehow not truly American. Wait, it gets worse. The magazine failed to disclose that the author, John Eastman, who among other things talks about Harris' divided allegiance was a Republican candidate who competed to run against Harris for California Attorney General. This is a total media disgrace. President Trump is calling Kamala Harris horrible and nasty, and he further unloaded on Joe Biden's running mate with FBN's Maria Bartiromo."

But I suspect you'll be hearing more from the pundits than every before, which is great if you like pundits or do pundits do for a living.

And Katrina, what do you make of the overwhelmingly positive media coverage of Kamala Harris and is there any part of you that feels that it's progress to have a black woman, even one you disagree with, on a major party ticket? KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I think that the coverage is pretty indicative of what most democrat coverage is and that is to provide protection. We have seen those in Hollywood and politics alike come out and wanted to defend and cuddle her. But we also heard that she's a strong black woman so she should be able to protect and defend herself but we will have to see what happens there. You know, as being a black woman, I don't look at the person that I'm going to vote for by their gender or their skin color because what really matters to me and I would assume that this matters to most women, how they are going to govern, if they have experience, and what policies they support specifically when it comes to being a black woman, and Kamala Harris is on the wrong side of the policies that I believe would actually benefit black America."

At the same time, should the president be calling her a socialist, and a fundraising letter from your campaign says that both Biden and Harris hate America. How do you justify that kind of language?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERSON",
      "utterance": "I mean you just have to look at their politics. You have to look at what Kamala and the vice president have been saying over the last few months. When you were talking about policies that actually hurt Americans, when you talk about some of the policies and Kamala double speaks specifically about them, this is definitely a candidate of the choosing for the Democrat Party. This is a red flag for the party itself because choosing Kamala Harris reinforces what the Trump campaign has been saying for months, and that is that the polls are wrong because if Joe Biden were leading by 10 points and had the black vote locked up, you don't go with an attempt to energize the base. So this is absolutely the final takeover of the hardcore progressives, socialists, and even Marxists political positions of the Democrat Party. These are policies that are irrational like the crazy Green New Deal that kills millions of jobs and eliminating private health insurance. A government takeover of health care which no one wants and putting illegal aliens ahead of Americans is extremely radical."

      "speaker": "PIERSON",
      "utterance": "I don't think anyone is deaf, blind or dumb to notice that Joe Biden doesn't quite have all of his faculties in place. So the number two is extremely important for this case. She is extremely radical. She is someone as a sitting senator who said during a public hearing that our interior law enforcement agency was compared to the KKK. So this is something that I think is truly important. And not to mention, you know, Joe Biden even forgot she was a United States senator when he claimed to have the support of the only black woman in the United States Senate. So people are right to look at her as leading the ticket."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

Now, the president -- we talked about this earlier -- told reporters that he had heard the conservative lawyer's argument -- this was made in NewsWeek -- that Kamala Harris might not be eligible to run for vice president because of the circumstances of her birth. That was totally bogus in the sense that she was born in Oakland, California and under the 14th Amendment, she is a citizen. The president said, I have no idea if that's right. Shouldn't he have checked it out before what his critics say is giving legitimacy to the argument or casting doubt on an opponent's eligibility to run for VP?"

You know, you're going to have the legal scholars out there debating any and everything when it comes to presidential ticket as they should, by the way. But the reality is she should just be disqualified simply because of the positions that she takes. I mean, the entire ticket itself. When you think about it, next week, we are going to have the DNC convention which will be evident of the left-wing mob final takeover Democrat Party because the speakers' lineup will mirror the party's ticket. There will be some aggressively radical and power hungry, you know, old school hippies and new age socialists and Marxists who are going to be out there championing, reimaging policing, and fundamentally destroying America's economy, American security and way of life. I think next week is going to be a true eye opener for the country."

This is a sitting senator who was offered some really nasty criticism of our brave law enforcement agencies, as well as Justice Kavanaugh himself. Just go back to those hearings and I think most people would agree with the president's assessments."

Even Lindsey Graham has broken with him on this issue. A lot of people are upset about it. Is this a political blunder?"

Think about it, we are talking about the U.S. Postal Service when we should be talking about the economy, when we should be talking about the vice presidential ticket, and the fact that neither Kamala Harris and Joe Biden is taking questions from the press. They're not out there campaigning asking for the vote in contrast where you have the president, the vice president, and their campaign out in all of the states asking Americans for their votes and telling them what their vision for the future is."

We asked the Biden campaign for a guest for the third time in recent weeks. The campaign was not able to provide us one, but we will keep asking in the interest of balance. Jessica, when Kamala Harris dropped out well before Iowa of the presidential race, the consensus among pundits, she had run a terrible campaign, erratic, mismanaged. She was even getting clobbered among black voters in her home state of California. How is she now being described by many of the same commentators as a political superwoman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it has a lot to do with the big boom that she's given Joe Biden's campaign this week. They raised  48 million in 48 hours, which is absolutely astounding. If you look at the snap polls in a day or two after she was added to the ticket, you will see that moderate Democrats and liberal Democrats are both overjoyed at the selection. And when you think about the target demographic that President Trump is doing the worse with, that is women, especially college-educated women and now suburban women, that's Kamala Harris's sweet spot. So I think she was absolutely the right pick and it makes a lot of sense that the voting public is reacting well to her selection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Certainly, Democrats are. Now, obviously there's a lot of extra attention to the Kamala pick because Joe Biden is 77. But on some level, once a week or two of excitement fades, aren't the media exaggerating the importance even of this running mate and isn't the race going to come back to Trump versus Biden?"

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I would hope so. That is what the next four years -- four years are you better off than you were when President Trump came into office? It would be Joe Biden filling his shoes if he does get elected on November 3rd. And Joe Biden is the one with the long record. He has those eight years as Obama-Biden Democrat that he can point to his accomplishments and say, do you want more of what I delivered before, or do you want the last four years again? So I think it is absolutely about Joe Biden, that his age is relevant. Ronald Reagan was the oldest president in the White House. He left at the age of 77, where Joe Biden is now. It does make a difference to be thinking about it. And I, with the selection of Kamala Harris, really saw this as passing of the torch to some degree. She's 55 year's old. She's more progressive than Joe Biden is though she is on his ticket and they will be running on his moderate policies. So Joe Biden is signalling to younger voters, to the next generation of Democrats --"

      "utterance": "Now, what about some media outlets and journalists and commentators who are describing Senator Harris as a moderate despite the fact that during a campaign, she went left, she backed Bernie's Medicare for All? Doesn't that show a kind of a left-leaning viewpoint by the mainstream media?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I've never denied the fact that there is a left-leaning viewpoint amongst the mainstream media and that is problematic that often opinion columnists and journalists, reporters get conflated, right? Reporters are not supposed to have opinions. They are supposed to report the news. But I think what they were reflecting upon is a couple of things. Kampala Harris started off, as you pointed out in your segment with Katrina Pierson, endorsing Medicare for All but then moved away from that. We do need to have a private option. She was for the Green New Deal but she has joined Joe Biden's ticket. She's for his more moderate climate policies, making sure first and foremost that we re-enter the Paris Accord. So I think that's what they are referring to, also the fact -- and it's incredibly important for the historic nature of this ticket -- that she is a black woman. And if you look at black Democratic voters, they are some of our most moderate and conservative voters. I think that they are speaking to that, that she hopefully will connect as Joe Biden has with this more moderate core of our party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But do you think the media basically were really pushing the former vice president to pick as his number two a woman of color? Because there were just all of these stories out, he picked a highly qualified white running mate to be this great disappointment. Were the media now celebrating the results of that pressure campaign?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I think it is two parts. I think that there is the historic nature of this which matters a tremendous amount. You have the daughter of immigrants. I mean, she's the true embodiment of the American story, right, that this is possible, that civil rights activists who came from India and Jamaica could have a daughter, she could rise up and be an A.G., United States senator, and now potentially a vice president and the first black woman to hold that role. So I think they are celebrating the historic nature of that and for good reason. I think they are also rightly commenting on the fact that representation matters, especially in the Democratic Party. And for years, Democrats have been playing lip service to our core voting bloc, which is black women, and that they needed to be represented. But I would say more than the press, what mattered were those two open letters from prominent black women and prominent black men that said that we need to have a black V.P. candidate. And I think that's really what pushed Joe Biden over the edge to ensure that this was an African-American pick."

Let me tell you, I'm not only just certified, I went to an SEC school, my daughter goes to University of Georgia, and there is nothing more synonymous with the fall than college football coming back, and the SEC football is religion, it's a way of life. But here is the deal, what you're seeing now is the president as the SEC and the ACC and the Big 12 also saying they're going to try and find a way to play as opposed to the Big 12 and the Pac-10. You're seeing the president use this as a political issue, trying to say, I'm for football and those guys don't want it, therefore, I'm on the right side of this issue. But the honest truth is we just don't know. We don't know for sure the SEC or any other league is going to get to play. We would have Alabama and Georgia kicking the season off in early September. That would be the biggest game of the season. But there's no indication that's actually going to happen."

But in the case of the colleges, we are seeing coaches say we are going to have, you know, approach of we are going to do what we think is best for our students and athletes. And after all, they are students, and so whether or not these programs can have protocols and the things in place to protect them, we will find out.

Fifty-two percent of the responses said it was OK to kneel compared to the same poll taken in 2018 when only 35 percent supported it.
