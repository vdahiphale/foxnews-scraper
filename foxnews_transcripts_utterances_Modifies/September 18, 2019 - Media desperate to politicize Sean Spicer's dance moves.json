      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from a very busy Washington tonight. Inspector General Mike Horowitz made some news on Capitol Hill today. Why might Jim Comey be in some new trouble? And why don't Democrats want the IG to testify about potential FISA abuse? Catherine Herridge and Alan Dershowitz bring us all the details. Also, climate change is becoming a religion, literally. NBC News is now asking the public to share their climate confessions. I think we all have some in the studio. Ralph Reed reacts to the left's newfound faith. Plus, it's Wednesday. So it's time for \"Seen and Unseen\" with Raymond Arroyo. What do the attacks on Sean Spicer's dancing really reveal about the President's enemies? And a singer goes to war with his own gender.  But first, the war against men. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  The theory of toxic masculinity was once relegated to academic settings, workshops, and feminist symposia. But now that mindset has infected almost every area of our culture, our businesses, our schools, and now, of course, our politics. Well, dismissing and even demonizing the contributions of men throughout our history has become oh so inspiring, or at least Elizabeth Warren thinks so.",

So men who are heterosexual, strong, aggressive competitors are no longer an acceptable part of society, not really. They are the problem. After all, the professionals have told us so.  Last year, the American Psychological Association released guidelines for psychological practice with boys and men. That trash traditional masculinity as leading to \"aggression and violence as a means to resolve interpersonal conflict as well as substance abuse, incarceration and early mortality.\"   Well, of course, for years, Hollywood has been pushing the skinny jeans, crop top, pajama boy version of masculinity on us. We've gotten kind of used to it. And now, even time honored male brands and businesses are trying to make men feel guilty about being men.",

When they attack our founders or kind of dismiss them, this is where they're going. The entire American experiment, they believe, was sinful and awful because it was started by conquest. White men with their traditional notions of work and morality subjugated women and other minorities, end of story. Nothing really good came after that. Thus the thinking goes. It's the duty of all secular leftists to marginalize and hobble men who obstruct their vision of revolutionary change, political and otherwise.   Now, think of where that leaves us as a society, this entire mindset, and as a country, with our men either neutered or perpetually in a defensive posture dismissive or angry and alienated. Now, that's toxic. If you prefer an America run by a bunch of gender-enlightened bullies, then by all means, vote Democrat. That's going to be fun. And that's “The Angle.” Here to respond is Dan Bongino, Fox News contributor and author of the new book \"Exonerated,\" and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast. All right, Dan. Do you suspect that what the left is clearly doing here will work with voters?   DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR & AUTHOR, EXONERATED: No. I think what the left is doing, I think you should thank them. What they are doing actually led to the election of Donald Trump who does what I'm going to do now and tell you, if you think for a second the liberal lunatics out there, I'm going to apologize for being born male and subject myself to your stereotypical prejudgments, you're out of your freaking mind. You're living on the wrong planet. And Donald Trump didn't do it either.  But Laura, this is indicative of a bigger problem. We all know where this comes from (inaudible) but everybody dealt (ph) with critical theory and this white patriarchy garbage that's taught to our kids in school. But this is the complete intellectual collapse of the left you're witnessing in live time. We are now living through peak stupid with the left. And this toxic masculinity, white patriarchy nonsense where they've now devolved to judging people exclusively by their gender and their skin color is a marker of the total intellectual collapse of the radical left.",

When they attack our founders or kind of dismiss them, this is where they're going. The entire American experiment, they believe, was sinful and awful because it was started by conquest. White men with their traditional notions of work and morality subjugated women and other minorities, end of story. Nothing really good came after that. Thus the thinking goes. It's the duty of all secular leftists to marginalize and hobble men who obstruct their vision of revolutionary change, political and otherwise. Now, think of where that leaves us as a society, this entire mindset, and as a country, with our men either neutered or perpetually in a defensive posture dismissive or angry and alienated. Now, that's toxic. If you prefer an America run by a bunch of gender-enlightened bullies, then by all means, vote Democrat. That's going to be fun. And that's “The Angle.” Here to respond is Dan Bongino, Fox News contributor and author of the new book \"Exonerated,\" and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast. All right, Dan. Do you suspect that what the left is clearly doing here will work with voters? DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR & AUTHOR, EXONERATED: No. I think what the left is doing, I think you should thank them. What they are doing actually led to the election of Donald Trump who does what I'm going to do now and tell you, if you think for a second the liberal lunatics out there, I'm going to apologize for being born male and subject myself to your stereotypical prejudgments, you're out of your freaking mind. You're living on the wrong planet. And Donald Trump didn't do it either. But Laura, this is indicative of a bigger problem. We all know where this comes from (inaudible) but everybody dealt (ph) with critical theory and this white patriarchy garbage that's taught to our kids in school. But this is the complete intellectual collapse of the left you're witnessing in live time. We are now living through peak stupid with the left. And this toxic masculinity, white patriarchy nonsense where they've now devolved to judging people exclusively by their gender and their skin color is a marker of the total intellectual collapse of the radical left."

They're saying, no, we're going to check a box because they think - and I think it's selfish. They think it's going to help them get elected.

In this latest case, Buck is accused of injecting a 37-year-old man with, quote, dangerously large doses of methamphetamines on September 11, then refusing to help when the man believed he was overdosing. He survived, but others have not been as lucky. In the past few years, two other men have been found dead in Buck's west Hollywood apartment, 26-year-old Gemmel Moore, 55-year-old Timothy Dean both overdosed on methamphetamine. At the time there wasn't enough evidence to charge Buck even though Gemmel Moore wrote in his journal at the time, quote, \"I've become addicted to the drugs, and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was very painful, but after all the troubles I became addicted.\" And an attorney for Moore's family says it is about time Buck faces consequences. Watch."

So yes, we do think it can eventually lead to justice for the Moore and the Dean families, that's what we're hoping for. We're hoping that the charges are going to be amended and at some point we're going to see manslaughter, murder, negligent homicide, something more serious that will put Ed Buck away in prison for a substantial amount of time."

He would lure them in and then get them addicted, as you saw in that handwritten notes by Mr. Moore. This is a tragic case. When you look back on the facts, and Jasmyne alluded to this, this was known to officials for some time. Why would it take so long, simple case of lack of evidence? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: It's not a simple case of lack of evidence. What we see is what looks like the Harvey Weinstein model, or the Epstein model, where prominent, affluent, influential Democrats in blue cities are literally getting away with murder. We don't need three of these in instances. One of these, you just change the scenario just slightly and put the name of any publicly known Republican, and have this kind of incident happen once, and I assure you they don't stop until they have the guy in handcuffs."

And thirdly, look, at the end of the day, the life expectancy of black men in L.A. county has substantially increased with him being arrested, and that is important because he prayed on black gay men. OK, I know he's a Democrat, I get that, but that's very important."

I can also tell you that within 24 hours of Ed Buck flying Gemmel into Los Angeles from Houston, he was already dead. He paid for Gemmel's flight back to L.A., lured him over to his apartment.

So sad.\" And this guilty parent. \"I fly to see my son on the west coast. I live on the east.\" And a conflicted Keurig lover, \"k- cups! They are just too easy to use. I do use a reusable mug, however.\" Joining me now is Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Ralph, I have a couple of confessions, OK.

Today, that figure has risen to about one out of every three Democrats, and among self-identified liberals, it's 40 percent. And as modern American liberalism has become untethered and disconnected from the foundations of faith and tradition, and traditional religion, they've sought to find surrogates and substitutes in these increasingly politicized, ideological, and humanistic religions, worshiping, in this case, the creation rather than the creator. And I think it is just another example of how they have lost completely touch with the values of middle America."

But again, because of this loss of a connection to traditional religion, look, they have lost the evangelical vote four to one in the last election. They lost the Catholic vote. They are losing churchgoing, Bible believing, traditional America. And so they are desperately searching for something to establish a connection, but the problem is, is that if you are interpreting concern for one's neighbor as eliminating all jet travel, getting rid of the internal combustion engine, that is not going to sell at the ballot box."
