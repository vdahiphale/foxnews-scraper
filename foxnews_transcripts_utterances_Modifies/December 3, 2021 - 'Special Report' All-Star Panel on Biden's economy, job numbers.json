With that, let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Kimberley, what about these numbers, what they tell us about this economy? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": So they tell us that policies matters, and right now the one that are coming out of federal government are having a bad effect on the economy. On the one hand, you've got all these people who are not going back to work because they are still getting transfer payments from the government, whether that is the expanded child tax credit, whether it's rental assistance. On the other hand, you have businesses that for the last 10 months of this administration have been getting hit with a flood of new regulations, which act as taxes, and there is actual taxes proposals that are in the offing that Democrats are offering. So they are pulling back. And we're going to need to see some big changes out of D.C. to really get this economy moving again.",

I think the early part of the show, Bret, and where you are, the fact that we're up competing with China on tech, military, human rights, those are the things that I think that are in the back of the minds of so many Americans. And if I can say one last thing, if we want to do our part as everyday Americans and ensure our economy remains open and schools remain open, those of us are healthy enough to get vaccinated and who have no religious exceptions to the virus, we should get vaccinated, because the best thing for China would be for us to stop working again, for us to close down the economy, for us to close down the schools and impair our ability to compete.",

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's worth remembering that Joe Biden said that his case for being elected was that he would shut down the virus, that he had a plan for doing so. We have now experienced more deaths from coronavirus under President Biden up than we did under President Trump, and that's with President Trump having provided a vaccine. So it's really an unbelievable failure on the part of Joe Biden that he claimed he had some great plan for solving everything and it turned out he didn't really have a plan. And he keeps on just coming up with new measures that don't really work or new ways of forcing things that don't work. And it makes people lose even more trust than they had in these federal policies that were ostensibly supposed to take care of this. The fact of the matter is that this vaccine has been widely available to everyone who wants it for some period of time. There is some resistance to doing it, but that doesn't explain why there are all these other policy failures that the Biden administration is overseeing. They cannot blame the people for their own policy failures or their own inability to take the boot off the neck of the U.S. economy or otherwise keep this economy from coming back. But these job numbers weren't supposed to be that great as they were, half-a-million jobs, and to fail to meet that, which is becoming a bit of a pattern, is very bad signs for Democratic leadership.",
