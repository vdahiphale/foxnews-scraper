The mainstream media really wants you to think that what you see right here is not a mob. I wonder what they said about the Tea Party? We'll remind you. Also President Trump promised a border wall and House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is trying to make it happen. Well, they better do it. He joins me later in the show on what he saw at the border just today. And Raymond Arroyo has, you know, he got a lot of attention for last Friday's fall -- seen around the world -- even from some Hollywood heavyweights. Was it an accident or was it staged? We'll explain in \"Seen and Unseen.\" Plus, the devastating aftermath left in a Hurricane Michael's wake. We are going to monitor that throughout the hour and bring you any important updates so keep it right here. But first, what they are teaching our children. That's a focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Remember the old Graham Nash song?",

Well, one of my sons stopped to look at the TV on Saturday. We're all watching the Kavanaugh vote, and he saw the live feed of some of the chaos outside of the Supreme Court. Like, what's that, he asked. And are they even supposed to be doing that? He was reacting later to scenes like this and video of senators being cornered in elevators. So, I tried to give an explanation that I thought was appropriate for a 10-year-old and said something like, those people, Dimitri, are angry about the Supreme Court and the man -- a friend of mommy's -- President Trump chose as the next justice. And he kind of said, oh, he scrunched up his little nose and said, can't we watch something else? But it made me think a lot about this. The Kavanaugh battle has brought out the worst in the Democrats and our kids are watching. Rather than re-examine their tactics following the seismic defeat, liberals have a decided to go even lower. And by the way, it's not happening just in Washington. In Minneapolis, a special education teacher identified in reports as Samantha Ness was placed on administrative leave for tweeting the following -- \"So whose going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?\" Wait, the first offense is that the teacher doesn't know the difference between the possessive and contraction for who is. The genius followed up with this, \"Brett Kavanaugh will be dealing with death threats for the rest of his life being on the Supreme Court. I doubt my mid-west ass is a real threat.\" This is someone interested to shape young minds? Well, she has since resigned. But I wonder how many others are like her out there. Maybe they're not tweeting but doing other things. And how about this marquee outside of a south Charlotte middle school in North Carolina the other day? It read -- you can see it there, kind of -- \"F\" Kavanaugh. It was apparently created by some leftist vandal. But what an uplifting message for the children to absorb while being dropped off at school. Totally disgraceful. Something has changed since the Kavanaugh nomination. There is a desperate, far more unhinged nastiness on the left that we have seen as well spill into the classroom setting. Remember, universities excused class absences for Cancel Kavanaugh rallies. And that was preceded over the past year by marauding bands of frenzied leftists who are out there vandalizing and destroying historical statutes, well, just because they could and because they suddenly found the statutes offensive. And of course we have the celebrities feeling totally free to threaten the life of the president.",

KEVIN MCCARTHY, R—CALIF., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I don't think the question is if it will pass the House. The name of this bill is Build the Wall, Enforce the Law. So it fully funds the wall $25 billion, but it even does more. Kate's law, which we passed, is a part of this. Stop sanctuary cities. It keeps children safe because it removes the MS-13 gang members.

He joins me later in the show on what he saw at the border just today. And Raymond Arroyo has, you know, he got a lot of attention for last Friday's fall -- seen around the world -- even from some Hollywood heavyweights. Was it an accident or was it staged? We'll explain in \"Seen and Unseen.\" Plus, the devastating aftermath left in a Hurricane Michael's wake.

Well, one of my sons stopped to look at the TV on Saturday. We're all watching the Kavanaugh vote, and he saw the live feed of some of the chaos outside of the Supreme Court. Like, what's that, he asked. And are they even supposed to be doing that? He was reacting later to scenes like this and video of senators being cornered in elevators. So, I tried to give an explanation that I thought was appropriate for a 10-year-old and said something like, those people, Dimitri, are angry about the Supreme Court and the man -- a friend of mommy's -- President Trump chose as the next justice. And he kind of said, oh, he scrunched up his little nose and said, can't we watch something else? But it made me think a lot about this. The Kavanaugh battle has brought out the worst in the Democrats and our kids are watching. Rather than re-examine their tactics following the seismic defeat, liberals have a decided to go even lower. And by the way, it's not happening just in Washington. In Minneapolis, a special education teacher identified in reports as Samantha Ness was placed on administrative leave for tweeting the following -- \"So whose going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?\" Wait, the first offense is that the teacher doesn't know the difference between the possessive and contraction for who is. The genius followed up with this, \"Brett Kavanaugh will be dealing with death threats for the rest of his life being on the Supreme Court. I doubt my mid-west ass is a real threat.\" This is someone interested to shape young minds? Well, she has since resigned. But I wonder how many others are like her out there. Maybe they're not tweeting but doing other things. And how about this marquee outside of a south Charlotte middle school in North Carolina the other day? It read -- you can see it there, kind of -- \"F\" Kavanaugh. It was apparently created by some leftist vandal. But what an uplifting message for the children to absorb while being dropped off at school. Totally disgraceful. Something has changed since the Kavanaugh nomination. There is a desperate, far more unhinged nastiness on the left that we have seen as well spill into the classroom setting. Remember, universities excused class absences for Cancel Kavanaugh rallies. And that was preceded over the past year by marauding bands of frenzied leftists who are out there vandalizing and destroying historical statutes, well, just because they could and because they suddenly found the statutes offensive. And of course we have the celebrities feeling totally free to threaten the life of the president."

Joining us now with insight, it's important to get some, Reagan biographer presidential historian Craig Shirley. Craig, I've been dying to talk to you. As the temperature is rising now, you get the sense especially social media, that's a big difference between now and back in 1969. People are able to coalesce in a place really fast and assault people I public places, you know, verbally or otherwise. But how did Reagan deal with it and how might we learn from that?"

It may have been Bill Clinton probably now, but the hippie was carrying a sign that said, \"Make Love, Not War.\" Reagan looked at the hippie and he looked at the sign and he turned to an aide and says, \"You know, from the looks of him, I don't think he would do either.\""

    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Could this be the breakthrough Trump voters have been wanting? House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy introduced a bill earlier this week that would fund President Trump's wall on the southern border, but it's got to move fast. If this bill passes the House it would have to go through the Senate with 60 votes to avoid a filibuster before January. Could that possibly happen? The congressman joins us on that and his trip to the border today. All right, Congressman McCarthy, great to see you. If this were to pass the House, and that's a big if, how does the Senate have any stomach or the votes for this? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R—CALIF., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I don't think the question is if it will pass the House. The name of this bill is Build the Wall, Enforce the Law. So it fully funds the wall $25 billion, but it even does more. Kate's law, which we passed, is a part of this. Stop sanctuary cities. It keeps children safe because it removes the MS-13 gang members. And it denounces this movement like in San Francisco that allows illegals to vote in our election. But I watched what McConnell just said today. He said we're going to have a vigorous fight over the wall in December. And watching what this Senate was able to do with Kavanaugh, I believe this gives them the opportunity and the time to get this done once and for all."

So it's frustrating to a lot of us who pushed that so hard, Congressman, and I applaud you for getting to this now. But we're frustrated. A story today, I think I just saw today in Arizona, you probably saw it, a detention facility there was so full of all these people still streaming across the border, can't separate families. It's so full, they just had to do a mass release. And that shouldn't be happening, not with this president. He doesn't want this stuff."

They care more about their liberal social construct being foisted on America, open borders, open markets, redefining gender fluidity, whatever, throw it into the mix, whatever it is, it's not about the kids or the rule of law. They don't care about that. It's about redefining America as a borderless place that no better than any other place on earth. That's what it's about."

With allowing what they've done in San Francisco today, allowing illegals to vote in our elections. Or when they want to eliminate ICE. I would wish every American would spend one day with the border patrol agent. I was down in El Paso. This was the first place of the border control began. They call it where the legend all began. If they spent one day with them, I don't think there would be any question about building this wall and keeping our community --"

No coverage of this for the most part in the mainstream media, zero. And again, they care about women, but we have a woman raped at the hands of an illegal alien and it's just like it never even happened. Congressman, I have got to get you to react to this ever-increasing, rapid, moblike atmosphere among a very strong, virulent strain of the Democrat Party. Maxine Water reacted to the mob question.

Yes, we are shouting out, we have signs, we are saying what we think.

If they secured 85 percent of our vote, they would lose. They need to achieve more than 85 percent of the black vote to sustain their party. So they have gone to great lengths to smear Kanye West. And what they said last night was not only racist, it was absolutely despicable. I cannot believe that it would be allowed on any network, least of all having a host of laughing as if it's funny."

I got in trouble with poor old LeBron James, I was just teasing him. They were like, you can't say -- it's like you can't joke, but they can say the most horrific things possible, and you are shut down. What does this mean, though, for the Democratic Party? I think they are worried, are they not, Candace? You've broken through in your own way in politics. You just kind of come onto the scene with Turning Point USA. There are others coming forward saying, the demonization of Donald Trump and the Republicans, the economy is doing really well -- the market is down today, but this kind of thing happens. But stuff is going pretty well and these people seem really angry all the time. It kind of doesn't compute at some point."

They had no idea that there was any chance that conservatives might come after the cultural war. They won the cultural wore a long time ago. So for Kanye West to stand up and to say that I support Donald Trump, that terrifies them. So they are going to say whatever they can to smear him to make sure that no other black people wake up and understand that it has been the left that has harmed our community. It has been Democrat policies that have rendered our communities in the shape that they are in today when we talk about Chicago and Philadelphia, and all the major cities that they have run down. Black people are having a mass awakening, and Kanye West is a big part of the reason why."

First and foremost, Kanye is very educated about the Democrat Party and the history of the Democrat Party. Beyond that, Kanye West really does believe in uniting both sides and going forward. We know the left, they want to make sure everybody is separate. They want to keep the themes of racism alive. They like fearmongering. Kanye West is not about any of those things. He really wants to see a world that is better than the world that we were in yesterday. He sees a unique opportunity in Donald Trump because he sees that our president is courageous. He's willing to say the things that need to be said. And we haven't had that, certainly for the last eight years while Barack Obama was in office."
