      "sentences": "It's sad. One of my first jobs is working in the juvenile justice department and I wanted to help these young people get off the street and make sure that they didn't go into the court system. But the judge was very strict. So, they always say, Lawrence, you there as a resource to give them programs but I've got to give them consequences or it's just going to be the same thing over and over again. This is how we train our children to know that there's consequences for their actions. But what we have right now with the Democrats is an ideology. They don't believe people should be behind bars. And I've been in the criminal justice reform movement for a minute. I don't know when they decided to shift this narrative. It used to be equal justice under law. Getting some of these disparities out of way whether it's over policing or if there was targeting in some cases. That is no longer the mission. These D.A.'s have a mission and they believe that people should be back on the street. Our jail system was created for people that are at risk to society, and they don't believe that to be the case. They believe everyone can be reformed. What we've seen in these big cities is repeat offenders. We know who these people are. So, I guess my message to the left is, when is enough, enough? You know what's going to happen, eventually people are going to get fed up and Democrats and Republicans are going to have people in there that are going to be strong-armed, and then it's going to swing all the far to the right and Democrats are going to be really mad, but that's going to come when people get fed up with their conditions.",

It's like every -- you hear a new weapon that happens to one of Eric Adams volunteers, but this happens and because the left, and what's coming out of academia, are reinterpreting actual cartel assistance as oppression. So when Andrew Yang at the debate says look, we really need to get these folks off the street, into the hospitals because they're hurting themselves and they're hurting others, you get some idiot like Michelle Goldberg at the New York Times who claims that that's somehow selfish and that it's --",

There is no response, the only way forward is down. So, I wrote my notes I have three -- this is four reasons. One, the abandonment of its sentence, we talked about that, prison and bail were incentives to keep your nose clean. The twisted liberal view that somehow, it's a moral right to leave a distractive mentally deranged life on the streets, but then you have, finally, the woke distraction. Mayors and governors and bureaucracy get by with this criminal neglect by waiving the right flag, by celebrating the right holiday, by using the right pronoun, by supporting the right parades, somehow, that deflects from there just degradation of the cities that they run.",

But that's what propelled Eric Adams to the top of the pack there and he didn't even get the endorsement actually at the police union. Andrew Yang did get that. But his background in law enforcement as a New York City police chief captain and even looking at Val Demings, someone who is the first black females police chief in Orlando, and listening to them talk about how we can address these issues, there is a hell of a lot of compassion in there, but there are also smart solutions and things that a vast of Americans agree with.

Last summer, mostly peaceful, don't worry about those businesses that are being burned down, but then the Capitol Hill riots the world is coming to an end. And then like now, that metropolitan mayhem, the police are the problem or the Republicans or Donald Trump if you're listening to James Ghulam (Ph) Carville. Democrats think that some crime is OK and they think that some crime is not OK. And if you look at the capitol, right after the Capitol Hill riots Republicans came out loudly forcefully and genuinely condemn that violence. And the people are being prosecuted. Its 480 defendants so far, up to 550 people will be prosecuted by the attorney general and by the Justice Department and unprecedented in scale case according to the attorney general.

It's crime and no punishment in America's biggest city as violent spikes all across the country. Remember how New York City was rocked by looting last summer while a new report says prosecutors are dropping charges for hundreds of people who were arrested. D.A.'s are reportedly blaming a lack of evidence and COVID-related court delays for why they didn't prosecute. The New York Post summing up the situation this way, let them loot. And more brazen crimes caught on camera police naming a suspect in this horrific video showing a man getting shot after falling into two children on the sidewalk. Luckily no one was killed. And out in Chicago during a Puerto Rican pride parade celebration a 24 - year-old man was shot in the head at point-blank range and a woman in his car was shot in the neck. At last report she was in critical condition and the man died. Former police chief James Craig blaming the crisis on the lack of common sense."

One of my first jobs is working in the juvenile justice department and I wanted to help these young people get off the street and make sure that they didn't go into the court system. But the judge was very strict. So, they always say, Lawrence, you there as a resource to give them programs but I've got to give them consequences or it's just going to be the same thing over and over again. This is how we train our children to know that there's consequences for their actions. But what we have right now with the Democrats is an ideology. They don't believe people should be behind bars. And I've been in the criminal justice reform movement for a minute. I don't know when they decided to shift this narrative. It used to be equal justice under law. Getting some of these disparities out of way whether it's over policing or if there was targeting in some cases. That is no longer the mission. These D.A.'s have a mission and they believe that people should be back on the street. Our jail system was created for people that are at risk to society, and they don't believe that to be the case. They believe everyone can be reformed. What we've seen in these big cities is repeat offenders. We know who these people are. So, I guess my message to the left is, when is enough, enough? You know what's going to happen, eventually people are going to get fed up and Democrats and Republicans are going to have people in there that are going to be strong-armed, and then it's going to swing all the far to the right and Democrats are going to be really mad, but that's going to come when people get fed up with their conditions."

It's like every -- you hear a new weapon that happens to one of Eric Adams volunteers, but this happens and because the left, and what's coming out of academia, are reinterpreting actual cartel assistance as oppression. So when Andrew Yang at the debate says look, we really need to get these folks off the street, into the hospitals because they're hurting themselves and they're hurting others, you get some idiot like Michelle Goldberg at the New York Times who claims that that's somehow selfish and that it's --"

In a sense, they are weaponizing compassion to stifle speech, and then that reflects -- I mean, what that reflex allows for is no adult solution. Right? There is no response, the only way forward is down. So, I wrote my notes I have three -- this is four reasons. One, the abandonment of its sentence, we talked about that, prison and bail were incentives to keep your nose clean. The twisted liberal view that somehow, it's a moral right to leave a distractive mentally deranged life on the streets, but then you have, finally, the woke distraction. Mayors and governors and bureaucracy get by with this criminal neglect by waiving the right flag, by celebrating the right holiday, by using the right pronoun, by supporting the right parades, somehow, that deflects from there just degradation of the cities that they run."

Obviously, as someone who is a member of the Democratic Party, I don't agree with the hot take that we're pro- crime and that we don't care about anything. But what I will say to the points that were made earlier about they are becoming a pro law and order Democratic constituency, that is what has - and we'll see what happens tomorrow when it's the last day, it's the primary day for the mayoral race. But that's what propelled Eric Adams to the top of the pack there and he didn't even get the endorsement actually at the police union. Andrew Yang did get that. But his background in law enforcement as a New York City police chief captain and even looking at Val Demings, someone who is the first black females police chief in Orlando, and listening to them talk about how we can address these issues, there is a hell of a lot of compassion in there, but there are also smart solutions and things that a vast of Americans agree with. We all at this table know reform is needed. Right. That's across-the-board and every one of the cities certainly so that we don't end up with another George Floyd situation."

The question then is we've been doing this story like three times a week for like four months, right? Is there any persuasion going on between these two camps, right? It seems like it's the never-ending game of rhetorical ping pong. There was one moment of persuasion that leaped beyond this two -- these two idea of prison, of compassion, and process that we seem to be locked into. And we all know we're locked into it and that was the wall that was symbolically and practically perfect persuasion solution. Because you put it up there, it actually blocks traffic and it sends a message at the same time. And the message was seek legal recourse if you want to enter America, you can't do it this way. That was like the best way to do this. But because it was Trump and it was a -- you can't -- every solution now is always going to be, but Trump, right? Remain in Mexico, but Trump. Title 42, but Trump. So now, there's no way again, no way to go but down. There's only one solution and that is like, we can't do anything about it because we're evil."
