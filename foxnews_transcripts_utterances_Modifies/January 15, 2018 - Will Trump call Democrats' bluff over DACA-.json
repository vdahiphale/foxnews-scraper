      "sentences": "This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. We have so much good stuff for you tonight. I don't know if we will fit it into an hour. We will try. Don't move the dial, keep it park right there. Because with the deadline looming this week, how is President Trump going to deal with the Democrats who are now starting to shut down the government if they don't get a DACA deal?  And we recall the heart and soul of Martin Luther King on this day. The inconvenient truth the left eye has tries pretty hard to ignore. That's MLK's deep and abiding faith.  And what state has the worst poverty in America? The answer will probably shock you, and it's more proof that you can't spend your way out of problems.  And the celebrity freak-out over that erroneous missile alert in Hawaii. My choice words for them are straight ahead. But we begin tonight with the race to the bottom this Martin Luther King Day. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase, Dr. King said more than 50 years ago. Beautiful. President Trump showed good faith last week in that bipartisan meeting where he allowed the cameras in for almost an hour as they discussed DACA and immigration. And although, he didn't see the entire staircase leading to the final agreement, he told Democrats and Republicans, all of them that were present, what he needed to get yes. He needed an end to chain migration and the wall in exchange for a path to legalization for those 800,000 illegal immigrants.  Two days later, the Democrats, acting in bad faith along with Lindsey graham, presented him a deal that they knew he couldn't accept, it increased chain migration and did not sufficiently fund the wall. A total nonstarter.   So, after the president nixed it, Senator Durbin rushed out to mischaracterize off-color remarks about the corruption in the third world that drives citizens of those countries away into the United States. That set off a firestorm. Everyone from Al Sharpton to LeBron James weighed in declaring Trump toxic on the issue of race and then despicable columns like this further poison the well. I love that by Charles Blow. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus predictably are piling on.",

Home ownership among African-Americans has kicked up to 42 percent.

On my radio show today, author and Hoover Institution fellow, Shelby Steel, had these choice words for Congressman Lewis.   SHELBY STEELE, HOOVER INSTITUTION FELLOW (via telephone): John Lewis is -- lacks the imagination and has been so well rewarded for his history of protest that he just keeps beating the drum. He keeps trying to protest thinking that that's what's going to get us ahead. It's not. Protest is over for black Americans.

It's pretty obvious why the Democrats have themselves so worked up into this racial frenzy. They are petrified of a Republican president who actually delivers tangible economic results for black and Hispanic Americans. Democrats are racial monopolists and they are not about to allow President Trump to break their strangle hold on the black and Hispanic voters without a really nasty fight, which is what you are seeing right now.   Check this out. The Atlantic is reporting that the president's support among African-Americans is up. That's \"The Atlantic\" magazine. Not a conservative think tank. In fact, that support among African-Americans has nearly doubled.  When he was elected back in 2016, only 13 percent of black men supported Trump. Now according to a new survey of more than 600,000 people, Trump support among African-American men is up to 23 percent. He has also gone up somewhat with black women from 4 percent, a pathetic number in 2016, to a little bit better 11 percent in this latest poll. I'm telling you this. As a financial benefit of Trump policies touch the pocketbook in the neighborhood of the black community, the old Democratic charges and hysteria will look more and more unhinged. Now is this really what Dr. King dreamed about? Faith, freedom and equal opportunity or at the heart of Dr. King's vision for his fellow Americans and fellow black Americans. And today, who was closer to helping more of our citizens realize that vision?   President Trump, who in a year has already shown incredible results or Democrats, who, when they were out of power and out of ideas, simply call their opponents racist? I think you know the answer. And that's the Angle. Joining us now for reaction from Easley, South Carolina is Pastor Mark Burns, who supported President Trump during the campaign, and with me here in Washington is Wendy Osefo, who is a Democratic strategist.

The idyllic islands of Hawaii were ripped with panic on Saturday when someone screwed up leaving residents thinking the worst for almost 40 minutes. Parents threw children down storm drains for protection. I wouldn't have thought of that. Others try to find basements to shelter in until they got the oops, it was a mistake message. Nothing funny about this at all, though. But the instant reaction among some Hollywood lunatrons, that's another story, really funny. Two in particular stood out, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jim Carrey. Jamie Lee knew who was really to blame for the flubbed warning, tweeting \"This Hawaii missile scare is on you, Mr. Trump. The real fear that mothers and fathers and children felt is on you. It's on your arrogance, hubris, narcissism, rage, ego, immaturity and your unstable idiocy. Shame on your hate-filled self. You did this!\" Since it may be her only frame of reference, Jamie wants her followers to believe that Trump is Michael Myers from the \"Halloween\" franchise. Never mind this was a screw up by the Democratically run state of Hawaii, Jamie Lee. Millennials may know Jamie Lee Curtis from the Activia yogurt adds, remember it makes you regular, but she was a pretty big star back in her day. However, when you are that hateful without a single fact on your side, Jamie, all I can say is you are far from perfect. Remember that movie with John Travolta? I might not look to her for political analysis, but if I'm looking for a great pair of leg warmers I'm calling her first. But we are still looking forward to her appearance and \"Halloween 40.\" I wish I were kidding. They are filming it. And then there's Jim Carrey, the actor and comedian known for his groundbreaking work in \"Liar, Liar\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\" He tweeted \"If we allow this one man Gomorrah and his corrupt Republican Congress to continue alienating the world we are headed for suffering beyond all imagination.\" Never understating things. Suffering, you mean what moviegoers went through watching much of your output over the last 20 years? Masterpieces like \"Me, Myself, and Irene,\" \"The Cable Guy,\" \"Fun with Dick and Jane,\" and the real tour de force, \"The Number 23.\" Pardon us if we ignore your political theorizing, Jim. Sorry, I can't let the moment pass without mentioning the worst \"Batman\" movie ever, \"Batman Forever.\" He did rock the green leotard playing the Riddler and that pinkish red dye job.",

Don't move the dial, keep it park right there. Because with the deadline looming this week, how is President Trump going to deal with the Democrats who are now starting to shut down the government if they don't get a DACA deal? And we recall the heart and soul of Martin Luther King on this day. The inconvenient truth the left eye has tries pretty hard to ignore. That's MLK's deep and abiding faith. And what state has the worst poverty in America? The answer will probably shock you, and it's more proof that you can't spend your way out of problems. And the celebrity freak-out over that erroneous missile alert in Hawaii. My choice words for them are straight ahead. But we begin tonight with the race to the bottom this Martin Luther King Day. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase, Dr. King said more than 50 years ago. Beautiful. President Trump showed good faith last week in that bipartisan meeting where he allowed the cameras in for almost an hour as they discussed DACA and immigration. And although, he didn't see the entire staircase leading to the final agreement, he told Democrats and Republicans, all of them that were present, what he needed to get yes. He needed an end to chain migration and the wall in exchange for a path to legalization for those 800,000 illegal immigrants. Two days later, the Democrats, acting in bad faith along with Lindsey graham, presented him a deal that they knew he couldn't accept, it increased chain migration and did not sufficiently fund the wall. A total nonstarter. So, after the president nixed it, Senator Durbin rushed out to mischaracterize off-color remarks about the corruption in the third world that drives citizens of those countries away into the United States. That set off a firestorm. Everyone from Al Sharpton to LeBron James weighed in declaring Trump toxic on the issue of race and then despicable columns like this further poison the well. I love that by Charles Blow. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus predictably are piling on."

Unemployment among African-Americans was 7.9 percent in 2016. Last month it was down over a point to 6.8 percent, that's a record. Weekly earnings for African-Americans up nearly 2 percent. Home ownership among African-Americans has kicked up to 42 percent. Given the success of Trump's policies for black America and the left's tragic record, they have decided to demonize the president as a racist. It's all they have.

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's why I love radio. You hear from real people every day. It's my own focus group, ongoing. It's pretty obvious why the Democrats have themselves so worked up into this racial frenzy. They are petrified of a Republican president who actually delivers tangible economic results for black and Hispanic Americans. Democrats are racial monopolists and they are not about to allow President Trump to break their strangle hold on the black and Hispanic voters without a really nasty fight, which is what you are seeing right now. Check this out. The Atlantic is reporting that the president's support among African-Americans is up. That's \"The Atlantic\" magazine. Not a conservative think tank. In fact, that support among African-Americans has nearly doubled. When he was elected back in 2016, only 13 percent of black men supported Trump. Now according to a new survey of more than 600,000 people, Trump support among African-American men is up to 23 percent. He has also gone up somewhat with black women from 4 percent, a pathetic number in 2016, to a little bit better 11 percent in this latest poll. I'm telling you this. As a financial benefit of Trump policies touch the pocketbook in the neighborhood of the black community, the old Democratic charges and hysteria will look more and more unhinged. Now is this really what Dr. King dreamed about? Faith, freedom and equal opportunity or at the heart of Dr. King's vision for his fellow Americans and fellow black Americans. And today, who was closer to helping more of our citizens realize that vision? President Trump, who in a year has already shown incredible results or Democrats, who, when they were out of power and out of ideas, simply call their opponents racist? I think you know the answer. And that's the Angle. Joining us now for reaction from Easley, South Carolina is Pastor Mark Burns, who supported President Trump during the campaign, and with me here in Washington is Wendy Osefo, who is a Democratic strategist. Great to see both of you. Happy MLK Day. Wendy, let's start with you. Tell me what I got wrong in that angle."

Obama has started this trend. So, for the president to take ownership of that, it's completely statistically dubious because he cannot. The president, Obama, was the one who started this trend. Second of all, when it comes to Trump, he hasn't done anything tangible that we can point to, to say that he has helped African-Americans. What's really important here is causation does not equate correlation. Just because he is in the office does not mean he caused things to happen."

    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "It's not that they are misguided, but one thing I wanted to say that's really important before I let the pastor talk is that African- American and black is not the same thing. When we talk about statistics and use those words interchangeably, we are measuring for two different groups and populations. Because when you say black you are including Haitians, Nigerians, people from -- they do count. That's why though statistics are more important is the ones that survey black Americans, not the ones who just survey African- Americans because you are excluding a large majority of people."

I'm an American. The fact is Dr. Martin Luther King did not fight and die so that we could inherit black America. He fought and died so we as black people can be Americans. We already had black America in segregation. You went to black stories, black people sat together. You lived in black communities, black neighborhoods. We already had black America, that's why Dr. King marched. That's why Rosa Parks sat down and didn't stand up. It's because we as black Americans, we fought, and Dr. King fought and others before me fought so that we can be Americans and the fact is the Democratic Party will hone in on anything that will paint the president as a racist because it's a distraction to the real issue. African-American is at an all-time low in the history of unemployment."

Without the perpetual I'm a victim, I'm a victim, I'm a victim mentality that you drill into people's heads, you are a victim, you don't have an equal shot. If you work hard you are not going to get ahead. What kind of messages that to tell young people today? He went on and on about this today. It was riveting radio. I think when things are getting better and people refuse to acknowledge it and say I'm a victim, I don't think that helps a single person get a job. If I don't think it helps a single young African-American man or woman have more hope. I think it tracks people down. People should be lifted up as they are in a growing economy. Wendy, I will let you respond."

It doesn't help where I'm from in Florida -- we care about port security and Coast Guard and other things. I think you have to put something out there to get a response from the president."

This is an easy solution and I think it's great that Darren is on your having a conversation and it sounds like he wants to get a deal. But the deal that was proposed is the Democrats get everything where you give legal status to DREAMers and you give Donald Trump 10 percent of what he wants, which is for his wall. We reverse that was that we will take 10 percent of the DREAMers, they get to stay, and get 100 percent of the wall, Darren would be here with his hair on fire saying that's not fair. Let's cut a deal that works for the DREAMers were we secure the border, we end chain migration, and we once and for all deal with these kids. Laura, this is about compassion and love and Trump talks about this all the time. The compassion and love of the Trump policy is you give certainty to the DREAMers. You end the next generation of DREAMers because you have a wall there to stop them from coming in. But not only that, it's compassionate for America because we stop the meth and they heroin in the human trafficking and the drugs that come over and across our border. This is a great policy that works for our country, for DREAMers. I think both sides can cut a deal, but you have Nancy Pelosi who is out there right now saying I want only DREAMer legislation and nothing for Donald Trump. That standoff leads us to a potential shutdown on behalf of Democrats. I think it's wrong."

I would urge your audience to go to Google and type in \"Knock at Midnight Sermon.\" And it's a knock at midnight sermon, a deeply religious sermon. Or when Jesus calls a man a fool. Indeed the source of Martin Luther King's inspiration was a book called the Bible which he quoted more than any hundred books combined, Laura."

For modern man, absolute right and wrong are a matter of what the majority is doing. Right and wrong are relative to likes and dislikes and the customs of a particular community. We've unconsciously applied Einstein's theory of relativity, which properly describe the physical universe, to the moral and ethical realm. This mentality has brought a tragic breakdown of moral standards and the midnight of moral degeneration deepens.\" Antjuan, I love that passage that lee put in his column today. But he's right. You don't really hear Dr. King talking about moral relativism. I don't know what he would think about what's happened to our country today. But that was pretty amazing."

And if you look at Dr. King's body of work and the things he fought for, justice and equality and fighting for the least of these, he really stood for what the Bible talked about in Matthew 25 and 40 in fighting for the least of these. When you look at what's going on in our country right now, Laura, I don't think that Dr. King would be pleased about the current people occupying our government on what they feel and what they're doing toward the least of these. Dr. King was about expanding our rights to vote at the ballot box. He was about health care for everyone. He was about making sure that we have a fair and balanced criminal justice system. He was about making sure that poor people have the resources they need to be pulled out of certain situations. I don't think we have that going on right now in our government, Laura."

The churches get smaller. Antjuan, this is just a fact. And we know in this great country the out of wedlock birth rate is 40 percent. That's white, black and Latino combined.

Once the family dissolves, as it has across all racial lines, especially hard-hit are African-American families and young men. Hard hit. Once that happens, government can really not save you.

Times revealed that California spent nearly $958 billion from 1992 to 2015 and is home to one of the three -- one in three of the nation's welfare recipients, a third. It has 883,000 full-time state and local government employees. That's all. And as a result it's home to 25 percent of the nation's total homeless population. Wow. This liberal dystopia is exactly the type of governance the left wants to leash on the country. Why not? It's working well for California. With us from L.A. is someone with firsthand knowledge of this dire situation. Shirley Husar is a columnist for \"The Washington Times\" and CEO of Urban Game Changer. Shirley, I was stunned to see this piece in the \"L.A. Times\" today. I've got friends from L.A. who were texting me, I said I've already read it. It didn't really surprise me because you and I have been talking about this for so many years.

California is being held hostage by a liberal progressive agenda to tax the middle class very heavily. We have gas tax. We have taxes within our bills when we go out and eat in L.A. city called a healthy tax. You know Laura, there's this old saying that if California goes then the rest of the country goes as well.

It's the drumbeat despite really good and powerful economic news in just one year. We had a guest on earlier, she was very nice but she said, look, Barack Obama is the one who really brought unemployment down from 16 percent among African-Americans to 7.8 percent. So he's the one who really deserves the credit. That was quite a big drop, but nevertheless in a year we've seen huge economic gains for African-Americans under Trump. He gets no credit."

It's devastating for blacks in California. They are using us as a progressive liberal agenda. Here we are, Martin Luther King, the 50th anniversary. The signs they have in California, they said that AIDS is a civil rights issue, and they used the face of Dr. King on billboards in California. They are playing with the minds of African-Americans and taking our legacy as hostage.

The idyllic islands of Hawaii were ripped with panic on Saturday when someone screwed up leaving residents thinking the worst for almost 40 minutes. Parents threw children down storm drains for protection. I wouldn't have thought of that. Others try to find basements to shelter in until they got the oops, it was a mistake message. Nothing funny about this at all, though. But the instant reaction among some Hollywood lunatrons, that's another story, really funny. Two in particular stood out, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jim Carrey. Jamie Lee knew who was really to blame for the flubbed warning, tweeting \"This Hawaii missile scare is on you, Mr. Trump. The real fear that mothers and fathers and children felt is on you. It's on your arrogance, hubris, narcissism, rage, ego, immaturity and your unstable idiocy. Shame on your hate-filled self. You did this!\" Since it may be her only frame of reference, Jamie wants her followers to believe that Trump is Michael Myers from the \"Halloween\" franchise. Never mind this was a screw up by the Democratically run state of Hawaii, Jamie Lee. Millennials may know Jamie Lee Curtis from the Activia yogurt adds, remember it makes you regular, but she was a pretty big star back in her day. However, when you are that hateful without a single fact on your side, Jamie, all I can say is you are far from perfect. Remember that movie with John Travolta? I might not look to her for political analysis, but if I'm looking for a great pair of leg warmers I'm calling her first. But we are still looking forward to her appearance and \"Halloween 40.\" I wish I were kidding. They are filming it. And then there's Jim Carrey, the actor and comedian known for his groundbreaking work in \"Liar, Liar\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\" He tweeted \"If we allow this one man Gomorrah and his corrupt Republican Congress to continue alienating the world we are headed for suffering beyond all imagination.\" Never understating things. Suffering, you mean what moviegoers went through watching much of your output over the last 20 years? Masterpieces like \"Me, Myself, and Irene,\" \"The Cable Guy,\" \"Fun with Dick and Jane,\" and the real tour de force, \"The Number 23.\" Pardon us if we ignore your political theorizing, Jim. Sorry, I can't let the moment pass without mentioning the worst \"Batman\" movie ever, \"Batman Forever.\" He did rock the green leotard playing the Riddler and that pinkish red dye job."
