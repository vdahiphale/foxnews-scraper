And tonight, more baseless lies from Democrats who continue to insist that voter ID laws in Georgia and Texas are racist but somehow they're not racist in Biden's home state with restrictive laws in Delaware. Plus, more shocking footage from New York as crime spirals even more out of control. New video showing a violent mob attacking an off-duty firefighter. And former Senator Barbara Boxer in California -- well, she was just mugged in northern California. Also tonight, a breaking new report detailing the long-standing ties between zero experience Hunter Biden's art dealer and the country of China. A big shock. And coming up, boxing legend George Foreman, he is going to weigh in on the anthem in the Pledge of Allegiance and what's going on in the Olympics. But we start tonight, in city after city, the left's draconian pandemic restrictions, they are now coming back. Vaccine mandates are creeping into public policy, including new requirements for New York City workers and V.A. employees and now mask mandates in L.A., St. Louis, Savannah, Georgia. Many other liberal cities are -- they're now bringing these mandates back and that's not all. Two months ago, it was Joe Biden who proudly declared a policy of vaxxed or masked. Well, now, the CDC is considering a revised new, new, new, new policy of that vaxxed and masked. Now, how many more mixed messages will the American people be given? No mask, one mask, two masks, no mask, some masks, mask indoors, mask outdoors and maybe masks in perpetuity and now, it's -- oh, never mind what we said before? And remember, according to Democrats, the media mob and the great flip- flop, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- well, life was supposed to return to normal for vaccinated Americans. That's what they told us, you might remember. Take a look.",

Again, even if you're fully vaccinated, how is this following the science that they lectured us every day that was supposed to follow are we supposed to ignore the science for example from the Cleveland Clinic? Very well- respected medical institution that if you had COVID, you don't need any vaccine. Oh, spoiler alert, the mask-obsessed left in America is not following the science and they're trying to blame conservatives for vaccine hesitancy when it's they themselves that are causing a lot of it. They're panicking. They're flailing, flipping and flopping daily. Now, this might be a surprise for anyone in the media mob who is tuning in for the first time. But, well, I've been saying for months and months and months over and over and over again -- yeah, you better take this virus, seriously. Yes, it's deadly we can read the numbers. And it can kill you. I do believe in science. I believe in the science of vaccination. But I'm not your doctor. I'm not going to give you or anybody medical advice. And frankly, like many Americans, I'm fed up with the ever-changing policies and advice -- they can't seem -- it's like the gang that can't shoot straight. So, yeah, take this seriously. Do your own extensive research. Talk to actual medical professionals you trust. Talk to your own doctor or doctors. Look at the data, factor in your unique medical history, your current medical condition. Make your own decision in consultation with your doctors. But if Democrats, if the media mob continue to panic, downplay the efficacy of vaccines with mask mandates and lockdowns -- well, the trust will be eroded even further and perhaps even shattered forever. And, by the way, if Democrats are truly concerned about the dangers of COVID-19, maybe they should be addressing that ongoing crisis at our southern border because for the past six months, we have a record number of migrants, the biggest number now looks like it will be in 25 years from all over the world, they have been pouring into this country illegally, almost all of them are completely unvaccinated. Most if not all of them hardly any are tested for COVID-19. There's been a high rate of COVID positivity when tested. And yet as we speak, the Biden administration -- they're actually dispersing them into towns and cities and counties all over the country. So to recap, according to Democrats. In order to be a good citizen, you must listen to them, even though their opinion changes by the hour. You've got a mask up socially distance. Take many precautionary measures. But when it comes to the southern border, oh, COVID-19, it's not a priority down there and those that are even being offered vaccines, foxnews.com had a report if you be -- if you're entering the country illegally, about a third of them turn it down. But they still let them in. How does that make any sense at all? Here with more, we have live from La Jolla, Texas, investigative reporter, FOX News contributor Sara Carter.

However, if you're, for example, affiliated with the last administration, you get a pre-dawn raid, you know, by a SWAT team or you get arrested and prosecuted for being a foreign agent, and you haven't registered for it. I wonder if Hunter ever registers as a foreign agent. Well, how about his background check that Secret Service personnel apparently tried to get those background check information when he threw that -- or when his girlfriend, his sister-in-law threw his gun away in that dumpster?

      "utterance": "Welcome to HANNITY. And tonight, more baseless lies from Democrats who continue to insist that voter ID laws in Georgia and Texas are racist but somehow they're not racist in Biden's home state with restrictive laws in Delaware. Plus, more shocking footage from New York as crime spirals even more out of control. New video showing a violent mob attacking an off-duty firefighter. And former Senator Barbara Boxer in California -- well, she was just mugged in northern California. Also tonight, a breaking new report detailing the long-standing ties between zero experience Hunter Biden's art dealer and the country of China. A big shock. And coming up, boxing legend George Foreman, he is going to weigh in on the anthem in the Pledge of Allegiance and what's going on in the Olympics. But we start tonight, in city after city, the left's draconian pandemic restrictions, they are now coming back. Vaccine mandates are creeping into public policy, including new requirements for New York City workers and V.A. employees and now mask mandates in L.A., St. Louis, Savannah, Georgia. Many other liberal cities are -- they're now bringing these mandates back and that's not all. Two months ago, it was Joe Biden who proudly declared a policy of vaxxed or masked. Well, now, the CDC is considering a revised new, new, new, new policy of that vaxxed and masked. Now, how many more mixed messages will the American people be given? No mask, one mask, two masks, no mask, some masks, mask indoors, mask outdoors and maybe masks in perpetuity and now, it's -- oh, never mind what we said before? And remember, according to Democrats, the media mob and the great flip- flop, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- well, life was supposed to return to normal for vaccinated Americans.

      "utterance": "And that was just a few weeks ago, and now, we're just supposed to accept another new normal the 100th new normal with masks and social distancing and lockdowns even if you're vaccinated indefinitely? Again, even if you're fully vaccinated, how is this following the science that they lectured us every day that was supposed to follow are we supposed to ignore the science for example from the Cleveland Clinic? Very well- respected medical institution that if you had COVID, you don't need any vaccine. Oh, spoiler alert, the mask-obsessed left in America is not following the science and they're trying to blame conservatives for vaccine hesitancy when it's they themselves that are causing a lot of it. They're panicking. They're flailing, flipping and flopping daily. Now, this might be a surprise for anyone in the media mob who is tuning in for the first time. But, well, I've been saying for months and months and months over and over and over again -- yeah, you better take this virus, seriously. Yes, it's deadly we can read the numbers. And it can kill you. I do believe in science. I believe in the science of vaccination. But I'm not your doctor. I'm not going to give you or anybody medical advice. And frankly, like many Americans, I'm fed up with the ever-changing policies and advice -- they can't seem -- it's like the gang that can't shoot straight. So, yeah, take this seriously. Do your own extensive research. Talk to actual medical professionals you trust. Talk to your own doctor or doctors. Look at the data, factor in your unique medical history, your current medical condition. Make your own decision in consultation with your doctors. But if Democrats, if the media mob continue to panic, downplay the efficacy of vaccines with mask mandates and lockdowns -- well, the trust will be eroded even further and perhaps even shattered forever. And, by the way, if Democrats are truly concerned about the dangers of COVID-19, maybe they should be addressing that ongoing crisis at our southern border because for the past six months, we have a record number of migrants, the biggest number now looks like it will be in 25 years from all over the world, they have been pouring into this country illegally, almost all of them are completely unvaccinated. Most if not all of them hardly any are tested for COVID-19. There's been a high rate of COVID positivity when tested. And yet as we speak, the Biden administration -- they're actually dispersing them into towns and cities and counties all over the country. So to recap, according to Democrats. In order to be a good citizen, you must listen to them, even though their opinion changes by the hour. You've got a mask up socially distance. Take many precautionary measures. But when it comes to the southern border, oh, COVID-19, it's not a priority down there and those that are even being offered vaccines, foxnews.com had a report if you be -- if you're entering the country illegally, about a third of them turn it down. But they still let them in. How does that make any sense at all? Here with more, we have live from La Jolla, Texas, investigative reporter, FOX News contributor Sara Carter.

Now, we've seen those numbers rise. Among 46 states, the numbers of COVID patients on the rise, the number of hospitalizations. But listen to Chris Cabrera, he is the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council and they have been fighting both the DHS, as well as the border patrol for the actual facts on the number of people that have actually entered the United States with COVID and they're not getting those numbers."

So we have a lot of heat casualties, we are seeing a lot more people coming over with COVID. We've had some agents just recently test positive and we've had quite a few of the people coming across test positive as well. And unfortunately, with those, they just get released in the United States. But I think the only way to solve this is, is a mandatory detention, mandatory removal, secure the border, get everything secured, from east to west. And once we get that secured, they can go forward from there. But you have to stop everything before you can start trying to fix anything."

They've made numerous invitations asking Vice President Kamala Harris to come here and see it for herself. They say this is a humanitarian crisis, and a national security crisis. And moreover, I think one of the most important facts that they want to get across to the American people is that without anybody here to resolve this crisis, it's only going to get worse. And they're expecting more than a hundred thousand people to enter this border this coming month. Sean, back to you."

According to a brand new ABC News poll, optimism about the country's direction that's down nearly 20 points since May, a massive drop. Now, Biden is underwater on the economy, on the border, on violent crime and Americans are also increasingly concerned about the president's -- well, very alarming behavior and that he's a cognitive mess. He barely holds one short public event per day, still struggles in each and every one to even complete simple thoughts.

Here with reaction, FOX News contributor, Dr. Nicole Saphier, former White House physician for two presidents, President Obama, President Trump, now Congressman Ronnie Jackson. You had said, Congressman, number one, you wanted Joe Biden to take the same cognitive test that Donald Trump took and got all 30 answers correct. Have they gotten back to you?

And it is -- it's getting worse with time. So, yeah, I don't think anyone's going to get back to me on that cognitive test anytime soon. I don't expect to hear from them, because he won't do well on it and we all know that at this point. We don't actually even need a screening cognitive test right now with all the stuff that he's putting out there right now, and the crazy things, he's saying to tell us that he's not fit to be our president right now. But this is just going to continue to get worse, Sean. And eventually, the Democrats are going to have to address this issue. And it won't be me talking about it a year from now, it's going to be the Democrats talking about it, and they're going to be trying to figure out how they can remove him from office because the Democrats, the far left and the mainstream media will not be able to cover this up for very much longer."

Does he have cognitive decline? I don't know. I'm not a neurologist. I'm not a neuropsychiatrist. But as someone who has watched him speak most recently at the CNN town hall, is he coming across as an inarticulate and kind of bumbling speaker at times? Absolutely. Oftentimes, he's so incoherent that I'm not understanding what he's saying, and I just find myself shaking my head. So, it's very frustrating and I think it does need to be addressed."

You see the energy of Donald Trump, you know, you may not like what he says, but he's on the ball and he's clearly aware. Stammer, stumble, mumble, bumble -- you know, to me and when 57 percent of the American people don't even think he's in charge anymore in the White House, that is a frightening number, including independents and Republicans and about 33 percent of Democrats -- Ronny Jackson."

But I'll agree with her that -- you know, I've said this before. We all know people that are 100 years old or close to 100 that are just as sharp as a tack. And we all know people that are in their early mid 60s that are already starting to have difficulty. Everyone ages differently. Unfortunately, President Biden is on the earlier end of that spectrum in my -- in my estimation, and he is he's not aging gracefully at this particular point from a cognitive standpoint. So, it will continue to get worse. There will continue to be more bad days and fewer and fewer good days. They will struggle to find days to roll him out and get him in front of the cameras. And we'll see as time goes on, he will be more and more reclusive because his team's not going to be able to roll him out there and put him in front of the American people without really telegraphing that something is really going on here that we need to address. And, Dr. Saphier, wouldn't it be true that if, in fact, there is cognitive decline, it's not something that usually gets better, usually over a period of time, it's a degenerative condition? I would assume with the pressures of the -- of the hardest job in the world being president of the United States, that that could accelerate any real condition that he has, would that be a fair assessment?"

    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Sure, sure. If -- absolutely and if you're talking about degenerative cognitive decline, yes, you're right. It usually does not get better. There are other causes that can, but not when it comes to age base and degenerative. If it does come forth that there is some sort of cognitive decline -- yes, that needs to be disclosed. Yes, that needs to be addressed. I can tell you, I have never spoken to him directly. So I really don't know. But I can say I have had the privilege of being able to interview former President Trump now twice and he is as you say sharp as a tack. That man can answer any question on the -- just like that. And, you know, sometimes he has me coming up with more challenging questions because he knows his stuff."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "utterance": "Well, there's nothing that's really going to stop it, Sean. There's certain things that can make it a little bit better. There are medications out there that they use for Alzheimer's patients. There are medications out there that they use as stimulants that can make people more awake and more alert for short periods of time. But it doesn't stop the process from actually happening. It just kind of covers it up. And as time goes on, those medications will become less and less effective. So, yeah, it's going to be a real problem for them in the long run and they're not going to be able to cover this up for much longer. And you know, there will come a point like I said, Sean, they're going to be faced with a choice. You know, if that they're going to be faced with the choice that they can either --"

The Biden DOJ decided not to investigate Andrew Cuomo's COVID-19 nursing home scandal. Keep in mind, the nursing home outbreak in New York was so devastating.

They love their sport. They love their team. You straight -- you're high- fiving with strangers. Now, you bring politics into it and I don't see any good coming out of it, George Foreman. Do you?"

And they went down to Germany and kill those kids that represent Israel. That's what demonstration will get you. It shouldn't be in sports. You should take it out.

I think what we got to do is because we're the greatest country in the world and we do have the right to protest but I think it's a wrong place wrong time, what we have to do as a people is we have to decide that we have to elect the right people into office because if you get the right people into office and hold people accountable, we wouldn't have these problems, because if you read the Constitution, it talks about everything we want to fight about today. And I think right now, we have leaders in Washington at this time that won't hold people accountable. So I think that's the problems we're having. But this is the wrong place, wrong time to do it at the Olympics because you're representing the United States of America. And to go to another country in the Olympics and put down one of the greatest country in the world where you cannot make the money that you're making in here in America. You see in football, basketball, baseball and even in the -- an acting world, you cannot make the money you're making in this country that you can make somewhere else."

And if you don't like this country this country is so great that you don't have to stay here. This country's so great, you don't have to stay. But the thing is this is the United States of America, are we going to start now having everyone else national anthem come in and we're going to have to uphold that national anthem as well and forget about the United States of America national anthem. And that's what I say. I think we got to get people that that have become leaders that's not going to stand for it there's no doubt you're going to you got to treat people fair. You want to listen to them. But at the same time, you got to let people know that this is the United States of America and guys. We want to do the right thing. When you talk about John Carlos and the people in the Olympics, you got to remember this. At that time, there was a separate bathroom. At that that time, a lot of African-Americans couldn't go into a restaurant and eat. Well, they did protest and down with this point here where we have an opportunity to be treated fairly, but they're not upholding that by holding people responsible for what they're doing."

Stuff like that doesn't bother me, because if I'm going to run for office, I'm fighting for something much bigger than Herschel Walker. So, little articles like that ain't going to scare me. It ain't going to do anything for me. I'm fighting for the people of Georgia. I'm fighting for the United States of America and I'm fighting for this Constitution. I'm fighting for law and order. I want my mom. I want any white mom, I want any Asian mom to be able to go to a grocery store and feel safe. And right now, I don't think they can do that."

And states, for example, over the weekend -- well, in New York City, right here, an off-duty firefighter was attacked by a violent mob in Queens, while just out walking their dog. And, apparently, one of the teams quoting saying, quote, \"fight night,\" the firefighter was then hit over the head with a glass bottle. And that's not all, keep looking at the screen, you see a robber punched and stomped on. He does this to a guy in broad daylight in Brooklyn, New York, and delivering multiple blows, including to the man's skull. Police are still trying to identify that suspect. And in Chicago, you have chaos and carnage. That continues to plague the city streets under the leadership of failed far-left Mayor Lori Lightweight. Twelve people were killed and at least 70-plus shot in Chicago just this weekend alone. As \"The Chicago Sun Times\" notes nearly a year into Lightfoot's anti- violence plan, many of Chicago's most dangerous neighborhoods are getting worse. And despite efforts to defund the police and reimagine the police and dismantle the police, these Democratic-led cities spent millions on private security -- oh, let's see for mayors in places like San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago and New York. And get this, we're also learning tonight the former California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer -- well, she was attacked. Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. When the states are hell-bent on defunding the police, dismantling the police, reimagining the police, eliminating bail laws and then almost riots last summer, saying even though we have incontrovertible evidence of you throwing bricks and rocks and bottles, Molotov cocktails at cops, we're not going to do a thing, 3,000 cops injured -- is there anything you guys in Washington can do?"

      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC)",

I tell you this -- if you do this crap in South Carolina, you'll be lucky if you go to jail. You'll be lucky if somebody doesn't shoot you. So I say that because we've lost deterrence. These big Democratic cities and states have lost deterrence. People no longer feel afraid to assault someone in the streets. Nobody feels afraid to go into Walmart and clean out the place because nobody in the prosecution level is going to do a damn thing. And the Democratic Party is the party of catch and release when it comes to criminals and illegal immigrants, and we've lost deterrence at the border, we've lost deterrence in our major cities in this country, and the only way you're going to regain it is to -- for these people to suffer at the ballot box."

That's now happening in city after city. This is not an isolated incident, Senator."

If you think that law and order has been lost in this country, well, then vote for candidates who pledge to support the cops. If you think the border is completely out of control and we're being overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, we're going to spread COVID and everything else, then you have a chance to vote for the candidate who promises to secure the border. I hope Herschel Walker runs. Herschel Walker is talking like the average Georgian. He wants his mom to be able to go to the store without being hurt. What's happened in these cities is that we've turned our back on the cops, we're no longer prosecute people when they commit petty crime and we lost the streets. Washington, D.C. is in complete decline. You have homeless people all over the town. Families can't go out in the streets anymore, because the policies the left when it comes to crime are not working."

He's a hero in Georgia and he understands law and order, he'll have the cops back. He'll be tough on all the things you need to be tough and he won't waste your money. He's a physical conservative. But we got a lot of opportunity on the map in the Senate. We're going to take back the House, Sean, unless we completely screw this up. I think there's a tidal wave brewing. I think this is going to be 1994 all over again. When you look at rampant inflation, out of control crime and a broken border, and just a general lack of knowing what you're doing lack of competency, that the Republican Party is going to have a great combat if we recruit the right people. And in my view, Herschel is the right guy for Georgia."

Senator Ron Johnson will weigh in on these new developments as we continue. Glad you're with us."

Now, Hunter Biden's art business is raising even more concerns about possible influence peddling on top of all we do know as Hunter's dealer -- art dealer that is now -- said back in 2015, he wanted to be, quote, the lead guy in China, adding, quote, I plan to find and discover and bring to the rest of the world those I consider China's next generation of modern artists. Remember, all these buyers -- they will remain anonymous. They say that's ethical. Will any of the buyers be connected to the Chinese government or military? And I'll ask again, what exactly is the market for these paintings? Five hundred grand? Now, we did reach out to Hunter Biden's lawyer and the art dealer -- his name is George Burgess -- for comment, we've yet to hear anything. Here with the reaction, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Sounds suspicious to me, Senator, especially in light of what you and Senator Grassley have already told us about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI)",
      "utterance": "Well, it's highly suspicious, Sean. You know, we requested his travel records from the Secret Service where Hunter Biden had Secret Service protection for about five and a half years. During that time period, he made 70 trips overseas. Think about that. That's about a trip a month. And my question is, what was he selling? You know, most international business people have a product or a real service that they're selling. You know, other than the Biden family name peddling influence, what was Hunter Biden doing? Of course, this was before he became the 21st century Picasso. Of course, now, he's selling that artwork. So, no, this stinks to high heaven and the only reason it's not getting more scrutiny in the mainstream press because the mainstream media is part and parcel of the Democratic Party. They're the communication arm of the Democratic Party. They're not going to even look at this, much less be concerned about it."

Why does this all sound corrupt? And what do you think about the anonymous side of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it is corrupt and, you know what's even more concerning is just the unequal administration of justice. Because he's Hunter Biden, you know, doesn't pay taxes on things apparently. And the IRS and the Department of Justice look the other way. However, if you're, for example, affiliated with the last administration, you get a pre-dawn raid, you know, by a SWAT team or you get arrested and prosecuted for being a foreign agent, and you haven't registered for it. I wonder if Hunter ever registers as a foreign agent. Well, how about his background check that Secret Service personnel apparently tried to get those background check information when he threw that -- or when his girlfriend, his sister-in-law threw his gun away in that dumpster? Now -- Sean, this stinks to high heaven and the American people understand that. The only people that don't understand is Department of Justice and the news media."
