He and Elizabeth Warren are the two Democrats who have shown substantial gains over the last three months. Clearly, Joe Biden has a substantial lead, no question. But as you point out, in the open Martha, their questions about Joe Biden opening the door by talking about his ability to work with segregationist years ago. And people are saying, especially now with Trump in the White House and all the racial static about him, do you really want to brag about working with a guy as a segregationist like Jim Eastland?  So, you know, the door is open but I don't think that's anywhere near as serious of what Pete Buttigieg is going through because I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor.  And he has to prove he can deal with a crisis.   If he doesn't deal with this, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation's crisis.",

So, and I would say as much as we talk about him on the rise in the presidential campaign, he stopped campaigning for the week, and he prioritized what he needed to do which is his job as mayor.

It's actually I think becoming so stringent that they have a couple of possibilities. They say, oh we're sorry and we're going to negotiate or they say we're really, really mad and we're going to fight. Unfortunately, it looks like we've got their back up against the wall and I think we're more likely to have more military confrontations that we are to have diplomacy. I'm very open and would like to have diplomacy. I know the president said he would talk without preconditions.

And so we're adding -- you know, we're adding the stick which is more sanctions but I don't know if that's bringing them -- you know, they came to the negotiating table initially because they had a carrot and the carrot was the money. We gave it up too easily but they were still complying. I would have built upon the nuclear deal to try to get a ballistic missile deal. Instead, getting rid of the nuclear deal, we've got to start over on the nuclear deal and the ballistic missile deal. And I think we also have to realize that if you want the Iranians to agree to a ballistic missile, conventional ballistic missile deal, the Saudis would have to be part of it. They're not going to give up their weapons with the Saudis not giving up any. And I agree with the president. I don't want them to have nuclear weapons but I also don't want the Saudis to have nuclear weapons. I wouldn't give the Saudis nuclear technology.

Containment is a much more realistic approach to foreign policy. And yes, they need to be contained. We need to do everything we can to convince them not to break out to get nuclear weapons, but that's going to have to involve some kind of carrot. And so one carrot that could be offered is letting go of the additional tariffs, they're cutting -- additional sanctions that are cutting off the flow of oil to the east. I think that should be something that's not getting rid of all sanctions, but if you put that on the table and say look, maybe we've gone too far on that but we're going to have to have something in response and that means we got to be done with all this sort of military confrontation that Iran is sort of provoking with us now.

I had a career where I went around the country auditing, encoding medical records all over the country, large hospitals, small rural hospitals. And I saw the effects of HIV and AIDS on young men.

      "speaker": "GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE",

You just saw the tragic result of that. The people in the -- you know, and the black -- one-third of South Bend has apparently turned against the mayor. He's had an incredible run Mayor Pete has. But I think that the robber has met the road and it seems to me that unless he can turn this around, obviously his candidacy will hit South Carolina and end there. It just seems to me, it's -- he's not being accepted by the African-American community. And if you can't get at -- you know, if you -- if you -- if you can't go black, you can't go back."

      "utterance": "Well, I think Geraldo is on point. It's 60 percent of the electorate, Democrats in -- electorate in South Carolina going to a very critical primary. But I think the bigger point here is has he had success now? What we've seen is Pete Buttigieg moving up in the polls. He and Elizabeth Warren are the two Democrats who have shown substantial gains over the last three months. Clearly, Joe Biden has a substantial lead, no question. But as you point out, in the open Martha, their questions about Joe Biden opening the door by talking about his ability to work with segregationist years ago. And people are saying, especially now with Trump in the White House and all the racial static about him, do you really want to brag about working with a guy as a segregationist like Jim Eastland? So, you know, the door is open but I don't think that's anywhere near as serious of what Pete Buttigieg is going through because I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor.  And he has to prove he can deal with a crisis. If he doesn't deal with this, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation's crisis."

You know, this is yet to be adjudicated. We don't know what happened in the situation. And we do know that -- you know it takes a long time generally for this process play out. The man was killed in this situation has a record. He has done some time in jail for cocaine and possession of a weapon. And you know, there's a process here that has to play out, Robert. And it seems like -- you know, when all these situations, you jump the gun and then you point the finger at the mayor, and he's not responding properly, and you know, there are steps to go through here as tragic as it is."

He made mistakes by not having as many minority officers over the years. He's also got involved in the department of justice civil rights area. And his ask for an independent investigation. So, and I would say as much as we talk about him on the rise in the presidential campaign, he stopped campaigning for the week, and he prioritized what he needed to do which is his job as mayor. So, I would say that to Geraldo's point, yes, he has a real uphill battle when it comes with the African-American community. That being said, I think he actually show a lot of leadership this week.  And it really depends what he does going forward. And does he make the changes that are necessary to be viewed as one who can lead the country?"

He had Obama's back. You know, he was loyal, he was consistent, he was strong, he helped in the early days to legitimatize President Obama and his historic role there. I think when you talk to James Clyburn, and John Lewis, and these lions of the civil rights movement, they give Biden, if not a pass, they say (INAUDIBLE).

I, on the other hand, was responsible for criminal justice reform, which had tremendous support and fixed the bad 1994 bill. You know, Juan, President Trump got more African-American votes than any Republican who has run. You know, and he said, you wrote a book, entitled, What If You Got to Lose? He is looking at African-American voters and saying, I'm not necessarily tweeting you in a monolithic way. I'm treating you as, you know, part of the economy. And yet, employment rate is better than ever for this group as well as for other groups. Is that a message that's going to resonate with voters who maybe have voted Democrat in the past?"

This is the wrong end of the problem there they're attacking at Martha. Because when the federal government 2007 took over the student loan business from the private sector, it made things worse. And it has made a large part of this problem. By the way, students who were repaying their loans after the government takeover, a lot of people don't know this. We're not paying it back into a student loan fund, they were paying for Obamacare. That's where a lot of that money was going. That's one of the reasons that the Obama administration wanted to do it. But look, how are you going to do this? $8,000 at a State University for a year, but maybe $60,000 for the prestige private university that's all forgiven? What about the people who paid their loans back? How are you going to sort that out? But the main point here is that the colleges and universities, well when they see free tuition, you know what they're going to do? They're going to raise tuition."

      "utterance": "You know, I'm really proud of President Trump for showing restraint.  I think it shows -- it really takes a statesman to show restraint amidst a chorus of voices for war. Whether the sanctions will work I think it's another story. Currently, from the Iranian perspective, they see the sanctions as an act of war cutting off their ability to sell any oil to Asia which the previous sanctions actually allowed them to sell some oil. It's actually I think becoming so stringent that they have a couple of possibilities. They say, oh we're sorry and we're going to negotiate or they say we're really, really mad and we're going to fight. Unfortunately, it looks like we've got their back up against the wall and I think we're more likely to have more military confrontations that we are to have diplomacy. I'm very open and would like to have diplomacy. I know the president said he would talk without preconditions. The problem is right now because we pulled out in an agreement that Iran was actually adhering to, the Iranians feel like you know, we're not acting in a good-faith manner."

      "utterance": "You know, I didn't agree with the fact that we gave up the money early. When I -- you know, the President has said this repeatedly. We gave him $150 billion up front. I think that was a mistake. The problem is that's already done. That was a carrot, but we gave up the carrot too easily. Now that it's gone, we have no other carrots, all we have is stick. And so we're adding -- you know, we're adding the stick which is more sanctions but I don't know if that's bringing them -- you know, they came to the negotiating table initially because they had a carrot and the carrot was the money. We gave it up too easily but they were still complying. I would have built upon the nuclear deal to try to get a ballistic missile deal. Instead, getting rid of the nuclear deal, we've got to start over on the nuclear deal and the ballistic missile deal. And I think we also have to realize that if you want the Iranians to agree to a ballistic missile, conventional ballistic missile deal, the Saudis would have to be part of it. They're not going to give up their weapons with the Saudis not giving up any. And I agree with the president. I don't want them to have nuclear weapons but I also don't want the Saudis to have nuclear weapons. I wouldn't give the Saudis nuclear technology. I think that pushes the Iranians to breakout from the nuclear agreement."

      "utterance": "Interesting. This is a quote from an article in the American Spectator which is titled Trump is winning the little cold war with Iran.  And it says the best approach to this ideological war against Iran is through containment, deterrence, and multilateralism. The same tools that the United States effectively used to defeat the Soviet Union's global threat in the Cold War. Do you see that as a similarity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I'm a big fan of George Kennan who was the original author of containment of the Soviet Union. And containment is a much better way of looking at the world rather than thinking like John Bolton and we're going to topple every regime we don't like in Thomas Jefferson is going to be elected the next time around. Containment is a much more realistic approach to foreign policy. And yes, they need to be contained. We need to do everything we can to convince them not to break out to get nuclear weapons, but that's going to have to involve some kind of carrot. And so one carrot that could be offered is letting go of the additional tariffs, they're cutting -- additional sanctions that are cutting off the flow of oil to the east. I think that should be something that's not getting rid of all sanctions, but if you put that on the table and say look, maybe we've gone too far on that but we're going to have to have something in response and that means we got to be done with all this sort of military confrontation that Iran is sort of provoking with us now. But I think there is a deal to be had but they're not going to come to the table without some sort of offer. But right now I don't think we even have adequate channels to have a conversation. I think we're not talking at all."

I mean, in fact in the parliament today in Iran they were chanting death to America you know, standing up as we would in Congress but these guys are standing up and you know, pounding their fists and shouting death to America.

We have you know, 1,000 fold military superiority. So we do have the ability to do all that. But out of that chaos what happens? If we were to do that and we were to go all-in with a war against mainland Iran, you get chaos again. What comes out of chaos? Terrorism and you know, struggle, and civil war, and chaos, and famine."

A man who identifies himself as Smollett's creative director says he called police and he leads the officers up to Smollett's apartment. Saying Jussie Smollett is like a star. And the attackers put a makeshift noose around Smollett's neck. Smollett's acquaintance then points out the white rope around Smollett's neck.

Supporters say that they teach diversity and acceptance. But opponents say that they aim to indoctrinate and unnecessarily expose children to sexuality. The deeply polarizing issue is generating protest that have gotten so heated that local police have called in SWAT team as some of these to provide security. In moments we're going to talk to three mothers who are leading the charge to shut them down.

The book that we write in particular was called \"Julian is a Mermaid\" and it's about a kid in the Bronx in New York who was accepted by his grandmother and able to really kind of explore what his gender is. And it really is a touching story about love and acceptance. And it was really a beautiful thing to be able to see so many people coming together for a reading in a library and our library was the largest turnout for this story time which is scheduled regularly.

But I guess the question is, why this is appropriate at a public library when, you know, a lot of these images and these people are very provocative. And there's a sexualization element to it no matter how tame it is. They have what, enormous eyelashes, and you know, like outfits and the shoes, the huge platform shoes. And the women who are about to come on, I know because, you know, just from reading of some of what they said. They think that these are negative images for girls, negative images for women.

I had a career where I went around the country auditing, encoding medical records all over the country, large hospitals, small rural hospitals. And I saw the effects of HIV and AIDS on young men.
