      "sentences": "When a massacre like the one in New Zealand occurs, it's tempting to opine but we're going to leave that to others. We do know that evil exists and when evil plans in a world of seven billion souls it's often hard to stop it. The vile terrorists left behind a manifesto, but his twisted beliefs only exists to mess with us. His views veer all over the place. He hates immigration, but he loves the environment. He hates diversity and individuality, he's an eco-fascist, a green nationalist.  When you think about it, he's nothing.  So as usual, his name shall never be mentioned here, but the point worth noting is this: He wished through his violent act to create a civil war here. The terrorism was meant to foment unrest and conflict, so if we were to point fingers at each other, like other networks do, then we fulfill that goal. So we won't.  We all believe in something that can later be twisted by evil men and that puts all of us in the same boat. So that's it for now. We're going to do a normal show, but you can bet that our hearts and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. All right, imagine you're on a bus or a train and there's only one seat available next to you and of course here comes a young bony backpacker with patchy facial hair wearing a wool cap in the summertime. He sits down and he just starts talking to you. It turns out, he's really excited and really excitable.  He just went backpacking all around Europe and he has so much to tell you about the world and he's dying to tell you all about it. that's our Beto.",

A Twinkie dipped in barbecue sauce, if you haven't tried it, well you're missing out.  But that's how the writer sees Beto. Now, mind you, he wrote a similar Valentine to John Edwards.

Just ask Tucker.  But let me ask you this, let me ask you this, if you look at the David and Goliath analogy, what reality comes closest to that? If Goliath is the consensus media that would make David Donald Trump and Trump used their spotlight as his slingshot and they've never been the same ever since.  So in the world of politics, there's only one Goliath and it controls the stories, creates the division, constantly sowing conflict to ensure their own economic survival, which is why I embrace Daylight Savings Time -- transition eh.

A Twinkie dipped in barbecue sauce, if you haven't tried it, well you're missing out. But that's how the writer sees Beto. Now, mind you, he wrote a similar Valentine to John Edwards.

Just ask Tucker. But let me ask you this, let me ask you this, if you look at the David and Goliath analogy, what reality comes closest to that? If Goliath is the consensus media that would make David Donald Trump and Trump used their spotlight as his slingshot and they've never been the same ever since. So in the world of politics, there's only one Goliath and it controls the stories, creates the division, constantly sowing conflict to ensure their own economic survival, which is why I embrace Daylight Savings Time -- transition eh.

They have an audience coordinator that makes sure there's one of every type of human being who can possibly pull a lever in the background, so you like white, black, Asian, Yankee, met, Pokemon, Pikachu, Mario, Luigi -- when you go to a Trump rally, it looks like the line to get seated at Cracker Barrel.

But by doing this, they're not creating futures for their kids. They're creating monsters because they're teaching them that they're so entitled they don't have to worry about things like responsibility or hard work or being grateful, that they don't have to face consequences.

So in a lot of ways, maybe a couple of people dodged a bullet here. But I think every parent -- I have a parent, I am a parent anyway and I think every parent -- this has gone on forever is in denial.
