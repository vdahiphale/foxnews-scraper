      "sentences": "Welcome to 'Hannity' tonight. So much out in the news, Robert Mueller's witch hunt into Trump-Russia collusion, it's now on day 349. So, tonight, after 50 weeks of investigation, we still have zero evidence that Donald Trump did anything wrong, absolutely zero.  Now breaking just moments ago, this is huge from \"The Washington Post\", Robert Mueller threatened to subpoena the president of the United States and take the president before a grand jury. This witch hunt is way out of control. Ed Henry has a full report coming up tonight.  Plus, according to information first leak to \"The New York Times\", Mueller has dozens of questions that he wants the president to answer. OK, coming up, we will reveal the special counsel's most insane and ridiculous questions and why this report is full of crap. And we'll also show you how Team Mueller is trying to set a trap for the president.  And also, according to new congressional report out, a group of secret donor, they paid huge dollars, millions of dollars to take down president Trump after you elected him. We'll explain that. I also have my questions. Now, while Trump remains the focus of this intense legal speculation, our two-tiered justice system is totally ignoring crimes from Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and so many others. So, stay tuned, we have a list of serious crimes that, in fact, really need to be investigated and will have the very latest from James Comey's Trump-derangement tour, the media's latest blatant display of bias is off the hook and an important update from the caravan of migrants demanding entry on the southern border.  Sit tight. It's time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

And now, Robert Mueller's merry band of Trump-hating Democratic sycophants are completely and totally desperate to find anything, something on President Trump.  Late last night, \"The New York Times\" released a report allegedly detailing questions that Robert Mueller wants to ask Trump before the investigation concludes. If any of these leaked questions are true, be warned, Mueller is laying a huge perjury trap for the president of the United States. Which means two things, one, he has nothing. And two, it proves everything I have been saying about him and Andrew Weissmann and company.   Two of America's top attorneys are now sounding the alarm. Watch this.",

This list of insane, juvenile ridiculous questions goes on, including one about a statement to our friend Maria Bartiromo, the president's reaction to news reports and what discussions Trump had about terminating the special counsel. Excuse me. He never terminated him! And again, more questions about the president's thought process. Remember, this is supposed to be -- originally was supposed to be about Russia collusion and investigation. Not to some persecution of the president on ridiculous thought patterns.

      "sentences": "You know, not under oath, not recorded, pretty much meaningless, send in a pro-Trump person like Peter Strzok interviewed Hillary. Yes, that's right, if we have a fair system of justice, President Trump should absolutely get the Hillary treatment for any interview with the FBI.  And just like Hillary Clinton's interview, after the exoneration was written months later, oh, Trump's interview should be conducted not under oath, not recorded, not be transcribed, and the exoneration written months in advance. And oh, yes, someone with a pro-Trump bias, let's say, me, I will conduct the questioning.   If Hillary Clinton -- how about Rush, or the great one, Mark Levine? Good idea. If he gets the Clinton treatment, anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok for the interview, maybe, I don't know, we have a good choice of people, lots of conservatives that can interview him. None of this is going to happen. We know that. We now know, sadly, in America, we have a two-tier justice system. We don't have equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws.  While the president is targeted in a totally off the rails witch hunt, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, all of these other deep state actors have never been charged with a crime, despite mountains of evidence that we have. For example, despite her total exoneration from the FBI, our friend, Fox News legal analysts Gregg Jarrett will join us, revealing multiple serious crimes that Hillary Clinton should be charged with, starting with 18 USC 793, mishandling, destroying classified documents, 18 USC 1505, the obstruction of justice. Remember, Bleach Bit, deleted emails, busted up devices. No charges over the multiple crimes related to her campaign shady practices relating to the Steele dossier.  Next stop, let's look at James Comey. Well, he's not under any criminal investigation as of now. Shouldn't he at least face scrutiny over 18 USC 641, the theft of government property of records after he took these Trump memos outside of the FBI? What about 18 USC 1924? The mishandling of classified information. And remember, when James Comey lied to Congress about night signing off on Clinton's exoneration letter once before that interview took place, that's against the law, 18 USC 1621. We've got Andrew McCabe, House Republicans have referred McCabe to the I.G. for multiple crimes over lying to the FBI and McCabe was fired for lying to the FBI.   Let's see, oh, General Flynn? Why has he not been charged with a crime in this case? Of course, don't hold your breath for an investigation into Loretta Lynch, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok or any of these anti-Trump deep state actors.  What's behind this sadly in the United States of America today is a two-tiered system of justice. It is simple, the deep state hates who you chose to be your president. They are hell-bent on seeing Donald Trump delegitimized and hopefully on their side removed from office. Obviously, that means they don't want him to succeed. And that would mean even if Americans suffer in the process.  Breaking this week, a group of wealthy secret donors -- get this -- they poured as much as $50 million into an investigation of President Trump after his 2016 election, based on the dossier. This is in the House Intel Committee report -- get this -- the top-secret anti-Trump donors even utilize the services of Christopher Steele, the foreign national, the author of the dirty dossier that we know was filled with Russian lies. Without a doubt, this deep state is conducting a full scale political attempt to take down this president. And perhaps, the most pathetic deep state actor of all, James Comey -- well, the guy that refused to come on this show, I offered him four hours of airtime -- he's continuing his anti- Trump book tour, and is actually claiming that Trump's criticism of the deep state is dangerous for the country. How dare he? How dare he be honest? No president has faced this before.   Comey also took some time to fantasize about what if the deep state's choice -- his choice - when, in fact, he exonerated Hillary Clinton when he knew that she committed crimes and wrote the exoneration before investigation. But he is thinking, but what if Hillary had actually won?  Take a look.",

And I'll add also the law.  Also breaking tonight, Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Gowdy, they're requesting more information from the Justice Department surrounding fired FBI Director Comey's friend, Daniel Richman. He's the guy who used his special designation in the FBI to leak information to the press, which, of course, we know Comey wanted. Is Rosenstein going to cooperate on this one? I'm not holding my breath.  And next up, we have yet even more examples to give you from the abusively biased press in this country and their age-old tactic called bias by omission. And according to a report from NewsBusters tonight, on Monday, well, network news broadcast ABC, CBS, NBC, guess what, they completely failed to mention the South Korean President Moon suggested Donald Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. They never mentioned it. In fact, according to the NewsBusters, they only mentioned of the Nobel Peace Prize was used by ABC and NBC to mock Trump supporters who started chanting in Michigan, \"Nobel, Nobel\", during his rally over the weekend.

Those people in Congress who are considering this \"protect Mueller\" bill must really rethink that. This is the wrong time.

There will be constitutional questions over that, and the case could go all the way to the Supreme Court.  Fox confirming that John Dowd, then the lead Trump attorney, told Mueller, quote, this is not some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States. Now, I have spoken to some in the president's orbit who are furious about this leak. They think that Dowd may have put this out there, along with last night's leak about Robert Mueller's list of questions. Dowd in a phone call denied that to me. Others in the president's orbit saying maybe the president once these leaks out there so that everybody is on the same page about exactly what Mueller is asking. Plus, the White House can use the leaks as they did today is to say all of this is a witch-hunt. The bottom line is, the list you've been talking about, over 40 questions, is so broad that people close to the process are telling me tonight it makes it less likely that the president will ever sit for an interview with Mueller. The president as I noted today charged as a witch hunt. He railed against the leaks. Insiders here focusing on the part of \"The New York Times\" story saying that the list of questions from Mueller was compiled by the president's lawyers, led at the time as I noted by Dowd, after a series of consultations that Dowd, you see him there, had with Mueller. Dowd tonight told me, quote, it's not me pal, insisting that he is not leaking this information out, but he left the president's legal team earlier this year after concluding that Mueller's long list of questions could put the president in legal jeopardy if he sat for an interview. This leak is widely seen as an attempt to sabotage any interview. \"The Times\" added that the leaker was a person outside of the legal team, meaning it would not likely be the White House lawyer Ty Cobb or new outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani only basically replaced Dowd since he is currently on the team. While the president wants to do an interview, I told you some of his advisers now telling me tonight, it's less and less likely, because they see this as a pile on. Mueller pressing for answers about the president's interactions with James Comey, General Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, plus questions about whether he communicated with lawyer Michael Cohen about real estate deals in Russia which would seem to cross that red line the president talked about last year about how he did not believe it would be fair for his business dealings before he was president to be investigated.  Meanwhile, last point, Republicans Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte today are trying to probe some of James Comey's leaks, sending a letter to Sessions and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, seeking documents on one of Comey's friends, Daniel Richman, you remember him? Comey used him as a go- between to release some of his memos. Rosenstein today said that he is not going to be extorted by -- that's a word that he used, these articles of impeachment against him being drafted by House Republicans. I can tell you, Republican Mark Meadow tonight said that's ridiculous and that Rod Rosenstein, he said, should stick to facts instead of rhetoric, Sean.",

I think from our perspective, you know, President Trump does not want to bequeath to his successor a failed Iranian policy. Similar to the one he's having to deal with on North Korea where Iran is enriched with sanctions relief, it would have been an ICBM because that's not covered in the Iran nuclear deal, capable of targeting our homeland, and then a nuclear break out after the sunset provision closes out after 15 years with centrifuges and enrichment of uranium that they can break out with a nuclear weapon. I mean, that's not what we want to go. The problem is that the Obama administration left this administration with really not very good options. We can scrap the deal, that's going to carry some economic costs. We could continue with this flawed deal or we could try to supplement it with other deals.

So, tonight, after 50 weeks of investigation, we still have zero evidence that Donald Trump did anything wrong, absolutely zero. Now breaking just moments ago, this is huge from \"The Washington Post\", Robert Mueller threatened to subpoena the president of the United States and take the president before a grand jury. This witch hunt is way out of control. Ed Henry has a full report coming up tonight. Plus, according to information first leak to \"The New York Times\", Mueller has dozens of questions that he wants the president to answer. OK, coming up, we will reveal the special counsel's most insane and ridiculous questions and why this report is full of crap. And we'll also show you how Team Mueller is trying to set a trap for the president. And also, according to new congressional report out, a group of secret donor, they paid huge dollars, millions of dollars to take down president Trump after you elected him. We'll explain that. I also have my questions. Now, while Trump remains the focus of this intense legal speculation, our two-tiered justice system is totally ignoring crimes from Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and so many others. So, stay tuned, we have a list of serious crimes that, in fact, really need to be investigated and will have the very latest from James Comey's Trump-derangement tour, the media's latest blatant display of bias is off the hook and an important update from the caravan of migrants demanding entry on the southern border. Sit tight. It's time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

And now, Robert Mueller's merry band of Trump-hating Democratic sycophants are completely and totally desperate to find anything, something on President Trump. Late last night, \"The New York Times\" released a report allegedly detailing questions that Robert Mueller wants to ask Trump before the investigation concludes. If any of these leaked questions are true, be warned, Mueller is laying a huge perjury trap for the president of the United States. Which means two things, one, he has nothing. And two, it proves everything I have been saying about him and Andrew Weissmann and company. Two of America's top attorneys are now sounding the alarm. Watch this."

Note all of the questions that include the term, what did the president think? What did the president think about James Comey? What did the president think about Jeff Sessions' recusal? What does the president think about the special counsel? Well, I have a question for Robert Mueller tonight, when did thinking or thoughts ever become a crime? When did the United States start regulating what you may or may not to be in a person's mind? Are we going to criminalize thoughts? This list of insane, juvenile ridiculous questions goes on, including one about a statement to our friend Maria Bartiromo, the president's reaction to news reports and what discussions Trump had about terminating the special counsel. Excuse me. He never terminated him! And again, more questions about the president's thought process. Remember, this is supposed to be -- originally was supposed to be about Russia collusion and investigation. Not to some persecution of the president on ridiculous thought patterns. Rush Limbaugh captured it well today. He said the president should only agree to a Mueller interview if, in fact, President Trump gets the Hillary Clinton treatment. Let's take a look."

    {

      "utterance": "You know, not under oath, not recorded, pretty much meaningless, send in a pro-Trump person like Peter Strzok interviewed Hillary. Yes, that's right, if we have a fair system of justice, President Trump should absolutely get the Hillary treatment for any interview with the FBI. And just like Hillary Clinton's interview, after the exoneration was written months later, oh, Trump's interview should be conducted not under oath, not recorded, not be transcribed, and the exoneration written months in advance. And oh, yes, someone with a pro-Trump bias, let's say, me, I will conduct the questioning. If Hillary Clinton -- how about Rush, or the great one, Mark Levine? Good idea. If he gets the Clinton treatment, anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok for the interview, maybe, I don't know, we have a good choice of people, lots of conservatives that can interview him. None of this is going to happen. We know that. We now know, sadly, in America, we have a two-tier justice system. We don't have equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. While the president is targeted in a totally off the rails witch hunt, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, all of these other deep state actors have never been charged with a crime, despite mountains of evidence that we have. For example, despite her total exoneration from the FBI, our friend, Fox News legal analysts Gregg Jarrett will join us, revealing multiple serious crimes that Hillary Clinton should be charged with, starting with 18 USC 793, mishandling, destroying classified documents, 18 USC 1505, the obstruction of justice. Remember, Bleach Bit, deleted emails, busted up devices. No charges over the multiple crimes related to her campaign shady practices relating to the Steele dossier. Next stop, let's look at James Comey. Well, he's not under any criminal investigation as of now. Shouldn't he at least face scrutiny over 18 USC 641, the theft of government property of records after he took these Trump memos outside of the FBI? What about 18 USC 1924? The mishandling of classified information. And remember, when James Comey lied to Congress about night signing off on Clinton's exoneration letter once before that interview took place, that's against the law, 18 USC 1621. We've got Andrew McCabe, House Republicans have referred McCabe to the I.G. for multiple crimes over lying to the FBI and McCabe was fired for lying to the FBI. Let's see, oh, General Flynn? Why has he not been charged with a crime in this case? Of course, don't hold your breath for an investigation into Loretta Lynch, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok or any of these anti-Trump deep state actors. What's behind this sadly in the United States of America today is a two-tiered system of justice. It is simple, the deep state hates who you chose to be your president. They are hell-bent on seeing Donald Trump delegitimized and hopefully on their side removed from office. Obviously, that means they don't want him to succeed. And that would mean even if Americans suffer in the process. Breaking this week, a group of wealthy secret donors -- get this -- they poured as much as $50 million into an investigation of President Trump after his 2016 election, based on the dossier. This is in the House Intel Committee report -- get this -- the top-secret anti-Trump donors even utilize the services of Christopher Steele, the foreign national, the author of the dirty dossier that we know was filled with Russian lies. Without a doubt, this deep state is conducting a full scale political attempt to take down this president. And perhaps, the most pathetic deep state actor of all, James Comey -- well, the guy that refused to come on this show, I offered him four hours of airtime -- he's continuing his anti- Trump book tour, and is actually claiming that Trump's criticism of the deep state is dangerous for the country. How dare he? How dare he be honest? No president has faced this before. Comey also took some time to fantasize about what if the deep state's choice -- his choice - when, in fact, he exonerated Hillary Clinton when he knew that she committed crimes and wrote the exoneration before investigation. But he is thinking, but what if Hillary had actually won? Take a look."

And I'll add also the law. Also breaking tonight, Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Gowdy, they're requesting more information from the Justice Department surrounding fired FBI Director Comey's friend, Daniel Richman. He's the guy who used his special designation in the FBI to leak information to the press, which, of course, we know Comey wanted. Is Rosenstein going to cooperate on this one? I'm not holding my breath. And next up, we have yet even more examples to give you from the abusively biased press in this country and their age-old tactic called bias by omission. And according to a report from NewsBusters tonight, on Monday, well, network news broadcast ABC, CBS, NBC, guess what, they completely failed to mention the South Korean President Moon suggested Donald Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. They never mentioned it. In fact, according to the NewsBusters, they only mentioned of the Nobel Peace Prize was used by ABC and NBC to mock Trump supporters who started chanting in Michigan, \"Nobel, Nobel\", during his rally over the weekend. And while the media is not ignoring Trump's serious progress on the world stage, which they always do, they are mourning the tragic fight of the caravan of migrants at our southern border that want to enter this country illegally that don't respect our sovereignty.

Now, many of these migrants scaled the border fence in California, look at that, after making their way from Central America unabated through Mexico. Mexico that routinely throws people out or in prison if they enter illegally from El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Central America. These images that you are watching, the wall climbing, and attempting to illegally cross the border is a clear and obvious indication of how many of these migrants value our laws, respect our sovereignty. And what's worse, Mexico's total inaction. It shows what kind of so-called ally we are dealing with south of the border.

There is one agenda here that is to get the president before Mr. Mueller to enable -- in order to charge him with obstruction of justice or perjury. Those people in Congress who are considering this \"protect Mueller\" bill must really rethink that. This is the wrong time. It shouldn't -- besides being an encroachment on Article II, and it is certainly that, it never should be considered. Mr. Comey in his book tour made clear with these questions that the agenda -- he said, how would he prosecute Mr. Trump? The questions he had in mind are the very same thing -- get them in front of you so you can charge him with obstruction of justice. That's the abuse of the special counsel regulations that were passed. They create a whole new class of charges so that Mr. Mueller unilaterally can charge the president with perjury, obstruction of justice, intimidation or anyone else who he believes or wants to believe is interfering with his so-called investigation.

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Sean. \"The Washington Post\" basically saying this happened in early March, rather extraordinary meeting Robert Mueller, raising the possibility of a subpoena to compel testimony from President Trump in this Russia collusion investigation. There will be constitutional questions over that, and the case could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Fox confirming that John Dowd, then the lead Trump attorney, told Mueller, quote, this is not some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States. Now, I have spoken to some in the president's orbit who are furious about this leak. They think that Dowd may have put this out there, along with last night's leak about Robert Mueller's list of questions. Dowd in a phone call denied that to me. Others in the president's orbit saying maybe the president once these leaks out there so that everybody is on the same page about exactly what Mueller is asking. Plus, the White House can use the leaks as they did today is to say all of this is a witch-hunt. The bottom line is, the list you've been talking about, over 40 questions, is so broad that people close to the process are telling me tonight it makes it less likely that the president will ever sit for an interview with Mueller. The president as I noted today charged as a witch hunt. He railed against the leaks. Insiders here focusing on the part of \"The New York Times\" story saying that the list of questions from Mueller was compiled by the president's lawyers, led at the time as I noted by Dowd, after a series of consultations that Dowd, you see him there, had with Mueller. Dowd tonight told me, quote, it's not me pal, insisting that he is not leaking this information out, but he left the president's legal team earlier this year after concluding that Mueller's long list of questions could put the president in legal jeopardy if he sat for an interview. This leak is widely seen as an attempt to sabotage any interview. \"The Times\" added that the leaker was a person outside of the legal team, meaning it would not likely be the White House lawyer Ty Cobb or new outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani only basically replaced Dowd since he is currently on the team. While the president wants to do an interview, I told you some of his advisers now telling me tonight, it's less and less likely, because they see this as a pile on. Mueller pressing for answers about the president's interactions with James Comey, General Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, plus questions about whether he communicated with lawyer Michael Cohen about real estate deals in Russia which would seem to cross that red line the president talked about last year about how he did not believe it would be fair for his business dealings before he was president to be investigated. Meanwhile, last point, Republicans Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte today are trying to probe some of James Comey's leaks, sending a letter to Sessions and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, seeking documents on one of Comey's friends, Daniel Richman, you remember him? Comey used him as a go- between to release some of his memos. Rosenstein today said that he is not going to be extorted by -- that's a word that he used, these articles of impeachment against him being drafted by House Republicans. I can tell you, Republican Mark Meadow tonight said that's ridiculous and that Rod Rosenstein, he said, should stick to facts instead of rhetoric, Sean."

Joining us now with more reaction, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, NRATV contributor, former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino. I agree with Gregg Jarrett, David Schoen, Joe diGenova, Congressman, I agree with Alan Dershowitz. This is a perjury trap. This is juvenile. The idea that you're going to ask the president what was in your mind is an absurdity. And it shows just how far this has gone from so-called collusion with Russia. REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLA.: You are right, Sean, very few of the bullets involved the campaign. It was mostly during the transition and then during his presidency. So you have a situation where Robert Mueller, he is a DOJ employee, effectively. So he has an inferior officer in the executive branch. What gives him the right to conduct oversight over basic presidential decisions? It has nothing to do with any type of criminal activity. What was in your mind when you talked about Sessions resigning or this or that? He does not have the right to subpoena the president for that, I don't think the president should submit to those questions.

No, he is not going -- he will be under oath unlike Hillary, he won't have a friend interviewing him like Hillary had.

This regime had a secret nuclear weapons program and they're trying under a very bad deal to get a nuclear arsenal. They shouldn't get it. President Trump has stood so firm and so clearly on this issue and he said that will not happen. And that is something that I fully back. And I think it's not only in the interest of Israel and the United States, that's obvious. It is an interest of the world. This tyrannical anti-American regime should not have nuclear weapons."

Here with reaction, retired CIA senior intelligence officer and Sonoran Policy Group vice president, Daniel Hoffman. I thought that presentation yesterday was perhaps one of the biggest great breakthroughs intelligence wise that I have seen in my lifetime. I wanted to get your thoughts and the fact that the prime minister did it without notes, I'm told and put this thing out there and with all of that evidence, corroborated by our own intelligence, I want to get your thoughts."

Iranians are building up their capability, military capability in the Golan Height. It was a powerful expression on the part of Prime Minister Netanyahu with Israel's concern intelligence briefing. I think from our perspective, you know, President Trump does not want to bequeath to his successor a failed Iranian policy. Similar to the one he's having to deal with on North Korea where Iran is enriched with sanctions relief, it would have been an ICBM because that's not covered in the Iran nuclear deal, capable of targeting our homeland, and then a nuclear break out after the sunset provision closes out after 15 years with centrifuges and enrichment of uranium that they can break out with a nuclear weapon. I mean, that's not what we want to go. The problem is that the Obama administration left this administration with really not very good options. We can scrap the deal, that's going to carry some economic costs. We could continue with this flawed deal or we could try to supplement it with other deals. Any of those options are very tricky and challenging, you are going to see the art of the deal from Secretary Pompeo right now. I think he's--"

Am I wrong?"

He was playing over the weekend and gave a performance of a lifetime. It all started when his coach told him to run to home plate as, you know, fast as he could, but Lennox had another idea in mind, and that's when he shifted gears, slowed it down, way down. He headed for home, slow-motion, the crowd is sheering as he inched his way little by little towards home plate and he scores! That's for the highlight reel. I remember those days. Run. Cheers as a parent. All right. Before we go I want to take a minute and thank all of you. Our viewers, again making us the most watched show in cable news. Again, for the month of April, the first quarter of this year. Thank you. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're going to work harder every night. That's our promise."
