We had an ambassador in Russia even during the years of Stalin.  So, I think having open lines of communication is very important for avoiding war. And I think that’s what I would see this meeting as, is renewing engagement and renewing open lines of conversation. Look, we’re at war in Syria, and our planes are flying in the same airspace. We need to make sure that we’re trying to avoid accidental war. And so I commend President Trump for taking this meeting.",

I think we have gone a little deranged as far as over the top on this thing. Dov Levin looked at this from the Carnegie-Mellon University. And he looked between 1946 and 2000, and he said there were 81 instances of the U.S. meddling in elections, and 36 of Russian meddling in elections. None of it makes it right. But I have said repeatedly that countries that can spy do and countries that can meddle in elections do. All of them do on both sides of it.  So what we should do is try to protect the integrity of our election, make sure ours is decentralized, protected, do everything we can. But the other thing we should mention to the Russians, Putin says, oh, we can’t have any engagement because of this. Well, they ought to think twice about trying to get involved in our election again, because it’s made it impossible for us to make progress on things.  So, the Russian meddling in the election, maybe they thought it might be better to have Trump. But guess what? In the end, what they done is made it impossible for any engagement to happen, because everybody is crazy now about the meddling in the election.  So, when I talk to the Russians, that’s what I say to them. I can’t prove whether you did or didn’t, but think twice about it because you have messed it up as far as trying to get any kind of progress on North Korea, Syria, Ukraine.",

It’s almost impossible for any kind of lessening of tensions right now because of what they did in the election.  And so, yes, that is known, but then some on the Democrat side, I think, are just so crazy in their hatred of Trump. Look at John Brennan. John Brennan is out there calling the president a traitor.  John Brennan was in charge of collecting information on every American, on every person in the world. He had this tremendous power to spy on the entire world. And now turns out he’s a deranged Trump hater? That should concern us and make us think that we need to have checks and balances on our intelligence community, because this is just too much power.

And I think that I agree with George Kennan, who was one of the greatest diplomats of the last century, who said that if we expand NATO into Eastern Europe, you will have the rise of nationalism and militarism in Russia. He predicted the rise of Putin. And so when I opposed adding Montenegro, little Montenegro, to NATO, John McCain said I was working for Putin. This is the dumbing down of diplomacy, the dumbing down of foreign policy. John McCain wants to call people names and say, oh, you’re working for Putin. The Democrats are doing the same thing. Everybody is a traitor.

Gosh, if we just had more of your information, we could protect you. if we just had every bit of your information. Well, that basically guts the Fourth Amendment. So I’m very, very disappointed. I’m worried that he will cancel out Justice Gorsuch’s vote.  But President Trump did pick someone very good in Justice Gorsuch, who is great. He’s now the leading voice on the Supreme Court on privacy. But I’m worried Kavanaugh won’t be. But I also have to put this in perspective. This could be a Clinton nominee. So, I have to overall say, as much as I disagree on the Fourth Amendment, how would I judge this overall candidate compared to an Obama appointee or a Clinton appointee?
