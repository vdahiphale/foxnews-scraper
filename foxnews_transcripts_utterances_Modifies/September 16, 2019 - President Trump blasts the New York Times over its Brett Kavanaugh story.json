It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A New York Times bombshell about Brett Kavanaugh, bust. President Trump reacting just minutes ago, the paper now being accused of smearing the Supreme Court justice, it comes after a weekend story about a new sexual assault allegation from Kavanaugh's college days. The Times forced to make a major revision after leaving out key facts, including that the accuser decline to be interviewed, and that friends say she doesn't even recall the alleged incident. 2020 Democrats immediately jumping on the unverified claim to demand Kavanaugh be impeached. President Trump responding by defending Kavanaugh and attacking the Times, watch.",

They've just announced there's a correction. But to do that about a Supreme Court justice is a terrible thing. It's a false accusation. Whatever happened with the New York Times, I mean, I can tell you, personally, they never checked. They never do.  We used to have a thing called fact-checking. They don't do fact-checking anymore. They use to call and say, what about this, what about that? How can they do a thing like that and destroys somebody's life? I mean, they're destroying lives. And it's fake news. It's just fake news. But it's a very fair question. I mean, they have to be very embarrassed. But much more importantly, what they do is wrong, and they do it all the time.",

Everything we've just said was a complete and utter lie. Most editors and writers are liberal, we know that. But most good editors will operate with a conservative filter so they don't get compromised by their own biases. So they know that they're liberal, and they don't want -- but if they don't check themselves, then they might allow a corrupt product to go through. That no longer exists for the New York Times. So their filter is gone, so anything goes through.

You guys have always wanted to chip away at the second amendment, and Beto came along with a chainsaw and said let's go. And you guys usually win elections with you're moderate, not when you act like madmen. There's no chance now. Legislatively, you're not getting anything done when someone like Beto comes out and says this. And now, gun tweeting Americans don't trust Democrats. And they didn't trust them on guns very much to begin with. If you look at all of the issues the Democrats are running on global warming, taxes, guns, immigration, they've lost their patients, and they don't want incremental change anymore. They want to just go full for open borders, socialism, raise taxes, grab your guns, and that's scary stuff. Beto is a man-child. He -- I honestly believe he, you know, was seriously and genuinely affected by the mass shooting. But now he's shrunk his candidacy down to a single issue that will never grow up into anything nationally, and he's been, you know, wrong on this issue from the very beginning, because if you look at -- I have a list of all of the latest mass shootings here in the, I think, six years, 90 to 85 percent of them all passed background checks.

So, they had to have a town hall meeting. And basically, they came out and said, OK, like we're sorry, we shouldn't have done that, we should be more circumspect of Trump. This is pretty interesting to me. The reporters who authored the op ed that ran that then now has been given a correction. They are actually - they're authors of a book, but they are also reporters for The New York Times. So, this is what I think is an interesting thing that you might want to have a town hall about this. So, they have news in their book apparently, now discredited, but they said they have news. If I were the New York Times editor, I'd say well, wait, are you reporters? Are you authors of a book?

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A New York Times bombshell about Brett Kavanaugh, bust. President Trump reacting just minutes ago, the paper now being accused of smearing the Supreme Court justice, it comes after a weekend story about a new sexual assault allegation from Kavanaugh's college days. The Times forced to make a major revision after leaving out key facts, including that the accuser decline to be interviewed, and that friends say she doesn't even recall the alleged incident. 2020 Democrats immediately jumping on the unverified claim to demand Kavanaugh be impeached. President Trump responding by defending Kavanaugh and attacking the Times, watch."

They've just announced there's a correction. But to do that about a Supreme Court justice is a terrible thing. It's a false accusation. Whatever happened with the New York Times, I mean, I can tell you, personally, they never checked. They never do. We used to have a thing called fact-checking. They don't do fact-checking anymore. They use to call and say, what about this, what about that? How can they do a thing like that and destroys somebody's life? I mean, they're destroying lives. And it's fake news. It's just fake news.

Everything we've just said was a complete and utter lie. Most editors and writers are liberal, we know that. But most good editors will operate with a conservative filter so they don't get compromised by their own biases. So they know that they're liberal, and they don't want -- but if they don't check themselves, then they might allow a corrupt product to go through. That no longer exists for the New York Times. So their filter is gone, so anything goes through. I think we should be pretty grateful that there're people like Mollie Hemingway that are out there, because I didn't -- like, I didn't spend the time this weekend reading a book.

And it raises that -- a really big question, how many stories did they get away with because nobody was paying attention? I would say almost all of the stories New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong. That's how I see it. Now, they're all wrong. No, because I've been -- you know this, Dana.

And the FBI couldn't find any evidence to back up what Ford was saying, although she gave good testimony.

This is fiction. So people were freaking out thinking aliens were attacking. It goes to your point earlier. So, they omit the fundamental information that this is not corroborated, this is an allegation from the prior. Then they do it in a delivery which says, oh, it's harmless fun and have to retract that just like their 9/11 tweet. And then we have on the side a bunch of 2020 Democratic candidates who say they are all for criminal justice reform and yet are playing judge, jury and executioners. And Kamala Harris is saying you lied and your testimony should be retracted, and you -- all should be impeached. The Democratic Party, to me, if this is continued -- if they continue to pursue this, they're shooting themselves in the foot. And then it is themselves that they're destroying."

The Democrats have always wanted to take your guns. Beto is this one stupid enough to say it. You guys have always wanted to chip away at the second amendment, and Beto came along with a chainsaw and said let's go. And you guys usually win elections with you're moderate, not when you act like madmen. There's no chance now. Legislatively, you're not getting anything done when someone like Beto comes out and says this. And now, gun tweeting Americans don't trust Democrats. And they didn't trust them on guns very much to begin with. If you look at all of the issues the Democrats are running on global warming, taxes, guns, immigration, they've lost their patients, and they don't want incremental change anymore. They want to just go full for open borders, socialism, raise taxes, grab your guns, and that's scary stuff. Beto is a man-child. He -- I honestly believe he, you know, was seriously and genuinely affected by the mass shooting. But now he's shrunk his candidacy down to a single issue that will never grow up into anything nationally, and he's been, you know, wrong on this issue from the very beginning, because if you look at -- I have a list of all of the latest mass shootings here in the, I think, six years, 90 to 85 percent of them all passed background checks. And the ones that didn't, the kid stole the gun from his mom or dad. So it's really not about the rifle, which is legal. It's about something other than what they're talking about."

As somebody -- I can no longer trust the concept of red flags as somebody who basically introduce it here two or three years ago. Beto's showed me how the red flag gimmick would be callously abused in targeting people that he doesn't like. If he finds it -- if he thinks that you are too pro-gun, he could report you, which is what he might do, because that's the kind of bureaucrat he is. He says, hell, yes, he's going to take your guns. No. I predict he'll be taking my order at Starbucks in an El Paso outlet. Beto's quest, it's purely egocentric. He's got no talent. He's got no wisdom, no persuasive skills. He's the guy who has the Jack Kerouac novel in his back of his pocket that he doesn't read. He's got an acoustic guitar that he never knows how to play but has it out in front. He's the candidate version of Phoebe from Friends. Every time she shows up in an episode of Friends, you just were like waiting for her to get off screen. He is Phoebe from Friends."

The deal could be worth up to $12 billion over time. Juan, I know you feel strongly about this."

And in terms of anybody pursuing civil damages you just become another creditor, and the Sackler family is able to protect their fortune. Their personal fortune, Emily. But the criminal charges can continue. So if a state or an individual wanted to go after them on criminal charges, that's separate. But this looks like an effort to protect the Sackler family's fortune."

      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",

And in 2007, they pled guilty to lying and misleading regulators and doctors and patients about how addictive it was, because they knew it's really addictive and they didn't tell the truth about it. So even after that settlement, what the Sackler family did, they came in and they just stripped $11 billion out of the company and put it in these offshore trusts for the family to protect it against litigation. So now, the question is, are they going to pony up -- how many billions of dollars to settle it with all of these people? I think they have to settle because people need money in their hands."

That well is going to run dry at some point. At the same time, the federal government, the taxpayers are trying to fund to a significant amount of money that President Trump was able to get past. And that's kind of stalled out. Like the states have different programs. They're trying. It's like, actually, they're finding that there's very few things that really work. I would love to see more money put towards research and development of an opioid that would work. Or maybe it's not an opioid, but a pain reliever that actually does the job without the addiction. That's where we should be. That's the moonshot we should be trying for."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm going to go in -- defend the drug companies. Right now, we're letting the media direct this story and they're not using the facts, right? OK. People that use prescription opioids have a very low addiction rate, one to two percent, according to much of the research. When they talk about overdoses they are never been specific about them. They say opioids. It's a mixture of drugs. They often find in some studies between 3 to 6 different drugs on somebody, when they overdose, and the people that are dying are usually is with Xanax that is laced with fentanyl. So it's not prescription drugs. So if you limit the actual supply to people who have pain, or have cancer, or pain syndromes, then you're just pushing them to the street where they will get the drugs that will end up killing them. This is what media does all the time. They've done this with opioids. They're doing it now with vaping. We've said before, the vaping problem isn't the vehicle, right? It's not the vaping. It's what people are putting in it, which is probably THC, THC related products, vitamin E, perhaps. But it isn't the actual thing that is helping people reduce their smoking, which is going to save lives in the long run, millions of lives. People are overdosing on street drugs with the vaping, with the opioids. It's the same with nuclear power. It's the same with firearms. The media reacts without the facts, and they have a great villain. They have a great villain in the drug companies and it's too bad, because the people that are suffering are the people who have pain conditions, people with cancer, who have to keep going back to the pharmacy every freaking two weeks to get their drugs."

So, they had to have a town hall meeting. And basically, they came out and said, OK, like we're sorry, we shouldn't have done that, we should be more circumspect of Trump. This is pretty interesting to me. The reporters who authored the op ed that ran that then now has been given a correction. They are actually - they're authors of a book, but they are also reporters for The New York Times. So, this is what I think is an interesting thing that you might want to have a town hall about this. So, they have news in their book apparently, now discredited, but they said they have news. If I were the New York Times editor, I'd say well, wait, are you reporters? Are you authors of a book?

We've got - I love the spin of this little hamster, he loves the spin, the spin will never stop there Jesse. Never stop there. There he goes.

That's a group that helps provide service dogs to veterans in need. She's just four months old now and she's going to be a great dog in the future helping with PTSD or disabilities other types of needs. But the Coyotes, they're not the only team giving back.
