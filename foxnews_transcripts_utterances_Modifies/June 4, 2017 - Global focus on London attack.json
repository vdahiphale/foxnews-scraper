It remains at severe. It has not -- and I underscore that, it has not been upgraded to critical as it was after the attack in Manchester.  And now we're getting our best look yet at the white van that caused so much of the carnage and mayhem. Take a look at this still-frame. This is the vehicle in question. This vehicle was heading south over the London Bridge last night when it ploughed into pedestrians. It jumped the curb coming to rest near a light pole. Three men then exited the van, and then they began attempting to stab people nearby.  As you mentioned, the death toll now seven dead, 48 wounded. Police killed the three attackers. The question now, did they do it on their own or did they have any help? In the east end section of London, the neighborhood of Barking, in the last few hours, there have been a series of raids and as of now, 12 people have been arrested. Not clear, Howie, to what if any extent those 12 people are connected to the carnage that took place just 16 hours ago. The investigation here continues.",

Is to instill fear and not just take people's lives, which is the worst-case scenario, but to try and make sure that people don't go out and enjoy their freedoms that they have in these western countries like the UK and United States and all over Europe. That's certainly something that they want to do. We also see in these reports that these men who got out of the van were wearing fake suicide vests in order to instil even more fear which obviously they probably were connecting that to the recent Manchester attack. This is not something that seems to be isolated. This is not a lone-wolf problem. We have 12 suspects arrested this morning in London and also the 18 suspect who are arrested in Manchester today as a result of that suicide bombing recently and so this is ongoing. British officials and officials all the world are clearly having a very hard time coming to terms with this, but they're having an impact on the way that people think about whether they want to go to a crowded area or to a concert with their children.",

And as I think you're aware, there are searches ongoing in East London and 12 arrests have already been made. There is clearly more to do and we will work relentlessly to get to the facts. We have established that the van used during the attack was a white van that was recently hired by one of the attackers. As our own ascending (ph) grows, we now understand that the van at London Bridge started the attack at 21:58 yesterday they went from north to south down the river remember the public calling police a few later. The van mantled the pavements and collided with pedestrians before being abandoned where attackers were armed with knives continued into the Borough Market area stabbing numerous people. The attackers were then confronted by the fire-armed officers, and I can confirm that eight police firearms officers discharged their weapons. Whilst this will be subject to an investigation by the IPTCC, our initial assessment is in a region of 50 rounds in the reason of 50 bullets were fired by those eight officers. The three attackers were shot dead. The situation these officers were confronted with was critical, a matter of life and death. Three armed men wearing what appeared to be suicide belts. They had already attacked and killed men to the public and had to be stopped immediately. Until then, I'm not surprised that when faced - with what they must have feared were suicide bombers. The firearms officers fired an unprecedented number of rounds to be completely confident that they had neutralized the threat that those men posed. I'm humbled by the bravery of an officer who will rush toward a potential suicide bomber thinking only of protecting others. As the officers confronted the terrorists, a member of the public also suffered a gunshot wound.  Although, the injuries are not critical in nature, they are in hospital receiving medical attention, and we will of course keep you updated on that. Seven people have been killed in addition to three attackers were to inform the next kin of the victims is ongoing, and this might take some time as we believe some of the victims are from abroad. On top of that, we have 36 people remain in hospital suffering from a range of injuries. Some of these are extremely serious and 21 remain in critical condition. You will have heard today about the British transport police officer who suffered injuries in the attack responding to the incident. I can also confirm that an off-duty Metropolitan Police Officer based on sort of Borough was caught up in the attack. Fortunately, he has not suffered life-threatening injuries. He remains in hospital. The investigation team is taking statements from hundreds of witnesses and, I again, appeal to anybody with information or put it on the incident to make contact with the police. Recorders have been placed around London Bridge and around Borough Market area will remain in place (INAUDIBLE) and we've encouraged the public to avoid the area while our investigation continues. This is likely to have some impact on travel arrangements in the first part of tomorrow morning and we'd asked everyone to check with that travel operators and take alternate routes when necessary. Now the public can expect to see additional police both armed and unarmed across the capitol over the forthcoming days and as security plans and policing plans for forthcoming events are being reviewed. You will also see increased physical measures in order to keep the public safe on London Bridges. Finally, I asked the public to remain calm but vigilant and if you see anything suspicious, no matter how insignificant you think it might be, please don't hesitate to contact the police either 999 or the antiterrorism hotline, 0-800-789-321.

I know he has had a conversation with the prime minister over there and has pledged his support. But you have to remember, we have seen courts legislating from the bench prohibiting the president from implementing a program which will call for extreme vetting coming in to the United States. These are the same courts which have decided to legislate from the bench as opposed to interpret the rules that the president clearly has a constitutional authority to implement on behalf of the people of our country.

Now, 14 years later, The Times is abashing the job as the Washington Post did a few years. Publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. told his staff the responsibility has outgrown not one office and that the papers social media followers can act as a collective watchdog. That I'm afraid is a rationalization. The ombudsman demands answers from editors and reporters when they screw up. Liz spade was being let go from the position after just a year on the job called out sometimes reporters were being too opinionated on Twitter and that, \"there is a slide toward coverage that can be misperceived as rooting for Trump's demise\". This is precisely the wrong time The New York Times to silence the kind of voice. You know, we came in here this morning as we have on many mornings and had to rip up the show to deal with the London attack, the attack on the bridge there, the van and knife-wielding assailants and, you know, I have to ask all these questions. What's the latest? Will there be a news conference. What can we get rid of? And, you know, we try to be on the breaking news but not ignore other news and that is always a balancing act as we look at these pictures. I have to say, we've all gotten weary of the constant scourge of terror, perhaps especially journalist who have to chronicle each attack, there is a level on which - that we give the terrorists what they want by spreading their message of fear. What happened at London Bridge was horrifying and deserves every minute of coverage but the challenge for the media, for all of us in the news business, for all of us who are dedicated to reporting and analyzing news is to aggressively report the facts to each one of these horrifying attacks - this heart-breaking attacks without losing a sense of proportion, without making a dangerous world seemed more dangerous than they're already is which is exactly what our enemies would want. That's it for this edition of \"MediaBuzz\", I'm Howard Kurtz. Glad you could be with us. We hope you like our Facebook page. We post a lot of content there and I continue the conversation. You can also let us know what you think by emailing mediabuzz@foxnews.com. Do you want to comment on the media, let's continue the conversation on twitter @howardkurtz.

It remains at severe. It has not -- and I underscore that, it has not been upgraded to critical as it was after the attack in Manchester. And now we're getting our best look yet at the white van that caused so much of the carnage and mayhem. Take a look at this still-frame. This is the vehicle in question. This vehicle was heading south over the London Bridge last night when it ploughed into pedestrians. It jumped the curb coming to rest near a light pole. Three men then exited the van, and then they began attempting to stab people nearby. As you mentioned, the death toll now seven dead, 48 wounded. Police killed the three attackers. The question now, did they do it on their own or did they have any help? In the east end section of London, the neighborhood of Barking, in the last few hours, there have been a series of raids and as of now, 12 people have been arrested. Not clear, Howie, to what if any extent those 12 people are connected to the carnage that took place just 16 hours ago. The investigation here continues."

Is to instill fear and not just take people's lives, which is the worst-case scenario, but to try and make sure that people don't go out and enjoy their freedoms that they have in these western countries like the UK and United States and all over Europe. That's certainly something that they want to do. We also see in these reports that these men who got out of the van were wearing fake suicide vests in order to instil even more fear which obviously they probably were connecting that to the recent Manchester attack. This is not something that seems to be isolated. This is not a lone-wolf problem. We have 12 suspects arrested this morning in London and also the 18 suspect who are arrested in Manchester today as a result of that suicide bombing recently and so this is ongoing. British officials and officials all the world are clearly having a very hard time coming to terms with this, but they're having an impact on the way that people think about whether they want to go to a crowded area or to a concert with their children."

Do we restrict access to the country via immigration and refugee status? To me, those are both political arguments but they are made by both sides of the aisle. I think both are equally applicable to the problems of terrorism, so both are valid for discussion. At least from a media perspective, it's important to examine both of these because these are major issues for American voters."

Aslan writes, \"This piece of blank is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency.

I usually think a lot of the coverage after these attacks are fairly routine at this point. And I think we actually need to do a better job asking about next steps.

I think a lot of people based on the coverage of the election and all the news that we've had, really have kind of forgotten about what the Paris Climate did, what it was, what the obligations of the United States were. During the coverage, I didn't really hear about why are we in this? Why did President Obama make this decision? What are the binding factors for the United States? And how does it affect the American economy? What was the thinking behind the president's decision to pull out? It was more about calling the president a climate denier telling, you know, saying that he was committing an act of treason against the American people and the world for pulling out of this agreement.

When it comes to Sean Spicer, I'm always curious about why journalists think that he would be on his way out in a sense of he goes out to the podium everyday whenever there's a briefing and acts the way that President Trump would act. He's speaking on behalf of the president and his contentious attitude with the press seems to be exactly what the president would do and want. This idea that he's somehow making the office look bad, making the president look bad, he actually speaks on behalf of the president, and I think he's doing what the president would do and therefore why would he be fired?"

You look at national security policy, we had an FBI director who was fired, a national security adviser who was fired, a deputy who's being posted elsewhere. We've got the acting attorney general fired. So, shakeup is not, you know, the media could be forgiven for extrapolating from conflict that shakeups are going to happen."

They're pulling back some regulations, and I talked to a reporter from the Salt Lake Tribune yesterday who was taking how certain regulations are affecting that state.

And as I think you're aware, there are searches ongoing in East London and 12 arrests have already been made. There is clearly more to do and we will work relentlessly to get to the facts. We have established that the van used during the attack was a white van that was recently hired by one of the attackers. As our own ascending (ph) grows, we now understand that the van at London Bridge started the attack at 21:58 yesterday they went from north to south down the river remember the public calling police a few later. The van mantled the pavements and collided with pedestrians before being abandoned where attackers were armed with knives continued into the Borough Market area stabbing numerous people. The attackers were then confronted by the fire-armed officers, and I can confirm that eight police firearms officers discharged their weapons. Whilst this will be subject to an investigation by the IPTCC, our initial assessment is in a region of 50 rounds in the reason of 50 bullets were fired by those eight officers. The three attackers were shot dead. The situation these officers were confronted with was critical, a matter of life and death. Three armed men wearing what appeared to be suicide belts. They had already attacked and killed men to the public and had to be stopped immediately. Until then, I'm not surprised that when faced - with what they must have feared were suicide bombers. The firearms officers fired an unprecedented number of rounds to be completely confident that they had neutralized the threat that those men posed. I'm humbled by the bravery of an officer who will rush toward a potential suicide bomber thinking only of protecting others. As the officers confronted the terrorists, a member of the public also suffered a gunshot wound. Although, the injuries are not critical in nature, they are in hospital receiving medical attention, and we will of course keep you updated on that. Seven people have been killed in addition to three attackers were to inform the next kin of the victims is ongoing, and this might take some time as we believe some of the victims are from abroad. On top of that, we have 36 people remain in hospital suffering from a range of injuries. Some of these are extremely serious and 21 remain in critical condition. You will have heard today about the British transport police officer who suffered injuries in the attack responding to the incident. I can also confirm that an off-duty Metropolitan Police Officer based on sort of Borough was caught up in the attack. Fortunately, he has not suffered life-threatening injuries. He remains in hospital. The investigation team is taking statements from hundreds of witnesses and, I again, appeal to anybody with information or put it on the incident to make contact with the police. Recorders have been placed around London Bridge and around Borough Market area will remain in place (INAUDIBLE) and we've encouraged the public to avoid the area while our investigation continues. This is likely to have some impact on travel arrangements in the first part of tomorrow morning and we'd asked everyone to check with that travel operators and take alternate routes when necessary. Now the public can expect to see additional police both armed and unarmed across the capitol over the forthcoming days and as security plans and policing plans for forthcoming events are being reviewed. You will also see increased physical measures in order to keep the public safe on London Bridges. Finally, I asked the public to remain calm but vigilant and if you see anything suspicious, no matter how insignificant you think it might be, please don't hesitate to contact the police either 999 or the antiterrorism hotline, 0-800-789-321. I'll take a couple of questions."

Corey, you come in the middle of a Breaking News event as you know, let me ask you President Trump tweeting this morning, among the things that he said about the London attack.

I know he has had a conversation with the prime minister over there and has pledged his support. But you have to remember, we have seen courts legislating from the bench prohibiting the president from implementing a program which will call for extreme vetting coming in to the United States. These are the same courts which have decided to legislate from the bench as opposed to interpret the rules that the president clearly has a constitutional authority to implement on behalf of the people of our country. And what he said was our system is not designed right now to make sure that we know who's coming in to our country, so we have to stop being politically correct so that we're saving American lives and hopefully we don't have terrorist attacks on our own soil."

And what we've seen is that we're now going to have the opportunity to check people's social media activities because it wasn't that long ago where the San Bernardino killer came in under a K1 visa, committed a Jihad, and if we would have had the opportunity to look at her social media activity with we would have seen that she was exactly going to do that when she came to this country."

If he would have stayed in, the mainstream media would have said see? The president has flip-flopped. He changed his position on the campaign and he has no principles. Instead, what he did was exactly what he said he was going to do, which is exactly what he campaigned on, which is he said that is a $2.5 trillion expense over the next 10 years. It's 6 million jobs lost. It's a $3 billion slush fund to the United Nations of which the United States is paying all of it.

But what he has said and he's been on the record of -- in the past, of what he believes climate change and if it's real or if it isn't real. And I think the only person who's going to speak for the president on this is the president. He is the most accessible president we've ever had. He's exceptionally successful not just to the American people through Twitter but also to the media coverage and we've seen that to the White House Correspondent Association. They said that he's unbelievably accessible. And so, I'm sure they'll have the opportunity to directly ask the president that question."

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",

The president got no credit for negotiating the release of the U.S. Citizen in an Egyptian prison which Barack Obama couldn't get done. He literally got no credit for this. He's put jobs back - he put jobs on the table. The economy is booming. The stock market is at the highest it has been. If you look at the last month, there's supposed to be 185,000 new jobs created. There was 250,000 new jobs created are, you know, by every measure that you can look at this administration has been successful and the mainstream media has given him no credit. That doesn't even include all the executive orders that he has done, which allows coal miners and steel workers back to work and stops countries from dumping their goods on our soil without some kind of repercussion."

I think there's a lot of things that I can do and say to help him from the outside. If he were to say to me, Corey, I absolutely need you to come in, it would be a tough family decision. I've got young kids. I live in New Hampshire. I've got a great life and look I'm willing to serve my country in any capacity possible, but I think there's a lot of ways that I can do this from the outside to make sure that his agenda of tax reform and infrastructure spending and repeal and replacement of ObamaCare and building a wall on the southern border all get done."

We've seen a lot of that with these shakeup stories or alleged shakeup I should say, and sometimes they kind of make the president look like he is not completely in control or they reflect badly on the president.

Then what we've seen is there's been reports now that classified information has been leaked out. We've seen what happened in the previous administration was unmasking those being taking place for political reasons. If anybody has been part of that, they shouldn't be there.

That's why you don't see an obvious replacement just coming right up for Scott Pelley. The evening news is simply not what it used to be. Cable news ratings are rising, the network broadcast are losing audience and yet they still - they may not be the natural hart (ph) that they once were..."

But it seems all to me that once all the networks moved away from the sort of, again, rather Katie Couric and Sir Romano (ph), that all the network anchors now are a little bit more working like and Scott Pelley was a very good reporter.

But, the network let her go, fired her from the New Year's Eve extravaganza after this image -- after she pulled this grotesque stunt posing with the decapitated head - a blood Trump mask and after the condemnation who sold out on the left and the right. It was then that the comedian made a video apology."

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "You know what they say that they say the cover-up is always worse than the crime. And I think that analogy pertains quite nicely to the disaster of a press conference that we saw on Friday. And the most mind- boggling part of this whole thing is she's now accusing the president of trying to ruin her career when she's the one who held up the fake, decapitated head of President Trump. So, for her to play the victim is crazy. You know, she's saying that she has her free speech right to do whatever she wants. Well, you know what, Howie? The president and his family also have their free speech right to speak out against her."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I was going - I was going to make that point. I mean, the president sent out a tweet. Melania Trump put out a statement. They were reacting to what she had done, but there was a lot of talk at this presser about the First Amendment about censorship. This is happening because she's a woman, and I have to ask you, you know, nobody's trying to stop Kathy Griffin from telling jokes about Donald Trump or anyone else, but companies have a right not to associate with her, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes. Of course and the whole sexist argument, I think women should actually be very offensive - offended by that because there are real examples of sexism that happened every single day. But the president tweeting about Kathy Griffin isn't something that you can say is sexist. It's because she mocks a - she pretended to be a terrorist and thought it was funny. It has nothing to do with sexism. So, I think that actually women should be very offended by her bringing that into this argument. What a total excuse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think she should have stuck with her original apology, which at least seemed heartfelt. Now, CNN had some initial hesitation for its network said nothing and then it said we're evaluating the situation. As the story or criticism got louder, CNN severing its ties with Kathy Griffin who of course had been a fixture on the New Year's Eve Special with Anderson Cooper. Did the network really have any choice here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "No. I don't think that they had a choice. I think that CNN actually acted within a relatively appropriate timeframe. They came out -- they condemned the picture and then around 24 hours later, they severed ties with her. Of course, other companies, Squatty Potty in particular pulled the plug on her endorsement..."

But, I'm wondering this, pullback the camera a little bit look at the sort of Hollywood hatred of this president, do you think Kathy Griffin may have thought she would have gotten not just laughs but applause for doing this outrageous photo stunt? Because, you know, others have either paid no price or actually has helped their careers whether it's Madonna using about blowing up the White House or Stephen Colbert telling that crude sex joke about Trump and Putin."

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "A 100% and Kathy Griffin really isn't the first celebrity to threaten the president physically. Of course, Snoop Dogg made that music video earlier this year pointing a fake gun at the president, like you said, Madonna blowing up the White House. Robert de Niro said that he wanted to punch the president. And I think the media also is partly to blame here as well. There was a recent study that said that 80% of the president's news coverage in the first 100 days was largely negative. So, in the words of Donald Trump Jr., this is shocking but it really doesn't come as any surprise..."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't think she was trying to threaten the president. I do think it was grotesque and she is paying the price and it's not because of anything the president said, it's because the country left and right was kind of repulsed by this. Carley Shimkus, great to see you."

      "utterance": "Now, at least, there is some kind of line that you can't cross in terms of vicious personal attacks on the president. And CNN ultimately did the right thing. No way, the network could have put her on with one of the top anchors, Anderson Cooper. And Bill Maher apologized yesterday for calling himself a house n word, using the actual word, an interview with Senator Ben Sasse. Maher said he used an offensive word and a banter of a life moment and he is very sorry. HBO, which runs the show called the use of the racial epithet, completely inexcusable and tasteless, and I agree with that. We'll be right back with some final thoughts."

      "utterance": "After I exposed the Jason Flair fabrication scam at the New York Times, the paper decided to create a job of ombudsman or public editor. Now, 14 years later, The Times is abashing the job as the Washington Post did a few years. Publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. told his staff the responsibility has outgrown not one office and that the papers social media followers can act as a collective watchdog. That I'm afraid is a rationalization. The ombudsman demands answers from editors and reporters when they screw up. Liz spade was being let go from the position after just a year on the job called out sometimes reporters were being too opinionated on Twitter and that, \"there is a slide toward coverage that can be misperceived as rooting for Trump's demise\". This is precisely the wrong time The New York Times to silence the kind of voice. You know, we came in here this morning as we have on many mornings and had to rip up the show to deal with the London attack, the attack on the bridge there, the van and knife-wielding assailants and, you know, I have to ask all these questions. What's the latest? Will there be a news conference. What can we get rid of? And, you know, we try to be on the breaking news but not ignore other news and that is always a balancing act as we look at these pictures. I have to say, we've all gotten weary of the constant scourge of terror, perhaps especially journalist who have to chronicle each attack, there is a level on which - that we give the terrorists what they want by spreading their message of fear. What happened at London Bridge was horrifying and deserves every minute of coverage but the challenge for the media, for all of us in the news business, for all of us who are dedicated to reporting and analyzing news is to aggressively report the facts to each one of these horrifying attacks - this heart-breaking attacks without losing a sense of proportion, without making a dangerous world seemed more dangerous than they're already is which is exactly what our enemies would want.
