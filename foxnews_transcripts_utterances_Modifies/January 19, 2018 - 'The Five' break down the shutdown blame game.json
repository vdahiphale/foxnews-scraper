Effective? JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No, there's just so much -- so easy to counter attack because, obviously, he could have passed the chip program, the children's health insurance plan, at any point and the Republicans didn't do it.

It's a real moment for these young people who are pro-life supporters. They always get there. Thankfully the weather wasn't as bad as it usually is for them. But this corresponds with a time when you see that attitudes towards life are changing, and partly I think that is because of science. The science is starting to show that earlier and earlier, babies can be born and survive if they are born prematurely. And also, I think, that there's something to be said about all the benefits that we have from technology that are showing us what we might believe in our hearts is that life begins at conception. But now, you can actually see it more, and that's made a big difference."

In addition to that, the house today passed a bill called the born alive act, which would make that illegal. Kimberly, you know a little bit of that from the Gosnell trial.

I will say, yeah, a lot of people do think abortion should be legal, even knowing that it's murder. It's an interesting moral state that we've come to that many people accept that abortion is murder, but still want it legal. That is part of the pro- choice idea. They're not denying it's murder.

This better be good. Let's assume it is what we think it is. And what we think it is is the Obama administration, the department of justice, and the FBI, along with the Hillary Clinton campaign, abused the power of the surveillance program and spied on the Trump campaign before and after the election ended some serious unmasking. Now, if that's true, some of these congressmen say that people are going to be fired and people are going to go to jail. Not only that, Comey knew, allegedly. That's what another congressman said. And this has the potential to stop the Mueller investigation in its tracks. You know, it could be all sizzle, no steak, but I've never seen congressmen act as apoplectic before."

And I think it's because, one, that's not a good practice necessarily because we have FISA warrants for a reason and to keep them secret because you're trying to catch bad guys. I don't know how all of this got caught up in it, but I would imagine that if the president wanted to declassify the FISA application and not just have it as an issue to bludgeon the Democrats with and the previous administration with and to try to muddy the waters of the Mueller investigation, he would release it.
