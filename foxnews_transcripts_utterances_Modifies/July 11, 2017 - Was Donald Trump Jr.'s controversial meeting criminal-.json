Donald Trump Jr. released the email chain with his plans for meeting with a Russian lawyer last year, that lawyer allegedly had connections to the Kremlin. The emails between Trump Jr. and the British publicist Rod Goldstone who acted as a middleman for the meeting, shown in part Goldstone appearing to offer incriminating information about Hillary Clinton as, quote, part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump. Trump Jr. later replying, seems we have some time and if it's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer. This afternoon, the White House responded to the news and also read a written statement from President Trump.",

Donald Trump Jr. broke no laws, likely broke no election ethics rules. If you have a problem with what Russia is doing with regards to our elections, then you have a problem with what Barack Obama did to stop them from doing it. He apparently never stopped any of this from happening. Very quickly, take a look at what I think is the epitome of Trump derangement syndrome happening today. Look at this full screen at CNN Money put out. Trump Jr. Emails trigger knee-jerk drop in stock market.

Look at the scenes of a city in utter ruins after nearly nine months of savage house to house fighting. ISIS's loss in Mosul, is a watershed moment in the battle against them, but it's a stark-less in how much sacrifice will truly be needed to defeat them. Another piece of potential good news today. The respected Syrian observatory for human rights reported it is confirmed information that Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was killed in eastern Syria. U.S. military however says it hasn't been able to independently confirm it. Also a U.S. army sergeant has been charged with seeking to provide classified military documents and training to ISIS, Erik [SIC] Kang, an air traffic control specialist stationed in Hawaii, was arrested on Saturday following a year-long undercover investigation by the FBI. Now, we don't have a lot of time to talk about it. There's a lot to unpack here. A couple of things: al-Baghdadi may be dead. ISIS may be defeated in Mosul. The fallout is horrible, yet we, quote -- we stop another potential terrorist attack by a U.S. military member in Hawaii. What do you think?",

Donald Trump Jr. released the email chain with his plans for meeting with a Russian lawyer last year, that lawyer allegedly had connections to the Kremlin. The emails between Trump Jr. and the British publicist Rod Goldstone who acted as a middleman for the meeting, shown in part Goldstone appearing to offer incriminating information about Hillary Clinton as, quote, part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump. Trump Jr. later replying, seems we have some time and if it's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer. This afternoon, the White House responded to the news and also read a written statement from President Trump."

Knowing what we know today, going even further, that we know so much more. Trump derangement syndrome out in force today, all day long. Donald Trump Jr. broke no laws, likely broke no election ethics rules. If you have a problem with what Russia is doing with regards to our elections, then you have a problem with what Barack Obama did to stop them from doing it. He apparently never stopped any of this from happening. Very quickly, take a look at what I think is the epitome of Trump derangement syndrome happening today. Look at this full screen at CNN Money put out. Trump Jr. Emails trigger knee-jerk drop in stock market. Now, if that isn't the dumbest headline and the dumbest substance for a story, I don't know what is. Matt Egan, you should have your journalism card pulled for that stupid headline, it makes no sense."

We know later this evening on Fox News, Sean Hannity is going to have an interview with Donald Trump Jr. where we will get more facts, and I'm looking forward to really giving a deep analysis after that.

Joe, I'm going to get you to weigh in on this. I think that this is a significant thing to discuss because you say no collusion, no collusion.

And they don't do a very good job managing the perception, the public perception that people have of them. I do have to say that, you know, Donald Trump Jr. releasing these emails was a good show of transparency, something that we haven't had -- we didn't have in the previous administration."

Can we talk about what Hillary Clinton did when she sold 20 percent of uranium supplied to the United States to the Russians, or when John Podesta had Russian stocks, his family had Russian stocks, when he's negotiating some Russian deals, or when Bill Clinton went to Russia, spoke to the Russian people, spoke to the Russian government -- our Russia today, and all of a sudden some corporations and groups are throwing money at the Clinton Foundation.

That's all I'm saying. Let the facts fall. Let's define what collusion is. Not just -- right? Because that's all what people are doing. They're using this term collusion and they're not really meeting the letter of the law, collusion, they just mean something improper, something secretive, something confidential."

Donald Trump Jr. is a businessman, he's not a politician. Someone said I've got something on the competition, he thought maybe that's a good idea to take. Let's look at this from a macro level. June 9, 2016, Donald Trump meets with a Russian lawyer who gives him no information on Hillary Clinton. It was a bait and switch. The only other accounts that we have now is Mike Flynn meeting with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, and Jeff Sessions meeting with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. The problem with those two meetings, those were after the election. For collusion to happen before an election, we would need some sort of proof or meetings before, and the only thing we have now is Donald Trump meaning with a Russian lawyer who gave him nothing."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "But you said that there was no evidence of any kind of collusion, I think part of the problem is the fact that everybody in the Trump administration connected to the Trump, involve in the campaign, said there was no meetings with Russia. There's nothing like it. And this email, hey, we're the Russian government. We want to help you out. I love it."

We'll see what Donald Trump Jr. says tonight on Sean's show. But the denial, I think that people have an issue, that's that perception problem you're talking about, Jeffrey. When you say I never met with these people. I never had any conversations with the Russians, and now we know that part at least is not true."

But what about this one. What about the Russian dossier that the Clinton foundation got their hands on. Someone, including, I think, John McCain had it as well. Prior of it getting leaked.

U.S. military however says it hasn't been able to independently confirm it.

And one of those was George Bush, and he was the one who brought up the Axis of Evil that people ridiculed him for. And granted, Iraq has changed. It was Iran, Iraq and North Korea. But he was one of the first presidents to really start talking about North Korea in a serious way. And I do think you have to have some credibility that you're going to use a military option. You can't just use a threat. When my kid, when my son was in junior high, he was being bullied. And we went to the teachers. We went to the principal; talked to the parents. And this kid kept bullying my son, who was much smaller than my kid. And I told my son, I said, \"You know what? You've tried all the diplomatic options.
