      "sentences": "So many court cases, so little time. We are live at the U.S. district court in Washington where the former Trump adviser Roger Stone, he's still inside. He has apologized already a number of times for a controversial Instagram threatening post about Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who's now presiding in this case.  Now, he has asked for forgiveness. What's at stake is what the judge could do in return for his comments. She could slap serious conditions or more conditions on his release or harsher restrictions on his ability to even talk to the media, or both.  When that ruling comes down and Roger Stone leaves that courthouse in Washington, D.C., we will take you there.  In the meantime, there's this. Familiar scene, a showdown in Venezuela today, a lot more clashes, and getting a lot more violent and a lot more heated, as a disputed President Nicolas Maduro orders the border with Brazil shut down to keep U.S. aid out. Now a top Russian diplomat is meeting with his Venezuelan counterpart in Moscow, backing up the Maduro regime, and all of this as the opposition leader, the guy we say is the rightful leader for the time being of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, calls on supporters to rise up and surround military bases this weekend in peaceful demonstrations to get their hands on that aid.  But will all this be peaceful? We're on it. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And first my thanks to my buddy Charles Payne for filling in while I was out.   Let's just say things are very, very tense in Venezuela at the moment, as Vice President Mike Pence prepares to make a high-profile trip next week to neighboring Colombia. To FOX Business Network's Blake Burman on the very latest. Hey, Blake.",

The Trump administration trying to continue to keep the pressure on Venezuela's contested president, Nicolas Maduro, as the White House announced today that the vice president, Mike Pence, will be heading to Colombia in just a few days' time on Monday. Standing in one of Venezuela's neighboring countries, the vice president will call on Maduro to step aside. A spokesperson for the V.P.'s office saying the following in a statement today -- quote -- \"The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy and freedom has the momentum. Juan Guaido is the only legitimate leader of Venezuela, and it's time for Nicolas Maduro to go.\"  The announcement comes as Maduro has shut off the border between Venezuela and Brazil. Maduro also going on television earlier today saying he is considering shutting down the Colombian border as well to stop who he views as the opposition from bringing in relief.   Guaido, the opposition leader, is organizing caravans, as he is trying to get humanitarian relief that is being stymied at the border to make its way through Venezuela. Last week over here at the White House, President Trump hosted Colombia's president. Both were critical of Maduro for stopping aid at the border.",

You want him afraid. That was the reason for that little note on John Bolton's notepad last month, 5,000 troops to Colombia, neither confirm, nor deny, just there. And I think the aim of this is, these are images that really matter. If Guaido does succeeds in bringing back some of this aid, it's symbolic.

He reposted that without the target in the background, ultimately took it down, and then was called the court today, where he spent over an hour on the stand answering questions from the judge, from his own lawyers and the prosecutors about whether these Instagram posts were a violation of the court's direction not to engage in activities that could end up threatening individuals involved in the case.   And the judge has just told Stone that here on out he is not allowed to speak publicly about the case on social media, on TV, on radio, and, significantly, he is not allowed to do that through third parties or surrogates.  So there is now a total gag order on Roger Stone. The judge also said that his explanation to the court, that he was under extreme financial and emotional stress, and he accepted responsibility for this action, according to the judge, rang hollow. And she made the point that it wasn't just about the social media posts from Roger Stone. It was about how those kinds of images and messages could incite others to commit acts of violence that were related to the case, Neil.",

It was like the opening night, and his jersey, Nike jersey, split right in half. It was sort of an incredible Hulk kind of moment. So that time is different, you could say. I mean, all eyes were on the LeBron James at that time, but it didn't cause an injury. So Nike, obviously struggling to figure out what happened, but was also pretty quick on the P.R. and branding messaging to say this was an isolated incident.

A spokesperson for the V.P.'s office saying the following in a statement today -- quote -- \"The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy and freedom has the momentum. Juan Guaido is the only legitimate leader of Venezuela, and it's time for Nicolas Maduro to go.\" The announcement comes as Maduro has shut off the border between Venezuela and Brazil. Maduro also going on television earlier today saying he is considering shutting down the Colombian border as well to stop who he views as the opposition from bringing in relief. Guaido, the opposition leader, is organizing caravans, as he is trying to get humanitarian relief that is being stymied at the border to make its way through Venezuela.

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, this was really a crisis of Roger Stone's own making that began a few days ago when he posted on Instagram a photo of the judge in this case, Amy Berman Jackson, with what appeared to be a target or a crosshairs in the background. He reposted that without the target in the background, ultimately took it down, and then was called the court today, where he spent over an hour on the stand answering questions from the judge, from his own lawyers and the prosecutors about whether these Instagram posts were a violation of the court's direction not to engage in activities that could end up threatening individuals involved in the case. And the judge has just told Stone that here on out he is not allowed to speak publicly about the case on social media, on TV, on radio, and, significantly, he is not allowed to do that through third parties or surrogates. So there is now a total gag order on Roger Stone. The judge also said that his explanation to the court, that he was under extreme financial and emotional stress, and he accepted responsibility for this action, according to the judge, rang hollow. And she made the point that it wasn't just about the social media posts from Roger Stone. It was about how those kinds of images and messages could incite others to commit acts of violence that were related to the case, Neil."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "I think the judge is taking a very traditional approach, which is, she's making incremental modifications, at least at this point, to the gag order. The next step would be some kind of modification of the terms of his bail. But I think the judge is taking sort of what I would counsel as a wise and incremental approach to punishing Stone for what she sees as actions that really could have incited violence against herself or others in this case, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Obviously, he's been a loose cannon. His reputation is such. He speaks his mind, sometimes goes overboard here. But this judge seems to be saying right up front, it's not going to happen. You're not going to be doing that, period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "That's right. And Stone had made the argument to the judge that he makes his living off of being in the media, being on TV. And this was one of the ways that he generated income for himself. And he testified in court today that he has seen his consulting business dry up, he's basically wiped out his savings. And for all of these reasons, he's under extreme emotional stress. But that was just not enough for the judge to say, OK, I'm going to allow you to continue with some of these activities because it's how you make your living. So, again, a very incremental approach by the judge, further restrictions on the gag order to stop Stone from publicly talking about the case or authorizing third parties to do so on his behalf, Neil."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "You know, there's been a lot of moving pieces, especially today, Neil. Number one, we got confirmation that the president's former personal attorney Michael Cohen will be on Capitol Hill for back-to-back hearings next week, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday on the House side, on the Senate side, but the most important day is sandwiched in the middle. And that will be Wednesday. That will be public testimony in front of the House Oversight Committee. But there are going to be restrictions on what we hear from Cohen. He's going to be asked questions that speak specifically to the case that has arisen in the Southern District of New York. So that's things like bank, tax fraud, campaign finance violations, and then the hush money payments during the campaign. The other thing that's happened, because we have seen an acceleration of the timeline in the Manafort for sentencing, not only here in Washington, D.C., but also in Virginia And people who have read the tea leaves see this as another indicator that the special counsel investigation is winding down. Our own reporting, our contacts say that this is really the endgame now, and the report could come in days or weeks. They don't foresee it as being longer than that, in part because a number of data points have finally aligned. The new attorney general, William Barr, is now in place."

So we didn't really expect to hear anything from Stone today. But the silence with reporters is not second nature to Stone. And he is obeying the new order from the judge, which completely shuts down any media contact or statements about the case. If I could, just back to the special counsel, because I think this is important for folks at home."

He -- the nomination for his new deputy, a senior Transportation Department official, Jeffrey Rosen, has been announced. And we have got an end date for the current deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, which is mid-March. And those close to Rosenstein have always maintained that he wanted to stay at Justice until the Mueller report was delivered. And to really sort of tamp down expectations, what we understand is that the report that goes to the attorney general from Robert Mueller is considered a confidential report for the attorney general only. And it will be attorney General Barr who decides how much is released publicly and how much goes to Congress. But, in either case, what goes to the public or what goes to Congress will be Mr. Barr's draft or summary of the Mueller findings, not the Mueller report itself -- Neil."

You might recall that he had currently led the Democrat, Dan McCready, by about 1,000 votes in what was deemed an undecided congressional race from last year. If Mark Harris has things his way, he wants a new election. The North Carolina board has done so. So this disputed seat that has just been sort of held in abeyance for the better part of a couple of months now will be decided one way or the other. No date has been set.

So they thought they hit pay dirt when a gay black man stepped forward and said, ah, MAGA people came out for me. And they attacked me in an alley. They didn't ask any questions.

When this report came out from Jussie Smollett, the local news stations reported it as what was given to them. So, sometimes, you're reporting the news as is.

It was like the opening night, and his jersey, Nike jersey, split right in half. It was sort of an incredible Hulk kind of moment. So that time is different, you could say.

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate telling me earlier on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand, that detailing his universal basic income proposal comes down to this. Give everyone over 18 years of age, no matter their financial position, $1,000, every single month, so $1,000 a year. It might cost upwards of $2 trillion a year to do it, but there will be a great return for the economy. Charlie Gasparino readily agrees with that. He joins me, as does Jessica Tarlov, and, last but not least, Jillian Melchior. Jessica, what do you think of what he's proposing? Others are -- have since had variations of that basic income."

There is something fundamentally going on, on the Democratic side that doesn't get picked up so much, because the mainstream media is very much in agreement with the Bernie Sanders.

The interesting thing about this lawsuit, I would argue it's very much premature, because we don't know even yet where the president is taking the other money from. We know that Congress has authorized moving money around during a national crisis. But we don't know what money the president's using.

That speaks to the overall health of the economy. If someone feels confident to sell their house and move on, it speaks to the economy, speaks to their job. It speaks to a lot of things. And what's interesting is, they're saying the new tax law could be behind this, because the advantages, the tax advantages, or what you get from your mortgage is not there anymore, because they have eliminated, especially in high-tax states like New York, Connecticut and so on. You're not getting the advantage from the mortgage that you used to get with those tax deductions. So that has hurt."

This is when he left a little bit earlier. But he's facing a world of hurt here for a story Chicago authorities are saying it's all made up. We will have more after this."

      "utterance": "All right, despite what must be the obvious temptation on the part of Roger Stone to say something or do a Richard Nixon raised arm thing, not a peep out of him, no physical gestures, just getting in an SUV and leaving a courthouse, where a judge has issued a gag order, saying, not another peep out of you on this case, but extending that to family members, friends, associates to stay similarly quiet. Joining me on the phone is former federal prosecutor Doug Burns. Doug, is this too much? I mean, stuff leaks out on court cases and investigations. He can't say a word about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I have been in a number of these situations over the last 30 years. What you call pretrial services alerts the court that something came up, and usually it plays out exactly the way it did today, which is basically, please explain yourself, why did you do this, what were you thinking? A good-old fashioned tongue-lashing. Don't do it again, or they're going to be much more severe consequences. But now to your question, which I'm not avoiding, Neil, yes, I mean, of course, you're going to get into certain sort of First Amendment and expression issues, but they really are overridden, seriously, by the conduct of an ongoing criminal case. So when a judge in a criminal case issues a gag order, to the extent it crashes or conflicts with the First Amendment, the gag order is going to win out, basically."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so the judge did so because he was joking about putting her in crosshairs and all of that, and she was just sort of obviously a little appalled by that. But I do wonder, when things get out, whether things are leaked or not, that there's any avenue for him state his side of the story, or did he just bury himself with this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURNS",
      "utterance": "No, it's an excellent point you made, because you kind of read my mind, Neil. What I wanted to say was, he went in, apparently, and he said, look, I wasn't the one who put together this visual and the way that crosshair appeared in the top left corner, and he sort of explained what happened and that somebody else had done it. So, to your point, absolutely. But the bad news for him was, the judge didn't like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, she didn't at all. Thank you very, very much, Doug. I apologize for the truncated version here. Roger Stone..."

      "speaker": "BURNS",
      "utterance": "Not at all. I appreciate it. Thank you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Not a peep out of him for the time being. We will see how long he sticks to that. Very, very quickly here, folks, we're not missing the fact that we were down 103 points today. Again, this week could be a dicey one to make it nine up weeks in a row. We're well shy of making an up week. Then again, it's still early. We will see what happens tomorrow.
