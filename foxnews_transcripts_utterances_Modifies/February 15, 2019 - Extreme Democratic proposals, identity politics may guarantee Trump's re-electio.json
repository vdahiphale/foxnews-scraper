Actor Jussie Smollett said he was the victim of a savage, racist homophobic attack. Now, his story seems to be, let us say, unraveling and the entire attack may turn out to be a stunt -- may turn out to be a stunt arranged by the actor himself. We will have all of that soon right from Chicago.  Plus, an appearance on this show by Tucker himself, don't ask me how we pulled that off. But first, President Trump has pulled the trigger declaring a national state of emergency on the southern border in order to fund and build the wall and other things. How did it happen and how will the emergency work? Washington correspondent Kristen Fisher is all around the madness and she is here to unwind it for us -- Kristen.",

Sixty percent of the southwest border does not have enough infrastructure, technology and the personnel. I call that wide open.

Now, his story seems to be, let us say, unraveling and the entire attack may turn out to be a stunt -- may turn out to be a stunt arranged by the actor himself. We will have all of that soon right from Chicago. Plus, an appearance on this show by Tucker himself, don't ask me how we pulled that off. But first, President Trump has pulled the trigger declaring a national state of emergency on the southern border in order to fund and build the wall and other things. How did it happen and how will the emergency work? Washington correspondent Kristen Fisher is all around the madness and she is here to unwind it for us -- Kristen."

Well, this emergency declaration is only a few hours old, but already the ACLU says that it will sue President Trump and the House Judiciary Committee has launched an investigation. Democrats on the committee sent a letter to President Trump tonight saying that, \"We believe your declaration of an emergency shows a reckless disregard for the separation of powers and your own responsibilities under our constitutional system by fabricating an emergency order to bypass the political process for allocating a budget, you appear to be abusing both this trust and your own oath of office.\" But President Trump predicted all of that when he announced the emergency declaration in the Rose Garden earlier today."

But some Republicans believe it's an abuse of executive power and could set a bad precedent.

It doesn't mean there is not one now and it doesn't mean they are not getting worse. I mean, the numbers this year show a huge uptick in apprehensions. That doesn't count the people we don't catch. So when people say to you, \"The drugs are coming through the port of entry, let's use some technology to crack down there. There is no problem with drugs in the middle of the country and other areas that are populated.\" What do you say?"

      "speaker": "MORGAN",

Sixty thousand are coming in a month illegally into this country. This year so far, 62 caravans of 100 or more -- 13 in all of last year. Two thousand in one single day this week. So the numbers are climbing, but it's manufactured, right? And the other thing, the other argument in between the ports of entry, it is an absolute false narrative. Sixty percent of the southwest border does not have enough infrastructure, technology and the personnel. I call that wide open. So they are disingenuous when they talk about the ports because we don't -- Brian, just what you said, we don't know what is getting through, but we know that it is getting through and there is a lot that we are not interdicting in between the ports."

And if Congress does not stand up to the President, I don't know why they are there. Are they there for the state run offices and the fancy pins? Their job is for their ambition to counteract the President's ambition and it is their job as members of Congress to determine where money is spent. And if you are in Congress and worried about being primaried on this issue, maybe you should step down from your leadership position and let somebody with courage to actually do the job of a member of Congress take the reins of that spot and do the job appropriately.

You would do anything you could to protect your family and your constituents.

He couldn't convince Congress that there was an emergency, so there must not be an emergency. Plus the border crossings are at 50-year low. So I don't understand what he is worried about.

So you will think that Elizabeth Warren is woke and she will make Kamala Harris even more woke, and in the end they, they will even succeed in woking Joe Biden, and they are all going to be made super hyper woke. Federal officials, policemen in effect have discussed using the 25th Amendment because they think that President Trump is mentally ill. And as Alan Dershowitz said, that is a judgment that should be made by doctors or secretaries or chiefs of staff -- anyone, in fact, by the police agency. And the question before the electorate is going to be who is really the sane or the insane one? The party that is proposing retrofitting every single 230-year-old colonial era farmhouse in northern New England in order to make it compatible with the Green New Deal, the party that is committed to abolishing the Border Enforcement Agency, or the guy who is just there in the White House doing his job even as he drives deep state lunatics to devise ever more absurd ways of trying to get rid of him?"

This time around, you are going to have candidates who are taking extreme leftist positions, and the risk, of course, is as with what happened to Ilhan Omar, which in crude identity politics terms, they check all the boxes. They do all the virtue signaling so they seem kind of nice, and then you read three or four of their tweets and you realize, \"Actually, this person isn't nice.\" And I think that is a real danger for the Democrats, whereas Trump by comparison plays a sort of fog and bully and he tweets up a storm, but he's actually not unlikable in the same way that some of these Democrats are revealing themselves."

The U.S. news media as you remember immediately seized the chance to brand a group of high school boys from a Catholic School in Kentucky -- Covington -- as villains. Bigots who are targeting people on the basis of skin color. Well, it soon emerged that not only wasn't true, it was the opposite of what happened. But it didn't matter. Journalists continued to use their power to browbeat and bully the high school kids. Here is one among many examples."

Larry Elder is a radio show host from Los Angeles. We're always happy to have him on the show. He joins us tonight. So, Larry, you have got to think not, just in case of these boys, but in the case of anyone who has been called names by the media collectively and then found to be not guilty of the charges, how does that person get his reputation back?"

What happened here is what I call the intersection of Trump derangement syndrome and what Tom Wolfe, the author who wrote the book, \"Bonfire of the Vanities\" calls the media's incessant search for the great white defendant. Nothing better for the media than a white man who is perceived as privileged that they can malign. And that is what happened with Mr. Nick Sandman. And later on, earlier this week, Tucker, it also happened to a friend of mine named Doug Adler who used to be an ESPN commentator. Two years ago he did a match involving Venus Williams, used a term, \"guerilla tactics,\" not G-O-R-I-L-L-A, but guerilla as in guerilla tactics and a \"New York Times\" tennis writer named Ben Rothenburg puts out a post and accuses Doug Adler of racism. ESPN demands that he apologize. Adler happened to be white, and he does to keep his job. They still fired him and for two years, he's been battling a defamation lawsuit. Finally, he won it, got his job back, but the tennis sports writer at \"New York Times\" has not lost his job nor has he apologized, nor did anybody in the tennis commentating field come to Doug Adler's rescue. Not the McEnroe brothers, not Martina Navratilova, none of these announcers said guerilla tactic is a normal term used to describe a tactic in a match, and he got fired, got maligned as a racist just like Nick Sandman got maligned as a racist before the facts came in. The intersection of Trump derangement syndrome and the incessant search for the great white defendant."

This young man in D.C. who was wearing a MAGA cap. He committed also the sin of being born white, and he was privileged, and so the media just ran with that, just as they ran with the story about Doug Adler. It is outrageous."

The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offered to wear a wire. A statement was released after that that that was never serious, it was sarcastic, et cetera.

Keep in mind also, Brian, this is the same guy whose wife ran for office as a Democrat, took substantial money from people connected to the Democrat and the Clinton machine and then refused to recuse himself from that case investigating Mrs. Clinton until the end of the year. But Brian, the most important takeaway from all of this, is of course Andy McCabe is trying to walk this back. This guy, he is not that bright. He just admitted in a \"60 Minutes\" interview according to Scott Pelley to taking part in a coup attempt. That is just the hard facts. There is no way he is going to weasel his way out of this."

Rosenstein came out and said, \"Yes, I said, I would overthrow the President, but I said it sarcastically, I'd wear a wire.\" I don't like either one of these comments, either side of this conversation."

Don't worry, I was just kidding.\" Like there are some things as the Deputy Director of the FBI, let me just give him like a pro-tip, right? It's probably not a good idea from a former Federal agent -- granted, I wasn't the Deputy Director of the Secret Service, but probably not a good idea to hit the 25th Amendment, in other words, removing a President from office for an obviously nonsensical reason, some physical incapacitation. This guy, Brian, make no mistake. He was operating -- this was the discussion of a soft coup. There is no way around this. He didn't -- I don't know if he is just not that bright and he said this to Scott Pelley not realizing what he was admitting to, but it's clear to me now that Rosenstein and him have a lot of culpability in this. Rosenstein with the FISA, McCabe admitting by the way on the record that the case wouldn't have existed without the dossier, and they are both essentially two guys who have culpability sitting in two separate rooms being interviewed by law enforcement who are trying to be the first to rat on each other to get the best deal."

A surprise development happened just as we were walking into the studio. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has settled his lawsuit with the National Football League. Kaerpernick sued the league last year claiming 32 teams colluded to keep him off the NFL roster because he was taking a knee during the National Anthem. Now, we don't know details about the settlement, but Kaepernick had previously signaled that only a lucrative payout will convince him to drop the suit. What does this mean? What does it mean for Kaepernick's future? He is 31 years old. You would have to think he could still play if he wants. Fox News contributor, she used to be at ESPN where she thrived there, Brit McHenry used with a rich sports background.

I reached out to an NFL source of mine, an NFL agent who said he will be shocked if that was the number. He expects it to be much lower than that. Of course, Kaepernick's attorney might be the one leaking this because they want to set a precedent for future cases. But it really makes me scratch my head because you have to factor in, it's not just Colin Kaepernick, it's Eric Reid who just signed, Brian --"

The man called to tell them he had entered abandon home to smoke marijuana and found what kind of wild jungle cat inside the house? Lauren Blanchard."

      "utterance": "Here we go. Jussie Smollett claims he was the victim of a savage hate crime by Trump supporters. The truth appears different perhaps as the police have now arrested two men for the attack, both of them from Nigeria, supposed to be brothers. One at least has appeared on Smollett's TV show \"Empire\" which appears on Fox. A lot of comments from three weeks ago now look kind of dumb. The NAACP blamed Trump. Kamala Harris called the attack a modern day lynching. \"GQ\" ran the headline, \"The racist homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far right America's end game.\" Buck Sexton is the host of \"The Buck Sexton Show.\" He is also a reporter with \"The Hill\" and has been all over this case, so Buck, we wielded you in here to give us the latest. We know that these two suspects have been questioned for two days."

      "utterance": "Yes, they've been questioned for two days. They also know Jussie Smollett, and were on -- at least, one of them was on his show as an extra. So the people that are supposedly or supposed to have been in the only surveillance footage that we have seen of the individuals of suspicion are people that he has a connection to. Which is now, now, people are starting to think, \"All right, is this a case of a hoax where he had help? Or is this perhaps a scuffle that happened that then he created a story in addition to whatever the facts were to make this about the Trump supporters?\" Because those don't look like the two individuals before -- racist, MAGA, Trump supporters -- that's not what people would think."

I don't want to send celebrity phone numbers to strange police officers.\" He claims they shouted \"Empire,\" that's the name of his show, a gay slur, a racist slur, and quote, \"This is MAGA country,\" and then punched him in the face."

      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "All right, so I haven't thought that this was credible from the start. That doesn't mean that I could prove it's false. I can't say he is a liar. I can just say this doesn't add up. The Jussie Smollett story has had issues of credibility, I would say, it has gone from improbable to implausible at this point, but that doesn't mean it is entirely impossible. What we have is a guy here who, first of all, when he talked with these quotes, \"MAGA country,\" he says they claim -- that they yelled out in Chicago. Who is going to yell it is MAGA country in Chicago? It is just a strange thing to say, it doesn't add up. And as you look at the fact pattern after the initial incident, nothing supports his version of events. Everything looks shadier and shadier, which people in the news business should be saying \"Hold on a second, maybe there should be some skepticism.\""

These two Nigerians, I didn't know that Trump supporters had a hotbed in Nigeria, but these two Nigerians coming over being Trump supporters seems like an odd mix."

Because a lot of the major media outlets, not all of them, but about 90% plus across the country see this and they say, \"Here is an opportunity to trash Trump supporters.\" The story fits in perfectly, so they run with it, right? Just as they ran against the Covington kids stories that were defamatory, disgraceful and untrue because they saw a chance to tell people what they want to tell them and not actually be journalists who should be skeptical and search for the facts."

Kauffman was hiking in the Colorado Mountains and says he was quote, \"pretty bummed out\" when he turned around to see a big cat pouncing on him. He was even more bummed out when the animal bit into his hand and put a claw right through his cheek as you see. No matter though, Kauffman got in a wrestling match with the mountain lion, bashed it a few times with a rock and was finally able to suffocate it. Colorado officials congratulated Kauffman, but members of PETA were not pleased. Get this, the group released a statement saying, quote, \"This is a tragic story all the way around and it had to have been terrifying for both the man and the mountain lion, ending in the death of the animal who called that land home.\" It's wasn't as uplifting as I thought.
