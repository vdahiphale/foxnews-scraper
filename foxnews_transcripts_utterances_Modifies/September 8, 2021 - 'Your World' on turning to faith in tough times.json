Let's get you up to date on the numbers we're talking about. Just over the past 24 hours, the president planning $14 billion in disaster aid, and a lot of that before Hurricane Ida, $10 billion in disaster aid for, well, damages after Hurricane Ida, $6.4 billion for Afghan refugees, by the way, all of that on top of the 3.5 trillion, some say closer to $4 trillion, maybe even $5 trillion, on that human infrastructure package that the president says we need, and especially now.  Feeling spent yet?  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And what to make of it administration that is hell-bent now on making sure money gets spent to address crises that are out of control? It is also a means by which to avoid discussing Afghanistan, if that can possibly be done, and put the issue on, well, domestic matters, where money seems to be the answer.  Let's go to Peter Doocy at the White House with more. Hey, Peter.",

That's $10 billion specifically for Ida, $14 billion for storms that happen before. The acting OMB director explains it like this: \"A short term C.R. is necessary not only to provide Congress additional time to pass full-year appropriations bills that make bold forward-looking investments in our future, but also to address the specific urgent needs facing our country right now.\" Looking ahead, the president hopes to address climate with every dollar of that $3.5 trillion reconciliation budget that he is pushing. And so he is so confident that he's still on top of climate change that he claims his Build Back Better agenda would mean a storm like Ida doesn't cause $1 in damage down the line.",

We're going to get into that a little bit right now with Phil Wegmann RealClearPolitics.

But rewinding a little bit, the thing about that Rahm Emanuel quote is that it assumes that you're dealing with just one crisis. Instead, the Biden administration is ending summer with a number of crises on their plate, whether it's COVID that has not gone away, whether it's the Americans who are stranded in Afghanistan currently, or whether it's not -- whether or not it's the border crisis, which doesn't get as much attention now, but is still ongoing.

And that's why, when Congress is in town, this is their priority. They're not going to default. Brian Deese, earlier in the White House Briefing Room, was asked whether or not the White House was looking at the possibility of prioritization if the debt ceiling is not extended, whether or not the administration was going to pick and choose what to fund and what not to fund.   His assumption there from the podium was that the ceiling was going to be lifted higher. But this is one of these things that requires government to actually act to do things.

The other thing is, is that there's an air of desperation here, you could tell, Neil, because they know, meaning the Democrats know that it's -- they're not going to be in power next year, that 20 -- the midterms are not going to be kind to them, and Biden basically blew it for them totally with his botched Afghanistan surrender.",

The new interim prime minister for the Taliban is Mullah Mohammad Akhund, who faces U.N. sanctions, was close to former Taliban leader Mullah Omar, who welcomed Usama bin Laden to Afghanistan. The new prime minister served in the last Taliban government before 9/11. The new defense minister is the son of Mullah Omar, the spiritual founder of the Taliban.  But perhaps the most sinister choice is the new interim interior minister, who will oversee the brutal Taliban police. Sirajuddin Haqqani has the blood of American troops on his hands, is currently holding an American hostage, has been financed by the Pakistan government for years and has up to $10 million bounty on his head from the FBI. Also in the new Cabinet, four Taliban senior leaders once detained at Guantanamo Bay. They were released by the Obama administration in 2014, when President Joe Biden was vice president, in a controversial prisoner swap in exchange for the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was kidnapped by the Taliban after deserting his post.

There are less than 500 children who have actually died from COVID. One out of every 5,000 adults is getting COVID. And if you look at the statistics even further, and you see that children have a natural immunity to this -- to COVID and to the variant that prevents them from dying, they have a higher chance of getting cancer and dying from cancer and dying from drowning. If we're talking about kids not getting sick, then why do we let them get the flu? Why do we send them to school and they get strep? And why do my kids come home or anyone's kids come home with lice? So maybe we should shut down schools and we should make our kids wear bags on their heads, and we should make sure that kids are always masked up because we shouldn't let them ever get anything else.

They have better physical health. People who go to church actually live longer. But beside all of that, we need to continue to point people to the eternal purposes that we believe and hold on to. You remember the Dutch evangelist Corrie ten Boom, who was just a wonderful person, who was in Ravensbruck concentration camp for rescuing Jews. She used to say, if you look at the world, you get depressed. If you look within -- if you look at world, you get distressed. If you look within, you get depressed. But if you look to God, you get to be a person at rest. And I think the healing of our world has to begin with connecting people back to a relationship with God. And you can't do that in silos. So we have been careful and protective. We have done a lot of protection around our campus and, when necessary, worn masks and had sanitation. But I have continued to tell our members, it's so important to come together. You can't live out your faith in a silo. And we know our word said in Genesis. It's not -- good for a man and woman not to be alone. People need to come together. And the way we do that often is in our worship and in our service and our commitment to living beyond ourselves.

And while all those things are important, they're not as important as getting ourselves connected to our heavenly father, and coming to be people at rest with him, so that we can be empowered to be loving and serving in the community around us. That -- the societal ills I think we're facing now are far more spiritual than they are -- frankly, than they are economic or political or over things like racism or inequality.

Just over the past 24 hours, the president planning $14 billion in disaster aid, and a lot of that before Hurricane Ida, $10 billion in disaster aid for, well, damages after Hurricane Ida, $6.4 billion for Afghan refugees, by the way, all of that on top of the 3.5 trillion, some say closer to $4 trillion, maybe even $5 trillion, on that human infrastructure package that the president says we need, and especially now. Feeling spent yet? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And what to make of it administration that is hell-bent now on making sure money gets spent to address crises that are out of control?

The acting OMB director explains it like this: \"A short term C.R. is necessary not only to provide Congress additional time to pass full-year appropriations bills that make bold forward-looking investments in our future, but also to address the specific urgent needs facing our country right now.\" Looking ahead, the president hopes to address climate with every dollar of that $3.5 trillion reconciliation budget that he is pushing.

And that is another convenient thing that this president is doing to sell the $3.5 trillion human infrastructure plan. We're going to get into that a little bit right now with Phil Wegmann RealClearPolitics.

But rewinding a little bit, the thing about that Rahm Emanuel quote is that it assumes that you're dealing with just one crisis. Instead, the Biden administration is ending summer with a number of crises on their plate, whether it's COVID that has not gone away, whether it's the Americans who are stranded in Afghanistan currently, or whether it's not -- whether or not it's the border crisis, which doesn't get as much attention now, but is still ongoing.

And that's why, when Congress is in town, this is their priority. They're not going to default. Brian Deese, earlier in the White House Briefing Room, was asked whether or not the White House was looking at the possibility of prioritization if the debt ceiling is not extended, whether or not the administration was going to pick and choose what to fund and what not to fund. His assumption there from the podium was that the ceiling was going to be lifted higher. But this is one of these things that requires government to actually act to do things. And what's interesting is, it's a question of just that metric, but so many other things get piled on top of it."

      "speaker": "WEGMANN",

One thing is clear. This administration, they don't mind spending big. The era of big government is back. Biden would like to build back better.

Another interesting thing here is, there seems to be a Tea Party of one with Joe Manchin on the left, who is -- seems to be the only one who's arguing that $3.5 trillion is too high. Meanwhile, Democrats -- Republicans, they don't have a lot of credibility on this because they were spending like there was no tomorrow under the previous administration."

Charlie, they're already talking about not necessarily bringing the spending figure down, but bringing the tax figures up to pay for it, or maybe half of it. I don't even know.

And so you got to change the subject, to change it to the need for all this spending and how to pay for it and soak the rich and things that maybe appeal to the Democratic Party base. The other thing is, is that there's an air of desperation here, you could tell, Neil, because they know, meaning the Democrats know that it's -- they're not going to be in power next year, that 20 -- the midterms are not going to be kind to them, and Biden basically blew it for them totally with his botched Afghanistan surrender."

And they see this bill as a way to transform the American economy transformed the culture. And what they're at essentially here is to essentially change the construct between government and people, between work and people. The general construct has always been, the more you work, the harder you work, hopefully, you paid for -- you get paid more, you advance in the world. What they are changing the construct to be is, like, listen, the government is there for you every step of the way, and we're going to take care of you cradle to grave.

This was -- this was a Saturday. It was the last innocent weekend, if you will, before everything, everything changed. The jobless rate in this country was about 4.9 percent. Venus Williams had just won her second U.S. Open title. Jennifer Lopez had the number one song in the country, \"I'm Real.\" And Nokia had come out with a phone that was getting so popular, they couldn't keep it on store shelves. It was the 3310 and was long before we had smartphones. It was six years before we had something called the iPhone. And it was a different time entirely. But, again, in just a few days later, we wouldn't be talking about phones or Jennifer Lopez, would we? We'd be talking about something that changed the very fabric of capitalism and this country, when markets shut down, more than 2,000 were killed, and a lot of people began to wonder whether we would ever come back. We did."

You might recall that trading had stopped across the world and certainly in our country for upwards of a week. When the markets reopened, they immediately tanked. But, by then, they had clawed back most of those losses, as we announced our campaign to go into Afghanistan to take out the Taliban. Optimism ran high then, 20 years later, an about-face and reversal of fortunes that has still prompted more drama each and every passing day, with folks still trying to get out.

The new prime minister served in the last Taliban government before 9/11. The new defense minister is the son of Mullah Omar, the spiritual founder of the Taliban. But perhaps the most sinister choice is the new interim interior minister, who will oversee the brutal Taliban police. Sirajuddin Haqqani has the blood of American troops on his hands, is currently holding an American hostage, has been financed by the Pakistan government for years and has up to $10 million bounty on his head from the FBI. Also in the new Cabinet, four Taliban senior leaders once detained at Guantanamo Bay. They were released by the Obama administration in 2014, when President Joe Biden was vice president, in a controversial prisoner swap in exchange for the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was kidnapped by the Taliban after deserting his post.

And what we have is, we have an administration, to include the State Department, and is probably the worst violator here, that is just digging this hole deeper and deeper and deeper. When I came into the counterterror business in 1978, that was the creation of the Delta Force. We had a longstanding policy in the U.S. government that we did not negotiate with terrorists. Now, what we're doing today is violating everything that we have said for several decades now about how we deal with terrorist organizations. I realize they have dug such a hole that we're at a point where, what are our choices? What can we do now? And let me tell you what we can do. We can throw in with these private groups that have some very bold, but, more importantly, committed people that want to go out there and bring home their fellow Americans, as well as their buddies that served with them in Afghanistan, the Afghans that stood with us. And it is time for the State Department to get off the dime and create a partnership with these people, and not be totally dependent upon what they're doing now, which is negotiating with the Taliban."

But him and several other members were on the floor above the fire, where all of a sudden the floor gave way. And they plummeted into a pool of fire, where two members will loss and my father ended up burning 38 percent of his body. His ankles were burned to the bone. And he was hospitalized in the Cornell Burn Center for many months after that. By sheer luck, he was able to make a full recovery. And in the spring of 2001, he went back full duty."

But it wasn't until later on that night that our family started to gather around the house and coming in from all over.

It was all the days before that, all the stories he gave us, and the love and passion he had for it. It was too contagious to not want to be a part of that.

We need to vaccine those who are able. We need you do wear masks on those who can't get vaccines. And we need to be sure that we're having the safety of these kids be just as important as education of these kids. My kid is 4. She's spent half her life now basically wearing a mask. There's nothing that I love more than coming on your show, Neil, but my most important job is as a mother. I took it very seriously considering whether to send her back to school. And this school's approach of masks and vaccines and testing is a three- pronged approach that I think is best for our country and to ensure that our kids are getting as back to normal as possible.

I'm not sure -- when we were talking about this, when we were talking about vaccines, the promise was getting back to normal. Now we once again have to wear masks inside. When does this ever end? And for little kids, I just want to point out, in 2020, it was listen to the science. In 2021, it is science means nothing. Statistics mean nothing. There are less than 500 children who have actually died from COVID. One out of every 5,000 adults is getting COVID. And if you look at the statistics even further, and you see that children have a natural immunity to this -- to COVID and to the variant that prevents them from dying, they have a higher chance of getting cancer and dying from cancer and dying from drowning. If we're talking about kids not getting sick, then why do we let them get the flu? Why do we send them to school and they get strep? And why do my kids come home or anyone's kids come home with lice? So maybe we should shut down schools and we should make our kids wear bags on their heads, and we should make sure that kids are always masked up because we shouldn't let them ever get anything else. So I think we have to really look at the science and figure out, what are we doing to our children?"

They have better physical health. People who go to church actually live longer. But beside all of that, we need to continue to point people to the eternal purposes that we believe and hold on to. You remember the Dutch evangelist Corrie ten Boom, who was just a wonderful person, who was in Ravensbruck concentration camp for rescuing Jews. She used to say, if you look at the world, you get depressed. If you look within -- if you look at world, you get distressed. If you look within, you get depressed. But if you look to God, you get to be a person at rest. And I think the healing of our world has to begin with connecting people back to a relationship with God. And you can't do that in silos. So we have been careful and protective. We have done a lot of protection around our campus and, when necessary, worn masks and had sanitation. But I have continued to tell our members, it's so important to come together. You can't live out your faith in a silo. And we know our word said in Genesis. It's not -- good for a man and woman not to be alone. People need to come together. And the way we do that often is in our worship and in our service and our commitment to living beyond ourselves. And so, yes, as you just said, we have actually experienced growth."

And, Neil, interestingly enough, we didn't reach out with livestreaming, the world you live in all the time. But we're doing that now."

      "utterance": "A lot of people won't remember that name anymore. But I remember many years ago hearing him say there will be no peace on Earth until each person one by one makes their peace with God. And we have spent a lot of time in the last few years thinking the solution to our societal ills is in politics or in who we elect or in a movement or in a social engagement. And while all those things are important, they're not as important as getting ourselves connected to our heavenly father, and coming to be people at rest with him, so that we can be empowered to be loving and serving in the community around us. That -- the societal ills I think we're facing now are far more spiritual than they are -- frankly, than they are economic or political or over things like racism or inequality. Those things need to be addressed, but I think that they're really addressed primarily through getting people in community with one another and connected to the one who created them."

      "utterance": "Pastor, I mean, you're a modest man, but I think the secret to your success has been that you listen, and you don't scold people. You don't talk about them being sinners. You talk about them as being genuine human beings who the lord loves, regardless of your faith, denomination. You get that. And you're mesmerizing. So, I have no -- no shock here in what you're seeing as a result of that. Many, many and much more success in the future, Reverend. Thank you.
