Senator, is this OK with you?  SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R—WYOMING: Absolutely, Neil. I think it's an important thing to do.  We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place. So we want to be able to get more people confirmed.  But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear. He's not going to sign another continuing resolution. We need to do individual appropriations bills. We have work to be done on behalf of the American people. And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me. I'm a surgeon. I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours. I think it's where we ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.",
