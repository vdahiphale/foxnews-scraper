President Trump doubling down on his calls to identify the whistleblower as subpoenas have been issued for Rudy Giuliani and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state calling subpoenas and attempt to, quote, bully and intimidate state department officials.

The Biden approach though on all of this has been very -- it's curious to me. I don't know -- beyond seeing the picture, I don't know. He says he didn't talk to his son about it.

And it's just this beautiful cycle of life where everybody's income slowly rises, and our standard of living goes up every single generation. Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders want to destroy that great American experiment. I don't want to do that. I want to give it fuel and you know how do you give that fuel? You'll let people keep more of their money and that's what Trump did. But he gave the Democrats a little bit too much of an opening, because the tax cuts weren't big enough. If you're an average family, four people, $75,000 a year, you only got an extra $2000 your own money back. That should have been an extra $10,000 of your own money back, because that's real money, because the government doesn't know how to spend it better than you do.",

I just don't think that two are quite comparable, especially because one of the things Clinton had going for him was that the media was -- you know, basically, not trying to harm him. But the president is realizing like his allies are in the Republican Party and that his approach has always been to push and push and push. The Biden approach though on all of this has been very -- it's curious to me. I don't know -- beyond seeing the picture, I don't know. He says he didn't talk to his son about it. We haven't seen that. We haven't heard from them, but they are going to have to testify at some point."

Yeah, well, we were basically all on the call too, because the transcript is in front of us and we know exactly what he said and there's no quid pro quo there. I think Joe Biden is in trouble. I think he's in serious trouble. This is a guy who was doing a very bad job on the debate stage. He was underperforming to say the least. Many people were getting nervous. You saw Elizabeth Warren rising in the polls. And now, even though they attempted to make this about Trump, Joe Biden and his dealings with his son and what he did with respect to that prosecutor that he wants to get fired, and that tape that showed up with him saying we're withholding money, that all implicates him in this. And this is -- it's not going to be long before many of those donors who had Biden's back saying he was most electable are going to pull back and say, you know what, this guy has too much baggage, he's implicated in this, this does not look good for him, and even if you can't stand President Trump, you have to be able to look at a call and say I don't see any impeachable offense here.

Those numbers have shifted dramatically, which is the media reporting that it's shifting dramatically. So who's been pushing those buttons and pulling those strings? The same media reporting this. The story hasn't changed at all. So it's not about reporting, it's about repetition. The story is so small, but what's even smaller is the people that are generating it. I have a theory that a thousand people are generating this story, right? It's -- if that -- it might be -- 500 people are dictating the -- what 333 -- 350 million people are listening to right now. This is a splash fight in the tiniest kiddie pool of influencers. And it's a self-perpetuating media machine that must generate louder and louder noise as we realize how little -- there is -- there is no there, there. And I'll even go that way with Biden. Also, there's no there, there, period. But this story itself is so small and the people that are generating this sound is so small. I mean we're being sold a bill of goods. Remember the good old days when scandals were scandalous? I mean, Watergate, Iran Contra, Monica-gate, this is scandal impersonation. I'm insulted that I'm wasting my time listening to this crap.

You can make $20,000 a year, suddenly you're making 200,000, and you could be in the top 5 percent and then fall out of that -- that's how it works. That's what inequality -- the inequality equation is faulty and wrong. I would be for a Democrat, though. I would vote for a Democrat that would say let's make then take. Right now we've got Democrats that just say let's take. They have no idea -- they think that, like, the money for a safety net is like the tooth fairy money. It just shows up underneath your pillow. No, actually, you've got to work for it. You've got to create an economy for a safety net. So you've got to make before you take. Right now, Warren and Bernie, all that's on their head is take, take, take."

You will always have rich people, you always have poor people, and you'll always have people in between. That's how it's always been. That's how it always will be. But I think you can agree that it is the best place in the world, America to be rich, middle class or poor. I think we can establish that. OK. And here's why. Because we have this free market, a system that is so beautiful that everybody that if they show a little gumption, some ingenuity, they can create wealth and goods and services for other people. And it's just this beautiful cycle of life where everybody's income slowly rises, and our standard of living goes up every single generation. Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders want to destroy that great American experiment. I don't want to do that. I want to give it fuel and you know how do you give that fuel? You'll let people keep more of their money and that's what Trump did. But he gave the Democrats a little bit too much of an opening, because the tax cuts weren't big enough. If you're an average family, four people, $75,000 a year, you only got an extra $2000 your own money back. That should have been an extra $10,000 of your own money back, because that's real money, because the government doesn't know how to spend it better than you do."

Plus, I do think it's worth pointing out, unemployment at its lowest across the board, participation higher than it's been. And the medium household income is at now at a record that doesn't - and that means that as you have economic growth, you do have an increase in inequality because people are gaining more but that doesn't mean people aren't coming up from the bottom. To JPMorgan's point though and everybody down here on Wall Street and out in Silicon Valley, we're going to play some sound here. Corporate America realizes that it is about to be under attack.

Basically, the bottom level was just the breadbasket, right. You just pile the carbs in and that went up, it was like - it was all protein at the top. In fact, at the top and now we realize that is B.S. because what did we see concurrently with the nutrition pyramid increases in obesity, increases in diabetes and explosion of obesity related diseases and especially among children.
