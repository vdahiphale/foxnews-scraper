      "sentences": "I am Laura Ingraham and this is the \"The Ingraham Angle\" on an extraordinary news night this Friday night. A shocking report from the New York Times about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein working to drive the president from office. And breaking news at this hour, Christine Ford, the Kavanaugh accuser, has missed yet another deadline set by the judiciary committee. Ford's attorneys were to respond to the committee tonight by 10:00 p.m. to confirm her appearance before them. Instead, she and her attorneys are asking for more time. We are going to get into all the details.  And the Hollywood crowd steps into the Kavanaugh confirmation because that's what they're really good at. Also, a new Halloween costume controversy. Don't you love this, identity politics gone totally crazy. It is all on \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo.  But first, our top story, an absolute jaw dropper late this afternoon, a report from the New York Times. It lays out that in the spring of 2017, Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein suggested secretly recording President Trump and discussed invoking the 25th amendment to throw the president out of office.  Now, Rosenstein, as you would expect, is forcefully denying that this ever happened. Separately, a Fox News source, said to be in the same room as this conversation, is claiming that Rosenstein's comments were just sarcastic. They weren't serious. Does anyone believe that tonight? Washington Post is also reporting that, but let's take a trip, shall we, down Rosenstein memory lane. Now, this is the same guy who responded like this to demands from Congress to produce documents in that Russia probe.",

And he was so afraid that declassification was going to expose him for what he is, which is part of the deep state. This collusion never existed. It has been a fake dossier from the beginning. And look, we have done extensive research on this now. We have seen what Rod Rosenstein is really about.  Whether it's Rod Rosenstein. He covered up for Peter Strzok, for Lisa Page, for Andy McCabe, for Jim Comey.

I think he has the power and perhaps should go ahead and put together an investigative mechanism perhaps relying in part on the White House counsel's office so that they can get access, redacted, blacked out in certain places or not, to whatever these McCabe memos are. And at some point, to bring Rod Rosenstein into the office, look him in the eye.

So, he both wrote it -- I guess that's the suggestion of the president or the (inaudible) of the -- then he was mad the president relied on it. And that just torqued him off to know him. This is the New York Times reporting. I want all three of you to listen to this. \"Rosenstein raised the idea of wearing a recording device or wire, as he put it, to secretly tape the president when he visited the White House. One participant asked whether Rosenstein was serious, and he replied animatedly that he was.\" Now, it goes on to say, \"It is not clear how determined he was about seeing them through though he did tell McCabe that he might be able to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John Kelly about the 25th amendment, then the Secretary of Homeland Security and now the White House chief of staff to mount an effort to invoke the 25th.\"  And third point, \"According to others who described his comment, Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea but also followed up by suggesting that other FBI official who were interviewing to be the bureau's director could also secretly record Trump.\" This was around the time of course where after he fired Comey, he was looking at Wray, Rosenstein's name had been raised for this and a few others including a former Obama person. But he wanted, according to this report, there is no humor in this.  When he says it's humor, it's ridiculous -- I'm sorry. Just a woman's intuition, but it's ridiculous. No humor in this. Now Lee, I want to play this for you because the Democrats tonight are saying this is just the pretext Trump needs to fire Rosenstein. This is what Leon Panetta said tonight.",

I think that's the most important thing that has to happen, is the stories have to be gotten under oath, under pain of perjury from both Judge Kavanaugh and from Dr. Ford. The timing is actually important. The sooner, the better because as time goes on, people could adjust their stories and change them in response to what they are hearing in the public.

I think the president was right, let her speak, but to say that the Senate wasn't accommodating, they could have interviewed her at home in California. They said they would. Grassley said he would do it behind closed doors, in public, would be questioned by an outside counsel, which I thought, because it is all these white men up there. It would have been better to have an outside counsel, especially a woman, ask the question. Now, they don't want that. So, it seems like they have been quite accommodating except on, well, we are not going to do it whenever you want to do it, because you don't get to dictate terms. John, I want you to listen, and all of you to part of the letter that was released, again, just about an hour ago from the Kavanaugh accuser's attorney. \"The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the dates and conditions of any hearings has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford.

There is no forensic evidence anymore. The only thing that is left is the witness's testimony. The senators have to put them under oath, and while being respectful.

I don't think that anyone should be treated with kid gloves or treated differently. We ask this of people in cases every day in courtrooms around the country in these kinds of cases.

Karen Monahan is Ellison's ex-girlfriend and she published the document on social media. It appears to be from a Minnesota clinic back in November of 2017. And in it she claims that a doctor wrote that she, quote, was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated. She identifies the individual she was involved with as Congressman Ellison, and she is worried about retribution if she identifies him publicly. Monahan published the document just days after claiming that the Democratic Party, quote, smeared, threatened, and isolated her over these allegations against the congressman, who also happens to be the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The DNC has said that it's reviewing the accusations. Ellison has categorically denied all of it.

A shocking report from the New York Times about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein working to drive the president from office. And breaking news at this hour, Christine Ford, the Kavanaugh accuser, has missed yet another deadline set by the judiciary committee. Ford's attorneys were to respond to the committee tonight by 10:00 p.m. to confirm her appearance before them. Instead, she and her attorneys are asking for more time. We are going to get into all the details. And the Hollywood crowd steps into the Kavanaugh confirmation because that's what they're really good at. Also, a new Halloween costume controversy. Don't you love this, identity politics gone totally crazy. It is all on \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo. But first, our top story, an absolute jaw dropper late this afternoon, a report from the New York Times. It lays out that in the spring of 2017, Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein suggested secretly recording President Trump and discussed invoking the 25th amendment to throw the president out of office. Now, Rosenstein, as you would expect, is forcefully denying that this ever happened. Separately, a Fox News source, said to be in the same room as this conversation, is claiming that Rosenstein's comments were just sarcastic. They weren't serious. Does anyone believe that tonight? Washington Post is also reporting that, but let's take a trip, shall we, down Rosenstein memory lane. Now, this is the same guy who responded like this to demands from Congress to produce documents in that Russia probe."

The story drops a couple of hours after Trump tweets that the documents are going to the I.G. and you can imagine Rosenstein's horror. McCabe has blown this beautiful plan I had to get us both in the clear. I think that's what happened. Rosenstein's effort to cover, again, \"The Post\" story appears sourced to him.

There is no tee-hee giggle giggle in any of that. Corey? I think he is right. I think Lee is right. This is all about the declassification. Trump backtracked for some reason and I think that was a big gift to Rosenstein because he is worried about that FISA application and the fact that exculpatory information was not put in that FISA application to monitor Carter Page, Corey."

The first application was denied by the FISA court. Rod Rosenstein signed this and when the president made the announcement that he was going to declassify Bruce Ohr's 302, that was going to reveal that Nellie Ohr, Bruce's wife, was talking to Christopher Steel, that the Justice Department knew about this and that I'm sure Rod Rosenstein at the Justice Department was aware of what Bruce Ohr was doing because he was his supervisor at some level, that all would have come out very clearly. And he was so afraid that declassification was going to expose him for what he is, which is part of the deep state. This collusion never existed. It has been a fake dossier from the beginning. And look, we have done extensive research on this now. We have seen what Rod Rosenstein is really about. Whether it's Rod Rosenstein. He covered up for Peter Strzok, for Lisa Page, for Andy McCabe, for Jim Comey. He is also the individual, and you remember this, who recommended Bob Mueller become the head of the FBI when Jim Comey was fired.

I think he has the power and perhaps should go ahead and put together an investigative mechanism perhaps relying in part on the White House counsel's office so that they can get access, redacted, blacked out in certain places or not, to whatever these McCabe memos are. And at some point, to bring Rod Rosenstein into the office, look him in the eye. This president has famously done with a lot of hired and fired people, look in the eye and see if he can get adequate explanation for this because if it is true, if the way it is being presented in \"The New York Times\" is true, it is something very, very troubling that can't be continuing."

But apparently, the gist of it is Rosenstein was really ticked off that even though he wrote that letter or memo justifying the firing of Comey, giving a justification with the firing of Comey, he was mad that then the president relied on it when he was asked about it. So, he both wrote it -- I guess that's the suggestion of the president or the (inaudible) of the -- then he was mad the president relied on it. And that just torqued him off to know him. This is the New York Times reporting. I want all three of you to listen to this. \"Rosenstein raised the idea of wearing a recording device or wire, as he put it, to secretly tape the president when he visited the White House. One participant asked whether Rosenstein was serious, and he replied animatedly that he was.\" Now, it goes on to say, \"It is not clear how determined he was about seeing them through though he did tell McCabe that he might be able to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John Kelly about the 25th amendment, then the Secretary of Homeland Security and now the White House chief of staff to mount an effort to invoke the 25th.\" And third point, \"According to others who described his comment, Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea but also followed up by suggesting that other FBI official who were interviewing to be the bureau's director could also secretly record Trump.\" This was around the time of course where after he fired Comey, he was looking at Wray, Rosenstein's name had been raised for this and a few others including a former Obama person. But he wanted, according to this report, there is no humor in this. When he says it's humor, it's ridiculous -- I'm sorry. Just a woman's intuition, but it's ridiculous. No humor in this. Now Lee, I want to play this for you because the Democrats tonight are saying this is just the pretext Trump needs to fire Rosenstein. This is what Leon Panetta said tonight."

I hope that the president sees that before he makes decisions. And I'll say that I think the important thing, the really vital thing is declassifying these documents so that we can all understand what the bad guys at the DOJ and the FBI were doing as these two articles give some sort of indication there is more in those documents we can be sure of.

He can reverse his decision at any moment because right now, it seems to me that the Bruce Ohr 302, those are the interview memos that he wrote, the FISA applications and other text messages are critical to be released unredacted except for any sources of the messages which there apparently aren't any.

I think it's pages 10 through 12 and then 14 others pages there. So it wasn't the entire application. So that's perfectly fine. But you also have to remember, Andrew McCabe has been referred by the I.G. for criminal referral. That referral is (inaudible) Department of Justice. My guess is Rod Rosenstein is the one who is deciding whether or not Andrew McCabe is going to be prosecuted for lying under oath to the FBI on three separate occasions, particularly when he was the acting director of the FBI after Jim Comey was fired. So look, these guys ran this tight little (inaudible) that they never thought anyone was ever going to get caught between Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, you know, Rod Rosenstein, these guys did things. And then you throw in Clapper and Brennan.

Joining us now with reaction is John Yoo, former general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee and former U.S. attorney David Katz is with us along with former federal prosecutor, John Lauro.

I mean, she has been dealing with lawyers for weeks, if not months now. It is time for her to face the music. She has made a very serious accusation. Now, the moment of truth comes. She has to face questioning. She has to be asked the tough questions and she can't escape it. If she refuses to testify, then the bottom line is that he is going to be confirmed and this thing is over. But there is a legal expression for what her lawyer is doing, and that's jerking around. You know, every time they reach a point where there is an agreement, all of the sudden, you know, as you say, the goalpost move and that's just inappropriate."

And even though she doesn't remember key details, that's OK. If this has to go on another two or three weeks, so be it. But it is interesting to note how this is proceeding as a legal matter at the same time because even though it's not a legal setting in a courtroom, one would think that making a demand that you have to speak after Brett Kavanaugh is a little rich, don't you think, at this point, since she is the one making the accusation?"

      "speaker": "DAVID KATZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it is not a court of law but it certainly makes sense that the accusation has to come first and that the person being accused gets to hear exactly what the accusation is and then respond to it. Some of her other demand I do think makes some sense but, you know, not having all the cameras, not having all of these things, but you know, high officials are used to, but she is not used to that. And she is just going to tell her side of the story. And I kind of agree with, I guess it's Kellyanne Conway who said that, you know, she should be accommodated and giving her one more day is accommodating her. She shouldn't be attacked. And I think Republicans would have a (inaudible) victory wouldn't they. If they ended up losing the House and Senate because they mistreated her instead of giving her one more day and hearing everyone side of the story. Of course, I think they should also hear Mark Judge's side of the story because, you know, when you are a prosecutor, as I was, you always say, you know, there is one more witness they could have called. Why didn't they call him? The defense has the power of subpoena, let them call Mark Judge if Mark Judge is so important. But you know here, the Democrats don't have the power to call Mark Judge. The Democrats don't have the power to call him."

They could have gotten, actually, quite a bit gone in the last 72, 96 hours or so. But instead, what the Democrats are doing is going on TV talking about how Kavanaugh is a sexual predator.

This is the Senate performing its constitutional job to give advice and consent. It is a political process and a legal process, but it is not a criminal trial. The Senate doesn't need the FBI to conduct a criminal investigation. As you say, Laura, each side has committee staff. They can go out and interview people. They can interview them under oath. I think that's the most important thing that has to happen, is the stories have to be gotten under oath, under pain of perjury from both Judge Kavanaugh and from Dr. Ford. The timing is actually important. The sooner, the better because as time goes on, people could adjust their stories and change them in response to what they are hearing in the public. I'm worried about that. I think actually the committee is right to try to freeze the stories in place as soon as possible so that people can't start changing their stories. That would be worse than moving the goalpost. Already, we have lost that."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right. Well the Republicans did get both Judge and Patrick Smythe, they did interview them and they did sign declarations, which were signed under penalty of felony, correct? So that was done. Democrats could have taken part in the questioning. They decided not to. And going back to what David Katz said, you got to be more accommodating to the accuser. I think the president was right, let her speak, but to say that the Senate wasn't accommodating, they could have interviewed her at home in California. They said they would. Grassley said he would do it behind closed doors, in public, would be questioned by an outside counsel, which I thought, because it is all these white men up there. It would have been better to have an outside counsel, especially a woman, ask the question. Now, they don't want that. So, it seems like they have been quite accommodating except on, well, we are not going to do it whenever you want to do it, because you don't get to dictate terms. John, I want you to listen, and all of you to part of the letter that was released, again, just about an hour ago from the Kavanaugh accuser's attorney. \"The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the dates and conditions of any hearings has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford. Your cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor who has been doing her best to cooperate with the committee is completely inappropriate.\" John Lauro, cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor seems more to me like a political statement than it does to be from a lawyer who wants to actually make some headway on these negotiations."

That would be counterintuitive to what the Republican majority wants to do. So the reality is they have bent over backwards to have her come in under appropriate circumstances. Let's remember one thing. An accuser does not get to call the shots. This is a process with deadlines. She has decided to come forward and now she has to testify truthfully and honestly and face the music."

My point is that the Republicans and the committee should not be seen as not giving her a fair shot, as not hearing her story, as not understanding that this is a very unreported crime as Senator Collins has pointed out. And President Trump should treat her with respect at all times, including in his tweets. And the Republicans for their own sake, should treat her with respect. And all the women in this situation, a aman in this situation. They don't come forward all the time. Sometimes it is a long time before they make these allegations. Everybody can understand that.

What's going on here I think is that the Senate has been manipulated, that these charges were held back until the very last minute, even after the hearings were over. And so what the Senate has to do is to make sure it does its constitutional job. This is not about a form for airing grievances. The Senate has to find out the truth. There is no forensic evidence anymore. The only thing that is left is the witness's testimony. The senators have to put them under oath, and while being respectful. We have found in our legal system the best way to get the truth is to subject both witnesses to questioning and cross- examination. I don't think that anyone should be treated with kid gloves or treated differently. We ask this of people in cases every day in courtrooms around the country in these kinds of cases. I don't think we should expect any less, and give respect to Kavanaugh and to Dr. Ford, but show them respect by expecting them to tell the truth under oath and be subject and willing to answer questions of cross-examination."

African-American unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, women-owned businesses, confidence in the future of this country, right truck, wrong track, is that right, I think a 12-year turn-around. I believe that's right. If not, I'll correct it. I think that's right. But anyway, the right track, wrong track is much better than it was just a few years back. So all of that is really positive for the country. I get Democrats want more equality. But isn't the way to get more equality to have more economic opportunity? That's a big part of it, is it not?"

The latest bit to drop is that the woman accusing Congressman Keith Ellison of domestic abuse has released what appears to be a medical document from 2017 detailing the alleged abuse caused, allegedly, by the congressman. Karen Monahan is Ellison's ex-girlfriend and she published the document on social media. It appears to be from a Minnesota clinic back in November of 2017. And in it she claims that a doctor wrote that she, quote, was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated. She identifies the individual she was involved with as Congressman Ellison, and she is worried about retribution if she identifies him publicly. Monahan published the document just days after claiming that the Democratic Party, quote, smeared, threatened, and isolated her over these allegations against the congressman, who also happens to be the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The DNC has said that it's reviewing the accusations. Ellison has categorically denied all of it. And Laura, don't forget, after the allegations came out, he still went on to win the Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general. Laura?"
