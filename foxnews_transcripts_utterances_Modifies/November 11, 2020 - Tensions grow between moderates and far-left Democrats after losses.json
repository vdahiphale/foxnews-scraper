So racially the breakdown is basically the Democrats have pretty much all the Blacks - about two-thirds of the Hispanics and a little less than 50 percent of the whites. But they're struggling geographically and it's because of ideology. They can't compete outside the coasts and the cities because of Socialism. They have to run really moderate candidates to compete in red areas, and sometimes they win, but then in a cycle or two they're out, and that causes a lot of recriminations and finger pointing, which you're seeing right now. And it's also this - this is important, they have alienated the Democrats through this ideology and identity politics, the most important voting block in the country which is the middleclass, people making between $50,000 and $100,000 a year without a college degree. The last two elections Hillary and Joe Biden have lost the middleclass. Biden did better this time because he did better with the rich, but what you're seeing is the economic populism is making (inaudible) not just in this group, but with Blacks and Hispanics too. Trump won an additional 5 percent of Black Democrats, and an additional 7 percent of Hispanic Democrats. And at this point, if you're a Democratic party official, you'd ought to spank these Socialists back to the coasts. Because of this ideology you're losing geographically, you're losing in income levels, and you're losing a very critical racial demographic. So what usually happens now, the last two incoming Democratic administrations - first two years they lurch far left, and then a red wave happens. Happened in '94 with Bill, it happened in 2010 with Barack - so my prediction, if the Democratic party leadership doesn't send these Socialists packing, Biden lurches left and you're going to see another red wave.",

And it was interesting to watch this week when Joe Biden was giving a speech about healthcare and I remember him talking -- he was talking about Obamacare and how he's going to revise Obamacare, they're going to improve on it with the backdrop of this socialist Medicare for All. Well, in 2010, if you'll remember; President Obama said they get shellacking as a result of that. They lost more power in the House, Democrats did since Eisenhower. And also to Jesse's point about competing on -- just on the coast. Republicans are competing on the coast now. You had Michelle Steel flip a Democratic seat in California. That's only happened twice in the past two decades. And I think that the Democratic Party is starting to realize that people in these deep blue districts have the benefit and the luxury of being able to be very, very far left because they are always going to get re-elected.

It's an incredible night. Juan, I can see why you're happy that Joe Biden is president but Donald Trump remade the Republican Party and the Republicans had a monster night. And it was really to do, believe it or not Donald Trump everyone except himself because he changed into a working class party. He changed it into a multi-ethnic party. He changed it into a party that's going to go to bat for every single group without pandering. He didn't say my goodness; let's not talk about immigration because that'll tick off Hispanics. No, these are my policies. The Cubans, I don't think we should have relations with them. He didn't do that to get the Cuban vote. Venezuela, why are there (ph) communist in South America. He didn't do that to get the Venezuelan exiles. And when it came to cracking down immigration, just cared about Americans. They knew he wasn't anti-Hispanic. That's when we got the grand -- that's why he got the Rio Grande valley and that's why other people are listening to him and he got 13 percent of the African American vote, which is pathetic in the big picture but it's almost double what Mitt Romney got. And Mitt Romney didn't make any of the direct statements that let's say President Trump has made. And lastly, I can't believe that guys like Jim Clyburn, guys like Joe Manchin didn't have the guts to say defund the police is a problem. Didn't have the guts to say that burning down cities because you're angry about racial unrest is a good way to handle things. And the New Green Deal is not practical and will destroy the country. And we should be prideful of the fact that we have our energy autonomy. Why did they wait till after the election to say how bad this was. Why didn't they say it before?",

The other thing is I think democrat -- a lot of Georgians are very prideful of the fact that they're pro-republican and they like their old identity, which they lost if the recount goes the same way. The other thing I heard is Jon Ossoff, in terms of negative campaigning, he's a trust fund socialist and Warnock happens to love Cuba and Jeremiah Wright, so those two things aren't positive. On the other side, Purdue and Kelly Loeffler, who Doug Collins says I back her now, so that gives him his 24 percent, so I think they're both favorites. But I will look at this, the second amendment. Both are very pro-second amendment. Georgia is a very pro-second amendment state, and that's where the rubber hits the roads with these four candidates. And Purdue and Loeffler together are combining forces, almost like a ticket. I think that can be pretty strong. The fact that Rubio showed up in 48 hours I think is important.

      "utterance": "-- I actually know more about the Democratic party than Juan does now, after my research - and here is what I found. So racially the breakdown is basically the Democrats have pretty much all the Blacks - about two-thirds of the Hispanics and a little less than 50 percent of the whites. But they're struggling geographically and it's because of ideology. They can't compete outside the coasts and the cities because of Socialism. They have to run really moderate candidates to compete in red areas, and sometimes they win, but then in a cycle or two they're out, and that causes a lot of recriminations and finger pointing, which you're seeing right now. And it's also this - this is important, they have alienated the Democrats through this ideology and identity politics, the most important voting block in the country which is the middleclass, people making between $50,000 and $100,000 a year without a college degree. The last two elections Hillary and Joe Biden have lost the middleclass. Biden did better this time because he did better with the rich, but what you're seeing is the economic populism is making (inaudible) not just in this group, but with Blacks and Hispanics too. Trump won an additional 5 percent of Black Democrats, and an additional 7 percent of Hispanic Democrats. And at this point, if you're a Democratic party official, you'd ought to spank these Socialists back to the coasts. Because of this ideology you're losing geographically, you're losing in income levels, and you're losing a very critical racial demographic. So what usually happens now, the last two incoming Democratic administrations - first two years they lurch far left, and then a red wave happens. Happened in '94 with Bill, it happened in 2010 with Barack - so my prediction, if the Democratic party leadership doesn't send these Socialists packing, Biden lurches left and you're going to see another red wave."

      "utterance": "Well, you saw Kyrsten Sinema, of course, who ran as a quote, moderate Democrat and she won in that state two years ago. You had that happen again in the most recent Senate race. But I think when you look at what Juan was just saying about who had to deal with the Tea Party and Republicans; you know who else had to deal with the Tea Party, Barack Obama. And it was interesting to watch this week when Joe Biden was giving a speech about healthcare and I remember him talking -- he was talking about Obamacare and how he's going to revise Obamacare, they're going to improve on it with the backdrop of this socialist Medicare for All. Well, in 2010, if you'll remember; President Obama said they get shellacking as a result of that. They lost more power in the House, Democrats did since Eisenhower. And also to Jesse's point about competing on -- just on the coast. Republicans are competing on the coast now. You had Michelle Steel flip a Democratic seat in California. That's only happened twice in the past two decades. And I think that the Democratic Party is starting to realize that people in these deep blue districts have the benefit and the luxury of being able to be very, very far left because they are always going to get re-elected. But it's -- you know Joe Biden is also going to have to deal with not just the reckoning and Democratic Party but potentially losing the House as a result of being pushed to the left in 2022."

      "speaker": "BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX HOST",
      "utterance": "I think there is. And I think Kevin McCarthy is going to split the Democrats wide open in the house. I cannot believe they're up to 203 seats already, about a dozen out there. It's an incredible night. Juan, I can see why you're happy that Joe Biden is president but Donald Trump remade the Republican Party and the Republicans had a monster night. And it was really to do, believe it or not Donald Trump everyone except himself because he changed into a working class party. He changed it into a multi-ethnic party. He changed it into a party that's going to go to bat for every single group without pandering. He didn't say my goodness; let's not talk about immigration because that'll tick off Hispanics. No, these are my policies. The Cubans, I don't think we should have relations with them. He didn't do that to get the Cuban vote. Venezuela, why are there (ph) communist in South America. He didn't do that to get the Venezuelan exiles. And when it came to cracking down immigration, just cared about Americans. They knew he wasn't anti-Hispanic. That's when we got the grand -- that's why he got the Rio Grande valley and that's why other people are listening to him and he got 13 percent of the African American vote, which is pathetic in the big picture but it's almost double what Mitt Romney got. And Mitt Romney didn't make any of the direct statements that let's say President Trump has made. And lastly, I can't believe that guys like Jim Clyburn, guys like Joe Manchin didn't have the guts to say defund the police is a problem. Didn't have the guts to say that burning down cities because you're angry about racial unrest is a good way to handle things. And the New Green Deal is not practical and will destroy the country. And we should be prideful of the fact that we have our energy autonomy. Why did they wait till after the election to say how bad this was. Why didn't they say it before?"

Both parties laser focused on winning those contests. This is all happening as this new report causes some controversy.

But just the amount of scorched earth oppo drops that I've seen on these two democratic senators in the last 48 hours, my god.

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "I think they have a chance. I don't know if it's good. Now republicans almost always win these run-offs, and especially in a state like Georgia. I do think the idea that you have to invade Georgia with your voters in order to win is kind of pitiful and Congressman Ro Khanna was on the daily briefing today and he said he thinks that's not a good idea, not something that should be encouraged. But I'll give you a little interesting figure. So Joe Biden is up by around 14,000 votes. David Purdue, the republican incumbent is down -- well, he's -- he needs 14,000 more votes to avoid this run-off. So is it possible that there's enough democrats? Yes, in a presidential election. In a run-off? I just don't know if it's right to say that the democrats typically don't vote in run-offs because they don't care enough. I think everybody is super highly engaged this time around and I talked to a few people today that work in republican senate races, and they went from anywhere from cautiously optimistic that everything is going to work out fine to extremely nervous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. So Brian, Dana was picking up on this. It's potentially a low-turnout election in Georgia for these two senate seats. Can Barack Obama and Joe Biden help the democrats and can a losing President Trump help the republicans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Very interesting. I think probably fascinating because I don't know what Barack Obama's impact was in the last few days when he went there over there. And I know Stacy Abrams has raised $10 million and she might be more of an impact. The other thing is I think democrat -- a lot of Georgians are very prideful of the fact that they're pro-republican and they like their old identity, which they lost if the recount goes the same way. The other thing I heard is Jon Ossoff, in terms of negative campaigning, he's a trust fund socialist and Warnock happens to love Cuba and Jeremiah Wright, so those two things aren't positive. On the other side, Purdue and Kelly Loeffler, who Doug Collins says I back her now, so that gives him his 24 percent, so I think they're both favorites. But I will look at this, the second amendment. Both are very pro-second amendment. Georgia is a very pro-second amendment state, and that's where the rubber hits the roads with these four candidates. And Purdue and Loeffler together are combining forces, almost like a ticket. I think that can be pretty strong. The fact that Rubio showed up in 48 hours I think is important. And Mitch McConnell, when he's focused, I don't know if you know this but he tends to get his way. I think he's going to pour a lot into that."

Why do you -- why do you and Melania, you're not staying in the same house. And what's happening. Why is -- why is Baron so tall. All those questions, he never had an easy question in four years but he's getting it. Here's the other thing, who cares. If someone on \"The View\" doesn't like you and is going to target you, I don't think she's hiring anyway. The other thing is you put up a list of people who haven't endorsed the president and you expect this is just like some mystery thing on \"Murder She Wrote.\" That doesn't matter. We know they haven't endorsed yet. They're still counting ballots. Everyone is cancelling so many people you can't even keep up with. We got to get a thicker skin, stop targeting people, that's your problem. But overall, I like the Dana Perino method of I don't care. I don't check my voicemail. I don't check my text messages.

I don't like it. I don't also don't like, though, when you see people who refused to say, oh, there was an election, there's no evidence of fraud, and I acknowledge a fair result. And, therefore, I acknowledge President-Elect Joe Biden. And too many Republicans right now in Republican leadership in Washington are refusing to do it. I don't know if they think this is going to generate excitement in the base for the Georgia race. I don't know what they're doing. But it's not in keeping with our democratic norms. It's not in keeping with giving the incoming administration the opportunity to have a peaceful, successful transition. And today, I read in the paper something very interesting about what happened after that 2000 race where you had that month-long count in Florida, that the people on the 9/11 Commission said that failure to have a speedy, efficient transition opened the door to some of the damage that we as a nation suffered in 9/11.

All get a turnstile and then turn in the final count. We did get some good news on a potential COVID-19 vaccine this week. But some Americans may have to wait until the rest of the world gets it first. That is if a Biden advisor called Zeke Emanuel gets his way. He urged official to follow the fair priority model which calls to distribute a vaccine globally before it's available to all Americans. Katie, is that okay with you?

And they're going to get it to the most vulnerable populations first, so the rest of the economy can get on track. And the idea that we would be obligated to somehow share it with the rest of the world, and does this include China? I don't know. But I want to talk about the restrictions as well, the new restrictions, the threats of another lockdown. You know, if you remember back in May and June when they started -- you know, there are questions about how long the lockdown was going to go, 15 days to 30 days, people were willing to do it for a little while. Lockdowns didn't necessarily stop because politicians thought that it was fine to do it. They stopped because people started fighting back. You had that woman in Texas who opened her salon, went to jail over it. You have a number of people saying I can't feed my family if you continue to lockdown measures. And also, if it's based on science, we saw -- and I said this yesterday, Governor Cuomo admitted that 63 percent of new cases in New York earlier this year came from people who were locked down. And so, you know, you have to balance out the consequences of another lockdown with the consequences we've seen of people not being able to provide for their families.

The Minneapolis in, particular, they are now getting -- asking for $500,000 to get 40 more cops in to try to get some control. That doesn't help George Floyd's memory, it doesn't help George Floyd's family, it doesn't help anyone. It vilifies all police officers, not the one that's in prison. And that is the biggest mistake. And as James Clyburn said, it is -- sloganeering is one of the worst thing that could happen. And he says that the South Carolina seat was lost because of the phrase \"defund the police.\" And Kamala Harris backed it when the LAPD did it, and everybody was in support of it when they counted a billion dollars -- when they cut $1 billion off the NYPD too. Nobody stopped it. They cheered for it. And they can't walk it back now."

It really just became adopted for soldiers coming back from war, from deployment. And now, of course, on Veterans Day, combined with John Catsimatidis of Red Apple Media, and Toys for Tots, and the Marines, and they're handing out 100,000 yellow ribbons on Veterans Day to symbolize those who have served and are serving. And I think it's just a great cause that they got behind. And Tony Orlando is a great American patriot. He says, \"Listen, I used to be in the clubs all the time. I can't perform anywhere. I can't wait to help out the troops.\" So, when John Catsimatidis called him, who might be the next mayor of New York City, he came down and helped out."

As you can see, she had a tiara on as she watches cars, bikes, the police, the fire department all rolled down the street. She -- her daughter described it like this. Her daughter is Janet Hartle. She said, mom lived through the Great Depression, two world wars, and she raised six kids. She's a strong woman. And due to the virus, obviously, there was concern she wouldn't have a big celebration. But as you can see, she got a surprise parade. She even got a pat from the fire department and the police department. She's now an honorary officer. So, happy birthday, Mrs. Loughrey."

That's right, Sean LaRochelle is studying architecture, and his brother built -- he and his brother built a personalized version of his favorite Disneyland roller coaster called the Matterhorn right there in their backyard. They started working on this in March, finished it over the summer. And he says that he always wanted to build a ride, and that Disney rides have always been special to him because of their themes. So, Sean tried to include every detail that he could from the actual right including the famous Yeti."
