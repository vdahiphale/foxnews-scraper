      "sentences": "Cross my legs. Yes, yes. Oh yes, I'm extra clammy. Happy Tuesday, everyone. It's another in-studio night, here without a live audience. So if you don't hear any laughter at home, just pretend I'm Colbert. I kid, Steve. Not really. But everything is about precautions these days. You can't ever be too safe. One mask, sure. Two masks. Why not? While you're at it, put a coffee filter over your ass. Especially if you're Eric Swalwell. Guy likes to fart. Doesn't hide it. I respect that. Of course. While the legacy media gives you grief, even if you register mild hesitancy over a vaccine mandate, they still ignore some of the essential truths about health, that in a world where you can't trust the media or the government, you can still trust yourself. You can control your own risk factors. And that's the good news about the pandemic, that deleting comorbidity that influence severity of disease is one you can be and that's obesity. The bad news is you're living in a country where you can get a cheap steak out of a vending machine, where your average Exxon station has more food than North and South Korea combined. There's a Sunoco station near my apartment that received four stars from Zagat. So it's really not our fault that we're fat. We're just awesome and making great food and we can't stop eating it. And that makes COVID worse. We knew that but in the media, no one ever wanted to say that. This is the media who regularly scolds you, like your 58-year-old single aunt who has the same haircut as Newt Gingrich. Oh, they bend over backwards to slam you for your cloth mask, but bend over forward and do some sit-ups, that's unacceptable. In the early months of this epidemic, a few loud mouths like me mentioned, this would be a good time to lose weight because it's a risk factor that you can manipulate. And we were accused of fat shaming. Yes, something that used to be known as good advice is now offensive by people in the media, who were later call you a monster for not getting triple vaxxed. Meanwhile, they got COVID anyway. But when young patients died from COVID, the Web sites wouldn't run a picture which is perfectly fine. Privacy matters, but a hidden unspeakable truth. Obesity influence the outcome, just as obesity increases non-COVID risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, and also joint damage. Relax Kat, not those joints. It's a drug reference.",

      "sentences": "I know. All right. Now according to the CDC, 61 percent of teens hospitalized for COVID-19 had severe obesity. And in general, people who are overweight are in much higher risk for death and severe disease from COVID. New study from the CDC took a look at young people hospitalized for COVID-19 and found that healthy young people continue to evade the worst of disease. Meaning if you're young and healthy, you should be living your normal life which means going to work, having a beer with friends, sending me photos of you in public bathrooms when you're drunk. Those have really dropped off during the pandemic and I'm the victim here. Meanwhile, another study finds that dropping the weight drops COVID risk. So instead of hiding inside like your Joe Biden, you're better off taking a brisk walk around the block. Unless you live in Chicago, in that case run. But this is a big untold story, untold because even as acknowledgement of weight as a factor is seen as fat shaming. So then rather save a generation from a debilitating self-created comorbidity. We salute fashion magazines for letting the plus size grace their covers, or we champion the clinically obese for being body positive. We actively try out something that as a -- that may be as bad as smoking, pretending it's a fun, flirty lifestyle choice. Because this country is mentally and emotionally softer than a tube sock full of pudding. Sounds good. Heaven forbid our doctors point out the obvious thing that could kill you.",

According to the welders on 49th and 6th, I'm knocking it out of the park. Look, the obesity epidemic has been a threat to American health for decades. And a lot of it is our own government's fault. If the carb rich nutritional pyramid of old was designed to shape all of us like pyramids, it works. Meanwhile, we targeted people in peak physical conditioning for making the decision not to get vaxxed. These are people from pro athletes to Navy SEALs spent their entire lives focused on physical fitness. And yet an overweight news anchor can pass judgment on them in between inhaling ring dings and fun sized Snickers, their most reliable sources Grubhub. Look, before the pandemic I weighed a lot more than I do now. Real picture. To be fair, most of it was baby fat. I just love eating those babies. But when I looked at my risks, I realized I could do something. So I stopped mainlining sugar and started exercising more. Bottom line COVID stress tested our country in every facet of our lives. We learned a lot about our physical and mental health, our limits, but also about how pointless it is to trust the government. Instead, you can trust yourself. And if there's anything we should exploit, it's the things that we can control. And that's diet and fitness. And in Kat's case, hygiene.",

They were doing shows Friday night in Seattle when Oswalt got a call to join Dave's show. And Oswalt wrote, why not? I wave goodbye to this hell year with a genius I started comedy with 34 years ago. I ended the year with a real friend and a deep laugh. Can ask for much more. Well, it turns out Oswalt could ask for much more, namely approval from strangers online. Who saw the photo with Chappelle it didn't approve. So Oswalt put up another post which reads in part, I'm an LGBTQ ally. I'm a loyal friend. There's friction in those traits that I need to reconcile myself and not let cause feels a -- cause feels of betrayal in anyone else. Whatever. And I'm sorry, truly sorry that I didn't consider the hurt this would cause or the depth of that hurt.

Well, sorry, Steve, they cut your head off for listening to Western music. And with this list, I might support that. Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift and Adele are among some of the better-known names on Blinken's playlists, which gives him the music tastes of a depressed waitress at Chili's.

The bad news is you're living in a country where you can get a cheap steak out of a vending machine, where your average Exxon station has more food than North and South Korea combined. There's a Sunoco station near my apartment that received four stars from Zagat. So it's really not our fault that we're fat. We're just awesome and making great food and we can't stop eating it. And that makes COVID worse. We knew that but in the media, no one ever wanted to say that. This is the media who regularly scolds you, like your 58-year-old single aunt who has the same haircut as Newt Gingrich. Oh, they bend over backwards to slam you for your cloth mask, but bend over forward and do some sit-ups, that's unacceptable. In the early months of this epidemic, a few loud mouths like me mentioned, this would be a good time to lose weight because it's a risk factor that you can manipulate. And we were accused of fat shaming. Yes, something that used to be known as good advice is now offensive by people in the media, who were later call you a monster for not getting triple vaxxed. Meanwhile, they got COVID anyway. But when young patients died from COVID, the Web sites wouldn't run a picture which is perfectly fine. Privacy matters, but a hidden unspeakable truth. Obesity influence the outcome, just as obesity increases non-COVID risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, and also joint damage. Relax Kat, not those joints. It's a drug reference."

      "utterance": "I know. All right. Now according to the CDC, 61 percent of teens hospitalized for COVID-19 had severe obesity. And in general, people who are overweight are in much higher risk for death and severe disease from COVID. New study from the CDC took a look at young people hospitalized for COVID-19 and found that healthy young people continue to evade the worst of disease. Meaning if you're young and healthy, you should be living your normal life which means going to work, having a beer with friends, sending me photos of you in public bathrooms when you're drunk. Those have really dropped off during the pandemic and I'm the victim here. Meanwhile, another study finds that dropping the weight drops COVID risk. So instead of hiding inside like your Joe Biden, you're better off taking a brisk walk around the block. Unless you live in Chicago, in that case run. But this is a big untold story, untold because even as acknowledgement of weight as a factor is seen as fat shaming. So then rather save a generation from a debilitating self-created comorbidity. We salute fashion magazines for letting the plus size grace their covers, or we champion the clinically obese for being body positive. We actively try out something that as a -- that may be as bad as smoking, pretending it's a fun, flirty lifestyle choice. Because this country is mentally and emotionally softer than a tube sock full of pudding. Sounds good. Heaven forbid our doctors point out the obvious thing that could kill you."

According to the welders on 49th and 6th, I'm knocking it out of the park. Look, the obesity epidemic has been a threat to American health for decades. And a lot of it is our own government's fault. If the carb rich nutritional pyramid of old was designed to shape all of us like pyramids, it works. Meanwhile, we targeted people in peak physical conditioning for making the decision not to get vaxxed. These are people from pro athletes to Navy SEALs spent their entire lives focused on physical fitness. And yet an overweight news anchor can pass judgment on them in between inhaling ring dings and fun sized Snickers, their most reliable sources Grubhub. Look, before the pandemic I weighed a lot more than I do now. Real picture. To be fair, most of it was baby fat. I just love eating those babies. But when I looked at my risks, I realized I could do something. So I stopped mainlining sugar and started exercising more. Bottom line COVID stress tested our country in every facet of our lives. We learned a lot about our physical and mental health, our limits, but also about how pointless it is to trust the government. Instead, you can trust yourself. And if there's anything we should exploit, it's the things that we can control. And that's diet and fitness. And in Kat's case, hygiene."

Look at him. What happened, Oswalt? He looks like Joe DeVito's grandmother. I don't even know what she looks like. Probably hotter than that, though. Sorry, Joe. I didn't mean to objectify you're probably dead grandmother. Anyway, apparently, they were doing so -- they were doing shows next door to each other. I mean, she might be alive. But we don't know. They were doing shows Friday night in Seattle when Oswalt got a call to join Dave's show. And Oswalt wrote, why not? I wave goodbye to this hell year with a genius I started comedy with 34 years ago. I ended the year with a real friend and a deep laugh. Can ask for much more. Well, it turns out Oswalt could ask for much more, namely approval from strangers online. Who saw the photo with Chappelle it didn't approve. So Oswalt put up another post which reads in part, I'm an LGBTQ ally. I'm a loyal friend. There's friction in those traits that I need to reconcile myself and not let cause feels a -- cause feels of betrayal in anyone else. Whatever.

Wow, I can't wait to see Pete Buttigieg's Pinterest page with all the baby booties he's been knitting on paternity leave. Travesty. They tweeted eight times about Blinken's public playlist since December 10th. Once for every time Joe Biden stays up at 7:00 p.m. GOP Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted, I'm sure Americans still stranded Afghanistan will appreciate having this playlist to listen to as they're forced to live under Taliban rule. Well, sorry, Steve, they cut your head off for listening to Western music. And with this list, I might support that. Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift and Adele are among some of the better-known names on Blinken's playlists, which gives him the music tastes of a depressed waitress at Chili's. I don't know it's almost as if it were a list picked by someone who's never listened to any music ever in their lives. But he also enjoys Penny Lane by the Beatles. Here's a snippet."

Which when you think about it, really isn't that much. Are we doing the story? Anyway, it's terrible. According to Joe, it's not inflation. But corporate middlemen to blame for the rise in the price of bison. Yes, he already knows the solution to the problem he just found out from Mary, who the hell is Mary, anyway? What does she know? And how long did she know it? Big beef, which is also Rob Long's High School nickname. Paying farmers less while charging grocers more, so it's not Joe's COVID policies that have caused labor and supply chain problems that's to blame. Yesterday's administration announced plans to lower costs by increasing regulations on meat packers and encouraging competition with increased federal spending. That sounds like a lot of words. Use a lot of words we go to Jerry, the one-word rabbit for comment. That added nothing to this segment. That's like almost 60 percent of what came out of my mouth. Nick, is it reasonable to expect someone that's old and isolated as Joe to know the price of beef?"

This is a good thing. Isn't this -- right? Isn't this a civilized society? People are having sex later. They're not pumping out kids when they're still kids. This has got to be great news.
