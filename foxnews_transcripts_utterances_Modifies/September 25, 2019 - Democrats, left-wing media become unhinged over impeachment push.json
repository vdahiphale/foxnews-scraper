      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Just like last night. We're going to bring you some of the most comprehensive breakdowns of everything that transpired today and that's a lot. Ken Starr and his former deputy Sol Wisenberg explain why there's no smoking gun on this Ukraine transcript. Congressman Jim Jordan, Chris Stewart who just read the whistleblower complaint itself break down the fight on Capitol Hill. Former Independent Counsel Robert Ray is also here and while allegations against the Biden family are far more serious than what Trump is facing.  And Raymond Arroyo has a special impeachment edition of seen and unseen, that's coming up as well. But first seven lessons from the past 48 hours. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. I read through the rough transcript of the call between Trump and the new Ukrainian President and a few things struck me.  Number one. There's not a single person Washington with any experience in government, not one who really believes the President was trying to use the Ukrainian government to rig the 2020 election.  I don't see how anyone in his or her right mind could legitimately say there's an impeachable offense in this transcript. In the conversation Trump congratulated Volodymyr Zelensky on his parliamentary win and said the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine but he was frustrated that the E.U. isn't doing more. Zelensky agreed saying, \"The European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner. We're ready to continue to cooperate for the next step specifically. We're almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\"  Then the President responds, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say crowd strike the server. They say Ukraine has it. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it, whatever you can do. It's very important that you do it if that's possible.  Zelensky then interjected that one of his assistants had already met with Giuliani and that the investigation was very important for him as well, adding I guarantee that all the investigations will be done openly and then candidly. That I can assure you.   OK, handling investigations openly and candidly. That sounds like an evil plot to me. How nefarious of the - there is no quid pro quo and the President never once even hinted that Ukrainian aid would be withheld if a further investigation by them wasn't done. At this point, I think it's pretty obvious that the Democrats overplayed their hand big time. They based their impeachment move on a whistleblower who didn't even hear the conversation and who grossly exaggerated what happened in it. Which brings me to point number two. The President not only did nothing wrong. He went above and beyond his duty to his office hoping to discover what happened in the lead up to the 2016 election so it never happens to another President again.   As we know the Biden story is far more than just Hunter Biden making big money in Ukraine while Daddy was setting Ukraine policy.",

I still remember by the way when the Democrats didn't tell us that they were going to work on healthcare and infrastructure. They're going to take on the drug companies. They're not going to do any of that.  Which takes us to my seventh and final points, biblical here. All right, Democrats are possessed with the anti-Trump rage. Maybe there needs to be an exorcism. They're infuriated that Mueller let him down, that Trump has beaten them pretty much at every turn. They're obsessed with punishing him and anyone who works for him, anyone who's close to him. Think about it. Does leadership give impassioned press conferences on their plan for reining in government waste and fraud and abuse or improving the economy?   No, they save all their emotion and bogus investigations and angry denunciations of anyone associated with this President. The polls are clear. This is not what Americans want. These representatives were not sent to Washington to frustrate the people's will. They were sent to Washington to do the people's will.  And at this point, Trump's doing that all on his own. Soon though, it's going to turn to the people. They'll have their say. They're going to let Washington know what it thinks about the job they've done. And properly framed, the election will be a choice between the Democrats revenge and resist style politics with the President's results. And unfortunately for Pelosi and Schiff, you can't impeach your own constituents. And that's THE ANGLE. Here to respond is Ken Starr, former Whitewater independent counsel and Sol Wisenberg, former Whitewater deputy independent counsel. All right, gentlemen, as I mentioned in THE ANGLE, the favor that Trump asked for was help investigating the 2016 election.   But hosts at CNN and MSNBC chose today and other Democrats said as well, chose today to lie about what that favor pertained. Watch.",

What is specific? It would be the House Judiciary Committee drafting articles of impeachment. What's interesting tonight is that there's a split among Democrats. You have some Democrats saying they want kind of a kitchen sink approach. They want to keep their base completely happy by having articles of impeachment about Russia and the Mueller probe, about hush payments to porn stars and Ukraine as well.  There's another camp and it appears that Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be leaning more in this direction tonight that wants to keep it narrowly focused on Ukraine because they believe they can move quicker - quicker on that and that it would also keep some of the more moderate Democrats who won swing districts, Trump districts in 2018 on board if you keep it just on Ukraine. But look at the problem, two of those more moderate Democrats, were all with Martha McCallum earlier and they didn't seem to know what they're for. Watch.",

      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST",
      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Just like last night. We're going to bring you some of the most comprehensive breakdowns of everything that transpired today and that's a lot. Ken Starr and his former deputy Sol Wisenberg explain why there's no smoking gun on this Ukraine transcript. Congressman Jim Jordan, Chris Stewart who just read the whistleblower complaint itself break down the fight on Capitol Hill. Former Independent Counsel Robert Ray is also here and while allegations against the Biden family are far more serious than what Trump is facing. And Raymond Arroyo has a special impeachment edition of seen and unseen, that's coming up as well. But first seven lessons from the past 48 hours. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. I read through the rough transcript of the call between Trump and the new Ukrainian President and a few things struck me. Number one. There's not a single person Washington with any experience in government, not one who really believes the President was trying to use the Ukrainian government to rig the 2020 election. I don't see how anyone in his or her right mind could legitimately say there's an impeachable offense in this transcript. In the conversation Trump congratulated Volodymyr Zelensky on his parliamentary win and said the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine but he was frustrated that the E.U. isn't doing more. Zelensky agreed saying, \"The European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner. We're ready to continue to cooperate for the next step specifically. We're almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\" Then the President responds, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say crowd strike the server. They say Ukraine has it. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it, whatever you can do. It's very important that you do it if that's possible. Zelensky then interjected that one of his assistants had already met with Giuliani and that the investigation was very important for him as well, adding I guarantee that all the investigations will be done openly and then candidly. That I can assure you. OK, handling investigations openly and candidly. That sounds like an evil plot to me. How nefarious of the - there is no quid pro quo and the President never once even hinted that Ukrainian aid would be withheld if a further investigation by them wasn't done. At this point, I think it's pretty obvious that the Democrats overplayed their hand big time. They based their impeachment move on a whistleblower who didn't even hear the conversation and who grossly exaggerated what happened in it. Which brings me to point number two. The President not only did nothing wrong. He went above and beyond his duty to his office hoping to discover what happened in the lead up to the 2016 election so it never happens to another President again. As we know the Biden story is far more than just Hunter Biden making big money in Ukraine while Daddy was setting Ukraine policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "If foreign governments or approach to assist and digging up dirt on Trump in the lead up to 2016, that is a big problem and Trump's right. We need to get to the bottom of any election tampering. I though Democrats wanted to stop election meddling by foreign governments. Which takes us to point number 3. Democrats don't really care about preventing government corruption. Any Democrat claiming to be interested in corruption should be outraged by the fact that Biden himself bragged on camera about dangling a foreign aid carrot to get a prosecutor fired. When that prosecutor was involved in investigating a company paying his son, boatloads of cash. Not a single - that not a single Democrat will even conceive Biden's actions at the very least were an obvious conflict of interest is extremely telling."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Number 4. If President Trump wanted to pressure Ukraine to hurt Biden with the intent on improving its own re-election chances, there were a 100 better ways to do it. By the way ways that wouldn't involve speaking to the Ukrainian President on the phone when he knows that the call is monitored and memorialized by intelligence staffers. And while the Democrats insist Trump was pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. What does the Ukrainian President himself say about it?"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Nobody pushed him. So the principal himself adamant. No pressure from Trump. The call was normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. So are the impeachment Dems saying that Zelensky here on camera is lying so it's a Trump-Ukrainian conspiracy in plain sight. Now does all this kind of sound familiar any of you? Phony collusion claims in 2017. Phony pressure claims now. Number 5. There are no moderates left in the Democrat party. This point is beyond debate. During the mid-term, swing districts Democrats claimed they were anxious to work with the President. Now they are the tips of the impeachment spear."

When they're up for re-election next year and they insist, oh, they insist they're moderates who just want government to work again. Don't believe them. They must be voted out of office for violating their pledge to be more bipartisan. Number 6. Democrat leadership has totally given up on governing. Now time and again Trump has beaten them at their own game. We've seen it. I'm beginning to think it's made them - I think they're losing it. Day after day, they're totally delusional. You know the lunatic hobos who blurt out crazy things and they zigzag in the middle of a crowded intersection. Well Adam Schiff, kind of sounded like that today."

      "utterance": "What those notes reflect is a classic mafia like shake down of a foreign leader. This is how a mafia boss talks. Like any mafia boss, the President didn't need to say, that's a nice country you have. It would be a shame if something happened to it."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The man doesn't even know the godfather OK? He doesn't even know the movie. He doesn't even know what a shakedown is. I still remember by the way when the Democrats didn't tell us that they were going to work on healthcare and infrastructure. They're going to take on the drug companies. They're not going to do any of that. Which takes us to my seventh and final points, biblical here. All right, Democrats are possessed with the anti-Trump rage. Maybe there needs to be an exorcism. They're infuriated that Mueller let him down, that Trump has beaten them pretty much at every turn. They're obsessed with punishing him and anyone who works for him, anyone who's close to him. Think about it. Does leadership give impassioned press conferences on their plan for reining in government waste and fraud and abuse or improving the economy? No, they save all their emotion and bogus investigations and angry denunciations of anyone associated with this President. The polls are clear. This is not what Americans want. These representatives were not sent to Washington to frustrate the people's will. They were sent to Washington to do the people's will. And at this point, Trump's doing that all on his own. Soon though, it's going to turn to the people. They'll have their say. They're going to let Washington know what it thinks about the job they've done. And properly framed, the election will be a choice between the Democrats revenge and resist style politics with the President's results. And unfortunately for Pelosi and Schiff, you can't impeach your own constituents. And that's THE ANGLE. Here to respond is Ken Starr, former Whitewater independent counsel and Sol Wisenberg, former Whitewater deputy independent counsel. All right, gentlemen, as I mentioned in THE ANGLE, the favor that Trump asked for was help investigating the 2016 election. But hosts at CNN and MSNBC chose today and other Democrats said as well, chose today to lie about what that favor pertained. Watch."

      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FMR DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the President showed while the President showed extremely poor judgment in the phone call. I think you're right, it's a complete exaggeration of the conversation. As I said last night, I don't think it comes close to being an impeachable offense. Understanding that the definition of an impeachable offense is somewhat amorphous is basically what a majority in Congress says is an impeachable offense. But historically, thematically, I don't think we're there and I think they harm themselves by grossly exaggerating what was - what was said in the conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Ken, my specific question is about this favor. When they - when they reference the favor, they kind of nailed it right into and he - and the favor was investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden because he's going to be his opponent in 2020. That was never said. See, I actually read the transcript like five times today. That is not what said in and if either of you ever spoken to the President at length, it's usually a pretty freewheeling conversation in a good way because he has a lot on his mind. But he's thrown out a lot of things here but they are literally telling a falsehood night after night after night, in many ways. But tonight specifically about that fact, Ken."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEN STARR, FMR WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that the use of the term 'favor,' it's unfortunate. I agree with Sol. One can question the judgment, the wisdom of the call but my word, I think is wildly extravagant to say this somehow constituted a crime, a quid pro quo seeking a favor, some sort of effort to affect the elections of the United States, especially when and we're all trained to do this. When we should this from our literature class. Read the entire transcript and the context is one of two world leaders having a conversation including about what Europe is not doing. You have to read a lot about what France is not doing. Angela Merkel was not doing. The context is critically important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right. What I want to as both of you though, I mean we have had conversations, Presidents having conversations with foreign leaders about corruption all the time. I mean this is - America is forever trying to get our allies or get people who are kind of our allies to do better. Ask for - you know you guys should be investigating this. This is not out of the ordinary. When the Ukrainian President said you know, it's kind of normal stuff. I think most people have conversations like this at the high level. It's like 50,000 feet. I don't - I did't find this out of the ordinary at all. I really didn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",

      "utterance": "Sorry to interrupt. I don't know it's ordinary or not. I'm not usually purview to these conversations. That's - that's part of the problem but the President says, we have aided you a lot, it hasn't been reciprocal. Zelensky says some things and then the President says, you could do me a favor. You're right, he doesn't talk at all about Biden right away but he gets around to Biden and he mentions - and he mentions Biden's son and he mentions it a few times. That's why I say, it's unfortunate, it's bad judgment, very bad judgment. But it doesn't come close in my view to being a crime or to being impeachable and that's the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "About a 2 to 3. I don't think it's a serious issue with respect to recusal. First of all, we now know, we've been informed that the President never reached out to the Attorney General directly or indirectly. That the Attorney General's had no communications with the Ukrainian government about all this. And so we saw this, didn't we? In the Russia investigation and the Mueller report, the President asked for something to be done or says something to be done but it doesn't end up getting done. So there's no reason for Bill Barr to recuse himself."

That's protecting him. Here the President never talked to Barr. Never asked Barr about anything. However, I think it's very important and this is really of all the things in the conversation that upset me the most is by mentioning the Attorney General, who has been very careful to set up the Durham investigation--"

He's put this impeccable person of impeccable reputation, a career prosecutor in charge of it. The Attorney General has said it all up so that we can have confidence in it and then for the President to say something in this in this investigation like I'm going to have my Attorney General, it's not a good thing to do."

I mean, I think he probably maybe understood that this was being investigated already or was it - was in process of being investigated and he probably knew at some point they were going to likely talk to him. Maybe that - I don't know but it was like Durham versus Barr. I think it's like a freewheeling conversation. I think the fact that we're releasing transcripts of our conversations with foreign leaders, I bet there a lot of foreign leaders out there who are very unhappy right now and I'm worried about what is going to do to the Presidency. But great to have you both on tonight. Thanks so much. And Jim Jordan was one of the first Congressman to read the transcript of this call with Ukrainian President. Congressman Chris Stewart, just for you the actual whistleblower complaint. They're both here in moments."

Well, what's significant would be the numbers .The fact that now a majority of the 217 House Democrats are saying that they're in favor of some sort of impeachment inquiry but what comes next? What is specific? It would be the House Judiciary Committee drafting articles of impeachment. What's interesting tonight is that there's a split among Democrats. You have some Democrats saying they want kind of a kitchen sink approach. They want to keep their base completely happy by having articles of impeachment about Russia and the Mueller probe, about hush payments to porn stars and Ukraine as well. There's another camp and it appears that Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be leaning more in this direction tonight that wants to keep it narrowly focused on Ukraine because they believe they can move quicker - quicker on that and that it would also keep some of the more moderate Democrats who won swing districts, Trump districts in 2018 on board if you keep it just on Ukraine. But look at the problem, two of those more moderate Democrats, were all with Martha McCallum earlier and they didn't seem to know what they're for. Watch."

If you think this is dramatic, go read the transcript from this phone call and you tell me if you think that's dramatic. Because I think most American people go what is this about and Laura, if I could make this point quickly, I don't care if there's 217 Democrats who are voting for impeachment. That does not matter. It's the American people that matter in this thing. And they look at what Richard Nixon and they go, that was wrong. They look at what Bill Clinton did and they just intuitively know this was wrong but you have to explain to them well, for him to go talk to a foreign leader and to ask him to investigate corruption and most Americans go, I don't get it.

Everyone should read this document. I hope all your viewers do because when you read it, there was no quid pro quo, there was no talk about aid or any type of favor. There was - the whistleblower - the whistleblower himself was not, as Chris just said, had no first-hand knowledge, wasn't part of the call and I bet he hasn't even seen the transcript until today."

Now we have this complaint is all released, it's unredacted, it's declassified released. You got the transcript which now they're complaining about saying it's not really a transcript, OK?

A moment ago you said that a couple days ago there were news reports claiming that the whistleblower complaint was a whole lot more than the phone call, a series of incidents that maybe led this whistleblower to complain, to speak out, to say that there was a whole series of problems with the president. Congressman Stewart now saying it's largely about the call. I spoke to a senior administration official tonight who told me that the other stuff the whistleblower talks about in the complaint is largely stuff you could've gotten from news clippings, stuff that's been in the public domain. So remember, and if the congressman can confirm that for us, originally a lot of people in the media presented this a couple days ago as this whistleblower inside the government saw things up close that really alarmed him or her. But instead I'm hearing from a senior administration official this quote-unquote whistleblower heard about the call secondhand, as you noted, but also heard about these other things that were already in the public domain, not stuff that the whistleblower has firsthand knowledge of."

Robert, from an investigator standpoint, all your experiencing in the legal world, you're one the most respected lawyers out there, isn't the Biden angle more troubling than what Trump is accused of?

I do know that Rudy Giuliani feels very strongly that there is not only smoke out there in the Ukraine but fire as well as to what exactly was going on with our where's Waldo candidate, Hunter Biden. And although I do think, if I can differ with you for just a moment, as an investigator or otherwise, my sense is if Joe Biden remains the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, and I have my doubts about whether or not that will continue, because this is going to implode on everybody. I don't think this issue is going to drop, and Hunter Biden and the vice president's role in all of this is going to be looked at.

It hurt them in the 98 congressional elections when we ran on progress, not politics. You saw the video that's been shown of the Democrats widely decrying the Republicans overreaching. And having read the transcripts, heard about what the whistleblower said, there's no slam-dunk here, Laura. And if they go forward with an impeachment inquiry, which I don't think it's clear yet, but if they go forward and then vote, this could be curtains for the Democrats.

It's fun to see Nancy 20 years ago. We all looked younger. But she said people are paralyzed with hatred, OK, because of their impeachment quest. Pot meet kettle.

I don't think she wanted to do this, but I think she felt like she was being cornered by the leftwing of her party, and she gave in. I think it's going to go down in history as one of the dark days of her political judgment in going along with this, because, as Doug just said, the American people don't want it. The facts don't support it. This whistleblower complaint sounds to me like it was written by Fusion GPS. And it's really going to end up drawing very negative attention to the frontrunner in the Democratic race and really undermine the credibility of the Dems."

Look at these numbers, registered voters only 37 percent want impeachment, the people who are going to vote. Doug, let's skip to Orange County. Let's go to Orange County, a little down the coast from Harmeet. She's up in San Fran with all the fun people. And down in Orange County, all these swing districts, we were all kind of demoralized, Republicans, look at all these wonderful Republican districts, they all flipped Democrat. They all promised to be bipartisan. We are going to work with the president where we can agree. They have done none of that, and now they're all voting for impeachment? How is that going to work for California? Are you kidding me?"

Maxine Waters has said Trump should be impeached for not being respectful and for creating division and chaos. Herein lies the problem. The media has done a horrible job, Laura, of explaining impeachable offenses, crimes and misdemeanors, and, frankly, they've offered these silly impeachable offenses up, and they go unchallenged."

I believe the president shamelessly subverted and undermined authority of the National Park Service when he allowed this 11-year-old civilian to cut the White House lawn in 2017. Did he break underage worker laws, Laura? Did the president pay taxes on the tip he gave the child? A congressional inquiry of lawn-gate is clearly needed."

I find it impeachable that the tie goes a little below the belt, meaning in a fire emergency he could put others in danger by tripping, causing the Secret Service to reach down, pull him up, causing harm to the nation. That is clearly an impeachable offense."

What if last week we saw the photographic evidence that the president is careless with money? Look at this video. No wallet, no paper clip, no money clip, no rubber band. The president just shoves currency in his back pocket. It's clear he's getting ready to bribe somebody, Laura."
