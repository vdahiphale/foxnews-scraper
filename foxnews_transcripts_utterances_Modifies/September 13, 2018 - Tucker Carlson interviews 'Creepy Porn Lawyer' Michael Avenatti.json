We've denigrated his possible run for President. We even gave him an unflattering nickname. But tonight, after many requests he has agreed to come on our show. And in return, we're prepared to give him the serious treatment he says he deserves. And so, we will. Stormy Daniels' lawyer joins us just minutes from now.  But first tonight, Hurricane Florence has arrived in the United States. The storm is causing havoc all along the Carolina coast ahead of an expected landfall sometime tomorrow. Our Chief Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth has been following this since the very beginning and he joins us with the latest.  Hey, Rick.",

We can't exactly say that kind of precision, maybe 10, 20 miles one way or the other - or the other, we just we don't have that just yet. But I will tell you. This is satellite image. The storm very close here just south of the outer banks around Morehead City, at least that's the center of it, but it's a very large storm. Hurricane-force winds crossing about a 160 mile path right there and tropical storm force winds that's winds around 40 miles an hour and above are about 400 miles across, so, a - a really large storm that's going to impact so many people here.  And the radar picture, this right here are tornado concerns. Right there, that's a tornado warning. We will see little tornadoes pop up throughout this. We have one tornado warning. And then I want to move forward and show you the flooding concerns right there, Morehead City, flash flooding going on so that one spot dealing with both of this right here. We've probably seen six to eight inches of rain already fall. And I think we're probably maybe 10 to 15 percent away through what this storm is going to be doing. Take a look at this. A buoy out here recorded a wind gust of 112 miles an hour, so the winds are definitely with us right in the center part of this storm and that center part of the storm just going to get closer to the shore tonight into tomorrow.  Take a look at this. There's going to be a huge swath of land here. North Carolina, also into South Carolina that gets about a foot of rain and there will be isolated spots that are two-plus, probably a few spots that are 40 inches plus by the time this is done. And when I say done that means maybe Sunday into Monday.   This is the track of it. Again, we don't know what is going to happen here along the coast, eventually moves inland, and then, very quickly, Monday, Tuesday moves up towards the Northeast and we'll be done with this. But we have a long, probably, 48 to 72 hours ahead. Tucker?",

But they're still trying and they're going to keep trying apparently till the bitter end.   In a last minute twist today, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California says she has sent a letter about Kavanaugh to the FBI.

Senator Feinstein released a statement saying the reason she won't talk about the information she passed on to federal investigators is because quoting here \"That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision.\"  The New York Times is reporting the matter involves possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and a female when the judge was in high school.  Fox News has learned that Senator Feinstein first heard about the claim back in July. And yet, during 65 meetings with senators, including Feinstein, more than 32 hours of confirmation hearings, and 1,278 written follow-up questions from Democrats to Kavanaugh, the matter was never raised until today when Senator Feinstein sent it to investigators. The FBI says it will include the information in Kavanaugh's background file but were (ph) told any further action on the letter would have to come from the White House. So far, the White House has done nothing except call this a Democratic delay tactic.  John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the Senate and Member of the Judiciary Committee is incredulous saying \"Let me get this straight. This is a statement about a secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person. Right.\"   The conservative Judicial Crisis Network says \"This has all the indications of an 11th hour character assassination.\" We should note Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have also tried and failed to subpoena documents into Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to George W. Bush, including documents on Kavanaugh's knowledge of enhanced interrogations and warrantless wiretapping in the wake of 9/11. Judiciary Committee Chair, Chuck Grassley, who has not yet seen the letter from Senator Feinstein, says the confirmation vote will go forward as scheduled, September 20th. Tucker?",

He's already been convicted in the State of Virginia on eight separate financial charges, tax evasion, mostly. It's unclear if this deal, if it exists, would involve any testimony about the 2016 campaign. The Special Counsel's Office, not surprisingly, has declined to comment. We'll, of course, continue to follow it as updates appear.   But in other news today, just days ago, Peter Strzok's attorney tried to claim that the text messages that Strzok sent to his girlfriend Lisa Page about a \"Media leaking strategy\" were actually evidence he was trying to stop leaks. Ha. It wasn't believable then. It's less believable today because we have a new text message, this also from April of 2017. And what Strzok talks openly to Page about interacting with the press. He says The New York Times was angry because The Washington Post got a scoop surreptitiously on a story about Carter Page. In another message from December of 2016, Strzok told Page \"Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they're kicking into overdrive.\" Don Calloway is an attorney. He's a former Member of the Missouri State House representing St. Louis. And he joins us tonight.

There's a post office next door to the Observatory and they shut that down too. Local residents watched all that. They saw at least one Black Hawk helicopter, for real, circling the site. The local sheriff told reporters that the FBI refused to explain any of what was happening to him. \"For the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there.\" Huh? What stuff? Well we asked. The Feds won't say. But the Observatory today issued a cryptic statement about an unnamed security issue. Now, maybe it's nothing. Maybe, it's something. We're going to keep on it. Find out. American society seems to be fraying at the edges but filmmaker Michael Moore believes he's part of the solution. He is the hero who can help save it.

We just lost our own electric power a short time ago and it's just complete darkness all the way down this island (ph) and the people were well warned. They took those warnings seriously. Most of them have boarded up these houses here running (ph) the beach and left.

We've denigrated his possible run for President. We even gave him an unflattering nickname. But tonight, after many requests he has agreed to come on our show. And in return, we're prepared to give him the serious treatment he says he deserves. And so, we will. Stormy Daniels' lawyer joins us just minutes from now. But first tonight, Hurricane Florence has arrived in the United States. The storm is causing havoc all along the Carolina coast ahead of an expected landfall sometime tomorrow. Our Chief Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth has been following this since the very beginning and he joins us with the latest. Hey, Rick."

We can't exactly say that kind of precision, maybe 10, 20 miles one way or the other - or the other, we just we don't have that just yet. But I will tell you. This is satellite image. The storm very close here just south of the outer banks around Morehead City, at least that's the center of it, but it's a very large storm. Hurricane-force winds crossing about a 160 mile path right there and tropical storm force winds that's winds around 40 miles an hour and above are about 400 miles across, so, a - a really large storm that's going to impact so many people here. And the radar picture, this right here are tornado concerns. Right there, that's a tornado warning. We will see little tornadoes pop up throughout this. We have one tornado warning. And then I want to move forward and show you the flooding concerns right there, Morehead City, flash flooding going on so that one spot dealing with both of this right here. We've probably seen six to eight inches of rain already fall. And I think we're probably maybe 10 to 15 percent away through what this storm is going to be doing. Take a look at this. A buoy out here recorded a wind gust of 112 miles an hour, so the winds are definitely with us right in the center part of this storm and that center part of the storm just going to get closer to the shore tonight into tomorrow. Take a look at this. There's going to be a huge swath of land here. North Carolina, also into South Carolina that gets about a foot of rain and there will be isolated spots that are two-plus, probably a few spots that are 40 inches plus by the time this is done. And when I say done that means maybe Sunday into Monday. This is the track of it. Again, we don't know what is going to happen here along the coast, eventually moves inland, and then, very quickly, Monday, Tuesday moves up towards the Northeast and we'll be done with this.

But first tonight, Democrats are powerless to stop Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination on their own. That's the math of the question. But they're still trying and they're going to keep trying apparently till the bitter end. In a last minute twist today, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California says she has sent a letter about Kavanaugh to the FBI. It's a secret letter written by a secret person containing a secret allegation about possible misconduct in high school some 35-plus years ago. That's what we know. Trace Gallagher has more. Hey, Trace."

Senator Feinstein released a statement saying the reason she won't talk about the information she passed on to federal investigators is because quoting here \"That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision.\" The New York Times is reporting the matter involves possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and a female when the judge was in high school. Fox News has learned that Senator Feinstein first heard about the claim back in July. And yet, during 65 meetings with senators, including Feinstein, more than 32 hours of confirmation hearings, and 1,278 written follow-up questions from Democrats to Kavanaugh, the matter was never raised until today when Senator Feinstein sent it to investigators. The FBI says it will include the information in Kavanaugh's background file but were (ph) told any further action on the letter would have to come from the White House. So far, the White House has done nothing except call this a Democratic delay tactic. John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the Senate and Member of the Judiciary Committee is incredulous saying \"Let me get this straight. This is a statement about a secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person. Right.\" The conservative Judicial Crisis Network says \"This has all the indications of an 11th hour character assassination.\" We should note Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have also tried and failed to subpoena documents into Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to George W. Bush, including documents on Kavanaugh's knowledge of enhanced interrogations and warrantless wiretapping in the wake of 9/11. Judiciary Committee Chair, Chuck Grassley, who has not yet seen the letter from Senator Feinstein, says the confirmation vote will go forward as scheduled, September 20th. Tucker?"

If that's true that deal would head off Manafort's upcoming trial in Washington. He's being tried on charges of fraud and, hilariously, failing to register as a foreign agent. He's already been convicted in the State of Virginia on eight separate financial charges, tax evasion, mostly. It's unclear if this deal, if it exists, would involve any testimony about the 2016 campaign. The Special Counsel's Office, not surprisingly, has declined to comment. We'll, of course, continue to follow it as updates appear. But in other news today, just days ago, Peter Strzok's attorney tried to claim that the text messages that Strzok sent to his girlfriend Lisa Page about a \"Media leaking strategy\" were actually evidence he was trying to stop leaks. Ha. It wasn't believable then. It's less believable today because we have a new text message, this also from April of 2017. And what Strzok talks openly to Page about interacting with the press. He says The New York Times was angry because The Washington Post got a scoop surreptitiously on a story about Carter Page. In another message from December of 2016, Strzok told Page \"Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they're kicking into overdrive.\" Don Calloway is an attorney. He's a former Member of the Missouri State House representing St. Louis. And he joins us tonight.

It's in Sunspot, New Mexico right above the Mexican border and they evacuated the premises. It's a - it's federal facility. There's a post office next door to the Observatory and they shut that down too. Local residents watched all that. They saw at least one Black Hawk helicopter, for real, circling the site. The local sheriff told reporters that the FBI refused to explain any of what was happening to him. \"For the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there.\" Huh? What stuff? Well we asked. The Feds won't say. But the Observatory today issued a cryptic statement about an unnamed security issue. Now, maybe it's nothing. Maybe, it's something. We're going to keep on it. Find out. American society seems to be fraying at the edges but filmmaker Michael Moore believes he's part of the solution. He is the hero who can help save it.

Meanwhile, Moore's ex-wife says that he stiffed her on the profits from the films she helped produce. Those would include Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11. Greg Gutfeld has long made a passion of studying the career of Michael Moore. He also, of course, hosts \"The Five\" on Fox as well as \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" and he joins us tonight.

We should have - we should have tried that with Pearl Harbor. Files - filed suit in Tokyo District Court. It would all have been over a lot quicker."

Daniels has written a tell- all, time to help Democrats in the mid-term elections, probably advised by her lawyer to do that. I've written a book about why powerful forces are promoting people like Stormy Daniels and creepy porn lawyer in the first place. The book is called Ship of Fools. And it's the story of how our political class manufactures sideshows like this to hide the fact that they have no idea what they're doing but are getting rich doing it. Two books, out the same day. If you want to send a message this might be the time. You can pre-order it if you want, just to make that message crystal-clear. We've got a Fox News Alert. Of course, the outer edge of Hurricane Florence now made contact with the coast of North Carolina bringing with it powerful winds, huge amounts of rain, and a storm surge that could be deadly. Our correspondent, Steve Harrigan is in North Topsail Beach, North Carolina, right in the path of this hurricane and he joins us tonight. Steve, what's it like?"

      "utterance": "Tucker, it's really gotten worse every hour. Right now, we're seeing sustained tropical storm force winds. A couple hours, we're probably going to see hurricane-force winds of over a 100 miles an hour. The rain is just coming down in sheets. It's actually blowing right into me. It's been like that for the last several hours. That's the real concern here is after the wind passes through we could see 30 or 40 inches of rain in some places. It was described in one weather - weather report as potential total inundation in parts of North Carolina, so that's the real fear. Most of the people are off this island. We just lost our own electric power a short time ago and it's just complete darkness all the way down this island (ph) and the people were well warned. They took those warnings seriously. Most of them have boarded up these houses here running (ph) the beach and left. So they're - they're for the large part gone but - but for those who stayed and know the risks there is going to be some help, some very brave first responders are prepared. There are Swift Boat (ph) rescue teams. There's - the National Guard's been called up, several thousand members and also the army is ready to save people as well with high water vehicles as well as helicopters. So this could be a really dicey and dangerous next 48 hours here along the coast of North Carolina. Tucker, back to you."

      "speaker": "LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, Tucker, the storm hit here a couple of hours before it hit Steve, so it has continually been a little bit stronger here and that is the real concern is these conditions have been going on for hours. Typically, in hurricanes, the really bad stuff only lasts a couple of hours. It could last 12 to 24 hours where we are. We've seen winds up to about 80 miles an hour, some gusts probably stronger than that. Again, power has been out here for now about six hours. Complete darkness. And you can see, as the tide has begun to come in we're getting the storm surge that is coming. Now it's actually much harder to stand than it ever has been here. This storm surge next couple of hours or so will lift these docks clear up, where I'm standing will be flooded and turn those docks into barges of destruction here throughout this town. Then, of course, comes the issue of inland flooding. We're going to be talking about hundreds of thousands, if not, millions of people without power and weeks to be able to restore it, Tucker."

Stay with Fox News for continuing coverage of Hurricane Florence all night long and as long as it lasts. We'll see you tomorrow night on the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And trust me, we mean that with deepest sincerity. Good night from Washington.
