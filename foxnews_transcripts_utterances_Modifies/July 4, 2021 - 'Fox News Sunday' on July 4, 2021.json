When you look at the IC assessment, that the intelligence community's assessment, some reporting that within six months, the Taliban could  completely take over the country, including Bagram Air Base. It's quite frightening and they have gone quite an offensive right now in the more rural areas and they're poised to take provincial capitals. Once our troops are finally out of there, it looks like within a month, we'll be completely withdrawn. My criticism -- my criticism, we can debate how long to stay there, but my criticism is the lack of planning and preparation for this. If you -- if  you fail to plan, you plan to fail and I worry -- also when I met with President Ghani last week, Mike, you know, they talked about -- his team, about this is going to be the year of the jihad. What do they mean by that? It means all the young males in Pakistan at the madrassas are poised with the Taliban to pour over into Afghanistan and you're going to see a major civil war take place.

You know, they are really -- it's a dangerous game to do gain of research -- function research, and genetically manipulate viruses to make them more infectious. They're really playing with fire and that fire really lit up the world and burned it.

When I talked to the ambassador from Guatemala, he said, I don't want -- we're losing a generation of my children. What I need now is not aid, but trade. And what we need to do is work with State Department, Development Finance Corporation to get private investment down in Central America, because as long as the conditions are so bad down there, the families are willing to pay lifesavings to hand their children over to a trafficker. You know, I was a federal prosecutor, chair of homeland security, the traffickers are vicious and they exploit these children, they separate them from the families and they really don't care about these children.

So I think this is an opportunity to really say he's still in the game to the base. He uses it to attack people who have, you know, opposed him politically, including Republicans, and, you know, endorsed primary opponents, the people who have challenged him and he goes after the Republican leadership in Congress pretty frequently as well.

But clearly, Nancy Pelosi, and as you pointed out, and, Juan, you pointed out, Joe Biden earlier made -- has made clear that they are holding the infrastructure package hostage in order to get even more spending through reconciliation. And the problem there is at some point, and we're already seeing lots of evidence of this throughout the economy, at some point if you print -- the government keeps printing so much money, so make trillions of dollars and spends so many trillions of dollars that we don't have on whatever it is you're spending it on, that is going to drive -- be the major driver for inflation.

That's possible, but right now this full dose series, two doses of the mRNA vaccines, or one dose of the J&J vaccine is highly protective with no evidence yet that anyone needs a booster at this point.

Now, that's being turned over to the Afghans. When you look at the IC assessment, that the intelligence community's assessment, some reporting that within six months, the Taliban could completely take over the country, including Bagram Air Base. It's quite frightening and they have gone quite an offensive right now in the more rural areas and they're poised to take provincial capitals. Once our troops are finally out of there, it looks like within a month, we'll be completely withdrawn. My criticism -- my criticism, we can debate how long to stay there, but my criticism is the lack of planning and preparation for this. If you -- if you fail to plan, you plan to fail and I worry -- also when I met with President Ghani last week, Mike, you know, they talked about -- his team, about this is going to be the year of the jihad. What do they mean by that? It means all the young males in Pakistan at the madrassas are poised with the Taliban to pour over into Afghanistan and you're going to see a major civil war take place.

We have to get them out of there. There are about 9,000 of them. And I've been really pleading with the administration to come up with a plan. They just haven't prepared for this at all. The last I've heard, I think, finally, we've gotten some -- some attention and Kazakhstan looks a possible place to do this. And in terms of ISR, the intelligence surveillance reconnaissance capability, Uzbekistan is looking like a better place to do this. But you know, we are going dark in Afghanistan and there's going to be consequences long-term to this.

A residual force of 2,500 troops is not a whole lot of a footprint compared to where we have troops elsewhere to provide stability in the region. And I'm concerned with this complete decision to pull out that it's not going to have a good ending to it. And, yeah, I look at the embassy itself. We're going to have 600 people, DOD and other personnel. You know, I'm from Texas. The Alamo, and we had 250 Texans, 5,000 Mexicans, didn't end up so well there.

You know, one is the cover up that took place, I call it the greatest human -- greatest cover-up in human history. And you don't cover-up something if you're not trying to hide something. You know, they deleted all their databases with respect to the virus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The POA (ph) came in in 2019 and took over the lab, the head of the Kim (ph) bio warfare program. That doesn't happen unless something happened, you know, at that lab. So I think -- you know, I wish the Democrats would join with us on this very important investigations and what caused this problem. You know, they are really -- it's a dangerous game to do gain of research -- function research, and genetically manipulate viruses to make them more infectious. They're really playing with fire and that fire really lit up the world and burned it. And I think we need to get to the truth of the matter and the fact is State Department was warning about their safety protocols and many of the research workers were actually hospitalized with flu-like symptoms consistent with COVID. And finally, the world military games that took place in October, 9,000 militaries personnel came in all over the world to participate in many of them left with COVID-like symptoms.

And to undo that with the stroke of the pen, really not knowing what he was doing other than the fact that Trump's name was on it caused significant damage. When I talked to Border Patrol, there's a direct cause and effect between these foreign policy decisions and what we are seeing now at the border -- according to the secretary of homeland, the worst in 21 years. And it's really sad to see these young children down there at the detention facility interiors not knowing where there are without their parents. It's caused a humanitarian crisis. It's going to cause a human trafficking crisis. And for those little girls, a sex trafficking crisis. And again, the Biden administration is going to own this and I don't know how they can fix it because they're not willing to go back to these policies and it's very, very sad."

We have to -- it's manpower, technology, and infrastructure, that would be the wall. When you get to the root cause of the problem, this is where we need to do a better job working with Central America. When I talked to the ambassador from Guatemala, he said, I don't want -- we're losing a generation of my children. What I need now is not aid, but trade. And what we need to do is work with State Department, Development Finance Corporation to get private investment down in Central America, because as long as the conditions are so bad down there, the families are willing to pay lifesavings to hand their children over to a trafficker. You know, I was a federal prosecutor, chair of homeland security, the traffickers are vicious and they exploit these children, they separate them from the families and they really don't care about these children. And they bring them over, dump them off across the river, create a diversion and then the drugs come in in another sector with fentanyl and all sorts of dangerous things that are killing Americans as I speak in the United States."

I think with the House, Pelosi put forward was a totally partisan measure. You know, one out of every $2 went to the Green New Deal, totally unacceptable to Republicans. You know, if you're really serious about this, look at traditional infrastructure, and that is roads, bridges, rural broadband, which is so important to the country right now and not muck it up with things that have nothing to do with infrastructure. I worry that they're going to expand health care and education, have nothing to do with infrastructure, and then Bernie Sanders will use a reconciliation process to basically open up to a massive tax increase.

Now, remember, he has no Twitter, he has no Facebook, he's not on TV very much. He has no White House pulpit or staff to help him. So I think this is an opportunity to really say he's still in the game to the base. He uses it to attack people who have, you know, opposed him politically, including Republicans, and, you know, endorsed primary opponents, the people who have challenged him and he goes after the Republican leadership in Congress pretty frequently as well. The big issue for him is he doesn't have a political agenda at the moment. There is no sense of priorities or plans. So it's a little bit like a rerun. You know, it's like a cast reunion at the state fair ground, and it's very entertaining and he still draws a crowd, no question."

He still is a firm grasp. You had tens of thousands of people show up, they withstood scorching heat, unbelievably rains last night in Sarasota to attend that rally and they were -- were not disappointed. It was a great Trump rally. I do disagree though that he doesn't have an agenda. He has very much an agenda. His America First agenda talking about immigration and jobs and things like that are -- is at the very center of his platform. And I would argue that in the six months that Joe Biden has been in the White House, those issues have only become more pointed and his message -- his America first message, Donald Trump's America first message has become only more sellable and more popular in the six months that Joe Biden has been kind of goofing things up."

Across party lines, these are popular programs and within the Democratic Party overwhelmingly so. The only question is whether or not you can get that through the Senate and it appears right now that the Senate in terms of doing it basically with all Democratic votes as reconciliation is possible. But right now as strategy for Pelosi, I don't think there's any doubt that she is pursuing a politically-popular path not only within her party but within this country."

So I suspect -- I do suspect that at the end of the day, some sort of deal will come through. But clearly, Nancy Pelosi, and as you pointed out, and, Juan, you pointed out, Joe Biden earlier made -- has made clear that they are holding the infrastructure package hostage in order to get even more spending through reconciliation. And the problem there is at some point, and we're already seeing lots of evidence of this throughout the economy, at some point if you print -- the government keeps printing so much money, so make trillions of dollars and spends so many trillions of dollars that we don't have on whatever it is you're spending it on, that is going to drive -- be the major driver for inflation. And when people around the country -- they may not be talking about so much infrastructure and the things I think Juan is right about, you know, they are generally popular, but when you -- when you go to the grocery store today or you go to the gas station today and you see these prices are skyrocketing, home prices skyrocketing -- those are the kinds of things that have a massive, massive effect on an election in the future. And so, I think -- I think that -- everybody is kind of trying to talk about this area that is generally popular, but the -- but, man, the hangover from it is going to be I think devastating and it's going to be really devastating for Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and Democrats if they continue on this path."

In contrast, in the states where we have lower vaccination rates, many of them have much higher rates, 5, 10, 20 times higher rates and those lower states and those rates are increasing because of the delta variant, which is much more infectious. We don't yet know whether it's more deadly case per case, but we do have good evidence that our vaccines work to protect us against delta.

Not 100 percent, but very well protected against the virus. If you're not vaccinated, you need to continue to mask up indoors and think seriously about getting vaccinated soon so that you can do more things more safely and that you're not a risk to other people. One of the things that's so striking here is that this isn't a question of Democrat or Republican, this is a question of science and humanity. This is a huge triumph. The vaccines were developed under the Trump administration. They were then rolled out largely in the current administration. They're a victory not for Democrats or Republicans, they're a victory for people over the virus. And the more of us who get vaccinated, the more we can do. In terms of masks, if you're immunocompromised or you're in a very crowded place with very poor ventilation, that's something you'll have to consider individually. But, generally, these vaccines are remarkably safe and remarkably effective."

But most of the people who haven't yet been vaccinated are open to the idea. They have understandable questions. Some think that the vaccines were rushed. That's really not the case. This is 20 years of scientific research. Some distrust the vaccines. For them, sometimes it's helpful to explain that virtually every doctor who's been offered this vaccine has gotten it as soon as they can. I have. My family has. My kids have. This vaccine is safe and effective at our best route to being able to do more things without worrying about infecting other people or ourselves or bringing home an infection that could result in a lethal illness in a loved one."

    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDEN",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends on a few things, who you are, what you're doing, and where you are. If you are vaccinated and your immune system is normal, then you need to follow the regulations for where you are. If you're on a plane or a bus and they require it, you need to wear it. But, in most places, you really don't. In contrast, if you haven't been vaccinated, you need to wear a mask. If you have been vaccinated but your immune system is weak or you're very close to someone in the household of someone with a weak immune system, then you may want to think carefully about it. What is very clear is that if you've been vaccinated, you're way less likely to get severely ill, you're way less likely to spread the illness even if you get infected, and you're almost complete protected against death from the virus. About 99 percent of the 200 or so Americans who continue to die every day from this virus have not yet been vaccinated. Vaccination is our route to freedom."

      "speaker": "FRIEDEN",
      "utterance": "Mike, I really feel what we have to do is level with the American public. And the fact is, we do not know. It's possible we'll need booster shots periodically. It's possible this vaccine, especially the -- well, all of the vaccines approved in this country may last for three years, five years, ten years, lifetime. We don't know. We are studying this. And because the vaccines are just recently developed and applied, it will be sometime before we see, are people getting breakthrough infections? Who are those people? Should some people get a vaccine booster and not others after one year or two years or five years? If there are more changes in the virus after delta, other even more dangerous variants, maybe we'll need to tweak the vaccine. That's possible, but right now this full dose series, two doses of the mRNA vaccines, or one dose of the J&J vaccine is highly protective with no evidence yet that anyone needs a booster at this point. As the science change, we will change our assessment and our recommendations based on an objective look at the data."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "OK, so we'll see where the research goes. The Biden administration did not achieve its goal of having at least 70 percent of American adults receive at least one vaccine dose by today. Is it fair to say vaccination in this country has stalled?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDEN",
      "utterance": "I don't think vaccination has stalled but it has certainly slowed. And because of that, we need to do more to reach people who have questions. There're valid questions. You have to answer those questions, address the concerns, find the messages and the messengers that make a difference. My group resolved to save lives, did some research in the U.S. earlier this week that we released, and we found that when you just showed people the real life stories of the thousands, tens of thousands of people suffering from long COVID, with brain fog, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, difficulty doing the things that they used to love to do, they realize that it's not just about severe hospitalization and death, but long COVID that can be really debilitating for young, healthy people. So whatever the message is, the fact is vaccines are safe, they're effective. Virtually every doctor who has been offered them has taken them. And the more of us who get vaccinated, the safer we'll all be and the more we can do without worrying about the virus. We want it to be behind us. But until we get more Americans vaccinated, we're still going to be struggling with outbreaks and clusters and disruptions to the activities that we enjoy doing."

Variants that might be able to get around the vaccine-induced immunity and require us to have more shots. Now, we don't know if that will happen, but it's certainly a risk. Anywhere in the world there's uncontrolled spread of COVID, there's the possibility of new variances emerging. We've already seen remarkable kind of innovation by the virus as new strains of the virus have gotten much more infectious than the strains we were dealing with before. So far our vaccines work extremely well against every variant its thrown at us, but we don't know if that's going to continue to be the case. And the more we can tamp down spread, the better off and the safer we'll all be."

CATHERINE LUCEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you saw the president there really, as you said, Mike, celebrating. You know, the White House is encouraged by what they're seeing. This was the strongest jobs report in sometime. You know, stocks rose after this report. They are really making the argument that the, you know, economy is reopening, people are coming back, people are coming back to work, that this is -- these are all signs of progress. But, of course, you're also right that, you know, there are still warning signs and things to be concerned about. So, you know, that includes the includes the fact that it is -- workers are still slowly coming back to work and, you know, was mentioned in the previous panel, inflation is a concern for a lot of people as, you know, Americans, you know, this week see higher prices at the grocery store or the gas pump. And then, of course, you have the fact that the vaccination campaign is still continuing. It has slowed. And there are pockets of the country where the vaccination rate is lower. And so there are also concerns that, you know, the recovery could be uneven if places become hot spots. So it is -- you know, like I said, the White House is really trying to, you know, signal progress and enthusiasm. You saw the president out in Michigan yesterday, you know, sort of touting that they're back. They're doing a big event at the White House today. You know, a thousand people coming in to have a sort of a Fourth of July barbecue. They're really trying to signal that America's back, but they also are signaling that there is work to do and vaccinations."

I think the White House was putting out last week that 3 million jobs have been created since Biden took office, which is a record for any president. But, obviously, that comes after the tremendous economic slowdown that attached itself to the COVID pandemic. Nonetheless, when you see wages rising, that's really good news. And I think that it's not only that. But, again, as Catherine mentioned, the stock market. The stock market's been consistently high. The negative, of course, is everyone's concerned about inflation. But right now you have the Congressional Budget Office saying, you know, that's a transitory effect again of coming out of COVID with supply chain delays and problems. And when it comes -- again, CBO says -- to the GDP, this is incredible, Mike, but they are now predicting 7.4 percent rate of growth this year for the United States. That would be like a 40 year record. We haven't seen that kind of growth.

If it's because of inflation as opposed to a booming economy, then you have a real problem, a pretty scary problem, in fact, if those rising wages are entirely because of inflation. And when you have the federal government literally punishing people for working and rewarding people for not working, that's how you get the sort of -- this sort of dangerous atmosphere where you wind up with rising wages because of inflation. And I really do think that it -- that, you know, you know, come election time, you know, Wall Street can be booming, the -- you know, all kinds of - - you can look at all kinds of numbers that look good to economists or to really wealthy people on Wall Street, but if -- if people are paying massively more at the gas pump and massively more to feed their families at the grocery store, then that -- that tends to be far more damaging than any good that comes from somebody's stock portfolio."

      "speaker": "LUCEY",
      "utterance": "Well, as you were discussing with a previous guest, Mike, yes, the vaccination rates have slowed down. The White House been aggressively, you know, trying to encourage people to get vaccinated. You've seen the president out, the first lady, the vice president, her husband, they are really trying to push -- you know, push people to get vaccinated. But the concern is, obviously, that this is -- that this could create hot spots, this could create areas with lower vaccination rates that could -- that the cases could flare up again and that that could really slow the economic recovery. So you're really hearing sort of dueling messages from the White House right now. They're telling people, you know, America's reopening, people can go to ballparks, they can, you know, go shop, they can go to their favorite restaurants, but to do these things they really need to get vaccinated."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the answer right now is the same answer all along, and that is through information and educating people about -- and openly answering questions, questions that are uncomfortable. Unfortunately, you know, from the beginning of this, the entire thing, especially vaccines, have been politicized. You know, just a year ago, you had now Vice President Kamala Harris out there as an anti-vector trying to poo-poo the idea of getting vaccines because President Trump was the -- truthfully, the only politician out there pressing for these vaccines. So, in that sort of environment, where people feel like all of this has been politicized, and you get in so much trouble, you get shouted down for asking legitimate questions about the vaccine, that is a horrible atmosphere in which to try to promote truthful information about the help of a vaccine."

    {
      "speaker": "LUCEY",
      "utterance": "A couple things here, Mike. I mean, one, obviously, this is a real example of the, you know, the new conservative majority on the court, you know, which was cemented last year with, you know, Justice Amy Coney Barrett being added to the court. So we're really seeing the impact of that block. But also it sends a message. You know, Democrats and voting rights groups are saying, this really sends a message to states, to Republican-led states that are pushing for more voting restrictions, you know, that they -- that it might embolden them. That it shows that they have support in the courts."

      "utterance": "Well, I just ask everyone to remember that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was, I think, 87, Thurgood Marshall, 84. Both replaced by Republican nominees, conservatives on the court, and now we have a 6-3 conservative majority. And so from the Democrats' point of view, you know, it's not about hurting Justice Breyer's feelings. Justice Breyer is a legend. He's had an amazing career on the court. But it's simply saying that, you know, right now you don't want the court to go to 7-2 conservative. You know, Mitch McConnell, the former Senate majority leader, now the Senate minority leader, says that -- says that what he has promised us that if the Republicans regain the majority, he will not allow a Biden nominee to have a hearing. Well, that's unbelievable. You know, I mean he blocked Merrick Garland, an Obama nominee, for nearly a year and now he's saying he's going to, you know, pursue the same strategy. So Democrats are in a dither here. Like Justice Breyer realized the political, polarized reality of the moment."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think -- first, I think Juan summed it up perfectly why they're trying to do it. But I do think it's important to point out that these supposed restrictions on voting in Arizona were designed to keep people from voting where they're not registered to vote and a ban on ballot harvesting. How that is a voting restriction as opposed to protecting elections just baffles me."
