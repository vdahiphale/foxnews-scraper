We saw the briefings. We saw -- I don't think you can get any more transparent than those briefings. Trump said whatever was on his mind. He often quibbled with Fauci. There was -- nothing Fauci said as advice was ever ignored by Trump. In fact, I think Trump was ahead of Fauci when it came to the travel ban on China. And he was on board with the shut down the moment that it happened, and he was willing to sacrifice his entire successful and effective achievements with an economy with the shutdown.  If you listen to the press, he would've thought that Trump wouldn't have done that. I also want to point out in that presser, man, every question is about Trump. I think for the media, Trump's like an old flame who really, really burned you bad, so much so that you just can't let him go.

That's a political action. And I think we need to make a clear distinction because I think right now, you see a lot of people trying to distract or somehow say, oh, this is just like what happened. No, it's not just like what happened at the capital of the United States. This is not an effort to absolutely undermine our democratic processes. These are people who are criminal.

Also, here he is as the newest cast member of the Jersey Shore looking a little overdressed. And Bernie Sanders is also making a little cameo as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Jesse, I sent you one that I love with him on the couch with all of your friends on the set of Friends.",

He's one of those co-workers that plays the field politically and will always end up being on the side of who is ever in charge, which is why he kind of spewed these talking points at the start that seem contradictory to what actually happened. We saw the briefings. We saw -- I don't think you can get any more transparent than those briefings. Trump said whatever was on his mind. He often quibbled with Fauci. There was -- nothing Fauci said as advice was ever ignored by Trump. In fact, I think Trump was ahead of Fauci when it came to the travel ban on China. And he was on board with the shut down the moment that it happened, and he was willing to sacrifice his entire successful and effective achievements with an economy with the shutdown. If you listen to the press, he would've thought that Trump wouldn't have done that. I also want to point out in that presser, man, every question is about Trump. I think for the media, Trump's like an old flame who really, really burned you bad, so much so that you just can't let him go. I bet a hundred bucks, Jesse, people in the White House press briefing room are going to be drunk dialing Trump late at night when they're alone just to hear his voice.

Now, if I were Dr. Fauci, I might have said looking forward here. I'm not going to look backwards. He said that, but then he went the step further and said, but let's be clear. Like, it was obvious that we were out of favor. And I think one of the things that -- if you look back to March, the president's approval ratings really went up. Do you remember when he had the task force there? He was deferring to doctors. He was listening to them."

The other thing that I saw today is Dr. Fauci defending the Trump administration saying there absolutely was a vaccine distribution. But it wasn't just Dr. Fauci. Dr. Redfield of the CDC also said that. So, there's a lot that the country has gone through when it comes to COVID. Dr. Fauci does have a popularity rating that's pretty high in America as people tend to listen to him, want.

And, you know, I think he was a good employee. He was a good scientist. Remember, he works for the National Institutes of Health and he wanted -- he wanted to help President Trump, and he wanted to have President Trump's ear. I think Dr. Birx also was someone later excommunicated, who felt it's best to have a presence with the president of the United States during a health crisis. Now, obviously, the president subsequently brought in other doctors. Let me just leave it there. But he brought in people who were just telling him what he wanted to hear is what it looked like. And Birx and Fauci then got the boot. And so today, to hear him say, you know, \"science and evidence will carry the day,\" I think he is just speaking the truth to you."

And remember, their dissent is patriotic. Yours however is criminal and shall be punished with censorship and deprogramming. However, I just got word that these peaceful protesters in Oregon have already been bailed out by Kamala Harris, Lady Gaga, and Chrissy Teigen, which is great news. Only a few of them are violent, so that's cool. But I really, you know, the thing -- what I find it -- by the way, I'm kidding. That didn't happen. I think the bottom line here is there is a difference in treatment because the Democrats, they picked their mobs, whereas the Republicans, we condemn them equally. We think Antifa is disgusting.

Portland police, of all the cases that they've referred since the spring of last year for prosecution, that about 75 percent of them, the D.A. in Multnomah County has declined to prosecute. So, it's like they -- cases are referred and the D.A. goes, that's not really a crime, when it is."

But I will say that when you see this kind of criminal activity, this kind of anarchist activity taking place under a new president, it indicates it's not political. They're attacking a Democratic headquarters there. So, I think that this is quite different than when you see intentional violence against the United States capital in the midst of certifying an election that has been, you know, stoked by the president himself, President Donald Trump. That's a political action. And I think we need to make a clear distinction because I think right now, you see a lot of people trying to distract or somehow say, oh, this is just like what happened. No, it's not just like what happened at the capital of the United States. This is not an effort to absolutely undermine our democratic processes. These are people who are criminal. These are people who may be anarchists as I say. I don't know, but they should be condemned. They should be prosecuted. I don't think there's any question, but to say that it's somehow equal to what happened at the capital, I think that's an effort to distract and distort."

Also, Juan, only 200 Trump supporters entered the capital out of 75 million. That adds up to .0002 percent of Trump supporters that did anything wrong. I remember during the war on terror when there was a terror attack in all these body parts are flying all over the world, and you guys on the left were always quick to say, you know, you can't link that to Islam.

The Democrats were caught totally flat-footed. They did not think they were going to win those two Georgia Senate runoff races, so they are not prepared. They don't have staff; they don't have any plans in place. They're not ready to go. So, there's that. The other thing is that people like Senator Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell and others are saying, we want to have a discussion and an agreement about filibuster protection now before we agree to anything else. I think that is totally reasonable because it is the bedrock of the whole legislative uh process in the Senate. I don't think that's unreasonable. And I think that Chuck Schumer, look, understandably, he wants to tell McConnell to pound sand because there's a lot of pent-up demand. They think that Mitch McConnell has been this big obstructionist. But the other problem is, they only got 50, plus Kamala Harris in the Senate, so it's going to be very difficult for them to get anything done.

Because it sounds incredibly familiar, Juan, to what happened in January when there should have been everybody in our government focusing on the coronavirus, what was happening in those disturbing videos coming out of China, and there was a hearing going on about this mysterious illness. We were neck-deep in impeachment thanks to the very same people who are obsessing over Trump right now under the guise of unity. And it shows you how -- I mean, how dangerous and phony this unification rhetoric is because it's only unifying against people that they're identifying as evil, right? They're mask they're masquerading their own divisive hate as a unifying process meanwhile, once again, ignoring the coven package and demonizing 74 million people. It's the ever-expanding target of retribution. You start at that bullseye center with Trump, and then you work your way out to staffers, supporters, voters, and now anybody who's not truly in the resistance."

It was about basically anyone who did not kowtow to the left-wing ideology. So, they're coming after you if you don't fall in line and agree with them, number one. Number two, it's about helping people. There's 16 million Americans who are collecting some form of unemployment. I want Nancy Pelosi to stand in front of a camera and actually show some honesty and to speak to them and say, you know what, we're not helping you because I'm addicted to Trump. I can't get away from him so we're going to pursue impeachment rather than the aid. And by the way, they ought to hurry up on the aid because killing the keystone pipeline kills up to ten thousand high-paying union jobs. You rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, that's an extra $1,500 in cost every year to Americans while China still gets to build a coal-fired power plant. So, speaking of kowtow and we've been over for china."

He can go big and bipartisan, that takes about a month and a half, or he goes smaller and partisan by nuking the filibuster, and that could come out quicker. So, you have big and slow, fast and more narrow, one party is happy or both parties happy. You know the drill.

Here's a little tidbit from the innerwebs. Franken Jerk Jim Comey's new book that came out the first week of January, it opened at one percent of the first week sales of his last book.

That's a part of the historical record. They were in the room for coronavirus, for the Mideast peace deals, for the Kim summits. The American people deserve to know that. This isn't the first controversial administration that we've ever had. What about Nixon and Watergate? What about Truman dropped the a-bomber, FDR put the Japanese in internment camps?

And I think conservatives would appreciate that a private business has a right to set its own rules and decide who they want to publish, so I don't -- I don't think there's any question there. I mean, right now you see some of the radio stations setting rules for people and say, you can't say that the election was stolen. Let's stop that. Or you see that corporate donors are saying, they don't want to back people in Congress, politicians, who took part in trying to block the certification of Biden's win as president. So that -- I mean these are decisions being made by private companies and I think everybody respects that. You know, to my mind though, if it was a matter of censoring somebody, I would be totally against it. I don't think it's a matter of censoring.
