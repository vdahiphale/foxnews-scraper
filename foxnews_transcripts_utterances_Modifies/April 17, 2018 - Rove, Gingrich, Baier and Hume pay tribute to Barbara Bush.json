      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We begin this evening as I said with continuing coverage of the passing of First Lady Barbara Bush. The former first lady died today at her home in Houston, as Sean said, at age 92. She was one of only two women in U.S. history to be both the mother and the wife of a U.S. president.   But Barbara Bush was special in so many other ways. She was down to earth and also dignified. She was elegant. And she was admired, and she was loved by Americans and politicians on both sides of the aisle, which doesn't seem possible today. Tributes are pouring in from family, friends, and others, whose lives she touched. Joining us tonight for a look at the legacy of this remarkably gracious and kind woman are Bret Baier, Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove, and Brit Hume. It is great to see all of you tonight on this sad night.  But I want to start with you, Karl Rove. What a life, what a lady. I mean. the tributes from everybody, from Bill Clinton to foreign leaders, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, and with today's politics, it is kind of refreshing all over again to hear how many people loved her so much.",

But I'm sure the authorities in heaven are making sure that everybody is on their best behavior because Mrs. Bush had an expectation that you are capable of doing good things and she would let you know if she felt you were—you could do a little bit more to achieve what she thought was possible from it.  She was—I met her when I was 22-years-old and I have—a smile that could light up a room, a warmth, a respect for everyone, fun to be around, brash, smart, really smart, and capable of, many a time I saw her like needle pointing and you'd think that she was focused on the needle point and then she'd inject into that conversation and you knew she had been paying attention to every single word that you had been saying. I was supposed to have lunch with them two weeks ago today and she went into the hospital on a Monday. And she was a remarkable presence and think about it, advisor to a president, husband, her husband, whom she loved dearly, met him when she was 16-years-old, fell in love with him, married, together for nearly 76-years, married for 73, I mean really ...",

You may remember that moment when she was the first lady of the United States, where she went to the hospital in Washington and held an AIDS baby. This was at a time when a lot of people thought that AIDS could be communicated by simply touching an individual. And so a lot of these babies who were lacking human contact, and she went and did that and it's because she wanted to set an example and she wanted to make it clear that we—this is one of the things, this woman, she may have worn fake pearls and she may have had gray hair, but she had a respect for every single human being in which she came in contact with and expected other people to have that same kind of mutual respect for every one of God's creatures and every one of God's people. And I thought it was a powerful moment when she did that, and emblematic of this great and noble woman who served our country.  She was very patriotic.

That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Now, my friends across the political aisle are cheering the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision today that struck down on vagueness grounds, a federal immigration statute that triggered deportation for individuals convicted of violent crimes. The illegal alien in the case had been arrested for burglary, which both the Obama and Trump DOJ argued should trigger deportation. Why? Since, the defendant's conduct posed a significant risk of violence.  Well Neil Gorsuch, of course the newest Justice of the Court, applied a textualist approach in deciding to join the liberal justices in the majority. Justices Roberts, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy dissented on grounds that the statute's language was plenty clear. But look, setting aside which theory of statutory interpretation is most faithful to the constitution, do any of you wonder why this is an issue at all? I mean, look, anyone here illegally, except that DACA people, is potentially a deportable alien under current law. In other words, if you don't have permission to be here, go home. Well, maybe the government can't deport 12 million people. We hear that all the time. But certainly they could report a lot if they wanted to. But democrats, however, are not interested in enforcing the law. Instead, they're interested in growing their voter rolls. And the Democrats, they don't even recognize victims of illegal alien crime. Now, remember, according to reports, Jamiel Shaw's father said he never received a call from President Obama after he lost his son. But remember, he found time, President Obama, to call that other victim, Sandra Fluke, but I digress.  Governor Jerry 'Mr. Sanctuary' Brown was in Washington today and he was asked about the cities in California rejecting his sanctuary policies. Well, remember, the sanctuary laws forbid state and local police agencies from even notifying the federal government when incarcerated illegals are about to be released onto the streets.",

That is a separate conversation. I am shouting on the television 'get the follow-up in, George,' and the follow-up doesn't come. But give us the number one question that you would have asked if you had the opportunity of Comey.",

I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We begin this evening as I said with continuing coverage of the passing of First Lady Barbara Bush. The former first lady died today at her home in Houston, as Sean said, at age 92. She was one of only two women in U.S. history to be both the mother and the wife of a U.S. president. But Barbara Bush was special in so many other ways. She was down to earth and also dignified. She was elegant. And she was admired, and she was loved by Americans and politicians on both sides of the aisle, which doesn't seem possible today. Tributes are pouring in from family, friends, and others, whose lives she touched. Joining us tonight for a look at the legacy of this remarkably gracious and kind woman are Bret Baier, Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove, and Brit Hume. It is great to see all of you tonight on this sad night. But I want to start with you, Karl Rove. What a life, what a lady. I mean. the tributes from everybody, from Bill Clinton to foreign leaders, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, and with today's politics, it is kind of refreshing all over again to hear how many people loved her so much."

But I'm sure the authorities in heaven are making sure that everybody is on their best behavior because Mrs. Bush had an expectation that you are capable of doing good things and she would let you know if she felt you were—you could do a little bit more to achieve what she thought was possible from it. She was—I met her when I was 22-years-old and I have—a smile that could light up a room, a warmth, a respect for everyone, fun to be around, brash, smart, really smart, and capable of, many a time I saw her like needle pointing and you'd think that she was focused on the needle point and then she'd inject into that conversation and you knew she had been paying attention to every single word that you had been saying. I was supposed to have lunch with them two weeks ago today and she went into the hospital on a Monday. And she was a remarkable presence and think about it, advisor to a president, husband, her husband, whom she loved dearly, met him when she was 16-years-old, fell in love with him, married, together for nearly 76-years, married for 73, I mean really ..."

She is just so fun. She didn't dye her hair; she didn't get a face-lift. She's like, I am who I am. That is so refreshing today. Again, I use the word refreshing, but it's just I love it."

And also though, I think Karl called it right. She was ferocious. I mean she was pleasant, she was nice, she was hard, but in terms of both her husband and her sons, in terms of both Jeb's campaign, George W.'s campaign, there's no question she was going to go all out and she was prepared to reach to every friend she had and she wanted the family to do well and it did, so a remarkable American family."

Today, we're told that H.W. held her hand all day long next to her and that she was surrounded by family and he was right next to her when she left the earth. So I think you're seeing this family rally around each other. It was a big part of their life to be together. She said that it was the most important thing in her life and she gave a lot of commencement addresses. And one of them at Wellesley College said, at the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal.

And she used to say, you know, apropos of her devotion to family, she used to say, when she was first lady, she used to say what happens at your house is more important than what happens in the White House. Not a view often expressed but one that at the time I think was taken well and was very much like her.

You're doing it for free, and everyone said, you bet I'm going to do it for free, no problem. I love the literacy. I think she does not get enough credit for that.

And the focus was, it is your responsibility as a parent or as a friend or a family member to help someone else learn to love to read, and to do so at an early age. And it's remarkable, even today, the effort goes on in a huge fashion. I want to talk though quickly about one other thing. You may remember that moment when she was the first lady of the United States, where she went to the hospital in Washington and held an AIDS baby. This was at a time when a lot of people thought that AIDS could be communicated by simply touching an individual. And so a lot of these babies who were lacking human contact, and she went and did that and it's because she wanted to set an example and she wanted to make it clear that we—this is one of the things, this woman, she may have worn fake pearls and she may have had gray hair, but she had a respect for every single human being in which she came in contact with and expected other people to have that same kind of mutual respect for every one of God's creatures and every one of God's people. And I thought it was a powerful moment when she did that, and emblematic of this great and noble woman who served our country. She was very patriotic. She loved America deeply, and cherished the great values that we have and our freedoms and wanted others to enjoy and respect them as well."

That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Now, my friends across the political aisle are cheering the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision today that struck down on vagueness grounds, a federal immigration statute that triggered deportation for individuals convicted of violent crimes. The illegal alien in the case had been arrested for burglary, which both the Obama and Trump DOJ argued should trigger deportation. Why? Since, the defendant's conduct posed a significant risk of violence. Well Neil Gorsuch, of course the newest Justice of the Court, applied a textualist approach in deciding to join the liberal justices in the majority. Justices Roberts, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy dissented on grounds that the statute's language was plenty clear. But look, setting aside which theory of statutory interpretation is most faithful to the constitution, do any of you wonder why this is an issue at all? I mean, look, anyone here illegally, except that DACA people, is potentially a deportable alien under current law. In other words, if you don't have permission to be here, go home. Well, maybe the government can't deport 12 million people. We hear that all the time. But certainly they could report a lot if they wanted to. But democrats, however, are not interested in enforcing the law. Instead, they're interested in growing their voter rolls. And the Democrats, they don't even recognize victims of illegal alien crime. Now, remember, according to reports, Jamiel Shaw's father said he never received a call from President Obama after he lost his son. But remember, he found time, President Obama, to call that other victim, Sandra Fluke, but I digress. Governor Jerry 'Mr. Sanctuary' Brown was in Washington today and he was asked about the cities in California rejecting his sanctuary policies. Well, remember, the sanctuary laws forbid state and local police agencies from even notifying the federal government when incarcerated illegals are about to be released onto the streets."

Build—what's that supposed to do? Well, regardless of the threat, they might present to the citizens of California. Illegals, they're always welcome, so long as the liberals are in charge there.

And that is the \"Angle.\" Joining us now for reaction is Newt Gingrich, Former Speaker of the House and the creator of the New Defending America Course, which seems entirely appropriate for the subject matter at hand.

And that is what you've seen happen. People in normal, everyday cities are rebelling. Sheriffs are saying they're not going to obey the state law. The entire counties are opting out. And I think it's a good debate because let's just take MS-13, which is an El Salvadorian gang, spread all across America, extraordinarily violent. You look in Fairfax County for example, Virginia, the number of additional murders, rapes, attacks. If the Democrats want to be the party that protects the rights of MS-13 to stay in America and kill people, I think that's a great fall campaign issue."

Comey appointed his close friend, Patrick Fitzgerald, to be an independent investigator at a time when the entire case was a phony case. The CIA said to Valerie Plame was the whole case was about what she outed and who outed her. The CIA said she wasn't a covered person. The CIA Council has said, it did no material damage to the CIA. They knew who had done it. The person who did it was in fact Colin Powell's deputy at the State Department. Patrick Fitzgerald told him to keep his mouth shut. He then locked up by New York Times reporter for 85 days to get her to testify. Scooter finally out of concern for her gave her permission to testify because she said I have proven here, I'm not going to do it.

Comey is such a petty person that he sought to destroy Cheney. Scooter wouldn't turnover and destroy Cheney so they decided to destroy Scooter. I think what he said today is the most despicable language and the biggest falsehood and everybody ought to understand, Scooter Libby is the threat of the future. If they can do this to Scooter Libby, if they can do this to Donald Trump, they can do it to every American. And that's why I'll disclose this. If you read the original statement by Rosenstein, what he sent to the President, which I'm actually publishing tomorrow, and you read what the inspector general said about McCabe, you have to conclude.

Last night, we told you about the shocking fact about the tech giants war on free speech. And tonight, we look at how to fight back, and the first thing to do is to recognize what you are up against. One tactic the left uses to restrict the free flow of information is by ginning up a propaganda war on so-called fake news. Let's bring in reporter Sharyl Attkisson, host of the great Sunday show \"Full Measure\" and the author of the book The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives Control What You See, What You Think, and How You Vote. I'm so happy she is with us. You are the only person at CBS who was ever nice to me. I say this all the time."

      "utterance": "We worked at CBS together years ago. And Sharyl, we are delighted you were with us. So this \"Defending the First\" series we're doing I think is really important because a lot of people out there, they feel like they don't know how to fight back against this. They feel like they are under assault, all these fact-checkers that are out there seem to only check facts in a negative way about Republicans. PolitiFact, I know you know them, they say the GOP lies 32 percent is false, only Democrats only eight percent of the time. Are you finding that the fact-checkers need a fact-checker? SHARYL ATTKISSON, HOST OF \"FULL MEASURE\": I devoted a chapter to looking at this whole idea to shape and control our narrative in many different creative ways, to create what I call an artificial reality online and on the news so that people think that things are true that may not be true or that they are an outlier if they have certain feelings when they may not be. This may be media literacy efforts, it may be called fact-checking, it may be called anti-fake news—"

It's not that simple."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

They are in the midst of some would say the propaganda machine, especially in public schools, a lot of private schools. They are right in it. They're right in the thick of it, and it all skews Democrat. Let's talk about other fact-checkers. There is a now a fact-checker at Univision, and the statistics at Univision are really bad for Republicans. I guess 95 percent of fact checks in January of 2017 to April of this year, 95 percent went against Republicans, zero percent democrat, two percent Republicans and Democrats, three percent nonpartisan. That is the Media Research Center. Univision obviously not a big fan of the president either."

That doesn't mean you can't ever get valuable information from them, but that's usually an effort under a different name by an entity that wants to shape the narratives and shape your opinion."

That is why there was a whole philosophy when it comes to our founding to keep the government out of certain things. Do we really want to invite them and whatever their goals of the day may be to be the ones to decide what we can see and what we should believe and what we can't see?"

If President Obama had arranged this or Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, this would be—this would be all they are talking about. But it's like it's not even happening. It's really incredible. The tariffs, China is bowing out some of these issues that they have never moved on before. That would be covered. But it is almost like these substantive issues where Donald Trump is really making a difference for the country, those are inconvenient facts for this media. Its' got to be Stormy Daniels. It's got to be Cohen; it's got to be Mueller 24/7. That skews the public's mind as well."

'The Wall Street Journal's' Kim Strassel joins us now to share those questions with us. Kimberly, this is going to be so good because what I have been watching Stephanopoulos do this interview that lasted five hours, is there really anyone you would want to interview for five hours, first of all? That is a separate conversation. I am shouting on the television 'get the follow-up in, George,' and the follow-up doesn't come.

This is an organization that exists to smear the reputations of political opponents. Did you look into them? Did you know this history? And did that not color your view of the source who was bringing you this information?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. It says everything about this. If you actually read the full transcript, Comey admits that he claims that he knew that the dossier had been funded by a Democrat aligned group but he didn't know which one. Another question, why on earth did you not? Here comes this man bringing this dossier full of salacious allegations, I understand he had a track record with the FBI, that he had worked with them before, but never for a political operative before, never in an election year. Did you not say, who was actually paying this guy and what is his purpose out there? And he continued to refer throughout his entire interview to Christopher Steele as a credible source when the FBI now knows that he was out, despite FBI orders, talking to the press, blowing their probe, giving out information he had been specifically told not to, and Comey still referred to him as a credible source. There were a million questions that should have been asked about that."

Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, FBI agents who worked both investigations, lovebirds, texting each other, insurance policy, what questions should have been asked?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Basic ones. For instance, is this the kind of behavior that the FBI thinks is appropriate? Is a common behavior to have people sending messages like this? Does it concern you about the political bias? Both of these people were very senior members of the probes into both Clinton and into Trump. And does Comey have any concerns, knowing what they texted to each other? For instance, once they had a conversation about how they shouldn't necessarily send too many agents on to deal with Hillary Clinton because, by the way, she might be the next president and that could be bad. So political decisions were influencing how they handled those probes. Comey should have been asked if he still had confidence in the integrity knowing what he knows now about how the two were conversing about it."
