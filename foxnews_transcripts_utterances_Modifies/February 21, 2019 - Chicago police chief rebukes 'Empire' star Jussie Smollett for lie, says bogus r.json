      "sentences": "You know as a look out into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because that's who really deserves the amount of attention that we've given to this particular incident.  This morning, I come to you not only as the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, but also as a black man who spent his entire life living in the city of Chicago. I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it's been for our city and our nation to come together.  I also know the disparities and I know the history. This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who's in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of the city, and I'm also angry.  I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all. But this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve. Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial homophobic and political language. When that didn't work, Smollett paid $3500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process, and why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked. I only hope that the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did.",

A hoax removes the media's complicity.   No, it was a crime aided and abetted by the activist press who embrace their perfect victim, ignoring all those implausible details. So, Don, no one is interested in eating Smollett's lunch but we'll eat yours and that of the whole consensus media who need a lesson in restraint and resisting its own activist confirmation bias. Lemon has made it no secret that he believes Trump supporters are racist, which is how Smollett portrayed them. So forget Smollett, he was just serving a function for the thirsty press seeking that story. Smollett, an attention addict with an anti-Trump fever, he read the room and saw that it was going to be easy to fool the media.  And he saw all of those sympathizing friends, like Don Lemon, as suckers. They should be pissed off at him. But he couldn't fool the cops or most of us. So if your only lesson is that Smollett will be used as father at this network while missing the fact that he played you then you're as hopeless as we thought. You should have been thrilled that the demand for hate crime exceeds the supply and that you don't means that it will probably happen again. Hey, Emily, you're a prosecutor.

The chief's wrong.   All the analysis shows that there's more attention now to the idea that he lied because it's a conspiracy issue. It's a fraud issue. It's celebrity gossip.

Real hate crimes now are going to be treated with more skepticism, unfortunately, and that's what the police chief said, and I think that's probably one of the biggest results of this. Also, how dumb does Robin Roberts look right now when she went out there, didn't ask him any follow-up questions and let him perform like that? I bet she wish she had that back. Also, think about all the framed jobs and the conspiracy theories which we've seen. All it takes is a little common sense. You talked about it yesterday. There's a bunch of MAGA guys in a polar vortex in Chicago hate criming people. OK. Kavanaugh in high school, was he really participating in drug-fueled orgies?

The other thing though, I really like what Matt Lewis had to write today. I would cite him because I couldn't say it better. He writes for The Daily Beast. He said that the desire for sympathy and the moral authority that comes from being victimized has replaced the desire for admiration or respect for some act of heroism.  So it's like victim chic.

Some of what we learned today that we didn't already knew, while we knew the Smollett was associates with the Osundairo brothers, one of them was a source from whom he would buy the party drug, Molly. We did know that he directed the attack, but he specifically directed the brothers to beat him up, but not too bad. And we've got hints that he intended - from the ABC interview that he intended for the attack to play out in front of a security camera that didn't catch it and his awareness with the attack. We learned from the state's attorney is part of what tipped investigators off to something being fishy. The whole thing went down in 45 seconds. The motive was pay. Smollett didn't think he was getting enough or got enough attention from the threatening letter that went to the Empire studio, so he upped the ante with the attack. Bond is set at $100,000. He posted $10,000. His status with the show is unchanged. His attorney said, he was scheduled to shoot this afternoon.

      "utterance": "You know as a look out into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because that's who really deserves the amount of attention that we've given to this particular incident. This morning, I come to you not only as the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, but also as a black man who spent his entire life living in the city of Chicago. I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it's been for our city and our nation to come together. I also know the disparities and I know the history. This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who's in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of the city, and I'm also angry. I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all. But this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve. Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial homophobic and political language. When that didn't work, Smollett paid $3500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process, and why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked. I only hope that the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did."

A hoax removes the media's complicity. No, it was a crime aided and abetted by the activist press who embrace their perfect victim, ignoring all those implausible details. So, Don, no one is interested in eating Smollett's lunch but we'll eat yours and that of the whole consensus media who need a lesson in restraint and resisting its own activist confirmation bias. Lemon has made it no secret that he believes Trump supporters are racist, which is how Smollett portrayed them. So forget Smollett, he was just serving a function for the thirsty press seeking that story. Smollett, an attention addict with an anti-Trump fever, he read the room and saw that it was going to be easy to fool the media. And he saw all of those sympathizing friends, like Don Lemon, as suckers. They should be pissed off at him. But he couldn't fool the cops or most of us. So if your only lesson is that Smollett will be used as father at this network while missing the fact that he played you then you're as hopeless as we thought. You should have been thrilled that the demand for hate crime exceeds the supply and that you don't means that it will probably happen again. Hey, Emily, you're a prosecutor. What are the legal ramifications of this entire case? Laid it out for us."

I will say this, when the chief said he'd like to see more attention paid to things like the shooting in Chicago, what else, or especially to the -- as much attention to the initial charge as to the finding that this young man lied about it. The chief's wrong. All the analysis shows that there's more attention now to the idea that he lied because it's a conspiracy issue. It's a fraud issue. It's celebrity gossip. There is more -- and don't forget, Donald Trump. Donald Trump has jumped in and said, you know, he was wrong, and it fits in with Donald Trump's attacks on the media, so all the Trump crowd is celebrating this in a way that I --"

Real hate crimes now are going to be treated with more skepticism, unfortunately, and that's what the police chief said, and I think that's probably one of the biggest results of this. Also, how dumb does Robin Roberts look right now when she went out there, didn't ask him any follow-up questions and let him perform like that? I bet she wish she had that back. Also, think about all the framed jobs and the conspiracy theories which we've seen. All it takes is a little common sense. You talked about it yesterday. There's a bunch of MAGA guys in a polar vortex in Chicago hate criming people. OK. Kavanaugh in high school, was he really participating in drug-fueled orgies? Or Covington, let's see -- wait a second, a 16-year-old, 115-pound kid was confronting some adult like the Ku Klux Klan? And now, Donald Trump, it makes you suspicious of the entire Russia investigation. He -- Donald Trump is a Russian asset? Donald Trump is a Russian asset? You don't have any sort of doubt when someone says that? If you don't believe that there is any sort of suspicion when someone says Trump is a Russian asset, you're crazy and you're going to fall for another one of these hoaxes."

The other thing though, I really like what Matt Lewis had to write today. I would cite him because I couldn't say it better. He writes for The Daily Beast. He said that the desire for sympathy and the moral authority that comes from being victimized has replaced the desire for admiration or respect for some act of heroism. So it's like victim chic. If you are a victim, then you're going to get more attention and he knew that. But I do think it's kind of bizarre though. To your point, he was able to fool some at the media, not all."

Some of what we learned today that we didn't already knew, while we knew the Smollett was associates with the Osundairo brothers, one of them was a source from whom he would buy the party drug, Molly. We did know that he directed the attack, but he specifically directed the brothers to beat him up, but not too bad. And we've got hints that he intended - from the ABC interview that he intended for the attack to play out in front of a security camera that didn't catch it and his awareness with the attack. We learned from the state's attorney is part of what tipped investigators off to something being fishy. The whole thing went down in 45 seconds. The motive was pay. Smollett didn't think he was getting enough or got enough attention from the threatening letter that went to the Empire studio, so he upped the ante with the attack. Bond is set at $100,000. He posted $10,000. His status with the show is unchanged. His attorney said, he was scheduled to shoot this afternoon.

Xeno Lopez served as a parachute rigger, an infantryman from 2004 to 2010, then lost his Army Greens when he moved from one part of Bakersfield California to another in 2016. So, he's not the biggest fan of thrift shopping, but his wife wanted to go. So, he goes, he's at Mill Creek antique mall one day when he instantly recognized his missing uniform and the store's owner could tell that that belonged to him and no money was exchanged. They just gave him his uniform back, which was very sweet. They said he was brought to tears with being very grateful for that act of kindness. Also, tonight, tune into Tucker Carlson, where Greg and I will square off on the final exam. We've done this before, I won."
