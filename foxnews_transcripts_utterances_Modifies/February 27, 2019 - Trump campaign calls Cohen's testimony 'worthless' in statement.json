We are not at the brink of war, which is what it seemed like at points during President Trump's first year.

Here we are in 2019, Yongbyon is still here.   But they're saying that maybe they are going to trade it in exchange for either inter-Korean economic activities, which would be a form of sanctions relief, or some other form of sanctions relief.

      "utterance": "Marc, these hearings are always a bit frustrating to watch the questioning not going after the substance a lot of speechifying. Obviously, Republicans decided that they were going to spend their time to reduce or take away any credibility that Cohen had. But your thoughts on their strategy?"

      "utterance": "Taking away Cohen's credibility is low-hanging fruit. That wasn't hard to do. But I'll tell you, they do have a point not just about Cohen's credibility but about the Democrats' credibility in having this hearing. The fact is to have this hearing on this day when you're in Vietnam, the president is in Vietnam meeting with Kim Jong-un, trying to focus on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which is possibly the most important national security issue facing our country, and both sides, everybody, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, has an interest in him succeeding, to have specifically chosen this day in order to have -- it didn't work because of the time difference, but they wanted to have a split screen, it's unpatriotic. And I think Americans saw that."

      "utterance": "President Trump seems more interested in touting his warm relationship with Chairman Kim as an accomplishment in and off itself. President Trump calling a brutal autocratic leader a friend on Twitter is no substitute for actually achieving something for the American people in Hanoi."

      "utterance": "Skepticism from Democrats back in D.C. Here in Hanoi, we're about two plus hours from the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and a lot of optimism from the president, tweeting out \"All false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong-un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization & then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse. I believe that China, Russia, Japan & South Korea will be very helpful!\" With that, let's bring in our panel here in Hanoi. Olivia Enos is Asia Policy Analyst with the Heritage Foundation, and Alex Wayne, White House editor for \"Bloomberg.\" Thank you both for being here. I guess the question I really want to get to before all of this kicks off is what does success look like? Let's start with you, Olivia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLIVIA ENOS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION",
      "utterance": "I think success looks like a return by the Trump administration to a call for what is a legally required definition of denuclearization, that complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program. And I think we need to see those verifiable, tangible, measurable stats, like North Korea permitting IAEA inspections or saying that it will submit to a full data declaration. These would be positive steps that demonstrate that North Korea is sincere. But I think beyond denuclearization, what would be really positive is if President Trump went even a step further and raised some of those thorny human rights issues that are actually directly connected to some of the nuclear challenges and may help the U.S. to achieve some of those objectives."

      "speaker": "WAYNE",
      "utterance": "There are. Olivia reminds me that we haven't even heard this acronym this week, CBID, that they used so much in the first summit. I think Trump deserves some credit for just reducing tensions with North Korea. They're no longer testing nukes, they're no longer flinging missiles over Japan. We are not at the brink of war, which is what it seemed like at points during President Trump's first year. But now I think arms control experts would say that it's time to show some concrete and verifiable progress on the North Korea side so that we have some assurance that this is actually leading toward denuclearization and not an acknowledgment of North Korea as a nuclear power."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I mentioned this last night with another panel, but the hunger for North Korea to be an economic powerhouse, the president referenced it in his tweet, he's talked about it a lot. First summit in Singapore, economically blooming. Second summit here in Vietnam, doing great. Do we have a sense of what Kim's thought process on economics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAYNE",
      "utterance": "I would be surprised if Kim is as eager for western economic development in this country as the president seems to think he is. I think Kim would regard western development, fast food restaurants and U.S. clothing stores and Hollywood movies in North Korea as a threat to his regime. When people start seeing those sorts of luxuries, they then begin to wonder why has the regime been withholding this stuff from us for so long."

    {
      "speaker": "ENOS",
      "utterance": "Regrettably, I think that all of this talk about economic reform with North Korea is really a foreshadowing of the president potentially moving towards some sort of sanctions relief. We've been hearing in the leadup to the summit that perhaps there's going to be some sort of deal where we are trading the closure which has been promised many, many times before, of the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Here we are in 2019, Yongbyon is still here. But they're saying that maybe they are going to trade it in exchange for either inter-Korean economic activities, which would be a form of sanctions relief, or some other form of sanctions relief. And I think this would be a huge mistake because it would represent the Trump administration stepping away from really what has been the only successful pillar of its policy, that maximum pressure strategy."

Many events will be tomorrow for those of you back in the states. We expect to see another historic meeting between President Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un before the president heads back to the states. \"Special Report\" will be sticking around here for another show, wrap everything up that happens, and give you more looks at the local sites here in Hanoi. Sean Hannity has a big interview with the president after the meeting. Tomorrow there's a news conference as well which will be interesting. All things covered.
