In the cases that he he sat in, so far, there's just a month and a half at the end of last term, he voted together with Thomas on every single one.

New calls for gun control in the wake of Las Vegas. I want to take these arguments, if we can, based on what we know, one by one. Let's start with automatic weapons, if Stephen Paddock had automatic weapons, that was illegal under the law, correct? DAVID KOPEL, LAW PROFESSOR & RESEARCH DIRECTOR, INDEPENDENCE INSTITUTE & AUTHOR: Yes. A 1986 federal law said no new automatics can be sold to anyone in the public. Ever since 1934, even owning an old one has been a process that requires about nine months to get federal permission to do so."

John Kerry rose because he was willing to execute President Obama's foreign policy on Iran, with Susan Rice calling shuts. Donald Trump, clearly, does not favor the State Department. He is running foreign policy out of the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. Rex Tillerson is something of an outsider. The problem is, because Trump has non-stop battle going on with the press, any distance perceived between Tillerson and Trump will be elevated and used as a wedge between him and Donald Trump's foreign policy."

So he has got these consultants going through and looking at what the problems are and so forth. Deputy Secretary John Sullivan last week went before the State -- the House Foreign Affairs Committee and said, we're almost done, which is, going to be a good thing.

He has also written all the court's opinions expanding gay rights over the years. Now I, the Cato Institute, we've been filing briefs in support of gay marriage. Now we're supporting the baker or others in private business who don't want to work with gay marriage. Because private businesses are different than the government. For us, it's easy to square that circle. We'll see how Kennedy does. And there's different ways you can slice this case, if you will, whether it's expressive kind of business, with a wedding vender that does a message of some kind, if you accept baking as that, versus non-expressive businesses, like limo drivers or caterers. There's making a contract for a specific type of cake versus willing to sell it off-the-shelf. This will be an explosive case."

They're called fair share fees. But the challengers here are municipal workers out of Chicago and Illinois. Two years ago, in that case, as you mentioned, that was out of California, same issue. They're saying, look, in the public sector, anything unions collectively bargain is a matter of public policy, is a matter of speech, because they're dealing with public financing, they're dealing with education priorities, whether to give tenure protections versus higher salaries, all these sorts of things, and we might not like what the union is supposedly doing in our favor. I think the court is poised to strike down these laws. I think they were two years ago. They will do the same thing now.

I don't know if you will see very many difference in terms of voting patterns. I think Gorsuch is somewhere in between that Scalia and Thomas range, both on the substance and on various juris doctrines. I'm seeing some green shoots, I suppose, from his rulings when he was on the lower court, in terms of not being as deferential, even as Scalia, to government in administrative law, regulatory matters. In the cases that he he sat in, so far, there's just a month and a half at the end of last term, he voted together with Thomas on every single one. And he has been active in terms of questioning and in terms of writing concurrences and dissents. So he is certainly adding a strong voice. We thought maybe losing Scalia, there would be more time for the advocates to talk, but we haven't seen that.

And Trump has put them in a very prominent position, Dan, on vetting judicial nominees. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes. I think it is had very positive effect. If there's any criticism we've heard it's that there could be more nominees that are from the Law and Economics School, which is applies economic rationality to the law. In the way that, say, the very famous judge, Richard Pozner, of the Seventh Circuit, just retired. Pozner was one of the godfathers of law and economics. Perhaps over time, we'll see more of that introduced in the nominees."

That is where they like to go and ram through things they can't get through any democratic legislature in the states or at the federal level. So it is very important. They will come back to rule on things that Donald Trump does at president. But it is something we understand. When I was in the Bush White House, they understood the process and the kind of nominees. It is one area where Republicans really do have their act together. I just say one last thing. The Supreme Court has a busy docket, some really important cases. And I think at the end of the year, we're all going to owe Mitch McConnell a huge thank you for getting Neil Gorsuch on there instead of Merrick Garland."

Nor would it be good for Puerto Rico, because Puerto Rico will need capital to rebuild and need access to the private markets, and it will not do that if it defaults and wipes away all of the debt. Plus, keep in mind, about 75 percent of that debt is held by moms and pops on the mainland, who are -- who own Puerto Rican debt through mutual funds, and they're pensioners."
