In the wake of one of the biggest scandals involving money and power and privilege at the most prestigious American universities, questions are now being raised about whether everyone is kind of getting scammed.  Those who play by the rules and get into college off and just see the costs go up and up every year. And they graduate with a mountain of debt that can hold them back in every way.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And tonight, this is “The Story.”  The president has proposed one answer. New limits on the amount of money that families can borrow for college. But a prior president's head of the Office of Management and Budget is a cost cutter from way back. He earned the nickname, The Blade, in his days in the Bush White House. He is now the president at Purdue University. He has frozen tuition costs during his tenure. He gives students a very unique way to pay off their debt after they leave. He's even brought Amazon to campus which has dramatically lowered exorbitant textbook costs by 30 percent. Earlier, I spoke with the man at the Wall Street Journal called, the most innovative university president in America today. Former governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, I asked him about what he is doing.",

We've promised, at least, two more. And over that time, we have reduced the cost of room board and books.   So, it will be less expensive to attend Purdue in 2021 in nominal unadjusted dollars than it was in 2012. Consequently, student debt is falling and a record percentage of our students left last year with zero debt.",

We, Purdue, put up the first money because we believe in being accountable. And we believe and we know that our students are going to do well.

That is similar to the charges that landed Paul Manafort in prison although his charges were far broader than the ones that were aware of right now with regard to Greg Craig. So this as there are some big exits from the Mueller team that raised a lot of questions and also a trove of just- released documents on the Michael Cohen warrant that showed that the investigation started far truer than we knew.

These heavily redacted court records show the investigation into Michael Cohen began nearly a year before the FBI raided his New York business and dwellings in April 2018. The special counsel requested and obtained multiple warrants for Cohen's e- mails that cover correspondence during the presidential election. The filing runs into the hundreds of pages and 19 are completely blacked out or redacted with the heading \"illegal campaign contribution scheme\" underlying how the President's greatest legal exposure may be in the Southern District of New York and totally unrelated to Russia collusion.  Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress as well as multiple financial crimes including Campaign Finance Violations after two women were paid to remain silent about alleged affairs prior to the presidential election. President Trump denies their allegations. The unsealed records today show federal investigators also wanted historical and future location data for Cohen's iPhones to confirm from where he sent and received e-mails. In April 2018, the FBI sought and obtained authority to use what's called an electronic technique known as triggerfish. The April 2018 timeline may be significant because Cohen testified that he was instructed not to discuss conversations that occurred after the FBI raid.",

But it happened 10 years ago. So, you know, it's interesting that we're still hearing about this, because what we're getting now is more victims coming forward or alleged victims, I should say. The case possibly be reopened? Because he only served 13 months in jail. The U.S. attorney at that time, his name is Alex Acosta. You might know that name. He's the head of Department of Labor -- might have screwed up in the way he handled the case, a judge essentially came out and said that. We have this all in the piece. And lo and behold there's now new questions we've uncovered it about what are the reasons why people thought he got off so lightly. And that was that he helped -- he helped the government to prosecute Wall Street cases. What we found and we spoke to many people on this, about a dozen, we spoke to his lawyers. I spoke to the former U.S. attorneys, we have people on the record is that Jeffrey Epstein never helped in the prosecution of Wall Street. So that raises the question, why did he get just 13 months in jail, it was actually 15 months that he -- excuse me, 18 months and it was cut down for good behavior on 13. Why did that happen? And people are going to demand answers to that. And I'll tell you, there are two rationales to this, Martha, and we kind of address this in the story. One rationale is that the U.S. attorney at that time, again, Mr. Acosta, we've reached out to him, he had no comment but he basically caved. He saw the high-profile legal team, Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, you name it, a lot of top lawyers and he said listen, I don't want to go against them, let's just cut a deal right now, he blinked. The other thing is, and you have to, and I know I'm going to get a little bit of pushback on this is that they really didn't have the case.

In the wake of one of the biggest scandals involving money and power and privilege at the most prestigious American universities, questions are now being raised about whether everyone is kind of getting scammed. Those who play by the rules and get into college off and just see the costs go up and up every year. And they graduate with a mountain of debt that can hold them back in every way. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And tonight, this is “The Story.” The president has proposed one answer. New limits on the amount of money that families can borrow for college. But a prior president's head of the Office of Management and Budget is a cost cutter from way back. He earned the nickname, The Blade, in his days in the Bush White House. He is now the president at Purdue University. He has frozen tuition costs during his tenure. He gives students a very unique way to pay off their debt after they leave. He's even brought Amazon to campus which has dramatically lowered exorbitant textbook costs by 30 percent. Earlier, I spoke with the man at the Wall Street Journal called, the most innovative university president in America today. Former governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, I asked him about what he is doing."

We've promised, at least, two more. And over that time, we have reduced the cost of room board and books. So, it will be less expensive to attend Purdue in 2021 in nominal unadjusted dollars than it was in 2012. Consequently, student debt is falling and a record percentage of our students left last year with zero debt."

An Income Share Agreement is simply a contract in which the student after leaving for a fixed number of years at a fixed percentage, three percent, five percent, six percent of whatever their income is, pays back the investor that way. We, Purdue, put up the first money because we believe in being accountable. And we believe and we know that our students are going to do well. But the essence of an Income Share Agreement is it's not debt and the risk shifts entirely from the student. The risk of a slow start to a career, for instance, shifts entirely from the student to the investor."

It's not a racket, it's an extraordinarily important asset to America or higher ed institutions are still an area of competitive advantage. But there are comparisons to healthcare. I think there -- which is the business I was in for a very long time. And there -- to me they're inescapable. You have a product which is deemed a necessity. Just got to have that college degree. You have a total pricing power, the buyer cannot tell what a high-quality education is. And, in fact, buyers in the past of -- in the absence of any other evidence have used the sticker price as a proxy."

And so, we've seen it in healthcare, we've seen it in education. It's not an accident that the only things that have gone up faster in the American economy for the last two or three decades -- faster than healthcare, are college tuition, college room and board, and college books."

Well, I agree 100 percent with Juan. And look, what's at stake here is the American dream, literally.

I noticed that when we talk about a lot of the money from the federal government for student loans, a surprising amount, Martha, goes to people who are going to these schools that pop up online. Because they want to be a nurse, or they want to learn how to be a mechanic. And the schools are not prepared to help them with remediation from the fact that they didn't get a good education, sufficient education on the elementary and secondary level to complete it. So, they leave school, they're not the nurse, they're not the mechanic, but they have the debt."

These heavily redacted court records show the investigation into Michael Cohen began nearly a year before the FBI raided his New York business and dwellings in April 2018. The special counsel requested and obtained multiple warrants for Cohen's e- mails that cover correspondence during the presidential election. The filing runs into the hundreds of pages and 19 are completely blacked out or redacted with the heading \"illegal campaign contribution scheme\" underlying how the President's greatest legal exposure may be in the Southern District of New York and totally unrelated to Russia collusion. Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress as well as multiple financial crimes including Campaign Finance Violations after two women were paid to remain silent about alleged affairs prior to the presidential election. President Trump denies their allegations. The unsealed records today show federal investigators also wanted historical and future location data for Cohen's iPhones to confirm from where he sent and received e-mails. In April 2018, the FBI sought and obtained authority to use what's called an electronic technique known as triggerfish. The April 2018 timeline may be significant because Cohen testified that he was instructed not to discuss conversations that occurred after the FBI raid."

So the fact that he's showing these documents and this information from the dossier to these individuals before the investigation even got underway I think it is something that we need to keep a close eye on. I want to ask you another reason and this is about Rod Rosenstein because I thought this was very interesting today. We learned that he will not be leaving. Originally, he was going to leave the Department of Justice in the Deputy Attorney General position mid-March. But now he's going to stick around. And the word is that he is sticking around to absorb the punches from the Mueller investigation if need be. What do you make of that?"

Don't think that I, Bill Barr, the very able Attorney General have come in sort of a wrecking ball. So rest easy. Allow the process to run. And when you think of the alternative, if Bill Barr come in and said Rod, it's time for you to pack up. There are all kinds of questions about you and some suspicions and so forth."

But it happened 10 years ago. So, you know, it's interesting that we're still hearing about this, because what we're getting now is more victims coming forward or alleged victims, I should say. The case possibly be reopened? Because he only served 13 months in jail. The U.S. attorney at that time, his name is Alex Acosta. You might know that name. He's the head of Department of Labor -- might have screwed up in the way he handled the case, a judge essentially came out and said that. We have this all in the piece. And lo and behold there's now new questions we've uncovered it about what are the reasons why people thought he got off so lightly. And that was that he helped -- he helped the government to prosecute Wall Street cases. What we found and we spoke to many people on this, about a dozen, we spoke to his lawyers. I spoke to the former U.S. attorneys, we have people on the record is that Jeffrey Epstein never helped in the prosecution of Wall Street. So that raises the question, why did he get just 13 months in jail, it was actually 15 months that he -- excuse me, 18 months and it was cut down for good behavior on 13. Why did that happen? And people are going to demand answers to that. And I'll tell you, there are two rationales to this, Martha, and we kind of address this in the story. One rationale is that the U.S. attorney at that time, again, Mr. Acosta, we've reached out to him, he had no comment but he basically caved. He saw the high-profile legal team, Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, you name it, a lot of top lawyers and he said listen, I don't want to go against them, let's just cut a deal right now, he blinked. The other thing is, and you have to, and I know I'm going to get a little bit of pushback on this is that they really didn't have the case. That the alleged victims were not good witnesses, that you know, he pleaded guilty, I believe to one count of prostitution and one count of child prostitution even though there are many, many more allegations and that they just did not stand up in --"

And that would be the easiest way to go about this. If they want to -- we're trying to get to discovery if they can show that they are not being biased I'll be glad to drop the lawsuit. But the fact of the matter is they have been very biased in my opinion. And the point that we're trying to make here is they're content developers. So, they are regulating so much. They're the main way that people get their news in this country. It's how a lot of the journalists spread their news around. It's everybody is on Twitter today. So, just the fact that they're saying we don't have bias, they are admitting there that they are content developers and that's really what this case is all about."

What I would say, Martha, is let's just switch roles here. If somebody multiple people had said that you had done a lot of really bad things and it started impacting your contract with Fox, you're a public figure, I'm a public figure. Essentially what they're saying is it doesn't matter, you and I -- you nor I have any recourse at all. And so, I don't think that's right. And look, we want to get to the discovery process. There is no question that, you know, not only I've been defamed, it's been multiple times, hundreds and thousands of times."

And you know, I guess what I'm getting at is that I think everybody recognizes that these organizations, these social media organizations have an enormous amount of power in modern society. So, it's the goal of your suit to sort of, you know, open up the conversation and to push back at them to sort of create a system where's a there is a little bit more accountability on their part. Is that your goal?"

Either they are going to admit that they're content developers or they need to stop being content developers and just be an actual public square so I can exercise my first amendment rights. Secondly, the people that they are allowing to defame me, they are political operatives. We have no idea if they're associated with anything to do with the Russia investigation that we led because a lot of what they were doing was trying to obstruct our investigation into what Russia did in the 2016 election. So, we want the find out exactly who these people are that have defamed and slandered me --"
