As we get ready for the imminent release now of the inspector general's report on the origins of the Russia probe, a new bombshell as we learn now that the inspector general has another surprise first.  He will be releasing, reports say, a separate assessment on the actions of fired FBI director James Comey. Specifically, with regard to his riding and then leaking memos to the press.  Comey himself revealed his action and thinking in this attention-grabbing moment back in the summer of 2017.",

And so, now, you have Mr. Comey, again releasing potentially classified information out into the public square. But remember, the Department of Justice wouldn't prosecute Clinton and anybody else. And so, the big key question, the seminal question for the Department of Justice which is really a shift in the last 24 months, are they going to prosecute the mishandling of classified information or sealed documents? It looks like the answer is no.  But what is -- what Mr. Comey has done is -- in the Department of Justice, is try to prosecute people like Flynn and Papadopoulos for lying to prosecutors.

We've got an unemployment rate that's basically as low as it's been since the 1960s, across all demographic groups, and you've got jobs being created, in the manufacturing sector, over half a million jobs in the last two years. You've also got wage growth going up not only for white-collar workers, but for blue-collar workers. It's that means that people have more money in their pockets. And you see some of that manifested in greater saving, greater spending, and still really strong numbers and consumer confidence. So I do think some of that is overblown.

I think where you're really seeing the issues right now in terms of sentiment is that there are a bunch of banks that are running about up to a 33 percent chance of going into recession, you have contractions in manufacturing and business investment, the trade deficit and the fear of a trade war and what that will do to the American economy when we know that individual taxpayers are the ones bearing the brunt of those tariffs. Those are things that make people economically pessimistic. I'm not in the Bill Maher camp here, but when the president says continually, you know, this is why I'm on Twitter, look at my Twitter account to know what I'm thinking what I'm doing.

Ajjawi told The Harvard Crimson that when he arrived at Boston Logan Airport last Friday night, he was questioned by immigration agents for eight hours. And when they checked his social media history, they found that people on his friend's list had posted political points of view that opposed the United States. And now free speech and immigration groups are crying foul, saying, it's unfair to blame the student for things his friends said. Again, we don't know if Ajjawi's allegations are accurate or unchallenged because Customs and Border Protection isn't allowed to comment on individual immigration cases. We have called and emailed CBP a number of times and there has been no response beyond saying that Ismail Ajjawi was deemed inadmissible, quoting here, \"Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellanies grounds.\" It's a long list. But CBP adds there are multiple layers of review before admission is denied. Meantime, Harvard is now working closely with Ajjawi's family and the non-profit that awarded him the scholarship, and they hope to get him into school before classes begin next week. We should note just a few months ago, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying that foreign scholars are increasingly getting postponements and disruptions for what traditionally had been routine immigration procedures.

This is the complaint that was actually filed earlier today, the Minneapolis-based congresswoman accused of having an affair with a married political consultant based right here in Washington. Congresswoman Omar, also married, and the wife of the political consultant came forward alleging the affair. Now, the woman came forward this week alleging that her husband, Tim Mynett, you see him right there, the man who worked on Omar's 2018 campaign, was having an affair with the congresswoman. The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative leaning non-profit government watchdog, filed a formal complaint about Omar with the Federal Election Commission just this morning, arguing that she violated a 1971 law. I took a look at that complaint today. The group alleges that Omar's campaign paid Mynett's company, E Street Group, thousands of dollars to cover travel expenses. According to the filing, Ilhan for Congress paid the group north of $21,000 for travel from April to June of this year. Those expenses were not itemized in the proper way. We got a response from counsel that apparently is representing both E Street and Omar's campaign. I want to read part of it, quote, \"Any accusation that our clients acted to skirt the law in any way is absolutely false and completely unfounded. The complaint is nothing more than blustering to attempt to create the appearance of legal jeopardy, when there is none. The parties have at all times complied with federal campaign finance law.\" FEC rules do not allow candidates or sitting members of Congress to use campaign funds to pay for personal travel. If they do, personal funds must be used to reimburse the campaign. We will continue to follow this one. Martha, back to you.",

Vance wrote the blockbuster bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" about his roots, growing up poor in Appalachia, an area riddled with drug addiction and instability, as one review put it, but he was pushed by his loving grandmother to keep up his studies and eventually made it out of his deeply dire circumstances. In fact, he made it to Ohio State and then all the way to Yale Law School. He's clear-eyed in the book in his assessment of living on welfare and the relentless poverty cycle, and argues that he knows there's a way out through hard work because he says he found it. The film, big movie coming out in 2020, will start Amy Adams. So this is Vance with his wife, whom he met in law school. And together, they have a little boy named Ewan. Vance is a speaker. He is a commentator. In a recent speech, he said something that got the attention of an editorial writer at The Washington Post with this headline: \"How white nationalists aligned themselves with the antiabortion movement.\" The writer used this line from Vance's speech to suggest that white nationalists are pro-life and that J.D. Vance is a mainstream connection to that because he was arguing. She said that our population is declining and therefore white nationalism, as I said, is now main stream and that populating the earth with more white people was the goal of what he said. \"Our people aren't having enough children to replace themselves,\" he said. \"That should bother us.\" So this caused a big hullabaloo. The editor later took the quote out of the piece, noting that Vance probably meant our people, meaning Americans, not white people. Essentially, when that piece came out of the article, the editorial, it kind of caused the premise that it was written about to collapse. Here now, Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor. Good to see you tonight, governor. It's a pretty tenuous line to draw in this editorial, and yet that's the way it was done. Sort of brandishing him with this label and connecting him to white nationalists because he suggested that the population is on the decline and it needed to be replaced. What do you think about all of this?",

It's as ridiculous as saying that we found a suicide bomber who likes peanut butter. There were some democratic candidates for president who like peanut butter. Therefore, they are all suicide bombers. That's an outrageous lie. It's just as outrageous to say something about J.D. Vance and try to attach this to white supremacy. It really was absurd.

Just last couple images, we are getting some indication that it is now going through a strengthening process. The storm in the last couple days was in the north-eastern Caribbean. Martha, that's kind of a dead zone for hurricanes. Oftentimes, it breaks apart or at least it can't strengthen. It didn't happen. It held itself together, strengthened a little bit. Now, it's heading toward the Bahamas. Conditions are much more favorable for strengthening of the storm now. Because of that, we have the official guidance. In fact, most of our major model guidance brings it to major hurricane status. We will see some fluctuations if there is Category 2, 3, 4. We can't really say what it will be at that point it makes landfall. But we should have a very significant hurricane somewhere along the Florida coast. It could be still Georgia and the Carolinas. But most of our model guidance is coming into better agreement that it is a Florida first storm. One thing we are really concerned about is if this hits directly into Florida, stay somewhere in that central coastline, I can't say exactly where, but then potentially pulls back in towards the gulf. The water in the gulf is incredibly warm. We could be having this as a major hurricane on the coast of Florida, go back into the gulf, increase back to a major hurricane, make another landfall again, somewhere on the Florida panhandle, over towards Louisiana, the storm we are probably be talking about for about the next eight to nine days, so get ready.

And so, the big key question, the seminal question for the Department of Justice which is really a shift in the last 24 months, are they going to prosecute the mishandling of classified information or sealed documents?

And started taking notes on his discussions with the president. Then, he made it perfectly clear. He released some of that information to the press, found a way to get that out because he wanted to provoke a special counsel. Is there anything wrong with that?"

But the question is, are they going to prosecute people for lying to cut -- to federal investigators? That's why the McCabe part of this is so critical. And so, if this news is correct that this report on Comey is coming, it does open up this lane to say, what are we going to do with Mr. McCabe?"

They work for the President of the United States. It was the same James Comey who said, he doesn't do sneaky stuff, that he doesn't do leaking, he doesn't do -- he does all of those things.

And I think one of the things it's also going to lay bare once you hear the story of Comey and McCabe told together is that there was a culture of leaking in the -- in the senior offices at the FBI that really - - was out of control. And these folks were running their own plays, they were not -- they did not believe that they were in the chain of command at the Department of Justice. And, you know, Jim is really demonstrating why he was fired, quite frankly."

And I think, you know, this the inspector general report, both about Jim and about the origins of the investigation together with what we expect to happen to Andy McCabe, in the coming days.

He says that it, it really looks like the writing is on the wall that Andrew McCabe will be prosecuted because he says there's no other reason for that meeting between his top-level attorneys and the Department of Justice other than, you know, a last-ditch effort to sort of say, look, there is a way to back away from this. Is that you're -- do you agree with that?"

And what I know having been both the acting attorney general and chief of staff, and a U.S. attorney is that there is something that sophisticated defense lawyers know as a -- was someone's a dag appeal or a deputy attorney general appeal. Where if you disagree with the U.S. Attorney's Office, in this case, the district of the District of Columbia Jesse Liu was the attorney, if you disagree with their decision, sometimes you can get a hearing or an audience with the deputy attorney general to lay out your case as to why your client shouldn't be charged. I have not seen a dag appeal be successful, I have seen them many times with again, with sophisticated defense lawyers, but this is usually when somebody is eminently going to be charged, they try to get to the deputy attorney general and plead their case."

      "speaker": "WILLEMS",

A lot of this is due to the President's policy, to the tax cuts to the deregulation, but some of the numbers that you put up there are extremely telling. I mean, let's look at people working. We've got an unemployment rate that's basically as low as it's been since the 1960s, across all demographic groups, and you've got jobs being created, in the manufacturing sector, over half a million jobs in the last two years. You've also got wage growth going up not only for white-collar workers, but for blue-collar workers. It's that means that people have more money in their pockets. And you see some of that manifested in greater saving, greater spending, and still really strong numbers and consumer confidence. So I do think some of that is overblown. You know, that said, the administration always needs to be vigilant, always needs to be thinking about ways that continue to improve the economy. And you know, there's a lot of things that they can do --"

It went from 3.2 I think down into the two range. He thinks that's the feds' fault. Other people point to these trade tensions, that that is what is sort of cooling the heels of this very hot economy right now. That's something that you worked on very closely. Is there any hope that the trade issue gets resolved in a way that eases these recession fears?"

We are in a global economy and these trade issues are part of what is going to help our economy continue to grow, or to go in a different direction. And what I was going to say is, I think one of the most important things that we can do is Democrats and Republicans need to get together and pass the USMCA agreement. I think that is something that could be very positive for our economy. It's something that's predicted to create almost 200,000 jobs in the United States, a lot of jobs in the automotive sector, and it really hits all the major democratic priorities on labor and environment and things like that."

The President still the only area in which he's in the -- in the positive area in terms of managing is the economy, not immigration, not health care. So you pointed out the consumer competence number is very good, it dipped a little over the last month. I think where you're really seeing the issues right now in terms of sentiment is that there are a bunch of banks that are running about up to a 33 percent chance of going into recession, you have contractions in manufacturing and business investment, the trade deficit and the fear of a trade war and what that will do to the American economy when we know that individual taxpayers are the ones bearing the brunt of those tariffs. Those are things that make people economically pessimistic. I'm not in the Bill Maher camp here, but when the president says continually, you know, this is why I'm on Twitter, look at my Twitter account to know what I'm thinking what I'm doing. If you read his Twitter account on Friday, which was completely schizophrenic going after Jay Powell starting -- thank you, Charlie, for the little chuckle there. You know, I mean, President Xi --"

President Trump is unique in many ways, but he's not first president to go after the Fed chair, not even -- the saintly Ronald Reagan did it all, often through surrogates, but he did it when Paul Volcker had rates at very high levels. Listen, I'll say this. You know, I can't tell you where the -- where the economy is going. No one really knows whether the tax cuts, deregulation will sort of overwhelm any of the trade concerns. People might be reacting fundamentally to the markets. The markets are going nuts right now. The reason why both the bond and the stock market, because investors are having a quarrel. They don't know whether we're going into reception -- recession and they are trading based on some thinks that we are some think we're not. And that's kind of where we are now. But I will say this.

You know, your other takeaway from the polls here, because they've had the President down against every major Democratic candidate in this Quinnipiac poll, very difficult time with women voters and with black voters and Biden's going to feel happy about this poll compared to the Monmouth one which had him you know, losing ground."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",

Their head has even published a note saying this is clearly an outlier. We've had three national polls since then that show us back to normal with Biden up about even 12, 13 points. But the 16 point edge and the head to head with President Trump certainly has the Biden camp smiling there, and he's almost at 50 percent with African American voters. I can't emphasize enough. How important is that people consider the fact that the road to the Democratic nomination and to victory in 2020, runs through communities of color for the Democratic Party. And Elizabeth Warren is surging, but she has not surging with that community and you can't get there without it."

They keep them for 12 months, and then they go back on it. It doesn't work.\" These are really practical things that could be done with this money. Is that going to happen?"

And the first is going to be exactly that, treatment programs. Something that people don't really understand about opioids is a 28-day program doesn't do anything. And people who don't have health insurance might not even get 28 days. The groups that are putting out actual good programs right now, they are running one to two-year long-term inpatient programs. That takes a lot of money. But you have to balance that against the fact that communities that are hit with this problem, they spent the last 20 years, they got unfunded mandates to carry Narcan, they had the higher more first responders, they had to increase their police force, they had to hire more attorneys and prosecutors --"

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. So far, all the information of the story is coming from one source, the student himself, 17-year-old Ismail Ajjawi, a Palestinian raised in Lebanon. Ajjawi told The Harvard Crimson that when he arrived at Boston Logan Airport last Friday night, he was questioned by immigration agents for eight hours. And when they checked his social media history, they found that people on his friend's list had posted political points of view that opposed the United States. And now free speech and immigration groups are crying foul, saying, it's unfair to blame the student for things his friends said. Again, we don't know if Ajjawi's allegations are accurate or unchallenged because Customs and Border Protection isn't allowed to comment on individual immigration cases. We have called and emailed CBP a number of times and there has been no response beyond saying that Ismail Ajjawi was deemed inadmissible, quoting here, \"Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellanies grounds.\" It's a long list. But CBP adds there are multiple layers of review before admission is denied. Meantime, Harvard is now working closely with Ajjawi's family and the non-profit that awarded him the scholarship, and they hope to get him into school before classes begin next week. We should note just a few months ago, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying that foreign scholars are increasingly getting postponements and disruptions for what traditionally had been routine immigration procedures.

      "speaker": "DAVID SPUNT, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha, good evening. This is the complaint that was actually filed earlier today, the Minneapolis-based congresswoman accused of having an affair with a married political consultant based right here in Washington. Congresswoman Omar, also married, and the wife of the political consultant came forward alleging the affair. Now, the woman came forward this week alleging that her husband, Tim Mynett, you see him right there, the man who worked on Omar's 2018 campaign, was having an affair with the congresswoman. The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative leaning non-profit government watchdog, filed a formal complaint about Omar with the Federal Election Commission just this morning, arguing that she violated a 1971 law. I took a look at that complaint today. The group alleges that Omar's campaign paid Mynett's company, E Street Group, thousands of dollars to cover travel expenses. According to the filing, Ilhan for Congress paid the group north of $21,000 for travel from April to June of this year. Those expenses were not itemized in the proper way. We got a response from counsel that apparently is representing both E Street and Omar's campaign. I want to read part of it, quote, \"Any accusation that our clients acted to skirt the law in any way is absolutely false and completely unfounded. The complaint is nothing more than blustering to attempt to create the appearance of legal jeopardy, when there is none. The parties have at all times complied with federal campaign finance law.\" FEC rules do not allow candidates or sitting members of Congress to use campaign funds to pay for personal travel. If they do, personal funds must be used to reimburse the campaign. We will continue to follow this one. Martha, back to you."

Vance wrote the blockbuster bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" about his roots, growing up poor in Appalachia, an area riddled with drug addiction and instability, as one review put it, but he was pushed by his loving grandmother to keep up his studies and eventually made it out of his deeply dire circumstances. In fact, he made it to Ohio State and then all the way to Yale Law School. He's clear-eyed in the book in his assessment of living on welfare and the relentless poverty cycle, and argues that he knows there's a way out through hard work because he says he found it. The film, big movie coming out in 2020, will start Amy Adams."

      "speaker": "So this is Vance with his wife, whom he met in law school. And together, they have a little boy named Ewan. Vance is a speaker. He is a commentator. In a recent speech, he said something that got the attention of an editorial writer at The Washington Post with this headline",
      "utterance": "\"How white nationalists aligned themselves with the antiabortion movement.\" The writer used this line from Vance's speech to suggest that white nationalists are pro-life and that J.D. Vance is a mainstream connection to that because he was arguing. She said that our population is declining and therefore white nationalism, as I said, is now main stream and that populating the earth with more white people was the goal of what he said. \"Our people aren't having enough children to replace themselves,\" he said. \"That should bother us.\" So this caused a big hullabaloo. The editor later took the quote out of the piece, noting that Vance probably meant our people, meaning Americans, not white people. Essentially, when that piece came out of the article, the editorial, it kind of caused the premise that it was written about to collapse. Here now, Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor. Good to see you tonight, governor. It's a pretty tenuous line to draw in this editorial, and yet that's the way it was done. Sort of brandishing him with this label and connecting him to white nationalists because he suggested that the population is on the decline and it needed to be replaced. What do you think about all of this?"

It's a good thing they finally took it down and took away the smear job on J.D. Vance, which was just outrageous. It's kind of like saying, OK, J.D. Vance is pro-life, somewhere we found a white supremacist who is pro-life. Therefore, J.D. Vance must be a white supremacist. It's as ridiculous as saying that we found a suicide bomber who likes peanut butter. There were some democratic candidates for president who like peanut butter. Therefore, they are all suicide bombers. That's an outrageous lie. It's just as outrageous to say something about J.D. Vance and try to attach this to white supremacy."

But had it gone over Puerto Rico, there are a lot of mountains there and that can oftentimes can rip a storm apart. It stayed overwater, did not rip the storm apart at all. Just last couple images, we are getting some indication that it is now going through a strengthening process. The storm in the last couple days was in the north-eastern Caribbean. Martha, that's kind of a dead zone for hurricanes. Oftentimes, it breaks apart or at least it can't strengthen. It didn't happen. It held itself together, strengthened a little bit. Now, it's heading toward the Bahamas. Conditions are much more favorable for strengthening of the storm now. Because of that, we have the official guidance. In fact, most of our major model guidance brings it to major hurricane status. We will see some fluctuations if there is Category 2, 3, 4. We can't really say what it will be at that point it makes landfall. But we should have a very significant hurricane somewhere along the Florida coast. It could be still Georgia and the Carolinas. But most of our model guidance is coming into better agreement that it is a Florida first storm. One thing we are really concerned about is if this hits directly into Florida, stay somewhere in that central coastline, I can't say exactly where, but then potentially pulls back in towards the gulf. The water in the gulf is incredibly warm. We could be having this as a major hurricane on the coast of Florida, go back into the gulf, increase back to a major hurricane, make another landfall again, somewhere on the Florida panhandle, over towards Louisiana, the storm we are probably be talking about for about the next eight to nine days, so get ready.
