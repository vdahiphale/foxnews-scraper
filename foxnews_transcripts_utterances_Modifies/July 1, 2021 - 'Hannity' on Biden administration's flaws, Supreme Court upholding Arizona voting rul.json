Folks, that's a huge story. These face diapers on your kids aren't doing any good. Tucker, thanks again.  Welcome to \"Hannity\".  I'm Dan Bongino, in tonight for Sean.  Tonight, we are tracking multiple breaking stories. The witch hunt against President Trump unfortunately continues. Prosecutors now are targeting the Trump Organization. This as Hunter Biden and his father Joe continue to get a free pass and largely ignored and get away with whatever they want.  Miranda Devine will be here with another shocking story involving Hunter's hard drive from Hades. Also tonight, a huge win in the Supreme Court for the integrity of our elections. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich will be here with more on their big victory against the ballot harvesters at the DNC.  But first, when you're in the end of another long week of Joe Biden, and per usual, the president is once again malfunctioning in public. Check this out.",

Her tenure as VP has been a debacle, a disaster. According to a new political report, 22 staffers are no speaking out about the dysfunction inside the vice president's office. It's only been six months, six months, that's it. And they're already complaining -- backstabbing, disorganization, toxic behavior.  One Harris staffer called it a, quote, abusive environment. Another said it was an unhealthy workplace where people are treated like you can fill in the blank there, folks. And it's not roses, by the way. According to these whistle-blowers, it all starts at the top, where less than six months into this administration, and it's already not going well.  Now, President Trump appears poised to potentially make some major political waves. Check this out.",

And I think back to New York City where Mayor David Dinkins, big Democrat celebrated by the media, ran to the high crime wall and got crushed by Rudy Giuliani.

So, maybe he really is trying to say, run, Maxine, so that we can finally get rid of you. I find it interesting that we know for sure, Dan, Kamala Harris is not in charge. This \"Politico\" article is really just disturbing, and showing that there is just complete disarray in her office.

We are talking about three and half million pages of documents because they are so desperate, Dan, to find anything on Donald Trump because they want to disqualify him from running for president in 2024.   The best they could come up with was a corporate car for the CFO of the Trump Organization. Yet, they paraded him into criminal court in handcuffs in front of these horrible people in the media. It was a disgusting display.  Yet, you're right. They are letting real criminals go. And, by the way, what about Hunter Biden? We know this guy absolutely broke the law numerous times. Nothing has been done about that.

It's called a voting location or an election booth. I know it's crazy and it's worked for a long time. But this was a huge win. Explain what it means for the rest of the country where this is happening in other places.",

And it's quite frankly as simple as, is that the Democratic National Committee and other left-wing groups have systematically tried to file lawsuits in states and sometimes very shortly before elections to sow chaos so they can use their organizations to manipulate the vote. So, they challenged Arizona's limitations on out-of-precinct voting and limitations on ballot harvesting and they essentially said that they were racist, unconstitutional, violated the voting right -- Voting Rights Act. We had a 10-day trial, we defended those statutes we won. And then the ninth circus -- Ninth Circuit -- Ninth Circuit overturned that --",

This is what they do. They just they try to demonize and destroy you. And so, the reality is, is that we took it up the Supreme Court. I actually personally argued the case and we won. It's actually named Brnovich v. DNC because I intervened to defend those laws when other people wouldn't. And I thought it was important because, you know, the Constitution, federalism, election integrity have to mean something, and the U.S. Supreme Court held that states can enact common sense election integrity measures to protect the ballot and protect the process. And one thing that's so important, Dan, we emphasize. It was in our briefs, and it came up during oral argument at the court is in 2005, there's a bipartisan commission chaired by Jimmy Carter and that report said that one of the greatest threats to election integrity was mail-in ballots. And so, Arizona adopts the recommendations, including limitations on ballot harvesting. And 15 years ago, the left thought that was a great idea. Even \"The New York Times\" was writing op-eds in 2012 saying we need to restrict this because, you know, for whatever reason in Florida and other places were red states. And now, all of a sudden, when you enact common sense election integrity measures, and you want people to have confidence in the results, somehow that's either unconstitutional or it's racist.

He spent four years, millions of taxpayer dollars, pouring through three million documents based on a hundred subpoenas, believe it or not, never came up with a scintilla of evidence that Donald Trump did anything wrong. He didn't cheat on taxes. Trump didn't commit real estate fraud as the D.A. and the media wanted you to believe. So, instead, Vance is going after a corporate officer and the corporation itself for use of a company car, company apartment, tuition payments and not reporting it as taxable income. Good luck proving this case. The federal tax code is so complex and convoluted, Dan, it's really incomprehensible. There's so many exceptions, caveats, carve-outs and contradictory opinions by the IRS itself on corporate perks that it's a murky, opaque area of law. And as a consequence, these kinds of perks are incredibly commonplace in corporate America. So the jury is going to be given conflicting evidence, whether or not it's legal, and they're not going to know, Dan, because nobody knows. And second of all, because the rules are so nebulous, people are almost never prosecuted for this. Usually, they pay back taxes, maybe a penalty criminal prosecutions over fringe benefits, come on, it's unheard of. So, going after Weisselberg criminally underscores that this is selective prosecution for purely political reasons it's vindictive.

And so our story this week today and yesterday is about those Mexican billionaires who Hunter and his brother -- his uncle, Joe's brother, younger brother Jim Biden were very interested in parlaying their cash into their own pockets. So this is a typical Joe Biden who pretended during the election campaign that he knew absolutely nothing about Hunter Biden's business affairs overseas. He said that repeatedly.

Tonight, we are tracking multiple breaking stories. The witch hunt against President Trump unfortunately continues. Prosecutors now are targeting the Trump Organization. This as Hunter Biden and his father Joe continue to get a free pass and largely ignored and get away with whatever they want. Miranda Devine will be here with another shocking story involving Hunter's hard drive from Hades. Also tonight, a huge win in the Supreme Court for the integrity of our elections. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich will be here with more on their big victory against the ballot harvesters at the DNC.

Her tenure as VP has been a debacle, a disaster. According to a new political report, 22 staffers are no speaking out about the dysfunction inside the vice president's office. It's only been six months, six months, that's it. And they're already complaining -- backstabbing, disorganization, toxic behavior. One Harris staffer called it a, quote, abusive environment. Another said it was an unhealthy workplace where people are treated like you can fill in the blank there, folks. And it's not roses, by the way. According to these whistle-blowers, it all starts at the top, where less than six months into this administration, and it's already not going well. Now, President Trump appears poised to potentially make some major political waves. Check this out."

Governor, I'll go to you first on this. You know, the recipe for disaster here for Democrats is inflation plus crime, right? I mean, Jimmy Carter got smoked by Ronald Reagan, we had stagflation. And I think back to New York City where Mayor David Dinkins, big Democrat celebrated by the media, ran to the high crime wall and got crushed by Rudy Giuliani. I mean, this is really bad right now for Joe Biden as liberal cities run amok and our economy falls into this inflation death trap. Who's in charge?"

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's pretty apparent that Joe Biden's not in charge. I do think he was sucker punching Maxine Waters when he was encouraging her to run for the Senate. She's 83 years old, and she will never be defeated into her House district, but in a statewide election, it's a good way to send her home. So, maybe he really is trying to say, run, Maxine, so that we can finally get rid of you. I find it interesting that we know for sure, Dan, Kamala Harris is not in charge. This \"Politico\" article is really just disturbing, and showing that there is just complete disarray in her office. In fact, the infighting is so intense, I could have sworn that her office has become a Baptist Church. It truly has taken on that form without a doubt."

      "speaker": "BONGINO",

We have a prosecutor there, Cy Vance, who in his list of things he's concerned about, you think it would be crime, you know, terrorism, the struggling economy, people fleeing New York Snake Plissken from the `80s movie. But, no, no, they want to go after the CFO of the Trump Organization for free parking or something like that. Priorities, you know?"

      "speaker": "LARA TRUMP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it is so outrageous to see this. You're exactly right. People that are committing real crimes are just being let go, nothing is being done about it. Let me be very clear with people, what we saw happen to Allen Weisselberg today was absolutely disgraceful. Had this happen to anything else, were talking about five years of an investigation by Cy Vance, the district attorney. We are talking about three and half million pages of documents because they are so desperate, Dan, to find anything on Donald Trump because they want to disqualify him from running for president in 2024. The best they could come up with was a corporate car for the CFO of the Trump Organization. Yet, they paraded him into criminal court in handcuffs in front of these horrible people in the media. It was a disgusting display. Yet, you're right. They are letting real criminals go. And, by the way, what about Hunter Biden? We know this guy absolutely broke the law numerous times. Nothing has been done about that. They go out of their way to try to disqualify Donald Trump, it is disgusting, and the message it sends to every single American is, if this can happen to Donald Trump, think about what they could do to you. Disgraceful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Hunter Biden is in protected class. You know, he's a Democrat. So, Governor, you know, Kamala Harris, you ever see that meme on the Internet? You know, you had one job. Like, you know, your job was to deliver the paper, and you don't even get on the stoop, you throw it down the drain. Kamala Harris had one job, the border. She can even get that right. I mean, all they had to do, Governor, was nothing, just let the Trump policies continue and they would have been fine, and they managed to screw that up, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's amazing, I have to wonder, maybe they wanted Kamala Harris in this job, because she actually makes Joe Biden look competent. That maybe the only thing. And to Lara's point, she so 100 percent right, but I do have a strategy that I would suggest that everyone in the Trump use. Any time you're investigated, simply say, I identify as Hunter Biden, because if you can do that, you will never be investigated. Nobody will ever lay a finger on you. Nobody will care what you do. You can do things in broad daylight, and the FBI and everybody will turn a blind eye and let it go. So, just take the simple advice, identify as Hunter Biden. You're home free."

    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "It's good stuff. Lara, I like that approach. Identify as Hunter Biden. It works very well. But on these borders, seriously, they just had to do nothing. Just let your father-in-law's policies persist. This border chaos was completely avoidable. The numbers were clear as day, 30,000 illegal crossings during the Trump years, 170,000 now. They just screwed it up by doing something. Or they could've just shut up and left it alone."

      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that's right. Everything the Democrats touch turns into a dumpster fire, basically. You're seeing it on our southern border. It is so true. Do nothing, and to the problem is already solved for you. But instead, they have to do the opposite of what Donald Trump want to, because everything he did was bad, right? Wrong. We had a country that was flourishing under President Donald Trump. We have a secure border. We had more jobs than we had people to fill them, the lowest unemployment in many respects in the history of America. We had energy independence, net energy exporter. We were respected around the world again. In less than six months, gone, wiped off the map. All of it is gone because they hate Donald Trump so much. And sadly, it's to the detriment of the American people."

I mean, really, this is been a witches brew for this president so far, again, between the inflation, crime chaos in liberal cities, terrible messaging, grotesque performance of the border -- you know, we don't have a great Senate cycle coming up. We've got a lot of competitive seats. I think we're going to do good in the House. But do you think it will manifest itself on the Senate side and we have a chance of taking the Senate back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think we have a shot at it, and the reason is because of what the Democrats are doing. I mean, they are stinking it up the nostrils of every American saying, don't playing for higher gas prices? Don't you like the fact that there's a help wanted sign in every store and restaurant and hours have been curtailed because nobody showing up to work, thanks to the Biden policies? People are scared to death. Living in what has been major cities that were safe, they're not anymore. People care about their kitchen table issues, their personal economy, they care about their safety and security. And this administration and the Democrats with their nutty defund the police has put people in a real position of recognizing who the Democrats are. And for Jen Psaki to go to the White House and lie, just flat out lie, like a shad carpet in a VW hippie bus, I mean, my God, the Republicans trying to defund the police, and everybody with an IQ above broccoli knows, it wasn't the Republicans, it was the Democrats who continued to want to defund the police."

      "speaker": "BONGINO",

As Biden struggles, America's enemies are sadly becoming emboldened. Vladimir Putin is now publicly taunting and threatening the United States. China's dictator right now is hurling a few violent threats of his own. He doesn't want to be left out. And the CCP will probably never take responsibility for the virus they unleashed upon the world. According to one new report, a top researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology has deep ties to China's military. So, what does this mean for the United States and what can we do to hold the malignant communist party of China accountable? Joining me now with more is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, thanks a lot for joining me. Really appreciate it."

Hey, there's a lab in Wuhan that studies coronaviruses. We have a coronavirus outbreak, that lab had safety problems in the past. You know, as a pretty smart guy, you said, maybe we should ask them questions. And you were brutally attacked. I know you're not one of these schadenfreude guys, but it's got to feel good to be right and to put them on their heels a little bit, the left and the media. I mean, they look like idiots now."

And the lady that runs those labs is literally nicknamed the bat lady. Maybe we should take a look at them. I'm glad to see that NBC News is finally reporting to its viewers that that lab has deep ties to the Chinese communist party's military. If you're watching Fox 18 months ago and ever since, you would know that. There's no distinction in China between the party and the state and the military, and supposedly private institutions like government research institutions or companies or anything else. The party controls everything, and the military is the arm of the communist party in China."

I mean, China's infiltrated Hollywood, our sports industry, we have technology takeovers. You know, we've had government procurement issues in China, intellectual property theft. You know, we have Taiwan being threatened. We have Hong Kong right now in the midst of a takeover right in front of our faces. I mean, what can we do? Is there any way to expand kind of a Magnitsky type thing, where we can sanction some of their diplomats and their kids? I mean, the one thing they want to be able to do is visit America. But doesn't it -- listen, I'm a patriot like you, but we got to be candid. Doesn't it feel like we are taking a kick in the cojones here, man? We got to fight back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Dan, as you say, politicians in both parties for many decades put China's interests ahead of so many Americans' interests, whether it's our factory workers, or our troopers who are stationed in the Western Pacific. Some of the missionaries we had going to China, say nothing to do with their own people, in places like Hong Kong or northwest China where they're committing against ethnic and religious minorities."

    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "But we need to remember, that China needs us a lot more then we need them. We can buy your T-shirts and sneakers from another country. But where are they going to sell theirs? So, we can slap more tariffs on them. As you say, we can take things away visas from Chinese communist officials and their kids so they didn't come here and take spots in our universities. It should be for American kids. We can revoke their permanent most favored nation status so they don't get that beneficial trade status, but rather, Congress and the president have to decide every year whether we'll extend it for one more year. Those are all ways that we can make China pay, not just for unleashing this plague on the world, but also for decades of lying and cheating and stealing. It is time to lower the boom on China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",

Australia's taking a pretty muscular stand and it seems like we're just taking back a tape (ph). But just I want to move on quickly to Russia because that's important too. You're obviously well-versed in foreign policy. You know what an embarrassment, right, that President Biden stops a pipeline here, the Keystone pipeline, costs Americans 11,000 jobs and cost us domestic energy security. But then he gives Vladimir Putin a free pass to build a pipeline to enrich himself straight to Germany when the Trump administration tried to stop this, because of the transit fees that they would have bypassed. I mean, this is -- I don't understand how Democrats up on the Hill with you see that as being fair. Block a pipeline here but give it to Russia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's crazy, Dan. That we would end a pipeline here that's going to create thousands of high-paying American jobs, it's going to provide more energy security to the United States and our ally Canada to the north, while Joe Biden allows that pipeline to be built from Russia to Germany to more deeply hook Western Europe on Russian gas and to prevent Americans from exporting our gas to Western Europe, when we could create even more jobs here. And let's not forget a third pipeline in this tale of three pipelines, Dan, it was Russian criminals that hacked into the Colonial Pipeline that caused gas lines all across the eastern United States."

Of course the irony in all this is that the Democrats continue to spew lies and misinformation about election integrity measures in places like Arizona and Georgia. Big blue states are seeing their own elections descend into madness. Just look at what happened in New York with their board of elections which managed to botch the ranked choice voting count in the mayor's race by just a little bit, folks, don't worry just 135,000 fake votes, just the sliver - - from a test run of the computer system with the board saying they apologize for the error, yeah, yeah, you think? Joining me now for reaction to all of this, Arizona attorney general and Senate candidate Mark Brnovich. Attorney General, thanks for joining us. This ballot harvesting is an outright disaster. Congratulations on the big win, by the way. You know, we have a place you can turn in your ballots. It's not to a ballot harvester. It's got a name. Are you ready for it, Mr. Attorney General? It's called a voting location or an election booth. I know it's crazy and it's worked for a long time. But this was a huge win.

And it's quite frankly as simple as, is that the Democratic National Committee and other left-wing groups have systematically tried to file lawsuits in states and sometimes very shortly before elections to sow chaos so they can use their organizations to manipulate the vote. So, they challenged Arizona's limitations on out-of-precinct voting and limitations on ballot harvesting and they essentially said that they were racist, unconstitutional, violated the voting right -- Voting Rights Act. We had a 10-day trial, we defended those statutes we won. And then the ninth circus -- Ninth Circuit -- Ninth Circuit overturned that --"

This is what they do. They just they try to demonize and destroy you. And so, the reality is, is that we took it up the Supreme Court. I actually personally argued the case and we won. It's actually named Brnovich v. DNC because I intervened to defend those laws when other people wouldn't. And I thought it was important because, you know, the Constitution, federalism, election integrity have to mean something, and the U.S. Supreme Court held that states can enact common sense election integrity measures to protect the ballot and protect the process. And one thing that's so important, Dan, we emphasize. It was in our briefs, and it came up during oral argument at the court is in 2005, there's a bipartisan commission chaired by Jimmy Carter and that report said that one of the greatest threats to election integrity was mail-in ballots. And so, Arizona adopts the recommendations, including limitations on ballot harvesting. And 15 years ago, the left thought that was a great idea. Even \"The New York Times\" was writing op-eds in 2012 saying we need to restrict this because, you know, for whatever reason in Florida and other places were red states. And now, all of a sudden, when you enact common sense election integrity measures, and you want people to have confidence in the results, somehow that's either unconstitutional or it's racist.

De Blasio is urging New Yorkers to turn off their power amid this week's heat wave, all the while what Times Square is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you've seen the photos, they are tragically hilarious. Here to react to all of this is FOX News contributor Sean Duffy, along with former Trump campaign senior advisor, Mercedes Schlapp. Sean, that picture in Times Square sums up liberalism. Listen, man, liberalism is a bumper sticker. It's all BS. Tolerance, coexist, meanwhile they're calling everybody racist.

      "utterance": "Yeah, there is, Dan, no question, this is a political persecution masquerading as prosecution. It's an abuse of power and Cyrus Vance, the D.A., should really be ashamed of himself. He spent four years, millions of taxpayer dollars, pouring through three million documents based on a hundred subpoenas, believe it or not, never came up with a scintilla of evidence that Donald Trump did anything wrong. He didn't cheat on taxes. Trump didn't commit real estate fraud as the D.A. and the media wanted you to believe. So, instead, Vance is going after a corporate officer and the corporation itself for use of a company car, company apartment, tuition payments and not reporting it as taxable income. Good luck proving this case. The federal tax code is so complex and convoluted, Dan, it's really incomprehensible. There's so many exceptions, caveats, carve-outs and contradictory opinions by the IRS itself on corporate perks that it's a murky, opaque area of law. And as a consequence, these kinds of perks are incredibly commonplace in corporate America. So the jury is going to be given conflicting evidence, whether or not it's legal, and they're not going to know, Dan, because nobody knows. And second of all, because the rules are so nebulous, people are almost never prosecuted for this. Usually, they pay back taxes, maybe a penalty criminal prosecutions over fringe benefits, come on, it's unheard of. So, going after Weisselberg criminally underscores that this is selective prosecution for purely political reasons it's vindictive. The only reason he's been charged is because he's an associate of Donald Trump."

Again, Hunter reportedly used the trappings of his dad's vice presidency to pursue lucrative business deals with two Mexican billionaires. I'm losing track of all the billionaires, by the way, Hunter Biden's done business with. Does anyone have a list can we throw that up sometime? Despite Joe's promise that he never spoke to his son about his foreign deals, by the way, photos from \"The Daily Mail\" show Joe and Hunter alongside Hunter's Latin American partner -- there it is. I can say on return. There it is right there. There's photos. That's called evidence folks. Media people out there outside of FOX News, we have a name for that. That's called evidence. Take a look on the screen. You want to investigate that? We have to do your homework for you. A year later, Hunter flew to Mexico City on Air Force Two with his dad, where he apparently attended some business meetings. Isn't that great? Don't forget, Hunter's taxes, I'm sorry, the story annoys a hell out of me. Hunter's taxes are still under investigation by the feds. Do you think there's any chance he'll be held with the same standards as the Trump Organization? It's hilarious. Here now with more details, FOX News contributors, Miranda Devine, a \"New York Post\" columnist, and FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. Guys, thanks for joining us. Miranda, I'll go to you first. You know, with Hunter Biden, the most frustrating thing about this entire thing is remember the whole laptop fiasco when the FBI took the laptop, we had the FBI case number. It was reported, what, seven, eight months ago? I don't know how long ago. We had the case number. All the media had to do was call the FBI and say before the election say, hey, is there a real case against this guy because we got this whole case number thing? And they did none of it."

We've run now two photographs -- one this week of the Mexican billionaires having breakfast with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, in the vice president's residence in 2015, and a couple of weeks ago, we ran another photograph and another story about how Joe Biden had showed up at a dinner that Hunter Biden was holding at Cafe Milano in Washington, D.C. in April of 2015, for business partners from various countries such as Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexico. And so our story this week today and yesterday is about those Mexican billionaires who Hunter and his brother -- his uncle, Joe's brother, younger brother Jim Biden were very interested in parlaying their cash into their own pockets. So this is a typical Joe Biden who pretended during the election campaign that he knew absolutely nothing about Hunter Biden's business affairs overseas. He said that repeatedly. He's now been shown over and over and there's more evidence on the laptop still to come that he was intimately involved.
