Last night we were the first remember to show you that disgraceful video of NYPD Officers being doused with water. Now tonight we have even more to show you. Plus, \"Generation G\" you know that is? Generation Grievance because we have a new culture that has completely been enveloped by the left. We brought you one example from one Georgia Representative last night. Tonight we bring you the update with that story and more. Candace Owens is here and only hours as Hannity and I were talking about until Mueller's Capitol Hill testimony. Is that going to deliver some big exciting news for us or a big snoozer?  Alan Dershowitz is here with some well disappointing news for Democrats. You want to turn in for that. But first, the culture of disrespect. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Last night, we were the first to bring you this disturbing video that sent shock waves through the American Law Enforcement Community and beyond. Disgusting and depressing. But this is not an isolated incident. This is what everyone has to understand. This is just the latest in a long line of examples that demonstrates a growing disrespect for the people and principles that most Americans still hold dear. Since we showed you that awful video last night, another shocking incident surfaced from Harlem, as officers they are tempted to make an arrest.",

Of course that didn't stop the left which had already burrowed into our colleges and into our universities, spreading the view that Reagan was just a warmonger and America was in evil imperialist force. And all the while, the entertainment industry was doing its part slowly but surely ridiculing and demonizing and disrespecting Republican Presidents and the office of the presidency. The disrespect reached every aspect of popular culture, as filmmakers and producers pretty much ridiculed everything about traditional American values and replace them with something more progressive or too many of us, or regressive.  Public and private school began to disrespect America's founding by teaching a watered-down version of history approved by the politically correct sensors. The study of great books by old white racist men well that was held. And Howard Zinn's radical of people's history of the United States was in.  So after all these years later, shouldn't really come as a surprise when four freshmen Congresswomen equate the crisis at our border to one of history's greatest atrocities?",

Police Commissioner O'Neill came out and condemned that right away. We've seen Pantaleo for the last five years not get any support from the department. So the officers that are out there on patrol now, officers who had the water being thrown on them are indecisive in a sense of what they should do and who they have the backing of the NYPD.  Are they going to make an arrest and this individuals - any of the individual failing crack to their head, we'd hear the media and we hear other people out in the public saying it's minor crimes and all of a sudden everything would turn against these officers.

Tonight we bring you the update with that story and more. Candace Owens is here and only hours as Hannity and I were talking about until Mueller's Capitol Hill testimony. Is that going to deliver some big exciting news for us or a big snoozer? Alan Dershowitz is here with some well disappointing news for Democrats. You want to turn in for that.

The disrespect reached every aspect of popular culture, as filmmakers and producers pretty much ridiculed everything about traditional American values and replace them with something more progressive or too many of us, or regressive. Public and private school began to disrespect America's founding by teaching a watered-down version of history approved by the politically correct sensors. The study of great books by old white racist men well that was held. And Howard Zinn's radical of people's history of the United States was in.

Police Commissioner O'Neill came out and condemned that right away. We've seen Pantaleo for the last five years not get any support from the department. So the officers that are out there on patrol now, officers who had the water being thrown on them are indecisive in a sense of what they should do and who they have the backing of the NYPD. Are they going to make an arrest and this individuals - any of the individual failing crack to their head, we'd hear the media and we hear other people out in the public saying it's minor crimes and all of a sudden everything would turn against these officers. There's no leadership in the NYPD. This has been a problem. We've had three cops assassinated, several cops killed, we have numerous cops shot. There's absolutely no leadership in the NYPD and none coming from City Hall.

The perfect example is any demonstration. We watch it in Portland. We watch it in New York. We watch in Los Angeles. Times are changing because they are hesitating to engage. These two officers looked ridiculous in what they did. As soon as they were assaulted, they have that suspect in the car. They should have put out an assistance call. They should have turned and actually engage the suspect. If they get into an altercation, that's fine. If they have to use their taser, that's fine. If they have to use force other than that, that's fine because the next officer that goes in that neighborhood, maybe he'll get a bucket of paint, maybe a bucket of bleach, maybe even some acid.

So it's easy for us to say what officers should do but we are not the ones that are there when it happens and we are not the officers who are getting indicted because of public outcry over nonsense.

Minutes later, the pool boy asked me for my room key. This cannot be real right now. I am a guest too, right. #racist. Was this true? Impossible to prove but that's kind of the point. You see Thomas is a member of what we call \"Generation G\" or the \"Grievance Generation\". They are the product of decades of leftist control of our schools, our entertainment industry, and their breeding a culture of resentment and envy basically a society of victims and the victims, no matter what, are always right.

We think everything is racist. Things that used to be normal conflicts between human beings getting cut off while you're driving, having a bad correspondence in a grocery store.

But when you go to Medicare for all replacing private insurance, that's not supported by the public. And then if you go a step even further and say health care for illegal immigrants, that is toxic among independents and Republicans.

This is about showing the American people the facts that were found, and the facts that were found, whether or not there are criminal charges, are deeply troubling. If this were a case about someone other than the president, they'd already have been indicted."

What it means is that for every American who is subject to a criminal investigation and the prosecutor decides not to indict, then they can be called in front of Congress and say, you didn't indict him, but tell us how bad he really is. Tell us how many terrible things he did. Tell us all the things that you were told that maybe you didn't believe. It really undercuts the American system of justice, the presumption of innocence, and are long, long tradition that prosecutor simply decide whether to indict or not. And if they decide not to indict, they then shut up. Remember, prosecutors are not asked to find whether someone's guilty or innocent. That's up to the judge and jury. All prosecutors are supposed to find is whether there is probable cause to go further and have a trial. And it's all getting messed up by this Special Counsel concept. I hope we've heard the last of Special Counsel. I hope we never see them again in the American system."

Joining me now, Richard Goodstein, former Clinton adviser, Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union. I want to take you both through some of the language that Trump and the Democrat candidates have been using over just the past 24 hours. Earlier today, President Trump talked about how he was targeting new states ahead of 2020. So what are his potential opponents targeting? Here's Cory Booker."

Second of all, their whole thing is about how Trump's language is out-of- bounds and he's causing all this hostility. This man is running for president. That's the biggest problem these Democratic candidates have. The American people are practical. Do they think these people are ready to lead with statements like that?"

It does make people feel pretty angry. Is punching him in the face the appropriate response? No. But I do think it gives rise to that, which is exactly what I think, frankly, the Republicans lost the 2018 elections."

I think he was trying to say that things have gotten out of control and when we're going to try to get them back in control. It's a lofty goal. The economy is doing pretty well, and we have a lot of other issues, but I think that's what he was trying to get at here. I want to get to a second example, though. Here's President Trump today defending the Betsy Ross flag after that backlash against Nike earlier this month."

It's really very unfair what they do. They try and demean and belittle, and they are very good at it. They are better at that than they are at politics. They are better at that than they are at policy."

I think a lot of people are just tired of it. The rhetoric has to come down on both sides. It's great to have you both on tonight. And who's really behind that newest nicknames for the so-called squad? An “Ingraham Angle” investigation. The phrase the president used today, we've tracked it down. Stay there."
