I do think you have to pause, learn what we can from this and not rush into it because that minimized the politicization of it.

You can also with 3D printing, there's no way we are actually going to be able to control evil people who want to use tool to commit mass murder, and that's something we also have to think of because there are issues.  One of the things about this guy is he's the latest murderer who grew up in a fatherless home. It's very difficult to deal with that societal crisis of how most people who are in our prisons, most people who have severe problems grow up in fatherless homes.
