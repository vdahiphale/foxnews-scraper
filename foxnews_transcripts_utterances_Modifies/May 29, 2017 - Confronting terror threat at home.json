It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Thank you for joining us. We hope you all enjoyed your holiday weekend. On this Memorial Day, we honor our fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom. You and your families are in our thoughts and in our prayers. We also want to thank the men and women currently serving in our armed forces. We pray for your safety and for your families. We are living in very dangerous and uncertain times with waves of terror groups in the globe. But President Trump vows America will aggressively confront the threat and warned the Muslim world recently, it must as well.",

But also he's preparing for a very big decision on Afghanistan and a new approach to that. And there's a new debate within the White House as to what that should be. And I think that this foreign trip that you just took would actually lead him to wanting to do more. Because I feel like he had this transformation over the past six months. And in particular, when he's there in Europe -- there's this massive terrorist attack. And everyone looks to him. Like you are the leader of the free world. What are we going to do? And he says with very strong language, we're not going to put up with it. So, that's I think on the table for him in the next couple of weeks.

He went there with still an America first attitude. The Saudi arms deal. A $110 billion. We are getting jobs. We're getting cash for that deal. And then we're letting the Saudis take the lead in confronting the Iranians and other bad actors in the region. That's one thing.   Number two, he put the onus on the Muslim world. America is not going to be able to defeat these Islamic fascists by ourselves. We've recognized the limitations of doing that during the Bush administration. And then also in the Obama administration, they're going to have to be the tip of the spirit unless we are going to drive these people out. He puts some pressure on the clerics. This is not a war on Christianity versus Israelis versus Islam. This is a war of savages versus civilized people. And he kind of was uplifting and he said, you know, the Middle East used to be this is amazing trade route whether this shipping lanes and this is, you know, the access from Asia, the Europe and you know, this bedrock of civilization. Let's get back to that, let's return to that prosperity because the prosperity is there. But until you guys drive out these awful, awful people -- you're never going to have any success. You are not going to have families. You're not going to have money. You're not going to have safety. So, I think the President is very effective in doing that. And he came back to Israel. Put a little, bar a little high I think by saying I could possibly stop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And then call these people losers. And I think calling then losers sets them up because he's very effective at branding. And it just shows that we will win when we defeat them because that's going to stop recruitment.",

And solving those problems are two different things. And I think the other, the third problem that we have here is the Syrian civil war. And you have parsed the Syrian civil war different from ISIS expansion. You can't do it. Well, you have to see them as three different isolated things. And I think what I would hope to see from this administration is one, how do we solve self-radicalizing here in the United States? Two, how do we defeat ISIS in the Middle East and three, how to become to some sort of resolution in the Syrian civil war and take Assad out?

My point is it's too late for you. I have advice for people who are in college. If you want to be successful after college, college, you have to abandon identity politics. What happens after college creates a visible chip on your shoulder that you can see from space. And no job recruiter is going to want to hire somebody who sees and expresses themselves as a perpetual victim. When you give off the idea that you are a victim, nobody wants to be around you. I want to paraphrase Shelby Steele. When he deals with someone in the thrall of grievance culture, he always asks them -- what would you say if you weren't a victim? What would you do if you didn't think as a victim? Embracing victimhood allows an off-ramp from testing your abilities and taking advantage of the opportunities by constantly saying I am a victim, you have the world around you that offers so many things but you are angry.

And the thing is, it's not just refugees who just arrived last month that are causing the problems.

And when President Trump met with NATO members, I think the other thing that he was doing is not just making sure that they knew that they had to pay up so that we can all work together on this. But also he's preparing for a very big decision on Afghanistan and a new approach to that. And there's a new debate within the White House as to what that should be. And I think that this foreign trip that you just took would actually lead him to wanting to do more. Because I feel like he had this transformation over the past six months. And in particular, when he's there in Europe -- there's this massive terrorist attack. And everyone looks to him. Like you are the leader of the free world. What are we going to do? And he says with very strong language, we're not going to put up with it. So, that's I think on the table for him in the next couple of weeks. I think you will see a stronger position put forward on at least the Afghanistan plan."

He went there with still an America first attitude. The Saudi arms deal. A $110 billion. We are getting jobs. We're getting cash for that deal. And then we're letting the Saudis take the lead in confronting the Iranians and other bad actors in the region. That's one thing. Number two, he put the onus on the Muslim world. America is not going to be able to defeat these Islamic fascists by ourselves. We've recognized the limitations of doing that during the Bush administration. And then also in the Obama administration, they're going to have to be the tip of the spirit unless we are going to drive these people out. He puts some pressure on the clerics. This is not a war on Christianity versus Israelis versus Islam. This is a war of savages versus civilized people. And he kind of was uplifting and he said, you know, the Middle East used to be this is amazing trade route whether this shipping lanes and this is, you know, the access from Asia, the Europe and you know, this bedrock of civilization. Let's get back to that, let's return to that prosperity because the prosperity is there. But until you guys drive out these awful, awful people -- you're never going to have any success. You are not going to have families. You're not going to have money. You're not going to have safety. So, I think the President is very effective in doing that. And he came back to Israel. Put a little, bar a little high I think by saying I could possibly stop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And then call these people losers. And I think calling then losers sets them up because he's very effective at branding. And it just shows that we will win when we defeat them because that's going to stop recruitment."

Because you have the ISIS fighters in Syria, in Iraq and then you also have those folks who are self-radicalizing here in the United States and here in Europe. And solving those problems are two different things. And I think the other, the third problem that we have here is the Syrian civil war. And you have parsed the Syrian civil war different from ISIS expansion. You can't do it. Well, you have to see them as three different isolated things. And I think what I would hope to see from this administration is one, how do we solve self-radicalizing here in the United States? Two, how do we defeat ISIS in the Middle East and three, how to become to some sort of resolution in the Syrian civil war and take Assad out?

President Trump condemning the killings of two men who tried to stop a racist rant on a Portland, Oregon, light rail train. The President saying, quote, the violent attacks in Portland are unacceptable. He also tweeted the victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are with them. The 23-year-old and 53-year-old men were killed Friday as they tried to stop a suspect from harassing two women. One of whom was wearing a Hijab. Another man was seriously injured. Elsewhere in the news, golf great Tiger Woods arrested in Florida on suspicion of DUI. Woods released a statement tonight disputing that alcohol was involved. He instead blames an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. Woods, a 14 time major champion is out for the rest of the season while recovering from his fourth back surgery. I am Kelly Wright.

I mean, you all ultimately will be your own best advocate, to put forward your passions, your dreams, your desires and represent yourself and be able to get people to believe in you and take a chance on you. And it's a powerful thing inside of you that we all have. And that desire to want to have a good life. To have a grateful life like Oprah said.

My point is it's too late for you. I have advice for people who are in college. If you want to be successful after college, college, you have to abandon identity politics. What happens after college creates a visible chip on your shoulder that you can see from space. And no job recruiter is going to want to hire somebody who sees and expresses themselves as a perpetual victim. When you give off the idea that you are a victim, nobody wants to be around you. I want to paraphrase Shelby Steele. When he deals with someone in the thrall of grievance culture, he always asks them -- what would you say if you weren't a victim? What would you do if you didn't think as a victim? Embracing victimhood allows an off-ramp from testing your abilities and taking advantage of the opportunities by constantly saying I am a victim, you have the world around you that offers so many things but you are angry. You've got to let that go."
