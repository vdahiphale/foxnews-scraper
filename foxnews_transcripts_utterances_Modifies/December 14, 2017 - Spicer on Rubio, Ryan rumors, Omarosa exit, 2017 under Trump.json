      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from Washington tonight. How the Mueller investigation reveals that unlimited power does corrupt. That is the subject of tonight's Angle. What we have seen over the past seven months at the Mueller investigation reveals a lot about how big government can end up becoming a threat to representative democracy. And the more we look at the web of Clinton and Obama loyalists who burrowed in to Mueller's office, the more obvious it all becomes.  There were a number of highly influential and powerful people working inside the Obama administration, who were not only horrified about the idea of Donald Trump winning the presidency, they were intent on preventing him from being elected by any means necessary.  And if that meant applying for a FISA warrant based on a phony dossier in order to spy on the campaign, maybe they would do it. And if it meant deploying the entire mainstream media apparatus into death con one mode, hyperventilating about Russia collusion 24/7, they would do it.  And today if it requires floating a specious story alleging that the president has early onset dementia, well, they do that too or maybe spreading damaging falsehoods from anonymous sources that are later parroted and then retracted by major news organizations. They'll do that, too. If it means propagating the idea that Don Trump Jr., Jared, and the president were in some conspiracy with the old KGB to throw the election? No problem, whatever it takes. As the former Mueller investigator, Peter Strzok, put it, they needed an insurance policy to stop Trump.  Going on to reference a meeting in Andy's office and why is that significant? Well, here's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "Now, this entire investigation, these texts, all of it, this has become a complete farce. They have an unlimited budget. They have unlimited staff. They have basically an unlimited term. Mueller's team can stay on the hunt forever how long they want. It's insane. The founders never envisioned that a separate office inside the executive branch could hire a bunch of agenda-driven investigators in search of a crime by the head of the executive branch. I mean, if Congress wants to get rid of the president, they have a way to do that. It's called impeachment.   That's their constitutional prerogative, but this deal with Mueller is now just totally out of hand. And at a minimum, a few things need to happen immediately in order to at least stabilize the situation. First, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe must be fired, period. He allowed Strzok to be the lead investigator of the Russia investigation after he had been a key player in the ultimate exoneration of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. And, remember, he helped Comey soften the language of his non-indictment, indictment of Mrs. Clinton and there is a lot of other things about Strzok we won't go into now. You all know them by now.  And whether McCabe actually conspired with Strzok and went to the FISA court to surveil the Trump campaign, that's really important, too, and that also has to be investigated. But a separate ground for firing McCabe for cause may be the meeting Strzok references in his text messages, the thing that we just referenced.   Because, if true, McCabe actually took part in a discussion or actual planning, who knows, to subvert Trump's campaign or maybe if he was elected his ability to lead the government as president of the United States. That text message could be the smoking gun. And as for Bob Mueller himself, indeed, he has throughout his career served his country with honor and distinction. But that doesn't change the fact that right now this investigation he is heading has become irreparably tainted.  As the \"Wall Street Journal\" just put it, the man who should be most disturbed by all of this is Mr. Mueller who wants his evidence and conclusions to be credible with the public. Evidence is building instead that some officials at the FBI who have worked for him may have interfered in an American presidential election. Congress needs to insist that its rights as a quo equal branch of government exists to discover the truth. Now, I'm not calling for Mueller to be fired. It's tempting but I'm not. But, at the very least, he needs to put the brakes on this investigation, at least pause it for a bit.  I agree with what Alan Dershowitz said on my radio show this morning. It's time for a respected, independent expert to come in and thoroughly examine the individuals conducting this probe and fire anyone inside who even a hint of an appearance of a conflict of interest.  That's all it should take. That's how high the stakes are. Otherwise, the public confidence in the Mueller operation will and should collapse under its own weight. These endless revelations of bias. And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction in New York is John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Fox News contributor, and a recovering lawyer, and here in Washington, Richard Goodstein, a Democratic strategist.",

But when you are someone who worked for the Clinton Foundation, when you represented Ben Rhodes as Jeannie Rhee did, when you're high-fiving Sally Yates, the text message how she is defying the president. You are not just a Democrat you are an adversary of that president. That's why having them in the investigation I think is problematic.   John, let's go to you.

I think I think Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, however, is the one who is not doing his job. His testimony yesterday I think was extremely disturbing because he demonstrated to my mind utter obliviousness to this maelstrom that is surrounding the Mueller investigation.  Seemingly unable to look at these examples of bias by Peter Strzok and many, many others and connect them to what's happening in the investigation. So, when you combine that with the fundamentally unconstitutional nature of an unrestrained independent counsel, I think we are seeing the destruction of the reputation of the Justice Department and the FBI. I'm an alumnus of the Justice Department. I have worked with FBI investigators in a number of capacities over the years.

I think James Comey so badly bungled the Clinton e-mail investigation that Donald Trump should have fired him on January the 20th. He would have been fully justified and nobody would have said obstruction of justice.  It's a tragedy that he didn't fire him. But, in the course of the e-mail investigation, as we now see from the e-mails that have come out, we have got people who were so biased against Trump that it seems to me almost inescapable that their bias affected their judgment. This is where Rosenstein's testimony yesterday was so bad because it's as if he is saying I'm not going to connect bias to outcome, which is clear, I'm going to insist that they say in meetings that the FBI, we should not indict Hillary Clinton because otherwise Donald Trump would be elected president.   That never happened. I think what Strzok and others did was move Comey, if he wasn't already inclined to do it conclusion there was no requirement for -- that's fundamentally wrong.",

Just tonight Fox News obtained a copy of Comey's actual draft letter that exonerated Clinton. Richard and I were just talking about it. It shows the phrase grossly negligent was deleted in more than one spot. So, perhaps, you know, more alarming is that the draft shows Comey originally was going to state it was reasonably likely so that hostile actors had actually infiltrated Hillary's server but that was also taken out.   So, look, Senate investigators tell Fox News now that they expect Strzok is the one who really made all of these edits both to the grossly negligent language and about the infiltration of her e-mail searcher? Richard, I want you to address this infiltration of the e-mail searcher because this gets serious. This is classified information that could have been taken by a foreign actor, and this was hinted at a couple years ago when we were talking about this. It was said at the time it was likely that a foreign entity did manage to penetrate her system because it didn't have the security as one of the guys who testified even like a Gmail program.",

They're no Roy Moores, but they are populist so they conflate the two. I'm thinking of people like Kelli Ward in Arizona, Danny Tarkanian in New Mexico -- in Nevada. So we've got to think about this. This is where the populists need to be careful and smart, because it's not enough to have just a few national figures support you. No, no, no. You need money and you need some allies within the mainstream GOP to survive, just like President Trump did. Kelli Ward, remember, tried and failed to beat McCain, but, I'm telling you, she is a much better candidate now than she was then. So trying to tag her as far right as the \"New York Times\" attempted to do today is absurd. She would be a fine general election candidate. And the party needs more strong, smart women.

Mayor Ali Sallam says all the joy has been taken out of the holiday because of President Trump's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Sallam accused Trump of stabbing Palestinians in the back. Well, to be fair, it's not only Muslims who are upset with the decision. Palestinian Christians in the Middle East are vehemently opposed to the move. And as you know the Pope is as well. The decision by Nazareth's mayor could have come with a big cost to his town and its people. The annual celebration is a huge tourist attraction and it's attended by thousands and thousands of pilgrims. But the town ultimately decided to cancel the traditional singing and dancing, not the Christmas market and parade.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from Washington tonight. How the Mueller investigation reveals that unlimited power does corrupt. That is the subject of tonight's Angle. What we have seen over the past seven months at the Mueller investigation reveals a lot about how big government can end up becoming a threat to representative democracy. And the more we look at the web of Clinton and Obama loyalists who burrowed in to Mueller's office, the more obvious it all becomes. There were a number of highly influential and powerful people working inside the Obama administration, who were not only horrified about the idea of Donald Trump winning the presidency, they were intent on preventing him from being elected by any means necessary. And if that meant applying for a FISA warrant based on a phony dossier in order to spy on the campaign, maybe they would do it. And if it meant deploying the entire mainstream media apparatus into death con one mode, hyperventilating about Russia collusion 24/7, they would do it. And today if it requires floating a specious story alleging that the president has early onset dementia, well, they do that too or maybe spreading damaging falsehoods from anonymous sources that are later parroted and then retracted by major news organizations. They'll do that, too. If it means propagating the idea that Don Trump Jr., Jared, and the president were in some conspiracy with the old KGB to throw the election? No problem, whatever it takes. As the former Mueller investigator, Peter Strzok, put it, they needed an insurance policy to stop Trump. Going on to reference a meeting in Andy's office and why is that significant? Well, here's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.,CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Andy is presumably Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This text is very troubling because it suggests that they are doing something. They have a plan to take action to make sure that Donald Trump does not get elected president of the United States in the highest levels of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, this entire investigation, these texts, all of it, this has become a complete farce. They have an unlimited budget. They have unlimited staff. They have basically an unlimited term. Mueller's team can stay on the hunt forever how long they want. It's insane. The founders never envisioned that a separate office inside the executive branch could hire a bunch of agenda-driven investigators in search of a crime by the head of the executive branch. I mean, if Congress wants to get rid of the president, they have a way to do that. It's called impeachment. That's their constitutional prerogative, but this deal with Mueller is now just totally out of hand. And at a minimum, a few things need to happen immediately in order to at least stabilize the situation. First, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe must be fired, period. He allowed Strzok to be the lead investigator of the Russia investigation after he had been a key player in the ultimate exoneration of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. And, remember, he helped Comey soften the language of his non-indictment, indictment of Mrs. Clinton and there is a lot of other things about Strzok we won't go into now. You all know them by now. And whether McCabe actually conspired with Strzok and went to the FISA court to surveil the Trump campaign, that's really important, too, and that also has to be investigated. But a separate ground for firing McCabe for cause may be the meeting Strzok references in his text messages, the thing that we just referenced. Because, if true, McCabe actually took part in a discussion or actual planning, who knows, to subvert Trump's campaign or maybe if he was elected his ability to lead the government as president of the United States. That text message could be the smoking gun. And as for Bob Mueller himself, indeed, he has throughout his career served his country with honor and distinction. But that doesn't change the fact that right now this investigation he is heading has become irreparably tainted. As the \"Wall Street Journal\" just put it, the man who should be most disturbed by all of this is Mr. Mueller who wants his evidence and conclusions to be credible with the public. Evidence is building instead that some officials at the FBI who have worked for him may have interfered in an American presidential election. Congress needs to insist that its rights as a quo equal branch of government exists to discover the truth. Now, I'm not calling for Mueller to be fired. It's tempting but I'm not. But, at the very least, he needs to put the brakes on this investigation, at least pause it for a bit. I agree with what Alan Dershowitz said on my radio show this morning. It's time for a respected, independent expert to come in and thoroughly examine the individuals conducting this probe and fire anyone inside who even a hint of an appearance of a conflict of interest. That's all it should take. That's how high the stakes are. Otherwise, the public confidence in the Mueller operation will and should collapse under its own weight. These endless revelations of bias. And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction in New York is John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Fox News contributor, and a recovering lawyer, and here in Washington, Richard Goodstein, a Democratic strategist."

We know Rudy Giuliani had all his friends that put on pressure on Comey to put out that letter 11 days before election, which he had no business doing and he didn't disclose to the public the way in which the Russians were trying to kind of tilt this election in addition to his press conference of July 5th, which again went against the FBI rules. So, that, to me, is kind of the fundamental way in which I think you are misrepresenting."

      "utterance": "I agree with you. I actually agree with you. I don't think he should have done that either. But the fundamental question about this probe is, just given the fact that it's so high stakes, just to have it guy Peter Strzok, Weissmann, Jeanie Rhee, they didn't just vote for Obama. That's fine. You're a Democrat. No big deal. But when you are someone who worked for the Clinton Foundation, when you represented Ben Rhodes as Jeannie Rhee did, when you're high-fiving Sally Yates, the text message how she is defying the president. You are not just a Democrat you are an adversary of that president. That's why having them in the investigation I think is problematic. John, let's go to you. Ambassador Bolton, your thoughts on this as a former attorney and watching this from the outside. Bob Mueller has a stellar reputation. Republicans built it up and so did Democrats."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that it doesn't really matter what Bob Mueller's reputation is before he becomes an independent counsel because I think the entire concept of independent counsel is so fundamentally flawed that you inherently have investigation turning into exactly what this has turned into. I think I think Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, however, is the one who is not doing his job. His testimony yesterday I think was extremely disturbing because he demonstrated to my mind utter obliviousness to this maelstrom that is surrounding the Mueller investigation. Seemingly unable to look at these examples of bias by Peter Strzok and many, many others and connect them to what's happening in the investigation. So, when you combine that with the fundamentally unconstitutional nature of an unrestrained independent counsel, I think we are seeing the destruction of the reputation of the Justice Department and the FBI. I'm an alumnus of the Justice Department. I have worked with FBI investigators in a number of capacities over the years. I am just thunder struck at what I have seen in the past six months coming out."

      "utterance": "Right. But you will agree, will you not, that Strzok, who is not a lawyer. He didn't actually put his name on the document, James Comey, who is a lawyer, went to a very distinguished law school, Laura did. He was the one responsible for everything that went forward. So, I think this is kind of a big misdirection as the noose is tightening with all due respect around the president and people close to him seeing one misdirection after another. I think we will see more of them until either Mueller gets fired or he says what he is going to come up with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Here is a fundamental fact. More than one person can commit wrong doing. I think James Comey so badly bungled the Clinton e-mail investigation that Donald Trump should have fired him on January the 20th. He would have been fully justified and nobody would have said obstruction of justice. It's a tragedy that he didn't fire him. But, in the course of the e-mail investigation, as we now see from the e-mails that have come out, we have got people who were so biased against Trump that it seems to me almost inescapable that their bias affected their judgment. This is where Rosenstein's testimony yesterday was so bad because it's as if he is saying I'm not going to connect bias to outcome, which is clear, I'm going to insist that they say in meetings that the FBI, we should not indict Hillary Clinton because otherwise Donald Trump would be elected president. That never happened. I think what Strzok and others did was move Comey, if he wasn't already inclined to do it conclusion there was no requirement for -- that's fundamentally wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Hold on right there, guys, because we also tonight learned more about former FBI Director Comey's decision to characterize Hillary Clinton's e-mails as just extremely careless, rather than the statutory language which would have been grossly negligent. Just tonight Fox News obtained a copy of Comey's actual draft letter that exonerated Clinton. Richard and I were just talking about it. It shows the phrase grossly negligent was deleted in more than one spot. So, perhaps, you know, more alarming is that the draft shows Comey originally was going to state it was reasonably likely so that hostile actors had actually infiltrated Hillary's server but that was also taken out. So, look, Senate investigators tell Fox News now that they expect Strzok is the one who really made all of these edits both to the grossly negligent language and about the infiltration of her e-mail searcher? Richard, I want you to address this infiltration of the e-mail searcher because this gets serious. This is classified information that could have been taken by a foreign actor, and this was hinted at a couple years ago when we were talking about this. It was said at the time it was likely that a foreign entity did manage to penetrate her system because it didn't have the security as one of the guys who testified even like a Gmail program."

      "utterance": "Indulge me, your viewers need to understand what the statue says, whoever having information relating to national defense through gross negligence or let's say simple mindedness permits the information to be delivered to anyone in violation of his trust should be fined or imprisoned. Do we think that Hillary Clinton delivered the information on her server or let me contrast Donald Trump being in the oval office with the Russians giving them, that's where the simple mindedness comes in, giving themselves that we got from al Qaeda through Israeli sources about using computers to blow up airplanes, and, therefore, tipping off Iran. That is textbook within that same statute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "He is the president of the United States. So, I guess, if something is classified in that case, he would probably make the argument. Was he un-classifying it, Ambassador Bolton, I'm not sure how is that is apt in this example when we're talking about thousands and thousands of e- mails that were deleted and a computer system that was maintained completely contrary to the guidelines of how State Department documents and other materials should have been stored. But nevertheless, you know, Richard makes a point. The accusations about President Trump and the Russians behind closed doors and that one meeting."

      "utterance": "Then move to impeach him on that grounds. That's up to you. But let's come back to Hillary, if I had proposed at any of my tenure at the State Department doing what she did, I would have been fired. That's the example of different standards applying. Let's come to the statute in question because you only talked about a piece of it. It's a very comprehensively drafted statute. It starts at the top when you have clear espionage where someone intends to give information to foreigners. It comes down to gross negligence. Now why is gross negligence there? Because being that careless can have exactly the same effect of transmitting sensitive information to an opponent."

But is he looking to kind of in some ways exploit the embarrassment in Alabama to maybe knock out viable populist candidates elsewhere? They're no Roy Moores, but they are populist so they conflate the two. I'm thinking of people like Kelli Ward in Arizona, Danny Tarkanian in New Mexico -- in Nevada. So we've got to think about this. This is where the populists need to be careful and smart, because it's not enough to have just a few national figures support you. No, no, no. You need money and you need some allies within the mainstream GOP to survive, just like President Trump did. Kelli Ward, remember, tried and failed to beat McCain, but, I'm telling you, she is a much better candidate now than she was then. So trying to tag her as far right as the \"New York Times\" attempted to do today is absurd. She would be a fine general election candidate. And the party needs more strong, smart women.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Politics is threatening Christmas in the hometown of Jesus. Nazareth, the up to where Jesus was raised, according to the Bible, is canceling much of its Christmas celebrations this year. The reason? The mayor claims it's all because of President Trump. Nazareth is a mostly Muslim town in modern Israel, but it still holds annual Christmas celebrations. And this year it's different. Mayor Ali Sallam says all the joy has been taken out of the holiday because of President Trump's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Sallam accused Trump of stabbing Palestinians in the back. Well, to be fair, it's not only Muslims who are upset with the decision. Palestinian Christians in the Middle East are vehemently opposed to the move. And as you know the Pope is as well. The decision by Nazareth's mayor could have come with a big cost to his town and its people. The annual celebration is a huge tourist attraction and it's attended by thousands and thousands of pilgrims. But the town ultimately decided to cancel the traditional singing and dancing, not the Christmas market and parade. It's a pity that politics has been allowed to interfere with Christmas in the town where our savior was raised. My friends, we'll be right back."
