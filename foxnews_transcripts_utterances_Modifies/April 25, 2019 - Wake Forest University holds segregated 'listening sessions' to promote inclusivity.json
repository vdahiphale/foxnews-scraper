Secure the border, the opioid: a meeting he went to yesterday, they're trying to tackle that. The ISIS has been -- has been, wiped out. Security safety, these are things that matter in the end.

Tens of thousands of men arriving by sea and by air, armed to the teeth with guns and grenades, on a mission to secure the front and liberate Nazi-occupied France. With news of the strike now public and operational security at stake, Britain's government announced immediate suspension of all overseas travel. The papers explaining it as, quote, \"a new regulation, probably aimed just as much as ending careless talk by travelers as deterring enemy espionage.\" Both governments suspected the Germans might be onto them, admitting, quote, \"a strategic surprise,\" that is the fact that allies claimed to invade Western Europe is no longer possible, but a tactical surprise may be if security is maintained. Forty-two days later, President Roosevelt offered this prayer to our nation and our men. It is the quote of the night. \"God, give us faith.

And he was very supportive of everything I was doing. But the new Joe Biden is something else. Again, or the attempt to be the new Joe Biden."

A lot of guys in the labor unions which is the Biden strength took a chance on Donald Trump. Now, they know it was more than a chance. Now, they're seeing this advantage in their paychecks. Look, suburban women have to be reminded of the things in the end that matter most. I understand why the style, the approach, the tweets, other things have put a lot of people off. But let's look at the real world. Not only economic growth but real efforts to secure the well-being of this country. What are the president's agenda? Secure the border, the opioid: a meeting he went to yesterday, they're trying to tackle that. The ISIS has been -- has been, wiped out. Security safety, these are things that matter in the end. Now, is Joe Biden have some strength in these areas? Yes and no, he's been pretty much wrong on most aspects of foreign policy. But, you know, if he tries to do this imitation of a woke guy, which I think he may try to do, it's just not -- it's just not going to work. There's this too much history there, he should be who he is. You know, he should be himself.

Encourage young people to run for office, they've been training a new generation of leaders in. Helping to get new people to register to vote. So, I think the president made a wise decision not to get involved. Look, this is up to the voters, and the voters are looking for a proven leader. Somebody with an exceptional record, but also someone with a vision for the future. And I think Joe Biden will be able to compete in this crowded field. For obvious reasons, he's a known commodity. But more importantly, he is someone that people in a Democratic Party -- and I also think, Independents and some Republicans know that you can work with Joe Biden. Because this is a politician, as well as a leader that's not afraid to reach across the aisle."

You look at Bill Clinton, very similar in a lot of ways in terms of his ability to energize the party. Is Joe Biden more along the lines of a John Kerry sort of a tried and true, has paid his dues?

The thing about Joe Biden that I think many people respect is that he knows how to fight, he knows how to lead, but he also knows how to compromise. Perhaps, that's too old-school for this new generation of Democrats that want something -- you know, tougher and perhaps they want someone who is more in agreement with their positions and their values. But I do think that Joe Biden has an opportunity to reach out to those thousands of Americans who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but for whatever reason decided not to vote in 2016 or vote for Donald Trump."

He has -- his folks have said that he spoke with Anita Hill, that they had a good conversation, and just to remind those at home, I mean, he was the head of the Judiciary Committee when she spoke out against Clarence Thomas's nomination for the Supreme Court."

That's one of them, of course, and there is the crime bill that he was a major champion of and Bill Bennett, I think laid out some of the other positions that the vice president will have to clarify. Now, that he's a candidate for president of United States, and he's not the vice president running with Barack Obama. He's running to be at the top of the ticket, and he's going to have to respond to not just the Anita Hills of the world, but many Democratic voters as well as others that want to have a real answer to some of those questions. Again, this campaign is not just about his past. I know in 2016, Hillary Clinton had to talk about the crime bill. Hillary Clinton had to address some of the problems in the 1990s. This is about the future and perhaps, there's a generation of voters who were in grade school, elementary school, you know, Martha, I was in class a couple of weeks ago, and some of my students said, they watch me on television when they were in elementary school. And I might -- wow, that's shade. But, you know what, Joe Biden when he was in the United States Senate, as well as vice president, many of these young Democrats and young Americans, millennials, they don't know Joe Biden. They don't know anything about this. And so, they're going to look at Joe Biden, and say, \"Why is he running? I thought his days are over. But I do believe --"

Right now, he's in -- he's in the moderate to centrist lane. He can still become a progressive.

Back then, the party took some heat for splitting up its first seven debates into two separate events right. We have the evening and then we have the undercard. This time the Democrats say that they're going to do things differently. But my next guest, the former Communications Director for the RNC doesn't think that, and the other changes will work. Sean Spicer, former White House Press Secretary writes in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, candidate proliferation, and a Fox News ban will mean the party will fail where the GOP succeeded in 2016.

You've seen the ratings that you and Bret have gotten on your town hall, 2.65 million people. That dwarfs the other outlets combined in many cases throughout their day. And much of the Fox audience is receptive to the Democratic Party so they're left-leaning, their independents. I think these are the folks the Democrats go. And you look at the top folks, understand that Bernie Sanders is leading the pack went on Fox had a very successful outing with you and Bret, I think exposed himself to an audience that he's not getting through the other outlets. And by them banning Fox, at some point -- and I don't want to speak for your -- for our management but at some point, either Fox or another outlet is going to say screw it, we're going put -- we're going to host a debate. And the problem is that when we did this, we had everybody buying in and it was held together at times by some pretty thin duct tape, but it worked and it was successful. The Democrats, by banning people and allowing everybody to get a participation trophy and find different ways to make it on the debate stage, has created a system that isn't going to hold true, because candidates are always going to look for an outlet to reach new voters and Fox and other outlets are going to jump in and fill the void."

And we all know that there are voters who crossed over from being -- in 206 counties across the country who voted for President Obama that voted for President Trump. I think people are very -- a lot more -- you know, we talk about the divisiveness in the country quite a bit, but I also think that a lot of people feel they are not really affiliated with either party, and that they look at the candidates and they try to decide you know, who they think is going to do the best job. In terms of the way that constructing the debates, what the Democrats have said they are going to do right now is do it randomly, Sean. And I know that you wrote about this. You decided you know, if you made a certain cut off, you could be on at night, and if you didn't, you were on the next one down. And if you moved up and you got a great percentage, then you moved up into that you know, prime time tear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "That's right. And the way that Democrats are doing it, they are putting some folks who aren't even pulling at one percent, that they've gotten 65,000 donations of minimum of $1. And I right in the op-ed, this is on my Web site seanspicer.com for those who want to see it, that one candidate, Congressman Delaney is literally offering people $2 to the charity of their choice if they will contribute $1 to his campaign. Now, that is an ingenious way of getting him on the debate stage, but at that point, he still isn't pulling at a minimum of one percent. So he's going to be taking pot shots at the folks at the top, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete and others to find his viral breakout moment. And there's only so long that those folks at the top are going to withstand and say this is ridiculous. Folks who aren't even pulling at one percent are spending all of their time on stage taking pot shots at those of us who are actually garnering significant amounts of supporters within the Democratic Party. I don't think that that's going to be another you know, touchstone of how this system is probably going to fail when they -- when they realize this randomized system might sound good, that everybody gets a participation trophy and gets to show up in one or two nights. But it's not going to hold true for a while when people at the top don't like getting hit by people at the bottom."

Yes, there's too much power in the executive branch. That is not Trump's fault. This was true decades before Donald Trump ever came down on that escalator. This is not his problem. It's Congress' problem. It's one of the reasons I wrote this book, \"Our Lost Declaration\" is to remind the American people that we fought a revolution in order to disaggregate power.

In other cases, by in action by Congress in response to executive action. But in every circumstance, this is a result of Congress' failure, not Donald Trump's.

It's a war that hasn't been declared. That was, I would remind Senator Sanders, was started by President Obama. He got us into this. President Trump hasn't gotten us out of that.

We saw it during the French Revolution, the Cuban Revolution, any left-wing revolution goes to the logical trajectories of where you can end up. There is no theoretical restriction on equality. You can equality of voting, then equality of housing, equality of food. And to get beyond voting and political freedom, you need a level of government that's all inclusive, that forces people to be equal when buying. You and I are not equal, we all have different respective strengths, but that's the point. It takes a level of coercion. And so, we're getting to the limits of where the left can go. You reached the point, the Jussie Smollett case, tragic as it was, was sort of the limit. You can't go any further. Jussie said I'm black, I'm gay, I'm a victim. Where do you beyond that. Well, they had MAGA hats, where do you go beyond that. Well, they were white. Where do you go beyond that? They had bleach. Where do you go beyond that? They had lynch rope. It was two in the morning. And it was so illogical, that the odds of that happening were infinitesimal, but yet people wanted to believe that you show -- you can see where that left-wing evolution is going, it's going to reach a nihilistic point. So, all these issues, Martha, basically infanticide, reparations, Medicare for all, cancellation of debts, 70 to 90 percent income tax rate. Can't go any higher than that. They don't poll very well.

Because the Democrats, whether they like it or not, they are headed in this pipe of trajectory or the cliff and they can't stop it. They know they should stop it but they can't.

Tens of thousands of men arriving by sea and by air, armed to the teeth with guns and grenades, on a mission to secure the front and liberate Nazi-occupied France. With news of the strike now public and operational security at stake, Britain's government announced immediate suspension of all overseas travel. The papers explaining it as, quote, \"a new regulation, probably aimed just as much as ending careless talk by travelers as deterring enemy espionage.\" Both governments suspected the Germans might be onto them, admitting, quote, \"a strategic surprise,\" that is the fact that allies claimed to invade Western Europe is no longer possible, but a tactical surprise may be if security is maintained. Forty-two days later, President Roosevelt offered this prayer to our nation and our men. It is the quote of the night. \"God, give us faith. Faith in our sons, help us to conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country. A peace invulnerable to the scheming's of unworthy men.
