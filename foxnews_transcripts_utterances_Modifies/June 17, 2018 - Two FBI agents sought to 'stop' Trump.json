And throughout this report, you have people openly talking about just breathtaking bias that they have in favor of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump and pledging, promising that they will prevent him from getting elected. At the same time, they are ramping up this investigation of him.  So that is exonerating of Donald Trump.

It is also true that there weren't -- these weren't just about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page' texting their extreme bias. There were five different people involved in this probe that were texting really extreme things, insults against people who voted for Trump, against Trump. The attorney who was actually asking Hillary Clinton questions during that interview she had said, I am with her when he did that. So again, it's not necessarily -- the I.G. is careful to say, there is not hard evidence, but he said I am with her, therefore I'm letting her get off.

Kimberly is a commentator, a long-time friend of the Trump family, a vocal supporter of the president, who is free to date whoever she wants. It might have been better in retrospect if she has mentioned the relationship on the air. But she plans to disclose it if there is any specific discussion involving Donald Jr. What is absurd is for New York Daily News columnist Linda Stasi in a mean-spirited piece that erroneously describes Guilfoyle as a reporter to demand she be fired. Staci sort of apologized for writing that Guilfoyle would be better off picking grapes, saying she didn't know Kimberly is part Puerto Rican. Donald Trump Jr. questioned why Daily News editor approved the piece, tweeting, I guess hypocrisy, sexism and racist rhetoric are alive and well there. And even his estranged wife, Vanessa, tweeted, the lengths people will go to to attack a woman simply because she is dating Don. The era of mega-merger is now a planus (ph).

Maybe it is just a coincidence, that word leaked to Vanity Fair that CNN president Jeff Zucker has a contract that runs through 2020.

Mollie, that scrum, the press in the White House looked like an out of control kindergarten that needed a time out. But as most of the press has acknowledged, this inspector general report, put a serious stain on Jim Comey's reputation. At the same time, the press saying the president was wrong when he said he was totally vindicated because the report didn't examine whether there was collusion or obstruction with Russia."

And it is true that this was focused really on the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe although there was a lot because the same people covered the Hillary Clinton e-mail are -- the same people investigated the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe as investigated the Donald Trump probe. There is a ton of overlap. And throughout this report, you have people openly talking about just breathtaking bias that they have in favor of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump and pledging, promising that they will prevent him from getting elected. At the same time, they are ramping up this investigation of him. So that is exonerating of Donald Trump. It is not fully an exoneration but it one of his main arguments is that the Department of Justice and FBI have had widespread problems with the decision making bias and other problems that affect the investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At the same time, Marie, Jim Comey was a media hero at least until his book tour. And so I think pro-Hillary commentators must be happy that the I.G. slapped him down and revealed that he sat on the last minute charges, the Anthony Weiner laptop and e-mails for more than a month before popping it in the final days of the election."

These FBI officials do have text messages that look terrible. They give the impression of bias. The I.G. report also found no evidence that those political leanings impacted the investigation. Jim Comey I think comes across very badly as a Democrat. Reading what he did which did hurt Hillary Clinton politically, even if that wasn't his intention, reading his sanctimonious decision making processes is very hard for me. So I think sort of how you look at the I.G. report for the opinion commentator is based on where you sit politically in many ways but the president said a number of things about the report that are not accurate and it's on the media to call those falsehoods out when he does that."

So, this is all unfolding as Paul Manafort was taken to jail, waiting trial because of witness tampering. But let's come back to these incriminating texts with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. We've seen lots of really biased texts before. We hadn't seen this one. I guess it was somehow held back. But I think it has made a lot of headlines because it's just so over the top whether or not they were actually able to carry that out. These people hated Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. First of all, I do want to make one point that the I.G. specifically said that they couldn't determine that waiting to handle out Weiner laptop was a decision free from bias to basically strongly suggests that Peter Strzok was so biased that he made a bad decision on trying to pretend that those e-mails haven't been found on Weiner' laptop and instead focusing on the Russian investigation. It is also true that there weren't -- these weren't just about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page' texting their extreme bias. There were five different people involved in this probe that were texting really extreme things, insults against people who voted for Trump, against Trump. The attorney who was actually asking Hillary Clinton questions during that interview she had said, I am with her when he did that. So again, it's not necessarily -- the I.G. is careful to say, there is not hard evidence, but he said I am with her, therefore I'm letting her get off. But I think reasonable people can say this level of bias is very problematic for two very politically sensitive investigations."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Right. And trash her which the I.G. says was not good practice. What's interesting is law enforcement and the FBI have historically been much more conservative. They are nonpartisan but they traditionally been much more conservative if not Republican leaning. So yes, these messages look terrible. But we have to rely on the I.G.'s determination that they did not find any horrid evidence that this bias impacted the investigation."

This I.G. report absolutely confirms everything he said about Rod Rosenstein's bad decision making and failure to adhere to policy, his usurpation of authority and the like. We've also been told a lot of news about how you're not allowed to criticize the FBI, that they are beyond reproach.

You did see a lot of the same people who criticize Barack Obama meeting with Castro, criticizing the way that Trump was with Kim. There is this other stream that doesn't get a lot of coverage in the media which is a more realist approach to foreign policy that does seek to have a different approach. I just want to say one thing about the media's criticism of the praise of Kim. It would be much easier to believe that they were genuine about this if they hadn't spent that entire Olympics praising the sister of Kim and talking about how happy (ph) she was.

But a friend of the president's son who has been separated from his wife for more than nine months, says they haven't hidden the relationship. Kimberly is a commentator, a long-time friend of the Trump family, a vocal supporter of the president, who is free to date whoever she wants. It might have been better in retrospect if she has mentioned the relationship on the air. But she plans to disclose it if there is any specific discussion involving Donald Jr. What is absurd is for New York Daily News columnist Linda Stasi in a mean-spirited piece that erroneously describes Guilfoyle as a reporter to demand she be fired. Staci sort of apologized for writing that Guilfoyle would be better off picking grapes, saying she didn't know Kimberly is part Puerto Rican. Donald Trump Jr. questioned why Daily News editor approved the piece, tweeting, I guess hypocrisy, sexism and racist rhetoric are alive and well there. And even his estranged wife, Vanessa, tweeted, the lengths people will go to to attack a woman simply because she is dating Don. The era of mega-merger is now a planus (ph). The deal that Disney had to buy the entertainment properties of 21st Century Fox is now being challenged by Comcast which owns NBC and has made an all-cash bid that is 19 percent higher than the Disney offer. This was the immediate outcome of a federal judge approving despite President Trump's personal opposition, AT&T's $85 billion takeover of Time Warner, whose networks include HBO and CNN. Maybe it is just a coincidence, that word leaked to Vanity Fair that CNN president Jeff Zucker has a contract that runs through 2020. But even if AT&T leaves CNN alone, a company that controls the pipes that carry television and the web as does Comcast is getting deeper to controlling content which could mean higher prices and fewer voices for consumers. Ahead on \"Media Buzz,\" I asked actor and director Rob Reiner why when it comes to President Trump, he is throwing out word like treason.

But if you're going to in the press room as an accredited journalist, I'm going to you a question, a real question."

      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Right, right. And I completely agree. I've been in that room. I am (Inaudible). When you're a journalist -- I mean rule number one of journalism is don't put yourself into the story. You are there to collect facts and then give the facts to your audience, your reader, your viewer. So he broke every rule of journalism by making it about him self, making it personal about the press secretary. Sarah Sanders was very professional. So he did not respect."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, a rare moment of agreement. Cathy Areu, Emily Jashinsky, thanks for a great conversation. Coming up, I go toe to toe with Rob Reiner on his harsh Hollywood (Inaudible) against President Trump and his unhappiness with the media and that includes Fox."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Rob Reiner is an unabashed Hollywood liberal and actor and activist, who uses harsh rhetoric about Donald Trump and has to (Inaudible) of the coverage of the President. We sat down here in Washington to talk about that and the new film he directs and stars in, Shock and Awe, about the media's failures, except for one news outlet in the build up to the Iraq war."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You're a fierce critic of President Trump (Inaudible). I get it. But Robert Deniro goes on the Tony Award stage and says F Trump and gets a standing ovation. Can you see how that would be offensive to the 45 percent of the country that supports this President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I can also see how it's offensive to some of the people who don't support the President. You know listen. Everybody is entitled to you know free speech. They can say whatever they want. But I don't think that is particularly helpful for those of us who don't want to see Trump in office and don't want to see him continue to be in office."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you about some of your own words. You tweeted the other day when an American President attacks our closest allies and embraces enemy a hostile enemy powers you say he's in a conspiracy to commit treason, now so because you disagree with Trump's foreign policy, which you have every right to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "I don't say he is. I said one can only conclude. And there is a big difference."

      "utterance": "That's a fine distinction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "It is a fine distinction. But I don't know whether or not he committed treason. That will be something that we either discover or don't discover as Mueller's investigation, which unfortunately the house and senate investigations are not moving along. So we'll have to see what happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "you don't see that as an overly inflammatory word to use about a President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "It is a very inflammatory word. But if it turns out to be -- let's put it this way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "But let's put it this way. From what I see right now, there is a lot of blanks that need to be filled in for sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "After the election, you called the outcome the greatest attack on this democracy since 1941. I was kind of stunned by that because you are comparing the lawful election of a candidate who won the Electoral College to the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. Now that you're older and wiser, was that going a little too far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "No, actually I feel a little bit more -- I think -- not only agree with that, but I would go even further, because we are not talking about -- when we start looking at what happened to America, people have to really understand this. And this is one of the most of difficult parts of understanding the Russians."

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "I am not talking about the election that we had and electing Donald Trump. I'm not talking about. What I am talking about it's really important to understand this, because this is the key to what's here. We are talking about a foreign enemy power influencing an election. In the world of cyber warfare, it is insidious. And we don't necessarily feel it. We do know the capacity. We are learning the capacity, not just from a disinformation campaign or active measures, which the Soviets and the Russians now have been doing it forever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Just to clarify, you're comments are aimed more at Russia and the meddling."
    },

      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. So it's actually state-run media that backs up the President. I presume you know that Fox has a thriving news division with Chris Wallace and Bret Baier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "With a whole bunch of reporters."
    },

      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So I think your label was too broad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Well, I also tweeted out about Shepard Smith, and by the way, I have met Shepard Smith. He's a great guy and he is reporting the news. There is no question about it. He is telling the truth, and so does Chris Wallace. And you know I haven't seen as much of Bret Baier, but I believe he probably is too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "And I do know there is a difference between a news reporting and opinion and editorial and all of that. But what I am saying is the editorial part of Fox News which is, you know Hannity, and Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Those shows are not just -- they are really in support of Trump. And that is -- Fox News has a good rating, has a very strong rating. So there is a chunk of media that is verbally and overtly in support of Donald Trump. That's just true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, there was a chunk of media that was overtly in support of Barack Obama, including places like MSNBC. But let's turn to the press conduct in the run-up to the Iraq war, which is the topic of Shock and Awe. It's a story I covered intensively."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You are playing John Wolcott. He was the Washington Bureau Chief (Inaudible), an old colleague of mine. In terms of name ID, would you concede that Tom Hanks had an easier time paying Bret Bradley and you playing John Wolcott?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the funny thing about that. I wasn't supposed to play that part. That was -- Alec Baldwin was set to play that part. And we had been shooting for a week with Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones, and on the Saturday before he was supposed to shoot on Monday, he called and said he's not doing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He dropped out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "He dropped out. I said oh my god, what do I do? So my wife, Michelle who is one of the producers with me, she suggest that I play the part. And I thought oh my god, I don't know. I don't like directing and acting. And I then I realized I'm playing you know -- I said I am available so I will do it. And then she says to me the one bit of direction I got. Because I'm playing John Wolcott, she said try to be less Jewish. And I thought I don't know, I am from the Bronx. I will see what I can do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right."

    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "More now with Rob Reiner as we turn to his new film about the press, the Bush administration, and Iraq."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So you say the media weren't tough enough in the run-up to the Iraq war. They were not just tough enough. They were nonexistent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "There were some exceptions. There were stories that the Washington Post (Inaudible). In one scene, you playing Wolcott called the Philadelphia Inquirer and (Inaudible) and you complained they are not running your stories."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right. And that was the case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What was behind that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Well, that actually happened. I mean Knight Ridder news service was supplied to a number of newspapers around the country, and we talk about it in the film, that they were represented by a lot of military bases that got there. And they you know -- (Inaudible) my character says we don't write for people who send other people's kids to war. We write for people whose kids get sent to war. And so we were concerned that ours -- the Knight Ridder stories were not getting out. And many of the Knight Ridder papers did not print."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "They're not getting out because."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "They didn't print them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, but even in the broader media, were they not getting a lot of pickup because of the mindset in the mainstream media (Inaudible) Bob Woodward told me after the war that he was part of the group think, because obviously the Bush administration sold this war very hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right, right. Two reasons, one is that we were swept up in patriotism, 9/11. And people just went with the group think. The other thing was the Bush administration, in a smart way and from their standpoint, they never responded to these articles. They gave them no oxygen. They didn't refute them. They didn't talk about them, so it never got any attention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The underlying assumption, it was more than an assumption, the film was the Bush administration was lying about Iraq."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But that as opposed to cherry-picking intelligence as opposed to not being skeptical about the intelligence. But even John Wolcott says in an interview, to this day says he doesn't know that people are lying. That seems like a bit of a stretch on your part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Well, we were saying that Cheney lied. We say Cheney lied at this one thing about the idea in general because he had -- he talked about a connection between Mohammad Atta, Iraqi intelligence which didn't exist. He talked about they were on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon. They talked about aluminum tubes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "-- that turned out to be untrue however terrible that is, is that necessarily the same as lying deliberately peddling falsehoods."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's true. But if you do know that you've already made an assumption that you want to go to war and that you are crafting bits and pieces of intelligence in order to make that case and ignoring the vast amount of intelligence that says we're not sure about this. We don't have good intelligence because we haven't been inside Iraq with weapons inspectors in four years. I would argue that you're lying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At the same time this President has gotten overwhelmingly negative coverage. He did during the campaign. Everybody acknowledges that. You should in fairness be also a part of messaging for fair and independent coverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "He got a lot of negative coverage. There is no question about it. But I don't think in the -- during the primary season and even during the general, he got the kind of -- there is one thing to say negative coverage and one thing to say due diligence and scrutiny, real scrutiny. I don't think he got that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINER",
      "utterance": "Oh, god. Oh, my god. You know I didn't know, because I was going to go on (Inaudible) show, you know. And they said well, Scaramucci. I didn't know he was going to be there. Are we going to do a show like you know Crossfire?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
