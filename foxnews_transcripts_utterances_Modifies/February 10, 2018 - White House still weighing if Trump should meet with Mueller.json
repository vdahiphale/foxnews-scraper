      "sentences": "Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT. I'm Paul Gigot. President Trump Friday night declined to release a classified Democratic memo rebutting GOP claims that the FBI abused its power to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The White House sending a letter to the House Intelligence Committee asking it to work with the Department of Justice to remove sensitive material from the 10-page document. Democrats are calling the move politically motivated and hypocritical. But the president responded Saturday morning, tweeting, 'The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo, which they knew, because of sources and methods and more, would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon, they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to redo and send back in proper form. '  Let's bring in 'Wall Street Journal ' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnist, Kim Strassel.  Dan, what do you make of the president's decision to say, send it back and not declassify and renegotiate?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, we have not seen the Democrats' memo. We don't know what was redacted. We have to assume that since they talked to FBI Director Christopher Wray and deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, about the content of the memo that there's something substantive at the center of it. Mr. Wray and Rosenstein had their own letter that they sent simultaneously to the Democrats raising these questions. And I have to say, Paul, god knows what the American people are making of this right now. I mean, they must feel like they were sucked in a John Cooray (ph) novel. It's hard enough for us to try to figure out. We have our own sources and methods. So you have one set of memos dueling with another set of memos. But I have to say, go back to the beginning of this. This is ultimately about whether Trump was colluding with the Russians.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT. I'm Paul Gigot. President Trump Friday night declined to release a classified Democratic memo rebutting GOP claims that the FBI abused its power to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The White House sending a letter to the House Intelligence Committee asking it to work with the Department of Justice to remove sensitive material from the 10-page document. Democrats are calling the move politically motivated and hypocritical. But the president responded Saturday morning, tweeting, 'The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo, which they knew, because of sources and methods and more, would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon, they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to redo and send back in proper form. ' Let's bring in 'Wall Street Journal ' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnist, Kim Strassel. Dan, what do you make of the president's decision to say, send it back and not declassify and renegotiate? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, we have not seen the Democrats' memo. We don't know what was redacted. We have to assume that since they talked to FBI Director Christopher Wray and deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, about the content of the memo that there's something substantive at the center of it. Mr. Wray and Rosenstein had their own letter that they sent simultaneously to the Democrats raising these questions. And I have to say, Paul, god knows what the American people are making of this right now. I mean, they must feel like they were sucked in a John Cooray (ph) novel. It's hard enough for us to try to figure out. We have our own sources and methods. So you have one set of memos dueling with another set of memos. But I have to say, go back to the beginning of this. This is ultimately about whether Trump was colluding with the Russians."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, on the Democratic memo, 10 pages, the Republican memo only four, so just on its face and length, the chances increase that you could get some compromising of sensitive material. But I have to say, my view is Trump ought to not play this game of this memo, that memo. Just get the original FISA application out in total. Let the American people see it. And all four of them, frankly. We know it was re-upped three times. Let them see it all."

      "utterance": "Look, and they've had so much time to do this now, and instead they just spent another five days letting Democrats play this game. They've been in possession of this memo for that long. And it was pretty clear from the start, my sources say, that this was sent up to him in a way that did contain information that was going to put the White House all along in a position where they had to say something about redactions, and then Democrats could turn around and say, you got a double standard, you're hiding something. Just get it out there, get the FISA application out there, finish un-redacting the Grassley referral letter that went out this week that has to do with Christopher Steele, and some of the 302 forms, the interviews that the FBI did with their sources. Let the American public see what really happened."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

And the Grassley referral, what was important about it this week was it dismantled Christopher Steele's credibility. It showed he was out talking to the press, even though the FBI told him not to. That was undermining the FBI probe. And that he, potentially, lied to the FBI about having done so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, there's another thing that's interesting that we learned here, and that's a couple of names from the Clinton era have appeared, Sidney Blumenthal and Cody Shearer, long-time friends of Hillary Clinton. And it turns out, Kim, that they may have played a role in getting some information to Steele. Tell us about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, they didn't may have, it did happen. We now know that not only was the Clinton campaign funding this dossier effort, but it was providing information that went into the dossier. They came up with some reports, they funneled them to a middleman at the Obama State Department, a guy who worked for John Kerry, and he got them onto Mr. Steele. who incorporated them into his dossier. So this is another reason to wonder, look, if you're a super spy, like Christopher Steele has been presented, do you -- does it not fail your sniff test to go out and start putting information from noted political operators into your research?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And yet, James Comey, the former FBI director, under whom all of this happened, said, well, we trusted Steele because we knew him. But with all of this complicated partisan and political ties and potential motivation, this just makes the case even more to get it all out to see what they were looking at, so that the American public doesn't have to say, well, I trust this Republican because I'm a Republican, or I trust Republicans or vice versa. Let's see who really is telling the truth."

The president's lawyers have reportedly advised him against sitting down for a wide-ranging interview with Mueller, and are instead looking to have Trump answer as many questions as possible in writing. The president told reporters in January that he was looking forward to testifying under oath. So what should he do? Let's ask C. Boyden Gray. He served as White House counsel to President George H. W. Bush. So welcome, Boyden. What would you recommend that the president do drawing on your experience of advising presidents?"

But he should try to get a very constrained, well-limited interview, better interrogatories. But if it has to be in person, he will have his lawyers there. The central problem is there really is no scope limit to what Mueller's investigating and, therefore, there would be no limit to what he would ask. And the lawyers have to get some sort of constraint on that, otherwise, you couldn't prepare the president. He couldn't prepare for it because you wouldn't know what you were being asked."

      "utterance": "But does that limit really, ultimately, stand on the good will or the forbearance of Mueller because, as you say, he has leverage here, could take a subpoena to the grand jury, which would make the president look bad politically if he didn't cooperate voluntarily. But ultimately, is it really up to Mueller or can the president's lawyer really insist on a set of written questions?"

And I think that there's no reason to expect the White House counsel and the others in the White House to have rejected his being hired into this very important job, which he's apparently done extremely well, just on the basis of a couple of allegations. The trouble is for any employee, potential employee, staff member, is the security clearance. That's when the going gets tough. In this case, it looks as though the going was too tough. He wasn't getting his security clearance. And that's the acid test. At some point, the staff, the White House chief of staff, the White House counsel, has to fish or cut bait and say, I'm sorry, you can't -- they are not going to give you security clearance and so you can't stay in this job. The president has the right to reverse a recommendation of no security clearance, but I don't think that's ever happened. It didn't happen when I was there."

So they benefited from the stock market more than the average American worker did.

Those are the things that Fed will pay attention to and may, indeed, result in higher interest rates.

My colleague, Nick Eberstadt has a great article in the current ' Commentary ' magazine talking about how many times, among other things, how many times South Korea, over the past 15 years, has subsidized North Korea under the mistaken view that if they only give them enough money, everything will work out. You have to ask the question, did President Moon of South Korea subsidize or provide other economic incentives for North Koreans to do this. I'm very worried the answer to that might be yes, which means that with a little help from their friends, Kim Jong-Un and his regime are actually empowered, not just the propaganda victory but have received economic benefits."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Did the U.S. -- I'm talking about President Trump and the administration -- have any choice, however, except to basically go along with what President Moon of Korea -- South Korea wanted in this because, you know, they obviously have a huge stake in the Olympics going well. And you didn't want to have the U.S. somehow interfere with that. What choice did the U.S. have as a policy political matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "I don't think there was any choice. I put this down, again, to North Koreans' propaganda skill. The games are in South Korea, obviously. We have sent Vice President Pence on a very difficult and sensitive mission to try and show unity with South Korea, with Japan, but also, as he said, not to allow North Korea to have a completely open field for their propaganda efforts. And so I think he's got a difficult job. But it's important that we remind people that behind all of this blue smoke and mirrors, the nuclear and ballistic missile programs are continuing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "One of the things that the administration seems to be doing with Vice President Pence as strategy is starting to put human rights on the table, that is how North Korea treat its own people and visitors. So Otto Warmbier, the father of the man that North Koreans killed after they prevented him from leaving the country, he's going to attend with Mike Pence. The president met this week with some human right activists and defectors from North Korea at the White House. That's a turn from the Obama administration, and, I think, also the George W. Bush administration, which didn't like to talk about human rights in North Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the characteristics of the rogue states that we worry around the world, not including Iran, along with North Korea, they oppress their own people, they engage in international terrorism, and they pursue weapons of mass destruction. So I think that President Trump is well advised to find whatever arguments he can to try and show just how bad this regime is. Because notwithstanding the vice president's announcement of even stricter sanctions, I don't think we have time for sanctions to work. I think we are down to some very hard choices. Let me say, as an alumnus of the Bush 43 administration, look at the last 18 years. How many times have you heard one administration after another say tough new sanctions on North Korea. What have we been doing for 18 years that they are any tough new sanctions left to apply? That's why I think we are perilously close to the end of this road here. The president has a hard decision about whether to use military force or whether to acquiesce and North Korea becoming a nuclear weapon state."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, Ambassador, what they would say is that we are going to start to slap sanctions on Chinese companies that do business and other companies in Asia that do business with North Korea, and say, your choice is this, you either keep doing business with North Korea or you do business with us, you can't have it both ways. That's where I think this is going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "That may be. If we had done that 15 years ago, it might make difference. CIA Director Mike Pompeo said several times that North Korea is perhaps a handful of months away from being able to target thermal nuclear weapons on cities in the United States. So do we have a year for the secondary sanctions effort to proceed? I'm not sure we do. We don't have five years or 10 years, that's for sure. We are down to counting on our fingers and toes, I'm afraid, how close North Korea may be."

      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Right. And whether China pays the slightest bit of attention. You know, to harm China economically through sanctions, we have to understand that the United States will feel some pain, too, because of the closeness of the economic relationships. How are the New York banks going to warm up to that?"

The Acela Express was traveling from Washington, D.C., when the mechanical failure occurred, causing two of the train cars to separate. The episode is the latest in a string of accidents for the passenger railroad. Last Sunday, an Amtrak train struck a freight train parked on the tracks in South Carolina, killing two and injuring more than a hundred. And a chartered Amtrak train carrying Republican lawmakers to a policy retreat slammed into a garbage truck in Virginia, killing one and injuring several others. Amtrak's latest woes coming as details of President Trump's $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan are set to be released next week. We are back with Dan Henninger, Kate Bachelder Odell and Allysia Finley. So, Allysia, Amtrak, you take it once in a while. Why are they having so many problems?"

They want to expand service. They don't want to put money into safety. And there's a trade-off, direct trade-off between these things."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, we had -- after Allysia wrote a pretty tough editorial of Amtrak last year, we had the whole entourage come in and see us. And I think the CEO has since resigned who came in to see us. But it's a real difficult problem they talked about because so much of the infrastructure is really old."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And I think one of the things going on here is that we are dealing with, whether it's air transportation, which we've had fiascoes recently, as JFK bags piled up everywhere -- these are increasingly complex systems. And the private sector, by and large, has done a pretty good job dealing with complexity. Consider what Amazon does or FedEx, the modern shipping industry, inventory control. But the public sector is so far behind the curb in the acquisition of the software or the knowledge to deal with these complex systems that it evitable results in these kinds of fiascoes. And it's not going to get better because people want increasingly want transportation, whether it's trains or airplanes, to get from here to there. And so the public sector is going to be pressured. And I think we will see more of these kinds of mistakes."

      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a little bit of both. Amtrak is losing money. Passenger service is not profitable in this country. And you cannot ride a train from New York to Miami, which is ones that crashed by the way, and make money off that line."
