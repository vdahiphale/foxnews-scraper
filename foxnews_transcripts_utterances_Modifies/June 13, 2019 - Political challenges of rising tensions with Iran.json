All this raising the tensions in the Middle East and specifically that region. We will start there with our panel shortened tonight because of the town hall in just minutes. Let's bring them in.  In New York, Bill McGurn, Main Street columnist for the \"Wall Street Journal\"; and Susan Page Washington bureau chief at \"U.S.A. Today\". Bill -- let's start with you. Obviously it's a different thing when the Secretary of State comes out and says Iran is responsible.  BILL MCGURN, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Right. Look the President has made clear he's willing to negotiate but part of the negotiations are being honest. And in the past, we have covered up what Iran has done. And I think the Secretary is right. They are feeling the squeeze and they should be called out.   I also think that there probably needs to be a response to this.",

And as we heard from the supreme leader, quite an embarrassment for the Japanese Prime Minister who was there apparently carrying a letter from President Trump which got rebuffed by the supreme leader.
