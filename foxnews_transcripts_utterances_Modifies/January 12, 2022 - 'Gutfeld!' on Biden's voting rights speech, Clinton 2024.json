All right. Now to the actual news and care. Education secretary Miguel Cardona is facing calls to resign as a national school board -- official claims he solicited the letter comparing protesting parents to domestic terrorists. You can tell the letter came from the secretary of education because all the spelling mistakes. Thanks, Judge. If you remember the letter, which the board has since apologized for, called for federal action to address hostilities toward school boards as possible domestic terrorism, it's suggested using the Patriot Act against parents. Now that's patriotism arresting a soccer mom for raising her voice at a public meeting. Yes. Basically it's turned -- concern parents into ISIS and khakis. How long before they start waterboarding the kids to get their parents' Netflix passwords? But that's politics these days. The government is cool with the Taliban tootling around on abandoned Blackhawks. But they put Mr. And Mrs. Johnson on a watch list for asking why kids are segregated by race. The three R's have gone from reading, writing and rithmetic to racism, racism, racism. Even President Biden's Department of Justice relied on the letter and creating its own memo directly the FBI to investigate threats of violence in order to combat a disturbing trend of harassment of school officials. So we now live in a world where hardened violent criminals are back on the street five minutes after being arrested. But the FBI will kick your door down at dawn with guns drawn if you leave a nasty message on your kids science teachers blackboard. Right kid, they don't teach science anymore. Basically, Joe weaponize the DOJ to silence people who are making a stink. The school board's tolerate speech like their substitute teachers with a hangover. They want everybody to sit down and shut up and no one learns a thing. Of course, since that letter, things have only gotten worse. Which could be the motto under Joe's official White House portrait. Witnessed the performance of him yesterday, emphasis on performance, who in Georgia once again split America into two camps. You either on his side, or you're an evil racist. And that's the new stick. Whose side do you want to be on?",

I think Biden was his babysitter. But like his phone number and how to get to the Oval Office. He's forgotten all of that. Just as he's forgotten his praise for former Klan leader Robert Byrd. Apparently, the only White House -- the only white sheets Joe knows are the waterproof ones on his bed. That's unfair. That's unfair, Judge, I can't believe you wrote that. So as usual, the so-called Uniter did nothing but divide casting any critic of his election changes as an attack on democracy. And in this effort to get rid of the filibuster, Joe happily screamed at America like the judge does when any staffer makes eye contact with her.",

And if you speak up about school policy, voting integrity or supporting the police, they'll tear through you like Brian Stelter and a bag of Funyuns. It wouldn't be something if Joe tried to reason with the people he disagrees with, but instead, he does worse than write them off. He writes them up as white supremacist, bigots, racist, even terrorists. Makes you long for the good old days. I mean, way, way back oh, I don't know, let's say 2019.

Apparently when career criminal Willie Rolan was confronted by a store clerk, he brandished the knife and said (BLEEP) you. I'm taking everything and walked out. Making an excellent future divorce attorney. But he was got when he came back later that day to rob the same store. So congrats to the store for earning repeat business, I guess. But thanks to new D.A. Alvin Bragg whose policies downgrade serious offenses and keep convicts out of jail. The knife wielding purpose later released without bail. He may as well rob that business again. Three more felonies and he gets a court ordered foot rub. The judge wanted to lock him up and said thanks to the D.A. his hands were tied, unlike the perps. And that's the message to store clerks everywhere is clear. Your safety doesn't matter. Meanwhile, Chicago almost 100 people charged with murder aren't in jail, but instead are on home electronic monitoring where they can now murder family members. Home monitoring was created in the 80s to deal with prison overcrowding and wasn't meant for violent offenders but not anymore. Mayor Lori Lightfoot seen here looking shellshock all the time is blaming it on judges following a 2017 reform limiting cash bail. So, at least she's finally coming around to the problem.

The piece titled: \"What the public keeps getting wrong about pedophilia,\" features researchers seeking to make a distinction between attraction to minors and child sexual abuse. Well, thanks for clearing that up you sanctimonious sickos. Something tells me that the public's getting a lot more right on this than you cretins. A quote from the article goes like this: \"Not all people who sexually abused children are pedophiles.\" Well, how is that? Some pedophiles never abused children, experts say, and some people who sexually abused children do not sexually prefer them. What? Sounds like these scientists are running PR for the pedophile lobby. After an outcry, they deleted their Twitter thread of the article and change the title of their Web site to the complicated research behind pedophilia. But I'm sorry this isn't complicated. Pedophilia isn't a disorder. It isn't a social ill or a personality quirk. No more than a rapist is someone who has trouble making friends. And the more time we spend pontificating on terminology, the more we normalize the most vile behavior on the planet. Thankfully, USA Today was destroyed for appearing to de-stigmatize pedophiles.

All right. Now to the actual news and care. Education secretary Miguel Cardona is facing calls to resign as a national school board -- official claims he solicited the letter comparing protesting parents to domestic terrorists. You can tell the letter came from the secretary of education because all the spelling mistakes. Thanks, Judge. If you remember the letter, which the board has since apologized for, called for federal action to address hostilities toward school boards as possible domestic terrorism, it's suggested using the Patriot Act against parents. Now that's patriotism arresting a soccer mom for raising her voice at a public meeting. Yes. Basically it's turned -- concern parents into ISIS and khakis. How long before they start waterboarding the kids to get their parents' Netflix passwords? But that's politics these days. The government is cool with the Taliban tootling around on abandoned Blackhawks. But they put Mr. And Mrs. Johnson on a watch list for asking why kids are segregated by race. The three R's have gone from reading, writing and rithmetic to racism, racism, racism. Even President Biden's Department of Justice relied on the letter and creating its own memo directly the FBI to investigate threats of violence in order to combat a disturbing trend of harassment of school officials. So we now live in a world where hardened violent criminals are back on the street five minutes after being arrested. But the FBI will kick your door down at dawn with guns drawn if you leave a nasty message on your kids science teachers blackboard. Right kid, they don't teach science anymore. Basically, Joe weaponize the DOJ to silence people who are making a stink. The school board's tolerate speech like their substitute teachers with a hangover. They want everybody to sit down and shut up and no one learns a thing. Of course, since that letter, things have only gotten worse. Which could be the motto under Joe's official White House portrait. Witnessed the performance of him yesterday, emphasis on performance, who in Georgia once again split America into two camps. You either on his side, or you're an evil racist. And that's the new stick. Whose side do you want to be on?"

And all these comparisons that Joe made are Democrats that Joe actually once loved. I mean, it's Biden who repeatedly praised Wallace in the past even bragging about being praised by him. I think Biden was his babysitter. But like his phone number and how to get to the Oval Office. He's forgotten all of that. Just as he's forgotten his praise for former Klan leader Robert Byrd. Apparently, the only White House -- the only white sheets Joe knows are the waterproof ones on his bed. That's unfair. That's unfair, Judge, I can't believe you wrote that. So as usual, the so-called Uniter did nothing but divide casting any critic of his election changes as an attack on democracy. And in this effort to get rid of the filibuster, Joe happily screamed at America like the judge does when any staffer makes eye contact with her."

It wouldn't be something if Joe tried to reason with the people he disagrees with, but instead, he does worse than write them off. He writes them up as white supremacist, bigots, racist, even terrorists. Makes you long for the good old days. I mean, way, way back oh, I don't know, let's say 2019.

Another day, another failure of progressive policies and liberal-run cities. This week in New York, an ex-con who stole more than two grand worth of stuff by threatening a drugstore worker with a knife had his first degree armed robbery charges reduced to misdemeanor petty larceny. Apparently when career criminal Willie Rolan was confronted by a store clerk, he brandished the knife and said (BLEEP) you. I'm taking everything and walked out. Making an excellent future divorce attorney. But he was got when he came back later that day to rob the same store. So congrats to the store for earning repeat business, I guess. But thanks to new D.A. Alvin Bragg whose policies downgrade serious offenses and keep convicts out of jail. The knife wielding purpose later released without bail. He may as well rob that business again. Three more felonies and he gets a court ordered foot rub. The judge wanted to lock him up and said thanks to the D.A. his hands were tied, unlike the perps. And that's the message to store clerks everywhere is clear. Your safety doesn't matter. Meanwhile, Chicago almost 100 people charged with murder aren't in jail, but instead are on home electronic monitoring where they can now murder family members. Home monitoring was created in the 80s to deal with prison overcrowding and wasn't meant for violent offenders but not anymore. Mayor Lori Lightfoot seen here looking shellshock all the time is blaming it on judges following a 2017 reform limiting cash bail. So, at least she's finally coming around to the problem. But with these repeat offenders the justice systems literally a revolving door."

Because of a bad cop here, there. I believe in bad cops, I had 2896 days in prison because of a bad cop. But I also believe I have a real street cred on this because I live with a lot of those guys when I was gone. And here's what they do. When they the cops away, the mice play. And they have what's called a criminal mind. This is what they do for a living, most there. And when they feel like the police are on the run, and the politicians don't have the backs of the police, and that they actually are worried about the gangbangers and the organized criminals, they do what they're doing and as a result of that, everybody is not safe. And one last thing I appreciate you saying about the bargain hunter criminally you're talking about, but in Chicago is so bad, they're not bargain hunting anymore. They're coming to the downtown area, Michigan Avenue, they're grabbing and looting and crashing and all the rest of they're doing. And as a result of that, the whole city is now subject to violence.

Pedophilia isn't a disorder. It isn't a social ill or a personality quirk. No more than a rapist is someone who has trouble making friends.
