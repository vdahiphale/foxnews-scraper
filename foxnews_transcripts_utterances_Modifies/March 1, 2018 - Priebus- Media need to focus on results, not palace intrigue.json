The great one Mark Levin, Tomi Lahren and Reince Priebus and many will be here for reaction.  This is a massive development today. The FBI may have, in fact, broken the law and violated their own protocol when getting a FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page. This according to brand new letter out tonight from the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.  Also tonight, the important questions are being asked. We should have answers very soon. And also tonight, Trump Russia collusion crusader Adam Schiff is admitting we have the tape. He has seen no evidence that this collusion exists. Former Clinton independent counsel -- even Ken Starr, he's saying Robert Mueller is way beyond his mandate. So, is this even more proof that the investigation has been and continues to be a witch- hunt? And also breaking right now, Vladimir Putin, he is unveiling nuclear weapons that he claims can avoid detection. We are going to explain tonight why the liberal media, Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton are all to blame.  And the liberal mayor of Oakland, California, under fire for aiding and abetting criminal illegal immigrants. He is actually warning them about federal ICE raids. Is the mayor putting law enforcement and American lives in danger? The short answer, yes. Also, FOX News reporting that the commanding officer during the Florida school shooting ordered some deputies on the scene not to enter the school. This answers a ton of questions.  A lot of breaking news. We get started in our breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. These are massive and huge breaking developments tonight about what is severe Obama era FISA abuses. This letter, just released tonight, to the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes is detailing how the FBI may have literally broken the law and violated bureau protocols when a painting that FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. In this letter released tonight, Nunes points out specific DOJ guidelines when it comes to FISA surveillance. He writes, quote: 'Under the subsection FISA verification and accuracy procedures, the FBI itself acknowledges this importance, quote: the accuracy of information contained within FISA applications is of the utmost importance, only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications, FISA warrants to the court.'   Given this new information, Chairman Nunes, he is now demanding the DOJ explain if, in fact, these protocols are still in place. We already know the answer. They never verified this. And if they are, the chairman wants to know how officials will be punished for violating this law, lying to a FISA judge and not following protocol. This letter also points out how using this false information in a FISA court could violate several laws. Look at them on the screen, 18 USC 242, using color of law to conduct a targeted investigation based on the pretext of law enforcement, you have 50 USC 1809, surveillance conducted under color of law in a manner not authorized by a FISA conspiracy, obstruction of justice and contempt of court. What this means is the scandal is getting bigger and bigger unlike an abuse of power we have ever seen in the history of this country. That's why we are unpeeling layer after layer of this onion. Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, Jason Chaffetz, the great one Mark Levin will all have reaction to this tonight. And also breaking, we have more evidence the Trump-Russia collusion narrative for 20 months is a complete farce.  Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, you know, the ranking member of the House Intel Committee, long time professional Trump hater, he is now admitting that the scary, damning, earth-shattering information that he has now been playing up for more than a year is already in the public domain.

Adam Schiff is accusing Trump of collusion with little more speculation, rumor and phony Russian dossier that it was never corroborated or verified. Do you see how severe this is?   We may well find out in coming weeks or months that Schiff's constant anti-Trump five alarm fires has been nothing more than political hyperbole meant to damage a sitting president that you voted for, so he could win favor with his liberal base and get hired by conspiracy TV MSNBC. And is probably why, according to the RNC, Schiff has appeared on television 227 times since President Trump's inauguration. So, it's only a matter of time where NBC hires him. Maybe he'll take over for Matt Lauer who has been out for a while.  Also brand new tonight, Robert Mueller now facing criticism for someone who has intimate knowledge of special counsel investigations. Kenneth Starr, you might remember, independent counsel, responsible for investigating Bill Clinton in the 1990s. He is saying that Mueller, something we have been saying, might be crossing a line.

He's right, Rod Rosenstein who is overseeing this case to keep Mueller on task. Remember, this whole witch-hunt was supposed to only be about Trump-Russia collusion. That evidence does not exist all of this time. Speaking of Russia, think about this, with all of that talk we have another major breaking news story tonight, that's the Russian president, the bad actor Vladimir Putin. That's right. The guy that Obama said wasn't a bad actor and tell Vladimir I will have more flexibility after the elections. Remember that guy?  He's claiming he has brand new nuclear weapons that can penetrate America's defenses. Putin made the announcement during a state of the nation speech. He detailed how these new weapons literally include a nuclear power cruise missile and knew hyper sonic missile and nuclear-powered underwater drone.  U.S. officials are casting a lot of doubt on Putin's comments but saying that his new cruise missile is still in the test phase and has crashed a few times. OK. Here is my point tonight. You have the liberal media and the Democrats obsessing, totally obsessed over a conspiracy theory Trump-Russia collusion even though we have zero evidence Putin every single day as we are doing this is getting stronger. And the left and the media are literally playing right into Putin and Russia's hands.  Putin's entire goal, what is it? To sow political discord in America. That's exactly what the left -- that's exactly what the media are literally doing by going down the Russia collusion rabbit hole with no evidence. Then there is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Remember Obama? Mocking Mitt Romney for daring to call Russia a threat and then ignore threats, specific threats in 2014 from Devin Nunes and others on the House Intel Committee and he told President Trump stop whining about the election and election interference just days before the election.   And Hillary Clinton stupidly -- remember that silly reset button, you're going to reset relations with Russia. She helped to approve, giving Russia and Putin control of it 20 percent of our uranium. And then she paid for the Russian dossier filled with Russian government lies, you know?  Great job, media and Democrats. You have done a great job dividing the country and lying to the American people without evidence and pushing baseless conspiracy theories because you hate Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is getting stronger. We have more breaking news tonight. This story is outrageous. The Department of Justice is trying to determine if the mayor of Oakland, if she literally obstructed justice, warning criminal illegal immigrants about ICE raids. This liberal mayor, well, she took to Twitter on Saturday and to alter illegal immigrants and warn them in the Oakland area that, hey, federal immigration authorities are preparing to conduct operations. The acting head of ICE is blasting mayor saying that her stunt allowed about 800 criminal illegal immigrants to avoid arrest. He also said this on 'Fox & Friends' this morning, let's take a look.",

Being a law enforcement officer is already dangerous enough, but to give the criminals a heads up that we're coming in the next 24 hours increases that risk, puts them -- you're talking about -- these are American heroes strap a gun to their hip every day to defend this notion.

'I don't regret sharing this information. It is Oakland's legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws. We believe our community is safer when families stay together.'  OK. They did break laws. We have laws on the books. It's pathetic. But what the mayor is not saying and clearly obviously doesn't realize or care is that not only is she putting immigration authorities' lives at risk, she is doing the same thing for American citizens in her community. ICE is saying all they are trying to do is get the bad people off the street. So, guess what, if any of the criminal illegal immigrants that should have detained commit a crime, then the blood will be on her hands and literally, she will be responsible for whatever happens. She owns this.  We have a major update too tonight on the Florida school shooting. Fox News reporting the commanding officer we are now confirming tonight on the scene during Nikolas Cruz's rampage literally ordered some of the first responder deputies to set up a perimeter instead of confronting and neutralizing this mad man, this gunman.  This new piece of information is beyond stunning. The Broward County sheriff's office policy for dealing with active shooter situation says first responders may go into a building to save lives without permission. The policy does not appear to about setting up the perimeter.  If that's the case and the question is, why did at least four Broward County sheriff's deputies not rush into the schooling like the neighboring community, Coral Gables' officers did to save lives. Fox News is also reporting that there were delays in allowing EMTs to go inside the school. We are talking about kids literally, these moments, precious seconds save lives. We also know that there were dozens of missed warning signs prior to the shooting by the FBI and the Broward County sheriff's office.  This is one huge massive big government bureaucratic failure at every level. The government failed the people of Florida. And as we have been telling you, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is refusing to accept even an ounce of responsibility. And he is also saying that he likely will not release video of how deputies responded so that we, you, the American people can see exactly what happened. Shameful because the tragedy could have been prevented. All right. Back to our top story, joining us tonight, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Gregg, it's your night.

You don't need a special counsel if you have an attorney general who can actually, you know, make -- move the ball forward and do what he is supposed to do and administer justice. But he's nowhere on this. So, if you're going to keep the attorney in place, then go get a second special counsel.",

Forget about the FISA court. Federal district judge. The appellate court, the Supreme Court and you know as a matter of fact that you were misled, and I want everyone to listen to this. And you know as a matter of fact that the information that is provided to you or the information that wasn't provided for full context led to you issue a warrant to spy on an American citizen under the idea that the American citizen was an agent of Russia who is likely to commit a crime and by the way that citizen, Carter Page, last time I checked he hasn't been charged with anything. If you are a judge and we have had successive Judges in this FISA court over a period of one year and you don't do something about it, Congress needs to look into this. I do not expect the Department of Justice to investigate the Department of Justice. I just don't. I don't expect the FBI to investigate the FBI. But I damn well expect federal Judges serving as FISA court judges to make sure that conduct wasn't committed in front of them. Now, let me tell you something. Last April, Landmark Legal Foundation filed secretly with the FISA court, because we don't have any standing. Nobody has standing. Nobody really knows how this works. We said to the court, hey court, hey Judge, guess what? Guess what just took place in your courtroom? Here is what he said. You have the inherent jurisdiction to order an investigation of the FBI to get answers to this. Number one. Last April. Have this court's order or orders been used by intelligent and law enforcement entities of the federal government as a subterfuge to surveil private citizens and at least one United States Senator we were thinking of Sessions at the time for political purposes. Number two, did government officials seek one or more national security surveillance warrants from this court as a pretext to conduct an investigation for the purpose of affecting an ongoing national Presidential campaign and subsequent transition of an incoming President? This is last April. Number three, when applying to this court for one or more warrants in this matter. Did the FBI inform this court? That they apparently paid some of the expenses of a former British spy who prepared the dossier, reportedly relied on in whole or part, in its application to convince this court to issue a warrant. Number four, when applying to this court, this is us to the judge, for one or more warrants in this matter, did the FBI inform this court that the dossier it reportedly presented in pursuit of one or more warrants had originally been prepared by the former British spy for a Washington research firm conducting opposition research against the Republican nominee for President of the United States Donald J. Trump? This is important. Landmark Legal Foundation respectfully requests the court, the judge, the FISA judge, sitting en banc, by herself. That she should direct the government to complete its investigation and report its findings to the court within 90 days. The court should also consider whether it's appropriate to issue an order to all relevant federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to show cause as to why they should not be held in contempt for failing to protect the secrecy of classified information obtained pursuant to the court order. Now, do you know what the judge said in response to us, the FISA court judge? I want you to listen to this. April 25, 2017. This is Rosemary Collier, the presiding judge, keep in mind, the judges on the FISA court are picked by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. This are district court judges for the most part. So they are existing federal court judges. She wrote in this little order, the court has received a pleading titled motion for leave to appear as a me as amicus curiae on and on….",

In other words, this FISA Judge and quite frankly, was misdirecting when she said the matter is not before us anymore when it was still before them and this court, like any federal court, still has the power to reach back and hold people accountable. She did nothing. She did not call in the FBI as far as we know. She did not call in the Justice Department. She did not ask for answers. She did not ask for an investigation.

The great one Mark Levin, Tomi Lahren and Reince Priebus and many will be here for reaction. This is a massive development today. The FBI may have, in fact, broken the law and violated their own protocol when getting a FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page. This according to brand new letter out tonight from the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Also tonight, the important questions are being asked. We should have answers very soon. And also tonight, Trump Russia collusion crusader Adam Schiff is admitting we have the tape. He has seen no evidence that this collusion exists. Former Clinton independent counsel -- even Ken Starr, he's saying Robert Mueller is way beyond his mandate. So, is this even more proof that the investigation has been and continues to be a witch- hunt? And also breaking right now, Vladimir Putin, he is unveiling nuclear weapons that he claims can avoid detection. We are going to explain tonight why the liberal media, Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton are all to blame. And the liberal mayor of Oakland, California, under fire for aiding and abetting criminal illegal immigrants. He is actually warning them about federal ICE raids. Is the mayor putting law enforcement and American lives in danger? The short answer, yes. Also, FOX News reporting that the commanding officer during the Florida school shooting ordered some deputies on the scene not to enter the school. This answers a ton of questions. A lot of breaking news. We get started in our breaking news opening monologue."

The House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes is detailing how the FBI may have literally broken the law and violated bureau protocols when a painting that FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "In this letter released tonight, Nunes points out specific DOJ guidelines when it comes to FISA surveillance. He writes, quote",
      "utterance": "'Under the subsection FISA verification and accuracy procedures, the FBI itself acknowledges this importance, quote: the accuracy of information contained within FISA applications is of the utmost importance, only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications, FISA warrants to the court.' Given this new information, Chairman Nunes, he is now demanding the DOJ explain if, in fact, these protocols are still in place. We already know the answer. They never verified this. And if they are, the chairman wants to know how officials will be punished for violating this law, lying to a FISA judge and not following protocol. This letter also points out how using this false information in a FISA court could violate several laws. Look at them on the screen, 18 USC 242, using color of law to conduct a targeted investigation based on the pretext of law enforcement, you have 50 USC 1809, surveillance conducted under color of law in a manner not authorized by a FISA conspiracy, obstruction of justice and contempt of court. What this means is the scandal is getting bigger and bigger unlike an abuse of power we have ever seen in the history of this country. That's why we are unpeeling layer after layer of this onion. Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter, Jason Chaffetz, the great one Mark Levin will all have reaction to this tonight. And also breaking, we have more evidence the Trump-Russia collusion narrative for 20 months is a complete farce. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, you know, the ranking member of the House Intel Committee, long time professional Trump hater, he is now admitting that the scary, damning, earth-shattering information that he has now been playing up for more than a year is already in the public domain.

Adam Schiff is accusing Trump of collusion with little more speculation, rumor and phony Russian dossier that it was never corroborated or verified. Do you see how severe this is? We may well find out in coming weeks or months that Schiff's constant anti-Trump five alarm fires has been nothing more than political hyperbole meant to damage a sitting president that you voted for, so he could win favor with his liberal base and get hired by conspiracy TV MSNBC. And is probably why, according to the RNC, Schiff has appeared on television 227 times since President Trump's inauguration. So, it's only a matter of time where NBC hires him. Maybe he'll take over for Matt Lauer who has been out for a while. Also brand new tonight, Robert Mueller now facing criticism for someone who has intimate knowledge of special counsel investigations. Kenneth Starr, you might remember, independent counsel, responsible for investigating Bill Clinton in the 1990s. He is saying that Mueller, something we have been saying, might be crossing a line.

He's right, Rod Rosenstein who is overseeing this case to keep Mueller on task. Remember, this whole witch-hunt was supposed to only be about Trump-Russia collusion. That evidence does not exist all of this time. Speaking of Russia, think about this, with all of that talk we have another major breaking news story tonight, that's the Russian president, the bad actor Vladimir Putin. That's right. The guy that Obama said wasn't a bad actor and tell Vladimir I will have more flexibility after the elections. Remember that guy? He's claiming he has brand new nuclear weapons that can penetrate America's defenses. Putin made the announcement during a state of the nation speech. He detailed how these new weapons literally include a nuclear power cruise missile and knew hyper sonic missile and nuclear-powered underwater drone. U.S. officials are casting a lot of doubt on Putin's comments but saying that his new cruise missile is still in the test phase and has crashed a few times. OK. Here is my point tonight. You have the liberal media and the Democrats obsessing, totally obsessed over a conspiracy theory Trump-Russia collusion even though we have zero evidence Putin every single day as we are doing this is getting stronger. And the left and the media are literally playing right into Putin and Russia's hands. Putin's entire goal, what is it? To sow political discord in America. That's exactly what the left -- that's exactly what the media are literally doing by going down the Russia collusion rabbit hole with no evidence. Then there is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Remember Obama? Mocking Mitt Romney for daring to call Russia a threat and then ignore threats, specific threats in 2014 from Devin Nunes and others on the House Intel Committee and he told President Trump stop whining about the election and election interference just days before the election. And Hillary Clinton stupidly -- remember that silly reset button, you're going to reset relations with Russia. She helped to approve, giving Russia and Putin control of it 20 percent of our uranium. And then she paid for the Russian dossier filled with Russian government lies, you know? Great job, media and Democrats. You have done a great job dividing the country and lying to the American people without evidence and pushing baseless conspiracy theories because you hate Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is getting stronger. We have more breaking news tonight. This story is outrageous. The Department of Justice is trying to determine if the mayor of Oakland, if she literally obstructed justice, warning criminal illegal immigrants about ICE raids. This liberal mayor, well, she took to Twitter on Saturday and to alter illegal immigrants and warn them in the Oakland area that, hey, federal immigration authorities are preparing to conduct operations. The acting head of ICE is blasting mayor saying that her stunt allowed about 800 criminal illegal immigrants to avoid arrest. He also said this on 'Fox & Friends' this morning, let's take a look."

I mean, it's beyond the pale. I have been doing this for 34 years. And this is a whole new low to intentionally warned criminals that law enforcement is coming. Being a law enforcement officer is already dangerous enough, but to give the criminals a heads up that we're coming in the next 24 hours increases that risk, puts them -- you're talking about -- these are American heroes strap a gun to their hip every day to defend this notion. And to tell criminals we are coming in the next 24 hours is just incredible."

The mayor of Oakland is literally aiding and abetting criminal illegal immigrants and, of course, she is defending her actions writing on Twitter, not talking about the consequences. 'I don't regret sharing this information. It is Oakland's legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws. We believe our community is safer when families stay together.' OK. They did break laws. We have laws on the books. It's pathetic. But what the mayor is not saying and clearly obviously doesn't realize or care is that not only is she putting immigration authorities' lives at risk, she is doing the same thing for American citizens in her community. ICE is saying all they are trying to do is get the bad people off the street. So, guess what, if any of the criminal illegal immigrants that should have detained commit a crime, then the blood will be on her hands and literally, she will be responsible for whatever happens. She owns this. We have a major update too tonight on the Florida school shooting. Fox News reporting the commanding officer we are now confirming tonight on the scene during Nikolas Cruz's rampage literally ordered some of the first responder deputies to set up a perimeter instead of confronting and neutralizing this mad man, this gunman. This new piece of information is beyond stunning. The Broward County sheriff's office policy for dealing with active shooter situation says first responders may go into a building to save lives without permission. The policy does not appear to about setting up the perimeter. If that's the case and the question is, why did at least four Broward County sheriff's deputies not rush into the schooling like the neighboring community, Coral Gables' officers did to save lives. Fox News is also reporting that there were delays in allowing EMTs to go inside the school. We are talking about kids literally, these moments, precious seconds save lives. We also know that there were dozens of missed warning signs prior to the shooting by the FBI and the Broward County sheriff's office. This is one huge massive big government bureaucratic failure at every level. The government failed the people of Florida. And as we have been telling you, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is refusing to accept even an ounce of responsibility. And he is also saying that he likely will not release video of how deputies responded so that we, you, the American people can see exactly what happened. Shameful because the tragedy could have been prevented. All right. Back to our top story, joining us tonight, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Gregg, it's your night. This released letter by Devin Nunes tonight took -- when you are now questioning whether or not the FBI not only followed protocol, but whether they broke the law.

I think perjury, false and misleading statements, fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. So, all of these are serious crimes punishable by five, 10 years behind bars and if you deceive a court, and conceal evidence from a judge in order to spy on Americans, that is a whole set of crimes."

We know that Rod Rosenstein went into Speaker Ryan's office and begged him, don't give the information that has been subpoenaed. Now, I want to know, Rod Rosenstein, he has seven days to explain this and I suspect he is not going to want to answer again. And he is the guy that appointed Mueller.

Why do these people still have security clearances? You don't have security clearance, you don't have a job.

I mean, literally, every day, I see and I believe my gut, the special counsel, there's somebody in there that's leaking, because they don't like the fact that they are being covered and uncovered in the sense that look at the people that Robert Mueller hired.

So what we have to ask ourselves here is there is one specific question and I just want to go back to Chairman Nunes' letter. That says what has the DOJ and the FBI done to bring these people -- to investigate them or to bring charges against them? We want to know what's going on here. And then if did you go to the special counsel and you see the expansive nature of this special counsel.

Mark Levin's legal foundation has also filed a motion. They are asking the FISA court to do something about the suspected abuses allegedly committed by the FBI and the DOJ he is also the host the new colleague, we are proud to have him and that is 'Life, liberty Levin,' I am going to call him the great one. Also the host of Levin TV, CRTV Mark Levin. This Nunes memo that I have here that the FBI could have committed crimes and that they broke protocol. Don't we already know when you don't tell a FISA Judge in your initial application, subsequent renewal applications that Hillary bought and paid for the dossier and it was never verified and the law specifically says to verify it, don't we know that they violated the law, Mark Levin, constitutional scholar?"

Forget about the FISA court. Federal district judge. The appellate court, the Supreme Court and you know as a matter of fact that you were misled, and I want everyone to listen to this. And you know as a matter of fact that the information that is provided to you or the information that wasn't provided for full context led to you issue a warrant to spy on an American citizen under the idea that the American citizen was an agent of Russia who is likely to commit a crime and by the way that citizen, Carter Page, last time I checked he hasn't been charged with anything. If you are a judge and we have had successive Judges in this FISA court over a period of one year and you don't do something about it, Congress needs to look into this. I do not expect the Department of Justice to investigate the Department of Justice. I just don't. I don't expect the FBI to investigate the FBI. But I damn well expect federal Judges serving as FISA court judges to make sure that conduct wasn't committed in front of them. Now, let me tell you something. Last April, Landmark Legal Foundation filed secretly with the FISA court, because we don't have any standing. Nobody has standing. Nobody really knows how this works. We said to the court, hey court, hey Judge, guess what? Guess what just took place in your courtroom? Here is what he said. You have the inherent jurisdiction to order an investigation of the FBI to get answers to this. Number one. Last April. Have this court's order or orders been used by intelligent and law enforcement entities of the federal government as a subterfuge to surveil private citizens and at least one United States Senator we were thinking of Sessions at the time for political purposes. Number two, did government officials seek one or more national security surveillance warrants from this court as a pretext to conduct an investigation for the purpose of affecting an ongoing national Presidential campaign and subsequent transition of an incoming President? This is last April. Number three, when applying to this court for one or more warrants in this matter. Did the FBI inform this court? That they apparently paid some of the expenses of a former British spy who prepared the dossier, reportedly relied on in whole or part, in its application to convince this court to issue a warrant. Number four, when applying to this court, this is us to the judge, for one or more warrants in this matter, did the FBI inform this court that the dossier it reportedly presented in pursuit of one or more warrants had originally been prepared by the former British spy for a Washington research firm conducting opposition research against the Republican nominee for President of the United States Donald J. Trump? This is important. Landmark Legal Foundation respectfully requests the court, the judge, the FISA judge, sitting en banc, by herself. That she should direct the government to complete its investigation and report its findings to the court within 90 days. The court should also consider whether it's appropriate to issue an order to all relevant federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to show cause as to why they should not be held in contempt for failing to protect the secrecy of classified information obtained pursuant to the court order. Now, do you know what the judge said in response to us, the FISA court judge? I want you to listen to this. April 25, 2017. This is Rosemary Collier, the presiding judge, keep in mind, the judges on the FISA court are picked by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. This are district court judges for the most part. So they are existing federal court judges. She wrote in this little order, the court has received a pleading titled motion for leave to appear as a me as amicus curiae on and on…."

This warrant was extended three times. That matter was still appearing before this court. That is number one, number two, the court has ongoing jurisdiction to supervise the conduct of attorneys, the FBI, the Justice Department, before the court. Contempt may reach backwards. Even after a case has been concluded. In other words, this FISA Judge and quite frankly, was misdirecting when she said the matter is not before us anymore when it was still before them and this court, like any federal court, still has the power to reach back and hold people accountable. She did nothing. She did not call in the FBI as far as we know. She did not call in the Justice Department. She did not ask for answers. She did not ask for an investigation. She didn't hold a contempt hearing. Nothing. Do you know what that tells me? Something smells like a rat. Which means this."

They said the bulk of the FISA application consisted of what we now know to be unverified information. Fusion GPS, co-founder Glenn Simpson, never verified it. The FBI never verified. The deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe literally said no dossier, not even an application. You're right. It's renewed every 90 days. So, if you have an opposition Party candidate using unverified Russian lies in the lead-up and post-election, to undermine a president, and -- what we know as of now is none of it is true. Is this based on your knowledge of history at least a biggest abuse of power and corruption in your lifetime? Because to me this is Watergate, are you kidding? This is Watergate time a thousand to me."
