Top Trump officials are telling us all military options against Iran are still very much on the table. Adding the possibility of kinetic action is very much alive at this hour and all through the weekend. As the world waits to see the president's next move.  Good evening, everyone. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” With just moments to spare last night, our commander-in-chief called off a retaliatory strike against Iran, as the president tells that the U.S. was cocked and loaded ready to respond with force after Iran blasted that U.S. Navy drone from the sky over international waters.  But then, something changed. President attempting to peel back the curtain on his decision-making was nothing if not transparent. As today, he described the details he and American military leaders went through as they mulled their options in respect to Iran shooting down that unmanned American drone.",

They shut down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it. And here we are sitting with 150 dead people, that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead.",

And I don't know the kind of weight you have to carry on your shoulders, and maybe that number rattled around something big. I think the president has every right to withdraw from doing the strike. What I think was unfortunate today was how this played out in the public, and I think it could have been one of those things that hey, we're going to hold this as a possibility.  But I think in the future if you use something against any U.S. force, you'll lose it. I think, at least, that surface-to-air missile site should go away in the future.",

And John Bolton, all this kind of stuff that they all say, they should now be celebrating that he's not what they said that he was, but they're not. So, while I'm being consistent and I disagree with this decision. I think the president will use military force if something like this happens again. It is amazing to see the dichotomy of thanks.

If you shoot down a plane that actually could have had people on it. They may have misinterpreted, mislabeled this. The size of an airliner in $200 million, it's the cost of 10 F-16s. There's got to be a cost to you. That said, going forward if they think that the president is going to do the same thing if they shoot anything else down, I think he's going to -- and the pressure is going to be on him so much that there will be a response to that.

So, to me, this was actually -- this point hasn't really been picked up that much. But to me, it was actually quite striking that he wasn't going to lay -- you know, do a ground force invasion.

And I don't know the kind of weight you have to carry on your shoulders, and maybe that number rattled around something big. I think the president has every right to withdraw from doing the strike. What I think was unfortunate today was how this played out in the public, and I think it could have been one of those things that hey, we're going to hold this as a possibility.

And John Bolton, all this kind of stuff that they all say, they should now be celebrating that he's not what they said that he was, but they're not. So, while I'm being consistent and I disagree with this decision. I think the president will use military force if something like this happens again. It is amazing to see the dichotomy of thanks. And also, by the way, the same people that kind of celebrated when President Obama didn't strike in 2013 in the red line."

The president didn't make a promise to react militarily. So, I don't think it's backing away from a promise per se. I just think there has to be a cost to the Iranians. If you shoot down a plane that actually could have had people on it. They may have misinterpreted, mislabeled this. The size of an airliner in $200 million, it's the cost of 10 F-16s. There's got to be a cost to you. That said, going forward if they think that the president is going to do the same thing if they shoot anything else down, I think he's going to -- and the pressure is going to be on him so much that there will be a response to that. Last night would actually pale in comparison to you."

So, at least, there's a consequence to shooting down our assets. And that's why -- look, a stable confident country doesn't put limpet mines on oil tankers, and doesn't shoot down unmanned aircraft. They just don't do things like that. So, they're scared."

I don't think we're going to see a large footprint deployment anywhere around the world, whether it's the Middle East or Asia. But I've never heard him speak with that level of caution or concern about the civilian casualties that would result from a bombing campaign. I mean, you remember what he used to say on the -- on the campaign, let's bomb the yes out of ISIS, and bombed the hell out of people, et cetera. He obviously did those two strikes on Syria. So, to me, this was actually -- this point hasn't really been picked up that much. But to me, it was actually quite striking that he wasn't going to lay -- you know, do a ground force invasion. He was -- they were talking about doing strikes. And the fact that he considered that, or in his accounting considered that and pulled back was surprising to me."

But you've also got a trade war with Europe, and you know, that they've been tariffs and all sorts of things, and the threat of tariffs on automobiles. So, there's all sorts of things complicating that relation -- those relationships. And all these European leaders we forget have their own massive domestic political problems.

That's the 49-year-old who was romantically involved with his late brother's widow for a time but recently married a recent acquaintance and is also now being sued for child support by a woman in Arkansas who alleges that he got her pregnant last August. But the more pertinent primary issues are the younger Biden's business dealings like in Ukraine because his dad once bragged on camera about pressuring a prosecutor who was investigating a company Hunter was involved with and in China where Hunter was involved with a communist government- owned entity. Hunter Biden told ABC News he's never discussed any of this with his dad. His dad, less chatty."

The comments about segregationists, I understand the sentiment of saying that you know, he's old school, he remembers a day when you can talk civilly with people you disagreed with. I understand the sentiment. It's the wrong message that we need right now. I'm more concerned about his comments though that were made at a high dollar donor event where he said that fundamentally nothing would change for people of high net-worth regarding the tax plan.

      "speaker": "STEVE HILTON, HOST",

I mean, on my show, we've been -- we've been setting out the gory details of Joe Biden's connection to China in this corrupt manner and Ukraine for weeks and weeks. And I'm glad to see that people are catching up. I mean, the truth is that you know, the controversy over the segregationist comments, I think we can just put that down as another Biden gaffe. But you know, I don't think anyone seriously believes that he's racist, but I think that it's clear now when you look at the evidence that he is corrupt. And the reason this is important from a policy perspective is that there is no bigger issue for the next president than confronting China's rise. China has said very clearly they want to topple America as the world's superpower and impose their vision of authoritarian state capitalism on the world. Joe Biden is compromised by China while he was vice president. He took billions of dollars in bribes in the form of payments to his son's businesses. Now, I use that word bribes very, very carefully."

When Rudy Giuliani a few weeks ago raised questions not just about China but Ukraine as well in terms of business dealings for the former vice president's son, some people mocked him. It seems like these are very much on the table, Colin."

And the intersection of money and politics and using one's government position to enrich your own personal interests sounds pretty familiar Ed. It reminds me a lot of what Hillary Clinton dealt with, the allegation she faced with her family foundation back in 2015. And if you ask me, that's what sunk Hillary Clinton above all else was the idea that she was using her position in D.C. to sink her presidential ambitions and that's the thing that Biden is now facing and it's coming from ABC News."

    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly right. Look, people in this country want change from the swamp and the corrupt system. That's why they voted for Donald Trump as an outsider. It's that same election all over again this time if they nominate Joe Biden because he is the ultimate inside a swamp creature of D.C. just like Hillary Clinton was."

You've got an open primary that's going on. The debates started off next week down in Miami for the Democrats. But get to Colin's point about the fact that last time Democrats heard, it's Hillary Clinton's turn. She gets the nomination and it's not just the e-mails, it's past speeches, it's the business dealings, the foundation. With Joe Biden, there is a target-rich environment for this president of Senate votes, speeches, and gaffs."

    {
      "speaker": "BIRO",
      "utterance": "Exactly correct. And look, Joe Biden is a friend of mine. I respect him and he's been very kind to my family, but there's an argument to be made that it's time for new blood. And you know as well as the rest of the panelists here that the longer you've been in Washington, the more dirt they have that they can dig up on you. Joe Biden has done a lot of good but there's plenty -- and in the lead to the segment, you know, his mouth right now is really his own worst enemies, that was my concern because we don't know what else could come up."

And the corruption with China I think we'll get more and more to the foreground if he becomes closer to getting the nomination. I think he could totally derail him because it's such a fundamental policy problem."

      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "She has. And I think Biden dodged a real bullet -- political bullet that he's not on the stage with her next week and that they're on different stages because Elizabeth Warren's disdain for Joe Biden is well documented and goes back many years and she could just disembowel him on a debate stage.

And he has been very consistent with that. I think his actions yesterday shows that he prefers to have a diplomatic solution. He is increasing the maximum pressure campaign and the sanctions. And, Ed, we know that Iran's economy is in tatters. That people cannot get product.

And of course, they were willing to talk with Iran. What we have to do is force Iran back to the negotiating table. The JCPOA was a bad deal for us.

And knowing full well that Iran has continued to fund their proxies in the region, what he has done is to approach everything with deterrence. What you have seen Iran do is continue what they have been doing since the '70s, which is they are the aggressor in this situation. It is like shooting down the global hawk. That was an unprovoked attack. But they have been the aggressive one in these issues. Our allies in the region, our European allies need to stand with us as we deal with this.
