The current hiring pace along with a record low unemployment rate, more importantly, growing wages for your paycheck. That runs counter that narrative the mainstream media was pushing a couple of weeks ago about the president's internal poll numbers showing he could lose head to head in 2020 to basically every major Democrat in the race. In reality, the economy is booming for president kicking it into high gear. Some of those top Democrats seem to be struck -- stuck in neutral. Thanks to some glaring flip-flops they've made just in the last 24 hours. They couldn't hunt them in the run-up to 2020.

Look at this. Over 220,000 jobs created last month alone that was far beyond all expectations blowing it out. The current hiring pace along with a record low unemployment rate, more importantly, growing wages for your paycheck. That runs counter that narrative the mainstream media was pushing a couple of weeks ago about the president's internal poll numbers showing he could lose head to head in 2020 to basically every major Democrat in the race. In reality, the economy is booming for president kicking it into high gear. Some of those top Democrats seem to be struck -- stuck in neutral. Thanks to some glaring flip-flops they've made just in the last 24 hours. They couldn't hunt them in the run-up to 2020. First up, Joe Biden, but to his credit, finally came out of virtual hiding today actually did an interview.

I thought it was a very good moment for her actually where she was contrasting Joe Biden's 40-plus years in politics and using his own words against him. But it seems as if now she has the same policy position that he has. And it is a nuanced to position, it's one that the Department of Education shouldn't get involved in bussing. One that is a respectable and understandable position. But now, she actually holds that same position. One that she was trying to make it seem as if he was a villain.

Now, let's remember when Biden made his decision on busing, this was we were talking about the 60s and the 70s, which is a very different time than today. And where Senator Harris is right, is that it's a tool in our toolkit, but what you hear from parents all across this country. And especially, in urban areas. They're not asking or crying out for busing or for school choice. They're crying out for smaller class sizes. They're crying out for school nurses."

That may seem like a lot of money but it's half of what Mayor Pete raised. It's obviously less than what Biden raised, and Bernie Sanders' raised. And meanwhile, as you know, the president, who you support raised over $100 million, he's the incumbent. But was Harris just raising this to sort of takeout the former vice president without even really realizing where she was on it?"

But if I remember correctly in the debate, she actually started with, I was offended that you praised to segregationist, and she kind of pivoted to bussing all of a sudden. And it kind of -- it really showed that she had that rehearsed. And she had this in her toolkit, to use her own word, as an attack against Biden. And I think that's a really interesting point that she saw an opening to try to draw some of the money support and some of the enthusiasm away from Joe Biden. But I'm just blown away by Mayor Pete's fundraising numbers. If you would have told me that he would have had the number one performance in this quarter, I would have been -- that's about when we farfetched me to believe. But for him to raise $24 million in this quarter, very, very impressive. I have to say that also --"

But what you have is a large Democratic field, and if you look at all the money that Democrats have raised, it does equal the president's raised.

I mean, literally, the resistance told us that there though if we elected Donald Trump there'd be tanks on the streets and it was likely it was finally happening. The tanks were arriving.

I didn't count every single person. But when Tulsi Gabbard just flat out says -- she was running for president, you see the crowd a little bit in the picture. Tulsi Gabbard says, he won't be honoring the troops. He largely honored the troops throughout the speech. Look at this. The self-serving politician that he is, Trump has succeeded in making July 4th about himself and in doing so further divided our country.

Harry Truman gave a speech on the mall in front of the Washington Monument. You had it Woodrow Wilson, John F. Kennedy, Gerald Ford, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, all gave speeches at Independence Hall. Ronald Reagan gave a speech from an aircraft carrier that they stationed in front of the -- of the Statue of Liberty for a perfect camera shot. And how much did that cost?

They said it's going to be a partisan speech and a millions of Americans tuned in and we're wondering what the heck they were talking about. It was a great speech. It was moving to see all these fighter jets flying, the B- 2 bomber flying over the nation -- our nation's capital was amazing.

Several news outlets including The Washington Times now speculating the sub may have been on a secret Russian mission. Looking to tap into or cut underwater fiber-optic or internet cables that span the Atlantic and Arctic ceilings, big deal. The incident coming amid several major outages this week affecting the likes of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and yes Verizon.

      "utterance": "Well, you know, just to take a step back for a moment. I think most people think the Internet's in the cloud, it's really under the ocean. There are almost 400 of these cables, they're about the size of a really large garden hose that run several hundred thousand miles and our entire modern economy is dependent on these fiber-optic cables, from banking to insurance, to financial markets, and it's not just communicating it with each other it is how they actually access their data and data centers all over the world. So both the Russians and the Chinese have made it clear in their national security strategy that they are not going to take the United States on tank to tank or aircraft carrier to aircraft carrier, they are going to attack us asymmetrically. That's attacking us in space, cyber, undermining our confidence in our elections or in this case and what this sub was doing very likely was tapping into these cables to collect the data, to gather intel, and to put in place the ability to drop portions of the Internet and to -- and to pull the rug out from under our modern economy if we ever have to go to any type of --"
    },

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, let's pic that apart. That's big stuff. First of all, when you say, we believe that the Russians may have been trying to suck up some of this data and get information, what kind of intelligence gathering when you're talking about thousands and thousands of lines and cables, it could be a lot of our e-mails, text, or whatever, all kinds of info."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, right. So one thing to understand is that you know, artificial intelligence which are these powerful algorithms that can basically at some point in the near future outthink humans, outsmart us and do it you know, faster and quicker, and fuel their militaries, they rely on data. Data as that fuel. It's the new coal that power -- that power the kind of the A.I. industry particularly on the military side. So that's one piece but the other piece is to be able to attack us or to undermine us economically. So, you can imagine a Russian incursion into Ukraine, into Lithuania, we respond with additional sanctions."

It's a one- sided document like any prosecutor's report. And this investigation is showing the shortcomings, and I think the Mueller testimony will be an opportunity for the Congress to try to demonstrate the shortcoming and the bias in the report. I have a prediction. Excuse me. My prediction is they are going to be very frustrated. They are going to find that Mueller is not going to answer questions.

But ultimately, again, it comes down to what standard are we setting? Are we saying we can only have murals up, only have statues up of people that are perfect? By that logic, you're not going to have anyone. This mural was put up during FDR's new deal. Are we going to remove anything involving FDR because of his internment camps that he did, something we can all agree was evil?
