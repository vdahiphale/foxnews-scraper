Taking on Hillary Clinton, explaining himself on Saddam Hussein and various other topics, he is been going on for a little over an hour. At this point we're going to jump away for a moment as we get to some other programming this evening. This evening, everybody I'm Martha MacCallum and I am in for Greta Van Susteren tonight.  Breaking news these evening, on another front. Off the hook, as expected. No criminal charges against Secretary Hillary Clinton. Just a few moments ago, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the Clinton email investigation is now officially closed, as far as the Department of Justice is concerned as well.  And now, House Republicans are irate that Clinton will not face any criminal charges over the private server. The House oversight committee is demanding answers from FBI Director James Comey, who had accommodated them. He said he will appear tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. on America Newsroom, as I may mention, where he'll be asked many questions about the process of that investigation.  Member of the House and Dell Committee, Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo, has been hanging in there along with us tonight. We thank him for that. Congressman, good to see you this evening, welcome to the program.",
