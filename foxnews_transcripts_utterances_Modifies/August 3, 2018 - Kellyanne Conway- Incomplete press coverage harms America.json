I said honey, wait until you see the press I got on this. It's going to be great.  And here's what the fake news said. They said, Donald Trump, our president, was extremely rude to presidents and prime ministers, and I'm in a couple of cases, dictators. But that's all right. Donald Trump was very new rude. They don't talk about the money I raised. I was rude. And I wasn't. Actually, I have a better relationship with every one of them than any other president. I was asked to have tea with the Queen, who is incredible, by the way. So, I was about 15 minutes early and I'm waiting with my wife, and that's fine. Hey, it's the queen, we can wait. We then go up and we have tea. I didn't know this, it was supposed to last 15 minutes but it lasted an hour because we got along. We got along.  So here was the story by the fake news. The president was 15 minutes late for the queen. Wrong. And then, here's the rest of the story. No, here's the rest. Here's the rest of the story. So, they said I was late when I was actually early, number one. Number two, I guess the meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes and it lasted almost an hour. The president overstayed.

For example, CNN spent less than a minute covering the ceremony where Vice President Pence received the purported remains of fallen American servicemen who died during the Korean War. MSNBC didn't cover it at all.   The mainstream media is also happy to largely ignore the president's soaring new approval rating. They are also playing down America's a record-setting economy.

Plus today marks the close of day number four of the Manafort trial. Joining us now live from Washington with the latest on that and more is Ellison Barber fox. Ellison?   Ellison Barber, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: So for months President Trump's legal team has come back and forth on whether or not the president will sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. One thing at issue for the president's legal team are the questions investigators plan to ask him. The president's personal attorney sent a letter to Mueller asking about the scope and format of an interview. Sources tell Fox News Special Counsel had now responded to that letter and that Mueller agreed to have some questions answered in writing. There are new reports tonight, the special counsel team spoke with the known as the Manhattan Madam on Wednesday. Her name is Kristin Davis. She run a high-end prostitution ring in New York City. You might know her name because it came up during the Eliot Spitzer scandal to reach out to the special counsel about it. They declined to comment. We're working on trying to figure out more on this in general. But according to reports, investigators are interested in Davis' ties to Trump ally, Roger Stone. All of this as the president former campaign chairman Paul Manafort finishes his fourth day before a federal judge in Virginia. Manafort's accountant testified with immunity this afternoon and she said she falsified documents to help Manafort secure a loan and also classified income as a load which would lower Manafort's taxes. Manafort is facing is facing charges related to financial fraud. He denies any wrongdoing. Manafort was of course indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But the things we usually think of when we talk about the special counsel, Russia, and President Trump, those really haven't been topics at the trial but they are certainly, judge, elephants in the room.",

I said honey, wait until you see the press I got on this. It's going to be great. And here's what the fake news said. They said, Donald Trump, our president, was extremely rude to presidents and prime ministers, and I'm in a couple of cases, dictators. But that's all right. Donald Trump was very new rude. They don't talk about the money I raised. I was rude. And I wasn't. Actually, I have a better relationship with every one of them than any other president. I was asked to have tea with the Queen, who is incredible, by the way. So, I was about 15 minutes early and I'm waiting with my wife, and that's fine. Hey, it's the queen, we can wait. We then go up and we have tea. I didn't know this, it was supposed to last 15 minutes but it lasted an hour because we got along. We got along. So here was the story by the fake news. The president was 15 minutes late for the queen. Wrong. And then, here's the rest of the story. No, here's the rest. Here's the rest of the story. So, they said I was late when I was actually early, number one. Number two, I guess the meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes and it lasted almost an hour. The president overstayed.

Meanwhile the worst example of media bias this week is something called bias of omission. For example, CNN spent less than a minute covering the ceremony where Vice President Pence received the purported remains of fallen American servicemen who died during the Korean War. MSNBC didn't cover it at all. The mainstream media is also happy to largely ignore the president's soaring new approval rating. They are also playing down America's a record-setting economy.

One thing at issue for the president's legal team are the questions investigators plan to ask him. The president's personal attorney sent a letter to Mueller asking about the scope and format of an interview. Sources tell Fox News Special Counsel had now responded to that letter and that Mueller agreed to have some questions answered in writing. There are new reports tonight, the special counsel team spoke with the known as the Manhattan Madam on Wednesday. Her name is Kristin Davis. She run a high-end prostitution ring in New York City. You might know her name because it came up during the Eliot Spitzer scandal to reach out to the special counsel about it. They declined to comment. We're working on trying to figure out more on this in general. But according to reports, investigators are interested in Davis' ties to Trump ally, Roger Stone. All of this as the president former campaign chairman Paul Manafort finishes his fourth day before a federal judge in Virginia. Manafort's accountant testified with immunity this afternoon and she said she falsified documents to help Manafort secure a loan and also classified income as a load which would lower Manafort's taxes. Manafort is facing is facing charges related to financial fraud. He denies any wrongdoing. Manafort was of course indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But the things we usually think of when we talk about the special counsel, Russia, and President Trump, those really haven't been topics at the trial but they are certainly, judge, elephants in the room."

You know, when you're -- I represented a few innocent people and they wanted to scream from the rooftops, I'm innocent. And that's how President Trump feels.

Because, and Jeanine, you probably this. You will know this when you file your taxes in New York by getting rid of the deductions for the high tax states. That is going to influence a lot of people to pick up and come to Florida. Particularly if you're in industries like financial services where you can be here. So I think we are primed to really capitalize off of a lot of the good things the presidents has done. I mean, I think Florida has probably never been in a better position as long as we keep good solid low tax fiscally responsible policies."

Look, right now we've GDP growth that's doubling. We've got the fastest wage growth in 10 years. We've got home values that are rising at twice that rate and we have had the longest consecutive streak of job growth in American history.

I mean, you know, historically there is a reaction against the party in power, but I think the combination of a strong economy and the fact that the Democratic Party doesn't have any ideas, most of their grassroots seem to be gravitating toward socialism, like you see with the Ocasio-Cortez in New York, that's not a winning strategy for places like Florida and other swing states. So, as long as we stay on message, as long as we keep articulating an agenda, there're going to be a positive contrast for us with the Democratic Party that's exhausted of ideas."

And Matt, what about socialism and, you know, America was stunned with the woman here, Ocasio-Cortez, a socialist supporting -- and I'm not sure she is willing to fully admit that, but supported by the Democrats' socialist association. Where -- are the Democrats upset with that sector of the party? Because if you are not as left as they are, then chances are, I would think that a lot of the more moderate Democrats would either not come out or a vote differently. I'm not sure how to look at that."

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",

We welcome Democrats who want more prosperity. If you want Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters in charge, if you want them to rob America of the successes we've enjoyed during Donald Trump's tenure, then I guess, vote Democrat. But in Florida we share like freedom that's probably why we're going to elect Ron DeSantis, our next governor, and we want to make sure in our state that we're poised to take advantage of this roaring economy that we've created with the lower taxes, deregulation. And really trusting the American people to drive their own prosperity so that we're not dependent on government for multiple generations. We become excited and really engineered for success in the long term."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, look, we suspected he had been paid. They didn't give us straight answers. Then we figured out he definitely was paid and now this, so I think it further undermines the credibility of the explanations we've been giving. And it shows they knew or should have known that Steele was working on behalf of the Democratic Party, and to pay him like that and then funnel it through from Bruce Ohr, that's a big problem with how this whole thing was done."

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Well, but the only thing that is true there if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal today, the Russians are doing nothing to restrain North Korea and that's a problem. The rest of what she said is just a load of garbage and I just think as a Democrat I completely distance and disassociate myself from it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "OB. But unfortunately, you've got the likes of Maxine and Nancy. You both seen to be flipping their lids, and then you've got -- and I'll go to you with this, Deneen, and then you've got Ocasio-Cortez. Is the Democratic Party that historically will win the midterms in the first term of any new president, are they so fractured that they are not going to win?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "I think they are very fractured. You have the likes of Maxine Waters and then you have those who are the left of the left that are running on a really socialist agenda. And so when you look at the Trump economy, the roll back in taxes and regulations as a pro-growth economic environment, there are not enough people for jobs. I mean, something is really happening here in America where America's first agenda is working."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. So Doug, you are a pollster."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, talk to me about this alleged blue wave that is precedent -- precedence, I should say."

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And the Dems believe is going to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't see the blue wave, I think the Democrats are ahead the generic voters about six or seven points which would translate into somewhere between 23, 25, or maybe 27 seats. That's no blue wave. I would make the argument that if the Republicans get sidetracked themselves by talking about shutting down the government and don't run on the economy than they are doing we, Democrats a big favor. Talking about tax cuts for the rich unilaterally, another big favor. They talk about the economic consequences of this administration, it gets tougher and tougher for we, Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "OK. And Deneen, if the -- if the Maxine's and -- last question -- and the Ocasio-Cortez, what do they say? How does the Democrat run?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "Well, if they're going to keep doubling down on the rhetoric, Judge Jeanine."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "On what?"
    },

      "speaker": "BORELLI",

    },

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "How about socialism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "-- anything they could come up with identity and that as well, socialism as well. So we're going to see even more of that because of what the effects of we're seeing, the results from the Trump economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "OK. OK. Doug, really last question. Do you think the millennials even know what socialism is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "I think they know that the game is a much tougher one than when you and I were coming up, and they are looking for solutions and blaming somebody else and asking for redistribution, is their answer. And to me, it's a false answer. Capitalism to me is the answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Doug, capitalism."
    },

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",

      "utterance": "Welcome back to the special edition of Hannity. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening.
