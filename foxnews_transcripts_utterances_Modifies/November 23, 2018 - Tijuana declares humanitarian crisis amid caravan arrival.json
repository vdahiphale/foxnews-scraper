      "sentences": "I'm Raymond Arroyo sitting in for Laura Ingraham on this special edition of \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from New York City tonight. President Trump is doubling down on conflict and continuity in the final weeks of 2018, laying down the gauntlet over border enforcement. We'll explore his unprecedented feud with Chief Justice John Roberts and why Mr. Trump may have good reason to be upset with the politicized courts. Plus, God is coming up short with Americans this year. We'll examine a new survey that reveals they are finding meaning in other places, some good and others, well. And I hit the streets on this Black Friday to see how confident Americans are as we enter the biggest buying season of the year.  Then, in an exclusive \"Ingraham Angle\" -- well, in an \"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive, Mike Lyndell, the \"my pillow\" guy is here to explain why he is not letting critics scare him from his passion projects, including a new movie which will tell us about tonight.  But first, the crisis at the border is getting worse by the day as thousands of illegals immigrants gather in Tijuana, Mexico planning their next move, which according to reports includes a possible human stampede. This as police arrest nearly three dozen migrants on drugs and drunkenness charges.  The Tijuana mayor says his town is in the throws (ph) of a humanitarian crisis. He declared, \"They have categorically omitted and not complied with their legal obligations. So we're now asking international and humanitarian aid groups to bring -- come in and carry out humanitarian assistance.\" At the same time, a group of 150 migrants from that massive caravan stormed the border waving a white flag and demanding better conditions claiming they don't have adequate food and housing. I think they forget they are the ones who chose to make the illegal journey, but never mind that.  Tijuana continues to struggle to accommodate the estimated 5,000 migrants spending roughly $30,000 a day to house and care for them. But President Trump is not mincing words about what will happen if that caravan comes to the U.S. threatening to close the border completely. Listen.",

Why isn't the system the issue, because these people haven't stampeded. They haven't rushed the border. They are not carrying weapons with them. No one has seen them try to hurt anybody.

MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, I'd say that the broader system is the problem and the system is we have asylum rules that incentivize people to make these bogus asylum claims to essentially use asylum as a strategy for illegal immigration because none of these people has any realistic expectation of actually getting political asylum at the end of the day.  They're doing this to apply for asylum as a way of getting pass the border and then they're home free. This has been going on since the Obama administration really kind of incentivized it and, you know, we're still dealing with the fallout from it that's why we have this caravan and that's why there are other caravans behind them that are trying to do the same thing.",

President Trump is doubling down on conflict and continuity in the final weeks of 2018, laying down the gauntlet over border enforcement. We'll explore his unprecedented feud with Chief Justice John Roberts and why Mr. Trump may have good reason to be upset with the politicized courts. Plus, God is coming up short with Americans this year. We'll examine a new survey that reveals they are finding meaning in other places, some good and others, well. And I hit the streets on this Black Friday to see how confident Americans are as we enter the biggest buying season of the year. Then, in an exclusive \"Ingraham Angle\" -- well, in an \"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive, Mike Lyndell, the \"my pillow\" guy is here to explain why he is not letting critics scare him from his passion projects, including a new movie which will tell us about tonight. But first, the crisis at the border is getting worse by the day as thousands of illegals immigrants gather in Tijuana, Mexico planning their next move, which according to reports includes a possible human stampede. This as police arrest nearly three dozen migrants on drugs and drunkenness charges. The Tijuana mayor says his town is in the throws (ph) of a humanitarian crisis. He declared, \"They have categorically omitted and not complied with their legal obligations. So we're now asking international and humanitarian aid groups to bring -- come in and carry out humanitarian assistance.\" At the same time, a group of 150 migrants from that massive caravan stormed the border waving a white flag and demanding better conditions claiming they don't have adequate food and housing. I think they forget they are the ones who chose to make the illegal journey, but never mind that. Tijuana continues to struggle to accommodate the estimated 5,000 migrants spending roughly $30,000 a day to house and care for them. But President Trump is not mincing words about what will happen if that caravan comes to the U.S. threatening to close the border completely. Listen."

That meeting resulted in the White House authorizing thousands of troops at the U.S. border, giving them the ability to use force if necessary to protect border agents. That would allow Secretary of State James Mattis to order those thousands of troops to do just that, protect border agents. The Department of Homeland Security says there are 500 known criminals in that caravan, 500, headed to the U.S. At least that's what they know of at this moment. The Mexican ambassador to the U.S., Geronimo Gutierrez is also concerned about violence telling the \"Washington Examiner,\" \"We share the opinion that there are people that have criminal backgrounds.\" Yet the media is still trying to down play the threat."

The fact that this is what's considered a real threat is 5,000 people coming to the border, seeking asylum. Why is that -- why is they the issue? Why isn't the system the issue, because these people haven't stampeded. They haven't rushed the border. They are not carrying weapons with them. No one has seen them try to hurt anybody.

Asylum is when you are under persecution not just because I'd like a better job and a nicer neighborhood, right? Mark Krikorian your reaction. MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, I'd say that the broader system is the problem and the system is we have asylum rules that incentivize people to make these bogus asylum claims to essentially use asylum as a strategy for illegal immigration because none of these people has any realistic expectation of actually getting political asylum at the end of the day. They're doing this to apply for asylum as a way of getting pass the border and then they're home free. This has been going on since the Obama administration really kind of incentivized it and, you know, we're still dealing with the fallout from it that's why we have this caravan and that's why there are other caravans behind them that are trying to do the same thing."

There's absolutely no evidence or no proof that these guys are going to show up to the port of entry, bum rush the border and run through and become \"illegal immigrants.\" They're coming to the border seeking asylum.

And you and I have talked about this on a number of occasions where you have this lower level judge at the federal level and an Obama-appointee making a ruling to thwart the Trump administration, forcing it to go through the course before that policy takes effect. Now, the president called this judge and Obama judge, which is why the Chief Justice weighed in. He said, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges, or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\" However, given the Ninth Circuit's well-earned reputation for being let's just say a progressive and for frequently ruling against the president and his policies, well, he said it's high time someone called them out for their judicial activism."

And the chief justice arrogantly, and I underscore arrogantly stepped into it. It is a major mistake by the chief justice and of course, you notice he has been quiet now because he realizes that he did make a terrible, terrible mistake. Whatever he may have thought of the president's remarks, it's not his responsibility to rebuke the president of the United States, which is exactly what he was doing. And after sitting there in January of 2010 and listening to President Obama rebuke him and the rest of the Supreme Court for their decision in Citizens United when he said absolutely nothing to defend the integrity and independence of the court, for him to get involved in this was absolutely abysmal judgment."

That's actually a positive revival of family, if you will. I think if you look at how the economy is doing in the United States, unemployment is low, it's not surprising that religion actually drops down lower in this list. It's still fourth. That's still pretty good considering what is happening in other industrialized nations. When there's a downturn in the economy, when things start to fall apart, that's when people turn to religion.

And as you live for those things that are transcendent, then all the other things fall into place. But it is interesting, as you look at the age, as people get older and they start dealing with the real issues of life and considering what happens after this life, there is more of a turn toward religion, because they want to make sure that they make the right decision."

      "utterance": "Does this sort of thing happen? The second line is after you bury the body, you celebrate that they have gone home to God. We have second lines all the time. With Christmas upon us, may I recommend my \"Will Wilder\" adventures for young readers? The third in the series is coming in February from Random House. But it's a perfect time to get \"Will Wilder, The Relic of Perilous Falls\" and \"The Lost Staff of Wonders.\" They're sort of young Indiana Jones meet \"Stranger Things.\" And it's one of the few middle grade series where the entire family goes on the adventure with a hero. Get the \"Will Wilder\" books. That's all the time we have tonight. And I want to thank Laura for having me sit in for her. She'll be back Monday.
