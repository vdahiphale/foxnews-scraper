Clinton accusing someone of being political, it's like Bernie Sanders making fun of Trump's hair. This is the lady who kicked off birtherism. By the way, didn't some world leader just say it was OK to politicize tragedy?  But McCarthy's gaffe reminds us that the Republicans are like an IKEA cafeteria: full of meatballs. Instead of being persuasively right, McCarthy revealed political spite and the path to who pushed the video now detours to the freshly painted target on his own party's back. Too bad he can't blame that on a movie.   But let's not forget that it was Hillary who first politicized Benghazi. Rather than blame Islamists, she found a fake scapegoat in a video that nobody saw. McCarthy was right: The Benghazi hearings did hurt her numbers. But he could have said Hillary did something really bad, so her numbers should drop. So we still have a liar who falsely blamed a planned attack on a video. After that, a profound ignorance of national security in this age of cyber-terror, you have a smug someone who failed to see how dangerous she really is. McCarthy's answer was dumb, but unlike Hillary's actions, it wasn't harmful. Well, unless it gets her elected. That's a problem.",
