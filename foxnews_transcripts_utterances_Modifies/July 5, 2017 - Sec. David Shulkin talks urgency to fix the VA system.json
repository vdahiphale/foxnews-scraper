Now to the man who also says that our veterans and our soldiers are very important to that defense, particularly taking care of them after they have done that honor.  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, joining us right now.  Doctor, Secretary, very good to have you. Thank you.",

And that's why I believe that there is no other national resource that can provide those services to veterans. I also believe that it is important that we work with the private sector, because when the private sector does it better than VA, I believe our veterans deserve that.

He has dramatically changed expectations.\" He refers to things that you have done to try to marry the records, Defense Department records with those of the VA, so they're not -- you can -- they're seamless, but a lot of them commonsense solutions.  But, again, a lot depend also on the waiting times going dramatically down and the service remaining as stronger as it has been.  So that will be the metric which you will be ultimately judged.

But the problems in the VA are really due to the fact that we haven't modernized the VA. We haven't been using best practices that the industry has been using for a long time. And so we're hard at work at fixing those issues.  Those are not primarily money issues. But I do want to say that we are listening in a way that we haven't done before.
