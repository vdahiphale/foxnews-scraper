Welcome to -- we're coming to you tonight from outside Kingsbury Hall and the Nancy Peery Marriott Auditorium on the campus of University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  We are 27 hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate of this election cycle. It pits incumbent Republican Vice President Mike Pence against California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris. The moderator will be USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, you may know as a frequent panelist on SPECIAL REPORT. There will be additional health safety measures for this debate after President Trump's positive diagnosis for COVID-19 a short time after his debate with Joe Biden.  President Trump is tweeting that he's looking forward to next week's debate in Miami that he's feeling great and that the country is \"Learning to live with COVID.\" While former Vice President Joe Biden says the president should take some responsibility for his diagnosis.  The president's doctor says the first patient is showing no signs of the virus. The president is also halting stimulus talks with House Democrats until after the election, more on that in a second. Also tonight, President Trump's director of National Intelligence releasing documents that seem to implicate former President Obama and Hillary Clinton's alleged plan to smear then-candidate Trump four years ago, least briefed on it.  We have Fox team coverage, Peter Doocy here in Salt Lake City has the Biden campaign story. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight. Good evening, John.",

Today instructing his Treasury Secretary and chief of staff to suspend negotiations with House Democrats over a coronavirus relief bill until after the election. The president tweeting, Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 trillion to bail out poorly run, high crime, Democrat states, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a generous offer of $1.6 trillion. And as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request and looking to the future of our country.   Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows had been talking with Pelosi for weeks, but the two sides are separated by a gap of $600 billion they cannot seem to close. President Trump tweeted that if he wins the election, we will pass a major stimulus bill that focuses on hard-working Americans and small businesses. Adding that he has asked Senator Mitch McConnell to focus full time on approving my outstanding nominee to the United States Supreme Court Amy Coney Barrett.  The president was also talking tough upon his return to the White House last night. Speaking now from personal experience, he urged Americans to stand tall against the threat from coronavirus.",

He hired a suspected Russian spy to create that dossier.  What this is saying is that Russia believed that she had personally authorized this plan on July 26 or so before -- of 2016 and that U.S. Intelligence officials took it so seriously that Russians believe this. They further believe that this was done to distract from her own scandal.  They briefed President Obama about it early on in this -- you know, in 2016. And so, he knew that this was part of her -- what she was trying to do. Everything we found out about this story in recent years has pointed in one direction, that Intelligence agencies didn't really handle this very well.

For some reason, Democrats decided that they wanted to use the issue politically rather than come to agreement with Republicans.

If she -- if she truly cares about it, she can get it done immediately. But it should be -- people should be honest about who exactly has been posing the problems here.

Meantime, Democratic lawmakers calling for Congress to rein in big tech. Such a plan could possibly force Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple to sever their dominant platforms from their other lines of business and impose new uniformity on the terms they offer users. The proposals are in a report issued today following an investigation by a House Judiciary Committee panel into the company's market dominance. Republicans counter by saying existing law is the best method of holding tech companies accountable for censorship and anti-conservative bias. Facebook is tightening its policy against QAnon, the group that fosters political conspiracy theories. The company says it will remove Facebook pages, groups, and Instagram accounts from what it calls representing QAnon, even if they do not promote violence. Less than two months ago, Facebook said it would only remove QAnon groups if they promote violence. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", the U.S. Supreme Court will handle an emergency filing over mail-in voting in Montana. Today, the Ninth Circuit declined a request to enjoin what the district court decided last month, which was essentially, to allow the statewide election to be held via mail-in in large part.  Montana's governor argues an emergency declaration connected to the pandemic, allows him to suspend a state law that bars holding federal elections by mail. Ballots are supposed to go out Friday. On that line, officials in Florida are investigating a crash of the state's online voter registration system just before the deadline to participate in next month's election.

What needs to happen, what do you think will happen? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  First of all, it's an extremely important debate at this moment because of the two top people on the ticket. You have one, the 74-year-old president who just got out of the hospital, and the other who would be 78 on inauguration day, by far the oldest president ever to begin his term in office. So it is a big deal. It's going to be a much more conventional debate than we have seen because Donald Trump is not there. It will be much more conventional. And you will hear Kamala Harris staffers and supporters say they're going to tie Mike Pence to his record, but I believe for Republicans, a lot of Republicans would be OK with that, to talk about the court, to talk about deregulation, to talk about strengthening the military and an economy they believe was humming along before coronavirus and is now improving rapidly.",

He was very steady, a fermentable performance in 2016. Can she get him to talk about how and why this White House doesn't talk about lost lives? Can she get him to talk about why the president talked in private about a deadly virus but in public downplayed it?

It pits incumbent Republican Vice President Mike Pence against California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris. The moderator will be USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, you may know as a frequent panelist on SPECIAL REPORT. There will be additional health safety measures for this debate after President Trump's positive diagnosis for COVID-19 a short time after his debate with Joe Biden. President Trump is tweeting that he's looking forward to next week's debate in Miami that he's feeling great and that the country is \"Learning to live with COVID.\" While former Vice President Joe Biden says the president should take some responsibility for his diagnosis. The president's doctor says the first patient is showing no signs of the virus. The president is also halting stimulus talks with House Democrats until after the election, more on that in a second. Also tonight, President Trump's director of National Intelligence releasing documents that seem to implicate former President Obama and Hillary Clinton's alleged plan to smear then-candidate Trump four years ago, least briefed on it.

We made a generous offer of $1.6 trillion. And as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request and looking to the future of our country. Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows had been talking with Pelosi for weeks, but the two sides are separated by a gap of $600 billion they cannot seem to close. President Trump tweeted that if he wins the election, we will pass a major stimulus bill that focuses on hard-working Americans and small businesses. Adding that he has asked Senator Mitch McConnell to focus full time on approving my outstanding nominee to the United States Supreme Court Amy Coney Barrett.

We discovered that over the course of years that she was the person behind that. That her campaign had purchased this operation from a group called Fusion GPS which contracted with an unregistered foreign agent of a sanctioned Russian oligarch. He hired a suspected Russian spy to create that dossier. What this is saying is that Russia believed that she had personally authorized this plan on July 26 or so before -- of 2016 and that U.S. Intelligence officials took it so seriously that Russians believe this. They further believe that this was done to distract from her own scandal. They briefed President Obama about it early on in this -- you know, in 2016. And so, he knew that this was part of her -- what she was trying to do. Everything we found out about this story in recent years has pointed in one direction, that Intelligence agencies didn't really handle this very well. And yet, nobody seems to be held accountable except for that one Mueller attorney who falsified evidence to spy on the Trump team.

Whether this is a win, a small win for Democrats, or a small lose for the Republicans is one of the reasons I think so many in this country dissolution with politics. If we need to push through a Supreme Court nominee and I respect the mandate the president has following through on his constitutional responsibility, it would seem like in a moment when so many Americans are hurting, that the president would not pull these negotiators, that he would press and push and press and push and try to find some negotiated settlement or some compromise before the election. This is bad politics; I think this is a win for Democrats. I'm not one that likes it."

They're not moving off of 2.2 trillion. And now, Nancy Pelosi, obviously putting out a statement. If you look at the Dow today when the president tweeted out what he tweeted out, it obviously fell off a cliff in the numbers. Your thoughts."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, if it's a win, it's been part because the way the media have portrayed Nancy Pelosi's refusal to pass legislation during this election season. We saw this when Tim Scott tried to put forth criminal justice reform, a package that really should have -- should have been able to be passed. For some reason, Democrats decided that they wanted to use the issue politically rather than come to agreement with Republicans. Likewise, it is Nancy Pelosi, who stepped away every stage of this process. And I think that what President Trump is saying is that there's no reason to continue working that way, given that she has shown a reluctance to actually get this bill passed. If she -- if she truly cares about it, she can get it done immediately. But it should be -- people should be honest about who exactly has been posing the problems here. And Nancy Pelosi, according to Hill sources say -- they say, you know she has just really refused to negotiate in good faith here."

And I think Mollie is correct. I think Democrats are pretty clearly to blame for stopping this.

Meantime, Democratic lawmakers calling for Congress to rein in big tech. Such a plan could possibly force Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple to sever their dominant platforms from their other lines of business and impose new uniformity on the terms they offer users. The proposals are in a report issued today following an investigation by a House Judiciary Committee panel into the company's market dominance. Republicans counter by saying existing law is the best method of holding tech companies accountable for censorship and anti-conservative bias. Facebook is tightening its policy against QAnon, the group that fosters political conspiracy theories. The company says it will remove Facebook pages, groups, and Instagram accounts from what it calls representing QAnon, even if they do not promote violence. Less than two months ago, Facebook said it would only remove QAnon groups if they promote violence. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", the U.S. Supreme Court will handle an emergency filing over mail-in voting in Montana. Today, the Ninth Circuit declined a request to enjoin what the district court decided last month, which was essentially, to allow the statewide election to be held via mail-in in large part. Montana's governor argues an emergency declaration connected to the pandemic, allows him to suspend a state law that bars holding federal elections by mail. Ballots are supposed to go out Friday. On that line, officials in Florida are investigating a crash of the state's online voter registration system just before the deadline to participate in next month's election.

There are some polls recently have him picking up more points since the last debate. Battlegrounds still tight. We're back with our battle, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., chairman of RX Saver, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Byron, set the table, if you would, for the V.P. debate tomorrow night. What needs to happen, what do you think will happen? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  First of all, it's an extremely important debate at this moment because of the two top people on the ticket. You have one, the 74-year-old president who just got out of the hospital, and the other who would be 78 on inauguration day, by far the oldest president ever to begin his term in office. So it is a big deal. It's going to be a much more conventional debate than we have seen because Donald Trump is not there. It will be much more conventional. And you will hear Kamala Harris staffers and supporters say they're going to tie Mike Pence to his record, but I believe for Republicans, a lot of Republicans would be OK with that, to talk about the court, to talk about deregulation, to talk about strengthening the military and an economy they believe was humming along before coronavirus and is now improving rapidly."

And Kamala Harris is probably eager to talk about President Trump having gotten coronavirus. It is definitely true that both sides say they want to show how they are different from each other. That's good for the American people, to see what the choices are between voting for a Trump, and voting for Biden-Harris. And on this issue of whether you should be optimistic and take coronavirus seriously but not let it control your entire life, versus this idea that we have to live in fear about it, I think that's a referendum that Americans do want to have. And clearly many people in the media and the Democratic Party very much want to keep children banned from schools, keep businesses shut down, keep everything locked down. And I think a lot of Americans are saying they are more than done with that and they are ready to move forward now that we have a better handle and better treatments and better understanding of what the coronavirus is."

So this is in many ways a referendum on him. I do think it would behoove Senator Harris to be calm, to be prosecutorial, to press Mike Pence, who is a good debater. He was very steady, a fermentable performance in 2016. Can she get him to talk about how and why this White House doesn't talk about lost lives? Can she get him to talk about why the president talked in private about a deadly virus but in public downplayed it? These are the kinds of things I think the American public deserves to hear as much as they deserve to hear Vice President Mike Pence question her as well.

They had a good team, they made it to the playoffs. They just got knocked out by the Nuggets in the first round. This is our home this week. We're going to give you a little tour. Come on. So this is our area where we'll have lunch and catering, and these tables here were all set up around the concourse. Pretty wild, we are the only ones in this facility. Hair and makeup, here this is where we get all pretty. Look, behind-the- scenes, hair and makeup, getting ready. Very important executives right here. Jay Wallace, Sherrie (ph) Grech (ph). And then this is our big set. This is where we'll be doing the big show, and then we'll be over in the debate hall as well. But this is our home. Utah Jazz and SPECIAL REPORT, THE STORY will be back after this."

      "utterance": "See the plexiglass, they're getting ready in there. Finally tonight, some silver linings. Georgia pastor, Bishop Eusebio Phelps gave waitress Hannah Hill the surprise of a lifetime. Touched by her kindness and learning that her unborn child will of the same name as his late son Samuel, the pastor shared her story on Facebook, and within about a day, supporters raised more than $12,000 for her. And he gave it to her in a tip. The day after Christmas last year, Isabel Kirby could no longer move her legs. The 13-year-old from Medina, Ohio, was diagnosed with a rare neurological disease. But with the help of physician therapy at Akron Children's Hospital, the motivated teenager is starting to walk again just this week. There are great things happening in our country. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
