We have popping up in new states. We reported just moments ago, five cases reported in New York state.  Let's bring in our panel, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, and Brian Kilmeade, co-host of FOX & FRIENDS and author of the new book \"The President and the Freedom Fighter, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and Their Battle to Save America's Soul.\" Look forward to reading that.

      "sentences": "Yes. He has been trying to get ahead of it for years, ever since it happened, in a political fashion. So let's start with Joe Biden. He has been all over the map, and that's the problem with the president. He said we shouldn't politicize it. Of course, he spent all of 2020 politicizing it. He said he wouldn't support a mandate. He supported a mandate. So, Joe Biden has not been a steady leader. He has been a politician on this. Don't just stand there, do something is really Biden's approach.   And when it comes to the vaccine and the mandate, I do think this is gray area. I know a lot of people want to make it black and white, but I see this as gray. When you think about the principle of mandating vaccines for grave, health related issues, we crossed that line 150 years ago. In Massachusetts in the 1850s smallpox was mandatory vaccine. Since then rubella, measles, all kinds of things, in the state of Texas hepatitis b, polio are mandated vaccines in schools. So I don't philosophically oppose a mandate necessarily, but I do think you have to be realistic and stop pushing when so many Americans will not accept it. Most Americans have, are double vaccinated, 71 percent of all Americans over 18 are fully vaccinated. But to those who don't want to take it, it shouldn't be a mandate.",

Are we going to get vaccinated to avoid a runny nose and a low fever? It's restriction, restriction, restriction, that's what he is talking about today. I'm going to keep the mask on on planes, even though the air cycles through. They say it's one of the cleanest places you could actually be on the indoors.

This is a vaccine that we would not have but for Operation Warp Speed, and I think the incredible work that scientists and medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies were able to do largely because the way it was paved for them to do it.  I think when you look at serious health professionals, which I consider every health professional to be serious, but when you look at the serious community of professionals and you take out politics, there are two things they agree upon, that the vaccine is our greatest weapon and protection against the COVID and against its mutations and variants, and that the variants are able to -- are able to, excuse me, develop amongst the unvaccinated, and that's how we are getting the breakthrough cases with those of us who are vaccinated.  I happen to think that Ari had had it most right. He had to contort himself a little bit to get to the end of it. We should have a mandate around this. As Ari so aptly said, we have a history of this in our nation. This is about public health. And unless you have a compelling health or religious reason for not getting the vaccine, I don't see why we wouldn't want to force people to make people get it, because no one is dying from the vaccine or getting very ill from the vaccine itself.",
