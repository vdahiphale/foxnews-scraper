      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. Now, in just mere moments, California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner will join us for her first exclusive interview.  Tonight, we're in beautiful Southern California, where some might say the united socialist states of California, where, by the way, it was once the land of American pioneers. Ronald Reagan was governor out here, boundless possibilities. Not really that long ago, that Republican presidential candidates could win the great state of California. A lot has changed.  Now, California's beautiful weather, abundant natural resources, it has attracted hardworking, innovative, fun loving people from all across the country. So for many years, California was, well, pretty much an image of the American Dream. It embodied the American Dream. It truly represented what Reagan called a shining city on a hill.  But now, today, California is suffering. The state's one party, Democratic Party rule, has been unchecked, and by the way, hasn't been checked in a decade, and the results are palpable. The state's taxes are now beyond oppressive, especially to those who are struggling to get by. Income tax, well, can be high as 12 percent, 13 percent. Sales tax over 7 percent. Corporate taxes, which, of course, they don't pay taxes, they try as hard as they can to pass it on to we, the people -- well, that is hovering around 10 percent in the state.  And get this, California's gas tax, a whopping $0.50 per gallon, among the highest in the nation. And meanwhile, massive restrictions on development, construction. It has caused home prices in the state to skyrocket. As a result, homelessness is now rampant all throughout the state. These problems are real. Thousands upon thousands of tents, makeshift shelters, lined very busy streets in Los Angeles, San Francisco, other major cities in the state, and the situation is dire.  We have shown you ourselves, we send our cameras to both Los Angeles and San Francisco. And to make matters worse, California, it is hemorrhaging jobs. The state of California now has the third highest unemployment rate in the country, the highest number of unemployed residents. In the last year alone, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the Oracle Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, all announced bye-bye, they're leaving California, and they are going to Texas.   And not far behind, the residents of California, they are fleeing the state. Over the past decade, 1.3 million more people left California then came in from other states. After this year's census, California lost a congressional seat for the first time ever, and it's only getting worse. As we speak, the state's ongoing draconian COVID-19 lockdown measures, they continue to drive more residents out of this great state because of Governor Newsom's unholy alliance with teachers unions, over now half of California's public school students, they are not in the classroom. As a point of reference, in Florida, kids have been back in school since August. But, of course, Governor Newsom's children, well, they have enjoyed in person learning at a private school for quite some time. Just like the governor enjoyed a maskless dinner with no social distancing at an upscale restaurant, all while restricting California residents from doing the same, and even shutting down businesses that do not strictly adhere to his long list of COVID rules and regulations. Now, keep in mind, California has twice as many COVID deaths as Florida and a similar per capita death rate, and Florida has been wide open for months.   Tonight, it is clear, California is at a crossroads. Its governor is now facing a recall election. The people of California will have a critical decision to make. Now, one candidate, Caitlyn Jenner, is avowing a new path, a new vision forward, for the people of California. Take a look.",

This past year has redefined our career politicians as elitists, and the people of California as the warriors, the kings, and the angels.  We never take kindly to glass ceilings here.

And I came out -- come to California, the Golden State.  I went to San Jose. Why? Because San Jose was where all the great athletes lived. I had met them in my first Olympics in 1972. And me as a decathlete, I wanted to learn from all these other great athletes. In fact, in 1976, we took -- we placed fifth as a nation with three gold medals, a silver and a bronze within a five-mile radius up at my house. I put myself with some of these great athletes, and I learned so much. I want to do the same thing now. I want to take that same fight, that same spirit, go to Sacramento, surround myself with some of the smartest people out there. I am an outsider, I understand that. Smartest people out there. Because now I'm in a race for solutions. I need to find solutions to be able to turn this state around. I absolutely love this state.  I'm a fighter, always have been. I come from a long line of fighters.

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY. Now, in just mere moments, California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner will join us for her first exclusive interview. Tonight, we're in beautiful Southern California, where some might say the united socialist states of California, where, by the way, it was once the land of American pioneers. Ronald Reagan was governor out here, boundless possibilities. Not really that long ago, that Republican presidential candidates could win the great state of California. A lot has changed. Now, California's beautiful weather, abundant natural resources, it has attracted hardworking, innovative, fun loving people from all across the country. So for many years, California was, well, pretty much an image of the American Dream. It embodied the American Dream. It truly represented what Reagan called a shining city on a hill. But now, today, California is suffering. The state's one party, Democratic Party rule, has been unchecked, and by the way, hasn't been checked in a decade, and the results are palpable. The state's taxes are now beyond oppressive, especially to those who are struggling to get by. Income tax, well, can be high as 12 percent, 13 percent. Sales tax over 7 percent. Corporate taxes, which, of course, they don't pay taxes, they try as hard as they can to pass it on to we, the people -- well, that is hovering around 10 percent in the state. And get this, California's gas tax, a whopping $0.50 per gallon, among the highest in the nation. And meanwhile, massive restrictions on development, construction. It has caused home prices in the state to skyrocket. As a result, homelessness is now rampant all throughout the state. These problems are real. Thousands upon thousands of tents, makeshift shelters, lined very busy streets in Los Angeles, San Francisco, other major cities in the state, and the situation is dire. We have shown you ourselves, we send our cameras to both Los Angeles and San Francisco. And to make matters worse, California, it is hemorrhaging jobs. The state of California now has the third highest unemployment rate in the country, the highest number of unemployed residents. In the last year alone, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the Oracle Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, all announced bye-bye, they're leaving California, and they are going to Texas. And not far behind, the residents of California, they are fleeing the state. Over the past decade, 1.3 million more people left California then came in from other states. After this year's census, California lost a congressional seat for the first time ever, and it's only getting worse. As we speak, the state's ongoing draconian COVID-19 lockdown measures, they continue to drive more residents out of this great state because of Governor Newsom's unholy alliance with teachers unions, over now half of California's public school students, they are not in the classroom. As a point of reference, in Florida, kids have been back in school since August. But, of course, Governor Newsom's children, well, they have enjoyed in person learning at a private school for quite some time. Just like the governor enjoyed a maskless dinner with no social distancing at an upscale restaurant, all while restricting California residents from doing the same, and even shutting down businesses that do not strictly adhere to his long list of COVID rules and regulations. Now, keep in mind, California has twice as many COVID deaths as Florida and a similar per capita death rate, and Florida has been wide open for months. Tonight, it is clear, California is at a crossroads. Its governor is now facing a recall election. The people of California will have a critical decision to make. Now, one candidate, Caitlyn Jenner, is avowing a new path, a new vision forward, for the people of California. Take a look."

Now, I enter a different kind of race, arguably my most important one yet -- to save California. I want to carry the torch for the parents who had to balance work and their child's education, for business owners who are forced to shut down, for pastors who were not able to be with their congregation, or the family who lost their home in a fire, for an entire generation of students who lost a year of education. This past year has redefined our career politicians as elitists, and the people of California as the warriors, the kings, and the angels. We never take kindly to glass ceilings here.

For the LGBTQ community, I used to go back -- but in 1973, I graduated from college in Iowa. I packed up my '63 VW Bug and drove across the country, everything I owned in the backseat. And I came out -- come to California, the Golden State. I went to San Jose. Why? Because San Jose was where all the great athletes lived. I had met them in my first Olympics in 1972. And me as a decathlete, I wanted to learn from all these other great athletes. In fact, in 1976, we took -- we placed fifth as a nation with three gold medals, a silver and a bronze within a five-mile radius up at my house. I put myself with some of these great athletes, and I learned so much. I want to do the same thing now. I want to take that same fight, that same spirit, go to Sacramento, surround myself with some of the smartest people out there. I am an outsider, I understand that. Smartest people out there. Because now I'm in a race for solutions. I need to find solutions to be able to turn this state around. I absolutely love this state. I'm a fighter, always have been. I come from a long line of fighters. My grandfather was in World War I, was in the dead pile; somebody was walking by and heard a moan, and they said, oh my God, somebody's alive in here and pulled him out, and he wound up going on and living a very good life."

And -- but we have to change things. I love this country. I'm a patriarch. I love this state. The state's done so much for me over the years, and I've watched it crumble right in front of my eyes. And you've got to stand up, you know? And so, I knew it would not be easy. I knew it would be tough. But you know what? California's worth fighting for, and that's what I'm doing."

It's like, there's one set of rules for Sacramento, and there's another set of rules for everybody else. I mean, you've seen the video of him at The French Laundry, OK? I can't go down to my restaurant, and all the employees in that restaurant down there are not working. OK? And he's up there dining. We see Nancy Pelosi. I can't go to my hair salon. All the salons in my town are closed. Nobody can go in there and nobody's working. People are losing money. But she can sneak in. And it's the hypocrisy of what's going on. Yes, it is -- a dynasty, I guess you could say, in Sacramento. They've really been in charge for the last 40 years. I mean, we had Reagan come in a little bit, Arnold come in a little bit as Republicans, but it's been a dynasty. And as we see what happens here and, in the recall -- everybody was behind the recall; they needed 1.5 million votes, they got 2.1. But, of course, the Democrats had to verify every signature."

He's been horrible for business. Obviously, companies are leaving left and right -- 18,000 companies have left California. My friends are leaving California. Actually my hangar, the guy across, Fred Griffin (ph), he was packing up his hangar, I said, where are you going? And he says, I'm moving to Sedona, Arizona, I can't take it here anymore.

I see what's going on, and I see no common sense in politics and why they're doing it, besides only for political reasons. And I have always been on the Republican side, just because I have conservative economic values. You know, the old saying, lower taxes, less regulations, you know, a more friendly business environment, and we don't have that in California. But socially, I've much -- I've been much more progressive all my life. I get it. People do need help. You know, we need programs. But you cannot have social programs without an economy -- doesn't happen. You just don't have the finances to do it. And that's what's happening here in California.

There's more to it than that, and I think in the future I will explain more of that. But for me as a trans woman, I think role models are extremely important for young people. Trans issues people struggle with big time. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than the general public. And for me to be a role model to them, to be out there.

Granted, I live in a more rural area, and they were probably over protecting more houses. But we need to do a better job. We need an early detection system when it comes to fires. I've seen so many of them in Malibu. I've lived there for 48 years. And the biggest thing and the most important thing is that they jump on a fire as quick as possible and put it out when it's small.

I don't blame the federal government for coming down and saying we're going to shut this country down quickly, and they did. But I don't think anybody had any idea how it was going to be a political game to reopen. As you said, some states have done very well -- mentioned Florida. We've done a terrible job. Easy example, Florida, Orlando -- Disneyworld opened up nine months ago. Anaheim, Disneyland opened up six days ago.

I have statistics in LA, 465 shootings since January 1st, up 67 percent from last year, homicides up 26 percent. When you look at L.A. County and outside the city of Los Angeles, well, homicides up a whopping 113 percent, and Gavin Newsom is going to release 76,000 additional inmates for good behavior, 63,000 of them committed violent crimes.

And so, I am 100 percent behind our police force. Every place I go, if I see a cop -- if I'm driving, and I see a cop, I'll put my hand out the window and give them a thumbs up. If I'm -- they're sitting there, I'll pull up and say, hey, thank you for your service. You know, this citizen appreciates what you do. I 100 percent support our police forces. As far as -- I would be very tough on rioting, using as many forces as I could possibly use to stop the rioting and protect the citizens and the businesses of this community.

I used to have a home in Tahoe, how much snowfall do we have here, because that's where the bulk of our water comes from. And every year, I see this guy go out, and he's on the news, and he has this big, long pole. And he takes it out of this field, and he sticks it down to see what the -- how much snow we have. This year, it was only down maybe three or four feet, other days (ph), it's been like 10 feet where he's like, pushing the pole down, you're thinking, oh, we're in pretty good shape. Our water system's going up and down all the time. This year, we're down. We've gotten, here in the Los Angeles area, really, probably only two good rainfalls, and you can see that -- from my house, you can see how vegetation is very -- you know, it's not green, it's just - because it just hasn't gotten much water. We are headed for a drought. That has to be looked at in advance. Here's my crazy thinking -- again, Sean, logical thinking. We are now spending billions of dollars on this high-speed rail, OK? They talk about it all the time between LA and San Francisco. And I'm going, why are we doing that? I can get on a plane at LAX and I'll be in San Francisco in 50 minutes, you know, why do we need high-speed rail? Why don't we do this -- why don't we invest that money in desalinization plants along the coast? Take that water, and any time it's a bad year, desalinate the water, have some pipes going over the mountains out to the San Joaquin Valley for all our farmers, have it down here, we're in the Camarillo area. You look right over here; I drive through the farmyards every year. Why don't we just start to look at it -- wait a second, maybe water is a bigger issue than trying to move a few people fast --"

And if they have any faith in their soul whatsoever, they sit there and they go, God, why'd you do this? Why is this issue for me, of identity, in my head 24 hours a day, every day, 365 days out of the year? You can't take two aspirin, get plenty of sleep, wake up the next morning and you're fine -- it's just always there, it's who you are. But why? And so, this question was always in my heart. And sitting - I sat down with my pastor, and you know what? I thought, is there a reason for this? Am I doing the right thing? Do I need to come out and make a difference in probably the most marginalized community in the world? After long thought, I said, you know what, at this point in my life, my kids are raised, everybody's fine. Maybe it's time I take care of myself. Because when that day comes, and you go up to the pearly gates, and you're walking up the stairs, and you're seeing God in front of you, and you just ask that question, did I do a good job? Did I do the right thing? And just hope he says, hey, come on in. I did a good job. So that's what my life's been about. I'm just trying to be myself, and I can be myself now -- I couldn't do it before, because I had too many secrets. In my book, \"Secrets of My Life,\" I got all my secrets out, I have no secrets anymore. And I just wake up and be myself all day.
