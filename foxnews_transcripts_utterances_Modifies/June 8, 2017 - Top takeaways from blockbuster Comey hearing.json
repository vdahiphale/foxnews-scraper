That memo was leaked on February 15, at which time Jim Comey said that he was going -- look, Jim Comey probably perjured himself today or at least made a grave mistake. This would not be the first time in Jim Comey's testimony history where he has made an error when he's speaking to Congress.

We are \"The Fox News Specialists.\" The James Comey hearing living up to its block buster building, it was bombshell after bombshell for nearly three hours today, we've got an incredible amount of stuff to get to. So let's bring in our specialists right off the top. He worked as a legislative political director for the RNC northeast region, and he's the former political advisor and campaign manager to none other than President Donald Trump, needless to say his specialty is everything politics, my good friend Corey Lewandowski is here. And she's a Democratic political analyst serve in a senior role on the campaigns of then Senator John Kerry and Ted Kennedy, and she's a principal at the Dewey Square Group, but her specialty is riding her Vespa, currently is the happiest way to travel. Mary Anne Marsh is here. So we have a ton of tape to debate and analyze, so let's do this. Pick a comments appreciated specialists. Obstruction of justice accusations, the central focus of today's hearings with James Comey's claim that President Trumps said, and quote, I hope you can let this go, over the Flynn investigation, leading to this key exchange today."

Corey, the Wall Street Journal had an op-ed talking about this may be nothing more or less than Donald Trump, businessman in New York, and this is the way he operated here and he was just a political neophyte at the time."

And the bottom line is you could hope for a lot of things, the president didn't obstruct justice, there's no question about that. The one thing that's come out of today's testimony unequivocally was that Donald Trump as a candidate and now is the president has never been under FBI investigation. That is a headline James Comey had to admit to today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "One of the things that we heard today in the aftermath of that testimony, Eboni, is that Harvard professor and constitutional law scholar Alan Dershowitz said, you know what, Comey himself said it, there's no obstruction of justice here, and Comey is 100 percent correct."

    {
      "speaker": "EBONI K. WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Really want Comey said, and this is true, is that it's not up to him to decide whether or not there was an obstruction of justice charge. That is a legal conclusion, right, that ultimately Robert Mueller, the new special counsel appointed, will have to ultimately decide. But I agree with Corey, I mean -- and Comey said a lot of the leaks have just been flat out wrong. And he had assured the president and he'd maintained the entire time that President Trump personally was not under investigation. But as far as obstruction, Eric, you know, I said the entire time we don't know if there's anything there, but I certainly don't see any evidence to get us there so far."

      "utterance": "I think so. But I think they've also been doing a very good job of hearing what they want to hear, which all people who are partisans are guilty to an extent, whatever they want to hear is what they'll take from something. But it's really a denial of acknowledging how high the standard has to be of proof for obstruction of justice. You have to be able to show intent, that's really, really, tough, especially taken into account. The president can say stop this investigation if he wants to -- any investigation. He can pardon anybody wants to. He might have something inappropriate but to say, it doesn't mean it's a high crime and misdemeanor. That's really, really hard to prove."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",

    {
      "speaker": "MARY ANNE MARSH, DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I think what you have to look at here is, first of all, everything James Comey said today was under oath, under the pains and penalties of perjury, number one. Number two, the one thing you can quibble about with Comey is the facts. He find them, he pursue them. On judgment and performance, sure, we all have a lot of issues. There's no perfect witness. But what Comey said today repeatedly under oath is that Donald Trump lied repeatedly. And one of those lies was when he publicly said he never asked anything about Flynn to Comey and that was clearly a lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "We're going to get to that sound bite in a second. But another enormous piece of news to come out of today's hearings, how Bill Clinton's infamous tarmac meeting with Loretta Lynch impacted Comey's decision to publicly announce the conclusion to the Hillary Clinton email probe. Listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Ultimately, in a conclusive way that was the thing that capped it for me that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the justice department. At one point, the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it a matter, which confuse me and concern me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "So understand what you've just heard, the attorney general under President Obama, Loretta Lynch, instructed the FBI director to lie by renaming his ongoing investigation and call it, a matter, and coincidently or not, that's the same directive coming from the Clinton campaign. So, Mary Anne, there's your collusion, not between Donald Trump and the Russians, but between the president of the United States, Obama, his attorney general Loretta Lynch, and the FBI director Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "So we've known about that meeting at the tarmac for many, many months now, and that's why Loretta Lynch recused herself. And actually recused herself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "We didn't know she told Director Comey to rename his investigation, a matter. And by the way, that line up perfectly with what Hillary Clinton told her campaign to call it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "That has been reported. I've read that elsewhere. That that word, matter, had been used. I think if that's the standard here that we're applying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "It's the first time we've heard that Loretta Lynch told FBI director Comey to rename his investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "I can't find the citation word, but I'm confident it's out there because I remembered it. And the fact is if that's the standard, then Admiral Rogers should have been held to that same standards when he took a personal day and went to Trump Tower while he was still in charge, trying to get a better job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Corey, all day long, this was blowing up on social media, I'd never heard that Loretta Lynch, the A.G., instructed the FBI director to rename an investigation a matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "I've never heard either. But what's also troubling to me, if you look at what James Comey has said following his meeting with then President-elect Trump, and now President Trump, is he felt the need immediately to write memorandums to himself to document these, but there was no need after the attorney general instructed the FBI director in unlawful order to change the direction of an investigation by not calling it an investigation. He had no reason to memorialize this in writing and alert somebody else, whether that was White House counsel or somebody else, the assistant of the attorney general. He felt no obligation, no duty, no sense of honor that the attorney general has asked him to change the way he talks about something. That's where the real problem is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Now, really quick, Corey, I don't think that Loretta Lynch told him to stop the investigation or pivot the point. Now, the language, yes, that's what she said. She told me to use the term -- she said, yes, keep going with the investigation but don't call it that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "But he said in this testimony that he was very uncomfortable with her doing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, no doubt about it. It was not a good day for Mrs. Loretta Lynch today, absolutely not. But, she was not instructing him to pivot the investigation itself only to what he talked about it, which is still problematic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "Right. One quick thing, I mean, publicly she recused herself. The whole nation, the entire world knew that she was no longer involved in this case, and actually did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "As a Democrat, does it not bother you slightly that it lines up perfectly with a campaign, Hillary Clinton's campaign director to not call the investigation an investigation. It's sounds like collusion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "The semantics, yes. I think that's bad. And I also think it's really bad that Bill Clinton even got on the plane."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course that's bad. But I'm not going to take -- look, you said Comey said a lot of negative things about Trump, and he also said a lot of things that make Trump look good. I think that the people who are against Trump are taking only the things from the memo or from the hearing, excuse me, that make them look good, and the people that are for Trump said only the things that make -- it's just people are picking and choosing what they want to hear, either Comey's credible or he's not credible. This is just one person. There's going to be a lot more investigation in to this. We're going to have to wait and see what happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might be a tape. And my judgment was I needed to get that out to the public square. And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. So I asked a close friend of mine to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Is anyone else widely concerned that our FBI director leaked important documents to the press, and it begs the question, what else did he leak?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Excuse me. Excuse me. This is directly related to his position as the director of the FBI in a capacity where he has information that other Americans don't have, and he's so concerned about leaking the information himself because he knows it's irresponsible and inappropriate to do. That he has to give it to a liberal college professor to make sure it gets to the New York Times himself. That's -- and for that matter alone, he should have been fired if he did it before that. And clearly what we know and what Marco Rubio asked him today was how come the only information not coming out of the FBI has not been leak was that Donald Trump was never under investigation. And you know what Jim Comey's answer was, I don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Kat, go ahead, but understand something that at one point the New York Times and the Washington Post both called this some sort of smoking gun, this memo that we now know that James Comey, the day after, two days after he gets fired, leaks it to the New York Times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah, he did, he leaked it at the New York Times, and he did it for politically motivated reasons, all that is obvious. But it's not -- you can't point to a deep state theory of government officials leaking material. I'm not even saying one way or another whether that's true. But if it's a private citizen leaking, then based on what words mean, it's not."

He has the foresight, I guess to do that. Look, talk about the left, Eric, and yes, maybe they feel some kind of way about Jim Comey today. But let's not pretend like the left is in a love fest with Jim Comey. There was a lot, I think, if you want to say in terms of vindication of the president here. When -- who is this senator -- Riche asked specifically, was there ever the word used, you need to. He said that the word was simply, hope. I think that that's as close to vindication as President Trump is going to get on this issue. When Jim Comey said under oath that he only used the word, I hope you can, that's not really an instruction."

This is a man, again, who was a U.S. attorney, who was a premier law enforcement agent, and he has worked with multiple presidents, multiple attorney generals, and his response when he didn't report what took place was, I was stunned. It's a joke, right. It's absurd. He's a typical swamp creature. He's manipulative. He is manipulating the media for his own gain. This is everything that's been wrong with Washington. And then to go in front of congress and say, I was so stunned. I was afraid to call somebody. It's so egregious. It doesn't pass the smell test."

I'm still going to move forward with the investigation because it's the right thing to do. He didn't cower then and say I'm stunned. All of a sudden, anybody who's ever met Donald Trump, President Trump, knows how magnanimous he's in private, how gracious he is in private, how involved he is making sure everyone feels welcome in private, just like Bill Clinton had that ability. And all of a sudden, James Comey, the leader of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was so stunned he couldn't bring himself to call the White House counsel, the U.S. attorney -- the attorney general, the deputy attorney general. This is outrageous."

He made that statement on February 15. Jeff Sessions recused himself on March 2, two full weeks after. So either he is Nostradamus and can predict the future. But here's what he said. Jim Comey leaked a memo to the media, and he said that he leaked a memo regarding Kislyak to force Jeff Sessions to remove himself, because in the undocumented memo, what he said was there was no proper mechanism for the removal of an attorney general except public pressure. That memo was leaked on February 15, at which time Jim Comey said that he was going -- look, Jim Comey probably perjured himself today or at least made a grave mistake. This would not be the first time in Jim Comey's testimony history where he has made an error when he's speaking to Congress. What is very clear, his undisclosed memo and in that undisclosed memo, it says there is handwringing at the FBI on what to do if general -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not recuse himself. And the only way to get them to do that, because there is no mechanism, is through public pressure. That was an amazing memo that leaked to \"The New York Times.\" And what we now know is that Jim Comey is the leaker of the memorandums. He's admitted it himself, under oath."

But what is clear from Director Comey is that Russia had nothing to do with the impact of the outcome of the election. It did not mask where the state of Michigan was or the state of Ohio was, or the state of Pennsylvania. It didn't preclude Hillary Clinton's plane from going to any of the battleground states that she got absolutely destroyed in. Russia had nothing to do with that. What we do know is that she ran a terrible campaign, didn't connect with middle America; and that's why she lost. And it had nothing to do with the Russians."

And that's why I think you're going to start to see more reports, as you have in the last two weeks, about states like Illinois, and Arizona, and Florida, who did have their election databases hacked and did have the secretary of states and other related institutions that have everything to do with election day, had been hacked by the Russians. It wasn't just the DNC; wasn't just the RNC. There are a lot of states. And the Election Assistance Center was hacked, as well. And that is the repository for every single voting machine in this country, every precinct, every city and town. And that should scare everybody."
