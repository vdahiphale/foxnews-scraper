      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. In retrospect, it is remarkable just how dishonest, how thoroughly and intentionally dishonest the media coverage of the Kyle Rittenhouse story turned out to be. All of it was a lie. Rittenhouse was not a white supremacist. He was never in a militia. He never crossed state lines with a firearm. The protest in Kenosha was not peaceful. It was a riot -- chaotic and violent. Many of the rioters by the way carried guns. Rittenhouse was hardly alone. Rittenhouse didn't go to Kenosha looking for trouble. His father lived there. Rittenhouse himself worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha. On august 25th of last summer, Rittenhouse went downtown to stand guard over a car lot. Here is the context. The night before, police in Kenosha had done nothing as the mob burned businesses including another car lot all the way to the ground. So the business owner needed Kyle Rittenhouse's help. He was looking to a 17-year-old for help, if that gives you some perspective on how bad things were -- and he asked for it. As Rittenhouse stood there, rioters threatened his life. Then they attempted to kill him. In the end, Rittenhouse shot three attackers as he tried to run to the safety of the police. A number of media outlets claimed the men Rittenhouse shot were black, in fact, all three were white and all three had serious criminal records. We could go on. Again, the media coverage was from beginning to end, a tapestry of lies. If you watched the trial last week, you know that. But what about Kyle Rittenhouse himself? What is he like? Apart from his testimony in court, few Americans have ever heard his voice. Over the next hour, we're going to let Kyle Rittenhouse speak for himself. You can make up your own mind what you think. But before we start, one observation, which we can't resist making. It's hard to ignore the yawning class divide between Kyle Rittenhouse and his many critics in the media. Rittenhouse comes from the least privileged sector of our society. During high school, he worked as a janitor and a fry cook to help support his family. Last year, he got into college at Arizona State and he is very proud of it. In the world Kyle Rittenhouse grew up, and it is not a given that kids go to college, it is not even close. During the course of our long conversation, Kyle Rittenhouse struck us as bright, decent, sincere, dutiful, and hardworking -- exactly the kind of person you'd want many more of in your country. He is not especially political. He never wanted to be the symbol of anything. Kyle Rittenhouse just wanted to keep violent lunatics from setting fire to cars. In the America he grew up in, that was considered virtuous. So, if Rittenhouse seems a little bewildered at points during our interview, thinking back over the last year of what happened to him, that's probably why. A lot of the things he assumed were true about this country turned out not to be true at all. So in that way, he speaks for many of us. Here is Kyle Rittenhouse.",

This young man is far more intelligent than people wanted to give him credit for. There are many more dimensions to him than people realize. They saw him as a 17-year-old from a small town with kind of a boyish face, a boyish demeanor, and what they'll hear tonight in this interview or what we all heard was a young man who understood the enormity of the ramifications of his trial. It's almost as though he recognized it wasn't even about Kyle Rittenhouse, it was about the right of self-defense. He was smart enough to articulate this. He was smart enough to be able to recognize that what he was going through was really about American law and the Constitution and his right to defend himself. What will shock people is that he was very articulate in his description of supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement, and then went to the next step and said, you know, if someone were of color and in the same situation, I would be worried for them. I'm hoping they would have the same resources that I had. This is a young man who was a very empathic young man, all of the things he did in his life were to help people and the fact that when you said to him, you know why are you so calm? And he said, I've learned not to -- that I can't get upset about things that I can't control. I mean, you have to be like 50 before you figure that out. This kid has a tremendous future in front of him. He is not angry. When you asked him about the President what he would say, he -- you know, he just came back, not like a normal 18-year-old punk. He came back and he said, I would say, Mr. President, if you could go back and look at the facts, you would realize that what you said wasn't accurate. Everything he said, everything he talked about, the fact that he was able to go through all of this never, never get angry, never lose his cool. The fact that when you said to him you said, don't you want to hold people accountable? He said, well, you know my lawyers, I'm going to leave that up to them. And then you came back at him, Tucker, and you said but really, don't you want to hold them accountable? And he said, like I said, you know I'm relying on my lawyers. You know, it was like the withering cross-examination that he would stood in front of a nation aware of the impact and consequences of that cross- examination. Nothing moved him off the truth. This young man is a truth- teller. This young man is far more mature than his years. And even a mother and you know, I can't imagine as a mother, but his mom wanted him to hide. He said, no, I have to confront it. I have to face it, just like he did that night when he put his hands up and he tried to turn himself into the police and the police told them to get out of the way.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. In retrospect, it is remarkable just how dishonest, how thoroughly and intentionally dishonest the media coverage of the Kyle Rittenhouse story turned out to be. All of it was a lie. Rittenhouse was not a white supremacist. He was never in a militia. He never crossed state lines with a firearm. The protest in Kenosha was not peaceful. It was a riot -- chaotic and violent. Many of the rioters by the way carried guns. Rittenhouse was hardly alone. Rittenhouse didn't go to Kenosha looking for trouble. His father lived there. Rittenhouse himself worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha. On august 25th of last summer, Rittenhouse went downtown to stand guard over a car lot. Here is the context. The night before, police in Kenosha had done nothing as the mob burned businesses including another car lot all the way to the ground. So the business owner needed Kyle Rittenhouse's help. He was looking to a 17-year-old for help, if that gives you some perspective on how bad things were -- and he asked for it. As Rittenhouse stood there, rioters threatened his life. Then they attempted to kill him. In the end, Rittenhouse shot three attackers as he tried to run to the safety of the police. A number of media outlets claimed the men Rittenhouse shot were black, in fact, all three were white and all three had serious criminal records. We could go on. Again, the media coverage was from beginning to end, a tapestry of lies. If you watched the trial last week, you know that. But what about Kyle Rittenhouse himself? What is he like? Apart from his testimony in court, few Americans have ever heard his voice. Over the next hour, we're going to let Kyle Rittenhouse speak for himself. You can make up your own mind what you think. But before we start, one observation, which we can't resist making. It's hard to ignore the yawning class divide between Kyle Rittenhouse and his many critics in the media. Rittenhouse comes from the least privileged sector of our society. During high school, he worked as a janitor and a fry cook to help support his family. Last year, he got into college at Arizona State and he is very proud of it. In the world Kyle Rittenhouse grew up, and it is not a given that kids go to college, it is not even close. During the course of our long conversation, Kyle Rittenhouse struck us as bright, decent, sincere, dutiful, and hardworking -- exactly the kind of person you'd want many more of in your country. He is not especially political. He never wanted to be the symbol of anything. Kyle Rittenhouse just wanted to keep violent lunatics from setting fire to cars. In the America he grew up in, that was considered virtuous. So, if Rittenhouse seems a little bewildered at points during our interview, thinking back over the last year of what happened to him, that's probably why. A lot of the things he assumed were true about this country turned out not to be true at all. So in that way, he speaks for many of us. Here is Kyle Rittenhouse."

And we ended up at Reuther Central High School where we were cleaning graffiti for a couple of hours and then we met with the owners of Car Source and we offered to protect their business from fires, making sure the rest of their other two properties didn't get burned down like they did the night prior, and they agreed.

They just wanted to do it private, non-recorded, and the Judge said, no, no, no, it's going to be recorded.

Did you just shoot that man?\" And I told him, I'm going to the police. And he said, \"Oh okay,\" and ran off. And I kept running to get to the police. And that's when Anthony Huber strikes me with the skateboard as I'm running before I'm on the ground for the first time. And then I'm hit with a rock by somebody in a white tank top. And that's how I end up on the ground. And I have four people around me from what I remember, and I move my firearm in the direction, and they back off with their hands up, so I don't shoot them.

I go back to Car Source lot number 2 and I tell everybody there what happened. I said I had to do it. I just -- I was just attacked. I was dizzy. I was vomiting. I couldn't breathe. And I was like, we couldn't -- I wanted to turn myself in Kenosha -- I wanted to turn myself into the police in Kenosha, but I wasn't able to because they weren't accepting visitors apparently with the barricades and the fence up, so we ended up turning myself into the Antioch Police Department."

In his view, they badly abused him and his family and their trust. We will tell you a lot about that in just a minute and about the prosecutors.

It was during that time that his family desperately -- his mother mostly -- desperately looked for legal counsel, for representation. Someone who can help get out of jail. In the end, the family was represented by a pair of lawyers called Lin Wood and John Pierce. This came up out of nowhere. We were not expecting to have this conversation at all.

Again, the President of the United States did that as well as several Members of Congress. Now during the trial, one of the prosecutors, Thomas Binger, a particularly loathsome character, the government lawyer, mocked Kyle Rittenhouse for putting out fires in Kenosha.

If you look at the case, you look at the facts, no matter what your opinion is, or where you stand it. This isn't a -- this wasn't a political case. It shouldn't have been a political case. It was made a political case. This had nothing to do with race. And the ways people are twisting this, it is just sickening."

Kyle Rittenhouse shows up to prevent things from being burned to the ground, to stop arson. Guess whose side our leaders take? They call him a white supremacist. They slander him. Watching him speak, you realize just how disgusting what they did to him. Just ahead, he describes the months that he spent in jail and the conditions there which will shock you and how it affected his health. That's next."

I was extradited to Kenosha County Jail. My attorney, John Pierce said, oh, we're going to keep you in a juvenile facility. I always wanted to be extradited, and I had no problem with that. But he forgot to file the stay and he didn't even know I was going. So my attorney didn't know I was going to jail, which is quite sickening because he should have known."

But I didn't shower for until November 20th. And when I showered, I showered for like -- I took like a three-hour shower. I had like blood. My skin was bleeding because my skin was coming off of my body, it was just the nastiest thing ever. And I feel bad for Dave who has been with me through the beginning, who's helped start freekyleusa.org. I feel bad for him because he had to deal with my smell for that three-hour car ride.

And the most infuriating part is the facts haven't changed. Videotape of that night was available almost immediately to anyone who wanted to see it. It was very clear this man had acted -- this boy had acted in self-defense -- and they locked him up anyway, because of political pressure. So what are Kyle Rittenhouse's plans for the future? How do you live in America if you're Kyle Rittenhouse? We asked him that. That's straight ahead."

His community falls apart and he tries his best to do the right thing at a time when almost nobody else in the community is trying to do the right thing, but he does. And in return for that, the state under political pressure throws him in prison. Then the people who swear they will help him take advantage of him. It's a lot so.

He had to drive across state lines -- speaking of -- to turn himself in to the police it's an amazing story and it's a deeply sad story for what it says, not about him, but about the rest of us.

Like what if I wasn't alive or what if I did let Mr. Rosenbaum steal my gun? It's those type of dreams.

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, it's amazing. It's amazing that you've got this interview, Tucker. But I must tell you, I was blown away by the interview. This young man is far more intelligent than people wanted to give him credit for. There are many more dimensions to him than people realize. They saw him as a 17-year-old from a small town with kind of a boyish face, a boyish demeanor, and what they'll hear tonight in this interview or what we all heard was a young man who understood the enormity of the ramifications of his trial. It's almost as though he recognized it wasn't even about Kyle Rittenhouse, it was about the right of self-defense. He was smart enough to articulate this. He was smart enough to be able to recognize that what he was going through was really about American law and the Constitution and his right to defend himself. What will shock people is that he was very articulate in his description of supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement, and then went to the next step and said, you know, if someone were of color and in the same situation, I would be worried for them. I'm hoping they would have the same resources that I had. This is a young man who was a very empathic young man, all of the things he did in his life were to help people and the fact that when you said to him, you know why are you so calm? And he said, I've learned not to -- that I can't get upset about things that I can't control. I mean, you have to be like 50 before you figure that out. This kid has a tremendous future in front of him. He is not angry. When you asked him about the President what he would say, he -- you know, he just came back, not like a normal 18-year-old punk. He came back and he said, I would say, Mr. President, if you could go back and look at the facts, you would realize that what you said wasn't accurate. Everything he said, everything he talked about, the fact that he was able to go through all of this never, never get angry, never lose his cool. The fact that when you said to him you said, don't you want to hold people accountable? He said, well, you know my lawyers, I'm going to leave that up to them. And then you came back at him, Tucker, and you said but really, don't you want to hold them accountable? And he said, like I said, you know I'm relying on my lawyers. You know, it was like the withering cross-examination that he would stood in front of a nation aware of the impact and consequences of that cross- examination. Nothing moved him off the truth. This young man is a truth- teller. This young man is far more mature than his years. And even a mother and you know, I can't imagine as a mother, but his mom wanted him to hide. He said, no, I have to confront it. I have to face it, just like he did that night when he put his hands up and he tried to turn himself into the police and the police told them to get out of the way."
