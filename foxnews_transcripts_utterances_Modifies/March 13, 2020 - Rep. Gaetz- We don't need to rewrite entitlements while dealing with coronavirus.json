People going negative and then you have to cover your position so that you buy stocks. It is not really a total vote of confidence. But this was a good speech a good response. The markets like it. Again, be cautious, we still, here's the reality. Why do stocks go up or down? Stocks go up or down based on GDP and how GDP affects corporate earnings. If you think GDP is going down, you had other guests before talking about recessions. Therefore you have lower corporate earnings, or guess what stocks have to re-price and is probably going to be down. So I think that is the long-term prognosis here.

Here's the issue.  Now let me take a step back here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin they talked on the phone 12 times today including three times when the President was speaking. He would not continue to have those conversations if there wasn't a deal to be had. Now we just got a statement from the Speaker of the House about an hour and 15 minutes ago that there was an agreement on this Coronavirus Response Bill. I spoke with the senior administration official who indicated that they thought there was a deal. Then we started to hear from some House Republicans, no, the ink is not dry on this. And that the Treasury Secretary has not actually signed off on this. There's still some provision in the text which we don't have. There was an original bill put out 48 hours ago that they are still trying to resolve. Republicans have told me earlier in the day that there were technical problems with the bill. What does that mean? Well, there were provisions that did not pertain to Coronavirus, which Republicans thought went too far afield. Keep in mind here that the President said during his presentation in the Rose Garden today that he thought there were some things in here that shouldn't have been in there said that it did not go far enough. The House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to the White House today because they want to have air cover from the President in less he is going to sign off on it. If he is not, then they're not going to vote for it. Remember this was the experience that Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader dealt with in December of 2018 when they thought they had an agreement and then the government shut down. Even McCarthy dealt with a similar issue just a few days ago. They thought they had an agreement on FISA and negotiated with McCarthy and Bill Barr and then they passed through the House of Representatives, a bipartisan vote. And it is not going anywhere in the Senate.  We are expecting a vote tonight if they can you know kind of get this last mile behind them here. But the Senate has gone and they probably won't tinker with this until next week Martha.",

So, they are used to having these very kinds of strict rules on just about everything. And it has proved to be effective in this case, but I think you are right to point out that those kinds of orders from on high, they were obediently followed by everyone. That is just not really going to work in the free society like America. However, you're right to point out, you know, we are behind the curve. And that's why I was so pleased to see the president really getting going on the emergency declaration today and all the things that go with that.",

In one case, has to be quarantined and physical separations for different kinds of patients, all sorts of seemingly small systematic changes that seem to be working for them.\" I mean, what's, you know, what's the message for Americans because I think once we do see this testing ramp up over the coming next couple of weeks, we are likely to see the amount of diagnosis also probably accelerate fairly dramatically, I would say.

But I think that one thing I would point out more positively is what you have seen this week in America really reflects what a wonderful country this is. It is decentralized. We don't have some central command of control that can tell everyone want to do. And yet you have seen the different parts of the country, local governments, state government, the private sector, the supporting organizations, they have all stepped up, actually. And you are seeing the kind of aggressive response that has been imposed in other places actually emerging in a more organic decentralized way right across the country.

It's interesting to hear that Texas is already starting it. Here's Governor Cuomo of New York today talking about the consequences of closing schools. I think this is a big issue. Watch this."

You close schools you now have parents who can't go to work. You have parents who are working in health care facilities who can't go to work. So it is not that easy."

      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, what Governor Cuomo was saying is exactly right. There are a lot of add on consequences to closing schools. Let me tell you something though to put it in context, and that is before Coronavirus even existed in Texas, we had closed 50 schools in Texas this year for the regular flu. So this happens every single year. This should be done as health care authorities think that it should be done. But it automatically is not necessarily just to close a school because someone may be afraid of the virus."

So my next guest oversees clinical care for 51 hospitals in the United States including the hospital that treated the first known domestic case of Coronavirus. Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips is Chief Clinical Officer for Providence St. Joseph Health one of the nation's largest health care systems. It's great to have you with us this evening, Dr. Compton-Phillips. I guess my first question is what are you seeing across your hospitals in terms of increases in these cases and what is your read on where we are in the curve here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. AMY COMPTON-PHILLIPS, PROVIDENCE ST JOSEPH HEALTH EVP",
      "utterance": "Thank you for asking. We actually are seeing a significant uptick in the number of cases. And we expect to continue to see that for the next couple of weeks, because we know that it takes a while once people get exposed to start developing symptoms, and then for those symptoms to get severe enough to actually start seeking health care. And so we expect even if we stopped all transmission today for the next two weeks we would continue to see the uptick in cases. So we know we are still on the steep part of the curve. But by declaring the emergency and by having people stay at home and do social distancing, we hope to have that curve level off within the next month."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I think that is such an important message. Obviously everyone is trying to strike a balance between living you know this sort of freakishly abnormal existence, and to doing what we have to do. But what would your message be to people in terms of what they need to do? Stay home, don't go to - tell them what they need to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPTON-PHILLIPS",
      "utterance": "So my message is prepare, don't panic. And that actually maybe this will be a gift of time for everybody to slow down and smell the roses, it's going to be a long spring, and so reconnecting with the simple pleasures of being at home I think it's going to be a challenge for everybody across the country."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Were you surprised to see the President in the Rose Garden today shaking hands and everybody standing so close together? All the press of course is all close together too. When the message is just the opposite of that?"

      "speaker": "COMPTOM-PHILLIPS",
      "utterance": "I can tell you that it is incredibly hard to break a lifetime of habits just because somebody sends out an email or makes an announcement that our whole behavior is supposed to change. You know, every time you walk into a room with new people you reach out your hand. That is the way that you have been taught your whole life. And so we need to help each other, right, so that when you walk into a room, offer that elbow bump or offer the foot tap. It is just tough."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So obviously the President interacts with so many people and apparently one of the people who were next to him in a photo has tested positive. So should he be tested?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPTOM-PHILLIPS",
      "utterance": "You know we actually have a tool. I mean, now Google is working on building one. We have one on our website that helps people go through a list of do you have symptoms, do you know if you have been exposed? And so it can help people make the decision. And I think the President is a person, and so helping understanding his exposure on whether or not he has any symptoms can help him get test, decide whether or not to get tested. Because we do know that if people are tested and they have not developed symptoms yet, even if they do have the virus, they might not have sufficient virus to turn the test positive. So you can get a false negative without symptoms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes good point. With regard to the ICU units and ventilators, we have sort of you know very unsatisfying conversation last night with one member of the team, the White House team in terms of getting answers on this. But you said the numbers are going to continue to accelerate. So in your hospital system of 51 hospitals across I think three states, do you have enough ventilators for what you anticipate will be the need to care for all of those people who will need that care?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPTON-PHILLIPS",
      "utterance": "We are definitely worried about it. We are making plans in case we do not. And so those plans include working with all the other hospital systems in the State of Washington. Working with the public health authorities, and if we need to we are already starting early conversations with the national guard in the military saying if we get into an instance where the numbers continue to go up and that we have a significant number of people at risk for respiratory failure, we are going to make sure that we have the machines and the capacity to take care of people."

The DOW up nearly 2,000 points pretty much a mirror image of what we saw yesterday, S&P up 9 that was welcome news of course to everybody in the market. We took a huge hit on Thursday and the worst sell-off since the crash of '87. Here's a look at the week. So that's what this week looks like. And here is a look at since President Trump was elected, so yes, not bad. While the markets remain volatile, the hit to American businesses as the other huge side of this story here to talk about it tonight. Once again Charlie Gasparino is back CNN Correspondent and Fox Business. So what did you make of what happened today, Charlie?"

I mean, I think that it was a sigh of relief. That does not mean we are going back to the old days tomorrow. I think there is going to be more volatility. I mean, I think some of this you should know what's real enthusiasm that the Trump Administration has taken concerted efforts and that you have got the Fed involved now Fed is going to probably take interest rates on the short end down to zero."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "So a lot of people pressing down into the markets. Obviously spending $50 billion on this thing is a lot of money. And then just the notion that he is getting his hands around it and the White House is starting to do stuff, kits might will be available may be next week for testing all that helps the markets. My one sort of concern is the massive buy back during the speech. You had the feeling it was what is known as short covering. People going negative and then you have to cover your position so that you buy stocks. It is not really a total vote of confidence. But this was a good speech a good response. The markets like it. Again, be cautious, we still, here's the reality. Why do stocks go up or down? Stocks go up or down based on GDP and how GDP affects corporate earnings. If you think GDP is going down, you had other guests before talking about recessions. Therefore you have lower corporate earnings, or guess what stocks have to re-price and is probably going to be down. So I think that is the long-term prognosis here. If we can get our hands around this fast, well it will bounce back faster. If we can't, it is a long slow trek."

Because you look at the massive, the massive contraction of just lifestyle, right, you talk about going to a restaurant nearby that is always packed in New York City, empty. You can walk in. I went to a couple of places just in my town the other morning, like walking into practically everything empty. There's no way that does not have a ripple effect through all the companies that are--"

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "You're right about that, but a lot of people buy indexes and some companies will do very well. Now I'm going to go home tonight and this weekend and watch Netflix. I'm not crazy about Netflix as a stock it, because they have earnings they have some financial issues, but that stock is going to do well. It has to."

You know if you showed that chart of how well you did with the Trump markets it ain't a bad time if you rode that market up, take some off the table. Have a little cash cushion. You don't have to be total cash, 30 percent in cash, the stuff gets cheap, that is prudent investment."

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi there it is changing by the moment. Just before we came on the air, I'm told that there might be a problem in trying to get the bill across the finish line tonight. Here's the issue. Now let me take a step back here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin they talked on the phone 12 times today including three times when the President was speaking. He would not continue to have those conversations if there wasn't a deal to be had. Now we just got a statement from the Speaker of the House about an hour and 15 minutes ago that there was an agreement on this Coronavirus Response Bill. I spoke with the senior administration official who indicated that they thought there was a deal. Then we started to hear from some House Republicans, no, the ink is not dry on this. And that the Treasury Secretary has not actually signed off on this. There's still some provision in the text which we don't have. There was an original bill put out 48 hours ago that they are still trying to resolve. Republicans have told me earlier in the day that there were technical problems with the bill. What does that mean? Well, there were provisions that did not pertain to Coronavirus, which Republicans thought went too far afield. Keep in mind here that the President said during his presentation in the Rose Garden today that he thought there were some things in here that shouldn't have been in there said that it did not go far enough. The House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to the White House today because they want to have air cover from the President in less he is going to sign off on it. If he is not, then they're not going to vote for it. Remember this was the experience that Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader dealt with in December of 2018 when they thought they had an agreement and then the government shut down. Even McCarthy dealt with a similar issue just a few days ago. They thought they had an agreement on FISA and negotiated with McCarthy and Bill Barr and then they passed through the House of Representatives, a bipartisan vote. And it is not going anywhere in the Senate. We are expecting a vote tonight if they can you know kind of get this last mile behind them here. But the Senate has gone and they probably won't tinker with this until next week Martha."

      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL)",
      "utterance": "I think we would all agree that the Coronavirus Bill does not need any poison pills. And I think that this is the easy way to spot the issues. Everyone is for testing. Everyone is for medical infrastructure like ventilators. Where Republicans have challenges where we have got legislative provisions that forever change entitlement programs. We should not use the Coronavirus as an excuse to go and dramatically expand eligibility in the staff program, for example. So we want solutions that are medical infrastructure focused, testing focused, but don't rewrite entitlements while we are dealing with the Coronavirus."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Unfortunately, we see the Speaker of the House trying to jam the president, putting in for example reformations to abortion laws and abortion practices, the Hyde Amendment for example, into this legislative package is a way to try to make Republicans and the president look like we don't support testing."

As soon as that Air Force One ride was over, I was put in a DoD vehicle, taken to Walter Reed, tested. That test result came back negative. Health care professionals said I should still maintain the 14-day quarantine that ended at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. So, not exactly \"Straight Outta Compton,\" but I am straight out of quarantine."

I was just a little surprised today watching how everybody was, you know, sort of standing so close together and they were all in the same microphone and they're all putting their hands all over the same podium. And, you know, there has been a lot of exposure, obviously, they have all interacted with a lot of people as you have.

Because a lot of doctors and nurses, they are sending like videos and publishing that on social media, and they are begging the world to understand that, that the regime should not be trusted.

Because they wanted to show the rest of the world that see, a big turnout. They want the people to participate in the election. The number of participation in the election was already low, but they wanted to show off the rest of the world that we are in a stable regime. So that is why actually people are suffering from corruption, mismanagement, and hiding the coronavirus. And let me tell you another thing, always the western government, especially the European government, they say that we don't want to interfere in internal matter. What happened right now? The mismanagement hurting the rest of the world. First coronavirus in Lebanon, in Turkey, you know, Iraq coming from the Islamic Republic --"

So what notes can U.S. take to stop the spread in our country? Of course Singapore handles things very differently, but we are going to talk about that. And also, is England next on the list of countries that might not be ble to travel here. Steve Hilton is coming up next."

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight in the U.K., the British government announcing an emergency ban of all large gatherings beginning next week. That is President Trump says the U.S. allied may be included in his coronavirus travel restrictions after all because the U.K. has now seen a 35 percent rise in cases in just one day. Meanwhile, Singapore is receiving praise for its response with U.S. public health experts looking to the steps that they have taken to largely bring the COVID-19 outbreak under control there. Singapore building on lessons learned after being hit by SARS and H1N1. They now have a strict system to track and contain viruses as \"Business Insider\" reports, \"Singapore's working around the clock to find coronavirus cases. Lying about where you have been can result in six months of jail or a fine of up to $10,000.\" So that is one way to do it. Joining me now, Steve Hilton, host of \"The Next Revolution.\" Steve, great to have you with us. I mean, obviously we don't want to do -- there are many things that we don't want to do the way Singapore does. And they are taking a very heavy hand with this. But the flip side is that when you look at the chart in terms of our rising cases, our cases are rising more in line with Italy and China, and Singapore and Hong Kong is sort of flat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HILTON, HOST, THE NEXT REVOLUTION",
      "utterance": "Yes, that is right. I mean, the operative word in what you just said, Martha, in relation to Singapore is strict. They have a strict system for just (inaudible). Remember it is a very small place. Its population is nearly about half of New York City. So it's really, you know, we got to get that in and keep that in mind. But it's actually pretty close to being -- is being described as an authoritarian state. I mean, nothing like on the scale that you see in China, but it is a one- party state. You have the same political party in charge there for about 50 years. You have the same prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who founded the country basically around the place for 30 years or more at a stretch. So, they are used to having these very kinds of strict rules on just about everything. And it has proved to be effective in this case, but I think you are right to point out that those kinds of orders from on high, they were obediently followed by everyone. That is just not really going to work in the free society like America. However, you're right to point out, you know, we are behind the curve. And that's why I was so pleased to see the president really getting going on the emergency declaration today and all the things that go with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. This is from a piece in \"Wired\" talking about what they are doing in Singapore, \"People get their temperatures taken before they can enter most buildings including businesses, schools, gyms and government agencies. Everyone whose temperature is normal gets a green sticker. Then it says, keeping teams of health care workers separate from one another. In one case, has to be quarantined and physical separations for different kinds of patients, all sorts of seemingly small systematic changes that seem to be working for them.\" I mean, what's, you know, what's the message for Americans because I think once we do see this testing ramp up over the coming next couple of weeks, we are likely to see the amount of diagnosis also probably accelerate fairly dramatically, I would say. What do you think it's the sort of proper reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think first of all it's important as you are doing, to prepare people for that, to say look, this is going to get much worse before it gets better. But remember also the basic facts of it, with most people who get this will be fine. They will have zero or mild symptoms and so on. But I think that one thing I would point out more positively is what you have seen this week in America really reflects what a wonderful country this is. It is decentralized. We don't have some central command of control that can tell everyone want to do. And yet you have seen the different parts of the country, local governments, state government, the private sector, the supporting organizations, they have all stepped up, actually. And you are seeing the kind of aggressive response that has been imposed in other places actually emerging in a more organic decentralized way right across the country. I think that is a really positive thing about America."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think it is too. And I am amazed because, you know, if you told everybody a week ago that schools were going to be shut down, all of the kids were going to come home. No more movie theaters, no more Broadway shows, no more sports, no more NBA, no more NHL. People would said, you're kidding. That is crazy. That is never going to happen. And within just a few days, every one is kind of, I think mostly like, okay. You know, if this is what we have to do, this is what we have to do. And I think that is remarkable."

      "speaker": "HILTON",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do too. And everybody is, you know, elbowing and social distancing and we're going to have to keep it up for a while so, but we're very flexible to all of it. So, thank you, Steve. And we will watch what is happening in the U.K. I know there are some there who think that they have kind of been delayed in their reaction, but it sounds like they are also kind of facing the same things that we are and probably going to take some of the same measures as well. Steve, thanks. Good to see you."

She was going to the supermarket. And as she was walking in, she heard a faint excuse me, excuse me, and there was an elderly couple in a car who been waiting an hour for just the right person to ask if they could go do their shopping. They handed her $100 bill. She went and did their grocery shopping for them. There are wonderful things happening across the country where communities are coming together.
