And she had a lot of not nice things to say about the president.  By the way, President Obama got rid of ambassadors, too. This whole entire charade, none of it is about truth or justice. It is about a never ending three-year smear of this president at all cost because they cannot accept the results in 2016.  And as a consequence -- well, the House Democrats, they have done nothing. Oh, and government fund something set to expire next week, funding for our military set to expire next week. An important trade agreement with Canada and Mexico is yet to be approved. These do nothing Democrats have done nothing for three years, are ignoring really serious issues, let's see, peace and safety and security and prosperity and job creation. Why? Because of this psychotic rage at the mere mention of Donald Trump.  And all ambassadors, she even admitted, they serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States. And President Obama, he fired dozens of ambassador holdovers from the Bush administration. And he did it for political reasons. Nobody criticized him. The president has the right to fire or hire any ambassador for any reason or no reason at all. As a matter of fact, there was good reason to want today's star witness removed from her post. Look at these interviews conducted by John Solomon and the \"New York Times\", a top Ukrainian prosecutor has repeatedly claimed she gave him a do not prosecute list in 2016.   Now, the former ambassador denies the accusation. There was one paper, I believe, in Ukraine that said he rescinded those remarks. We will ask John Solomon about it in a second.  Do I know who is telling the truth? No, I do not. How does any of this apply to impeaching a president duly elected president of the United States? It doesn't. Anyway, joining us now, FOX News contributor, investigative reporter John Solomon. Now, you printed an article this week, there's two issues that I sees a it relates to the ambassador. I knew nothing about until my name and your name came up in the audition hearings. Nobody saw.   And what it comes down to is she didn't like that you reported on the fact that the prosecutor general, and my understanding is correct, that would be the equivalent of our attorney general.",

The witnesses that Adam Schiff has called from the State Department have testified affirmatively, that the U.S. under Yovanovitch applied pressure, multiple time to Ukraine prosecutors to drop prosecutions of people that the U.S. embassy like. These were Ukrainian nationals and Ukrainian prosecution decisions.  And our embassy was applying pressure, interfering in those law enforcement matters. That is no longer in dispute.

The first time I ever heard Maria Yovanovitch's name was March 5th of this year, and that's because she has given a speech earlier that called for the removal of a prosecutor three or four weeks before the end of the very contested Ukraine presidential election. And all of a sudden, I heard from career diplomats, you won't believe what our American diplomat did today, there's going to be a kerfuffle in Ukraine because Geneva Convention says we don't get involve in election stuff and she gave a speech. Two days later, her boss goes to Ukraine, Yovanovitch's boss. The first question, one of the first questions he gets, why did you meddle in our election with those comments? He defended her and said this and her words speak for themself. I'm not going to say anything more about them. This same issue came up in the hearing today because the Democrats want to pretend Ukraine didn't interfere in our election. But the ambassador acknowledged she knew in August 2016, Ukrainian ambassador to the United States wrote an op-ed slamming Donald Trump just before Election Day. So, two good examples of where both countries have a gripe where they believe they saw political interference by ambassadors, despite what the convention says. That's right.",

That means the fundamental constitutional rights in this country are at risk. That is a very dangerous situation. We don't have equal justice, that is now missing in action. We have one set of rules for Democrats and entirely different set of rules for Republicans and the rest of us, we, the people. Because we know just hours ago, look at the conviction, Roger Stone was found guilty of seven process crimes. And he could face decades in prison.  Paul Manafort might spend the rest of his life behind bars because of loan applications and tax issues. The U.S. House of Representatives is now spending every waking moment trying to impeach this president over no identifiable crime, and if you don't have any real witnesses, oh, hearsay witnesses. And, meanwhile, we've got deep state actors. We've got Trump haters, Andrew McCabe, oh, he is enjoying his cushy job over at fake news CNN, and as of yet, he has faced zero charges. And, remember, he was accused of repeatedly lying to the FBI. The office of the inspector general -- well, they found that McCabe showed, quote: a lack of candor with then Director Comey on or around October 31st, 2016. A lack of candor in an interview under oath with agents on May 9th, 2017. Inspector general found a lack of candor in an interview under oath with the office of inspector general investigators on July 28th, 2017. A lack of candor in an interview under oath with the office of the inspector general on November 29th, 2017. Not to be left out, his boss, Mr. Super Patriot, former FBI Director Comey, who took advantage to go after our 33-year veteran, a guy that the FBI agents didn't think was lying, General Flynn -- yes, he was the subject, also, of a scathing office of inspector general report. Criminal charges were actually recommended because Comey leaked confidential material about the president of the United States.   Now, in that case, the inspector general determined, I will quote him: Comey set a dangerous example for all FBI employees. But is Comey, is he facing any charges? Nope. Did Hillary Clinton face charges when she mishandled classified, top secret material on a secret server? No. Did she face any charges for literally taking subpoenaed emails, deleting them, acid washing the hard drive with Bleach Bit, busting up devices with hammer or having an aide do it, removing SIM cards? There's a three-year investigation over the collusion and her dirty Russian dossier. No. No problems whatsoever. Has anybody faced any charges for committing premeditated fraud on a FISA court which we now know happened? Has anyone faced charges for spying on the Trump campaign, his transition team, his presidency? Not a single person. No one in the Obama administration faced any charges for what was rampant, unmasking of Americans during a 2016 election. That hasn't happened either.  What about the Bidens? We've got sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe 30330 bragging about his quid pro quo. By the way, even the Democrats' star witness today had to acknowledge this blatant misconduct. Got to give her credit.

All right, today we saw once again another hearing in the Schiff show as you want to call it, radical Democrats, by the way this impeachment circus we've been showing you. Joining us now with reaction he is a number one best-selling author with his latest book \"Unfreedom of the Press.\" I call them the \"Great One,\" national syndicated radio show \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" its new time 8:00 p.m. every Sunday night the #1 show here on the Fox News Channel and all of cable news. Sir, really the President tweets out a mild tweet basically saying, yes, you know what this didn't work out very well. And look at - this is intimidation - no Mark, look at the law, it's not. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: You know, Sean, this is amazing. I hope the American people know what you're witnessing is tyranny. You can have tyranny of the legislature, you can have tyranny of the executive branch, you can have tyranny of the judiciary. You're witnessing tyranny in the House of Representatives, in the Intelligence Committee that doesn't do intelligence work anymore. This is an outrageous violation of the Constitution. How often is the Constitution read during these hearings? Never, never, and it's never going to be, because they're destroying the Constitution of the United States. They're undermining your franchise they're trying to influence the 2020 election. And by they, I not only mean the Democrats on this committee, I mean the media. To listen to the media analysis of what's taking place in these hearings is absurd, it's disgraceful. They talk about Russia, they sound like the Russian media. The Democrat Party and the media are like this, that's why I wrote the book. They're like this. So the President's never going to get a break from the media, so he tweets. So due process, even though it's not a criminal case, even though it's not a civil case, due process - Western civilization believes in due process. Due process even before the Bill of Rights does not apply to the President, because Congress can do whatever it wants. Is that what the Constitution says? Is that what that says? No that's not what that says. President's not allowed to tweet to defend himself. Well then he can't defend himself, you name one newsroom in this country really that's calling it straight here. None of them, none of them - not picking on anyone, I'm saying none of them. President's tweet today - not a single newsroom that I watched put the tweet up there in full - in full. Here's what the President tweeted America, everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then - and that's pretty much what he said. No it's not, according to Adam Schiff it is. \"Then fast-forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\" This woman is intimidated by this? We're told 33 years in the State Department where they have the most brutal bureaucrats on the face of the earth. She was facing down dictators. She was in somewhat - she was on - oh, my god, this tweet intimidated her. Now how could the tweet intimidate her, as I posted early on and everybody repeat it. She'd didn't even know about the tweet until commissar Adam Schiff read the tweet and he'd even read the full tweet. He read part of the tweet. Now let's talk about what's going on here. Here's an article for the 50th time. POLITICO, January 2017, Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire. Now other news outlets, this is conspiracy theory written in left-wing POLITICO, repeated in left-wing \"New York Times.\" It's not conspiracy theory it's fact. Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. It goes on in incredible detail. This ambassador wasn't all that familiar with it. Did she do anything about it? No. They have this great leader over there that everybody loves in Ukraine was trashing the President on social media, did she call him? No, no, it's - that's OK. But you know the poor thing was smeared by Rudy Giuliani. Let me tell you what a smear is. A smear is when you go after somebody's returns, a smear is when you go after somebody's bank records, a smear is when you go over somebody's children, a smear is when you try and dig up dirt about their past personal lives, a smear is this clown show. I mean it was fractious to hear them, \"oh, I'm sorry poor madam ambassador that you were smeared and that Rudy Giuliani - I'm sorry, while they're smearing the President of United States, while they're undermining these values that we believe in Western civilization and in our United States Constitution. And here's the thing, everybody knows, Trump gave military aid to Ukraine. State Department proposed it, other departments proposed it, he gave it 2017, 2018. 2019 he says we have a new government let me take a look. You're not allowed to do that Mr. President. Meanwhile, Obama without military aid from the Ukrainians when they really needed it. Russia invaded Ukraine on his watch and did he give them the military stuff they needed? No. Who do you think the Ukrainians like better? Is the American President Donald Trump or Barack Obama? I could tell you I'm sure it's Donald Trump. Who do you think the Russians liked better as President Barack Obama - you know, we'll work this out after the election or Donald Trump who has put the harshest, most severe penalties on Putin and his people in modern American history. Who do you think Putin wants as President of United States? Let me tell you something. This committee is a rogue, tyrannical committee with a rogue, tyrannical Chairman. Whatever the Constitution requires, he does the opposite. Whatever justice and fairness requires, he does the opposite. He's literally withholding transcripts from witnesses who've already testified in their below-ground skiff, because he doesn't want those witnesses who've testified differently than the show horse witnesses you've seen to be questioned. He doesn't want their narrative to be challenged. He doesn't want his one his narrative to be challenged. So the - and I hear the media. If the President would just stop tweeting we can fix this. Let me tell you something about the American media - it sucks. There's nothing free about it. It is part and parcel of the left of the Democrat Party. And these legal analysts who know nothing about the Constitution and the rule of law and American history, let alone Western history, they are pathetic and the American people are being horribly disturbed. And I would tell the American people that there's only one way to fix this, on Election Day - only one way to fix this on Election Day. And by the way, at least they admitted today that the President of the United States - he's the one who gets to set foreign policy. It is the State Department that is resisting this President that is the irregular channel. And if they want to attack Rudy Giuliani then have a different hearing about Rudy Giuliani and we'll get all the facts out on that. But the President of the United States, A, did nothing wrong. B, did not bribe. C, did not extort. D, no quid pro quo. E, gave them their money. F, that's the end of it.",

And she had a lot of not nice things to say about the president. By the way, President Obama got rid of ambassadors, too. This whole entire charade, none of it is about truth or justice. It is about a never ending three-year smear of this president at all cost because they cannot accept the results in 2016. And as a consequence -- well, the House Democrats, they have done nothing. Oh, and government fund something set to expire next week, funding for our military set to expire next week. An important trade agreement with Canada and Mexico is yet to be approved. These do nothing Democrats have done nothing for three years, are ignoring really serious issues, let's see, peace and safety and security and prosperity and job creation. Why? Because of this psychotic rage at the mere mention of Donald Trump. And all ambassadors, she even admitted, they serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States. And President Obama, he fired dozens of ambassador holdovers from the Bush administration. And he did it for political reasons. Nobody criticized him. The president has the right to fire or hire any ambassador for any reason or no reason at all. As a matter of fact, there was good reason to want today's star witness removed from her post. Look at these interviews conducted by John Solomon and the \"New York Times\", a top Ukrainian prosecutor has repeatedly claimed she gave him a do not prosecute list in 2016. Now, the former ambassador denies the accusation. There was one paper, I believe, in Ukraine that said he rescinded those remarks. We will ask John Solomon about it in a second. Do I know who is telling the truth? No, I do not. How does any of this apply to impeaching a president duly elected president of the United States? It doesn't. Anyway, joining us now, FOX News contributor, investigative reporter John Solomon. Now, you printed an article this week, there's two issues that I sees a it relates to the ambassador. I knew nothing about until my name and your name came up in the audition hearings. Nobody saw. And what it comes down to is she didn't like that you reported on the fact that the prosecutor general, and my understanding is correct, that would be the equivalent of our attorney general."

The witnesses that Adam Schiff has called from the State Department have testified affirmatively, that the U.S. under Yovanovitch applied pressure, multiple time to Ukraine prosecutors to drop prosecutions of people that the U.S. embassy like. These were Ukrainian nationals and Ukrainian prosecution decisions. And our embassy was applying pressure, interfering in those law enforcement matters. That is no longer in dispute.

The first time I ever heard Maria Yovanovitch's name was March 5th of this year, and that's because she has given a speech earlier that called for the removal of a prosecutor three or four weeks before the end of the very contested Ukraine presidential election. And all of a sudden, I heard from career diplomats, you won't believe what our American diplomat did today, there's going to be a kerfuffle in Ukraine because Geneva Convention says we don't get involve in election stuff and she gave a speech. Two days later, her boss goes to Ukraine, Yovanovitch's boss. The first question, one of the first questions he gets, why did you meddle in our election with those comments? He defended her and said this and her words speak for themself. I'm not going to say anything more about them. This same issue came up in the hearing today because the Democrats want to pretend Ukraine didn't interfere in our election. But the ambassador acknowledged she knew in August 2016, Ukrainian ambassador to the United States wrote an op-ed slamming Donald Trump just before Election Day. So, two good examples of where both countries have a gripe where they believe they saw political interference by ambassadors, despite what the convention says. That's right."

There's a three-year investigation over the collusion and her dirty Russian dossier. No. No problems whatsoever. Has anybody faced any charges for committing premeditated fraud on a FISA court which we now know happened? Has anyone faced charges for spying on the Trump campaign, his transition team, his presidency? Not a single person. No one in the Obama administration faced any charges for what was rampant, unmasking of Americans during a 2016 election. That hasn't happened either. What about the Bidens?

But here we go again and, yet, did have to admit that about Hunter and Joe. JENNA ELLIS, SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Yes. And, you know, Sean, the president said it so well today in his tweet when he said this is a double standard like the country has never seen, talking about Roger Stone but then, also, when he fairly commented on what was going on in the hearing. I mean, this is the president who doesn't have his legal counsel able to be present. He is not getting due process, he simply is fairly commenting. And yet, the Democrats try to attack that. This is absolutely ridiculous and incredulous. This is a fight for our country, for our Constitution. This is an attack like the country has never seen.

Well, we are going to have full fairness at the discretion of the compromised, congenital liar Schiff. We're going to allow witnesses at the request of the Schiff.

Today, Chris Stewart asked Yovanovitch, did you see any crimes? Did you see any bribery? She said no. We had John Ratcliffe two days ago asking the two Democrat star witnesses on day one.

I know you are going to say, look, the president has a First Amendment right and he is not necessarily getting a fair shake. He doesn't have a defense witness there at the table. So he certainly has a right to speak out on Twitter. But you have someone like Ken Starr, the former independent counsel saying today on fox this was injurious to the president's case and poor judgment to get involved like that and sort of play into the Democrats' hands, that is where I think you and I have an issue, Sean."

But the president was having a relatively good day. Congressman Scalise, the leader, is right that, in fact, Yovanovitch testified not only that the president, this president, President Trump helped Ukraine more than President Obama, also she testified something else, Sean, that he has the right as president to fire her, which is an important point. So the Democrats did not advance their impeachment cause but the president might have injured himself a bit."

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome back to Hannity. All right, today we saw once again another hearing in the Schiff show as you want to call it, radical Democrats, by the way this impeachment circus we've been showing you. Joining us now with reaction he is a number one best-selling author with his latest book \"Unfreedom of the Press.\" I call them the \"Great One,\" national syndicated radio show \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" its new time 8:00 p.m. every Sunday night the #1 show here on the Fox News Channel and all of cable news. Sir, really the President tweets out a mild tweet basically saying, yes, you know what this didn't work out very well. And look at - this is intimidation - no Mark, look at the law, it's not. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: You know, Sean, this is amazing. I hope the American people know what you're witnessing is tyranny. You can have tyranny of the legislature, you can have tyranny of the executive branch, you can have tyranny of the judiciary. You're witnessing tyranny in the House of Representatives, in the Intelligence Committee that doesn't do intelligence work anymore. This is an outrageous violation of the Constitution. How often is the Constitution read during these hearings? Never, never, and it's never going to be, because they're destroying the Constitution of the United States. They're undermining your franchise they're trying to influence the 2020 election. And by they, I not only mean the Democrats on this committee, I mean the media. To listen to the media analysis of what's taking place in these hearings is absurd, it's disgraceful. They talk about Russia, they sound like the Russian media. The Democrat Party and the media are like this, that's why I wrote the book. They're like this. So the President's never going to get a break from the media, so he tweets. So due process, even though it's not a criminal case, even though it's not a civil case, due process - Western civilization believes in due process. Due process even before the Bill of Rights does not apply to the President, because Congress can do whatever it wants. Is that what the Constitution says? Is that what that says? No that's not what that says. President's not allowed to tweet to defend himself. Well then he can't defend himself, you name one newsroom in this country really that's calling it straight here. None of them, none of them - not picking on anyone, I'm saying none of them. President's tweet today - not a single newsroom that I watched put the tweet up there in full - in full. Here's what the President tweeted America, everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then - and that's pretty much what he said. No it's not, according to Adam Schiff it is. \"Then fast-forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\" This woman is intimidated by this? We're told 33 years in the State Department where they have the most brutal bureaucrats on the face of the earth. She was facing down dictators. She was in somewhat - she was on - oh, my god, this tweet intimidated her. Now how could the tweet intimidate her, as I posted early on and everybody repeat it. She'd didn't even know about the tweet until commissar Adam Schiff read the tweet and he'd even read the full tweet. He read part of the tweet. Now let's talk about what's going on here. Here's an article for the 50th time. POLITICO, January 2017, Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire. Now other news outlets, this is conspiracy theory written in left-wing POLITICO, repeated in left-wing \"New York Times.\" It's not conspiracy theory it's fact. Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. It goes on in incredible detail. This ambassador wasn't all that familiar with it. Did she do anything about it? No. They have this great leader over there that everybody loves in Ukraine was trashing the President on social media, did she call him? No, no, it's - that's OK. But you know the poor thing was smeared by Rudy Giuliani. Let me tell you what a smear is. A smear is when you go after somebody's returns, a smear is when you go after somebody's bank records, a smear is when you go over somebody's children, a smear is when you try and dig up dirt about their past personal lives, a smear is this clown show. I mean it was fractious to hear them, \"oh, I'm sorry poor madam ambassador that you were smeared and that Rudy Giuliani - I'm sorry, while they're smearing the President of United States, while they're undermining these values that we believe in Western civilization and in our United States Constitution. And here's the thing, everybody knows, Trump gave military aid to Ukraine. State Department proposed it, other departments proposed it, he gave it 2017, 2018. 2019 he says we have a new government let me take a look. You're not allowed to do that Mr. President. Meanwhile, Obama without military aid from the Ukrainians when they really needed it. Russia invaded Ukraine on his watch and did he give them the military stuff they needed? No. Who do you think the Ukrainians like better? Is the American President Donald Trump or Barack Obama? I could tell you I'm sure it's Donald Trump. Who do you think the Russians liked better as President Barack Obama - you know, we'll work this out after the election or Donald Trump who has put the harshest, most severe penalties on Putin and his people in modern American history. Who do you think Putin wants as President of United States? Let me tell you something. This committee is a rogue, tyrannical committee with a rogue, tyrannical Chairman. Whatever the Constitution requires, he does the opposite. Whatever justice and fairness requires, he does the opposite. He's literally withholding transcripts from witnesses who've already testified in their below-ground skiff, because he doesn't want those witnesses who've testified differently than the show horse witnesses you've seen to be questioned. He doesn't want their narrative to be challenged. He doesn't want his one his narrative to be challenged. So the - and I hear the media. If the President would just stop tweeting we can fix this. Let me tell you something about the American media - it sucks. There's nothing free about it. It is part and parcel of the left of the Democrat Party. And these legal analysts who know nothing about the Constitution and the rule of law and American history, let alone Western history, they are pathetic and the American people are being horribly disturbed. And I would tell the American people that there's only one way to fix this, on Election Day - only one way to fix this on Election Day. And by the way, at least they admitted today that the President of the United States - he's the one who gets to set foreign policy. It is the State Department that is resisting this President that is the irregular channel. And if they want to attack Rudy Giuliani then have a different hearing about Rudy Giuliani and we'll get all the facts out on that. But the President of the United States, A, did nothing wrong. B, did not bribe. C, did not extort. D, no quid pro quo. E, gave them their money. F, that's the end of it."

Ken let me go to you, because I know you've made some news with your comments earlier today. And you're also saying that there's nothing impeachable for the President. I'm going to read you to you the President's tweets, and I want you to tell this audience exactly what was so horrible. They call it serving at the pleasure of the President. The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than preceding administrations. It is called quite simply America First. With all of that, however, I have done far more for Ukraine than Obama, which by the way, even the former ambassador admitted. And when you look at the second one, \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia. How did that go?

If you testify, I'm going to hammer you. I think that is - it's not a crime, it's not impeachable, I think it's unwise.

He could have talked about what the prosecutor general said about her and whether it's disputed or not, that's in dispute still. John Solomon says the prosecutor general stands by that she handed him a list of names, but I don't know what the truth is. The President could have gone after a lot of other stuff.

It probably would have been a whole lot simpler if Trump had just shut up and just not gotten involved. But that's not who President Trump is. Of course, he's going to get involved. He always defends himself. And of course, if this offends Adam Schiff so much, and he doesn't want President Trump getting on Twitter to defend himself. Of course Adam Schiff could have allowed the President - I don't know to have an attorney there cross- examining and defending Trump for him. But that's what is not permitted. But the real thing here that I think is so - it reveals how unfair this whole process is, is the fact that yet, again it's like the obstruction of justice charge. When the underlying charge, the underlying accusations against the President they always fall apart, they always become ridiculous. They have to go to these second tier accusations like obstruction of justice or intimidation of witness - intimidating a witness who has nothing impeachable to say."
