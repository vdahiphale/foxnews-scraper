      "sentences": "All right, Bill, thank you very, very much. We're following developments very, very closely in Lansing, Michigan, to the left of your screen. We will be hearing from the Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, right now. Her even tougher stay-at-home policies now have invited this wrath that Grady Trimble just talked to Bill Hemmer about, where there's a traffic jam of people saying, we understand stay at home, but this is beyond crazy.  The governor taking a number of stringent measures to demand that residents quit moving between homes, quit crossing the street to go to other friends. Don't use motorboats, use a canoe. It got to be so surreal for these people that, whether you're on the left or the right, a lot of people felt the governor overextended herself.  Let's listen to how she's responding to this criticism right now, Governor Whitmer now talking to her state.",

      "sentences": "And they're on the front lines every single day helping us get through this crisis.  Every time I speak to them, I feel the impact this virus has had on them and their families. A staff member of mine has a family member who is a nurse. And at the end of his long shifts, he will often stay in the garage and cry before going into the house. Another friend of mine has multiple sclerosis and a compromised immune system. She has been in her apartment for five weeks. We have all missed birthdays and celebrations, whether they were weddings or holidays, with our family and friends. Incredible sacrifice has been made by the people of Michigan.  And it's really paying off. These are hard times, but we are getting to get through this together. I know that there are many who are struggling with their mental health right now. People are lonely and isolated and frustrated and would give anything to return back to normal.   And I have to tell you, I would too. We're going to get there. It's going to take some time. It won't all happen overnight, but we will get there, if we are smart, we do what we need to do and everyone plays their part. We have to mitigate risk. And so while we will be reunited with our friends and loved ones again, it's important that we continue to double down on our efforts today. For those of you who held your Easter brunch or your Passover, your Seder dinner over Zoom, instead of being in person, thank you for doing your part.   For every teacher who's instructing your students online, thank you for doing your part. For every grocery store clerk who is working incredibly long hours, so that special hours can be available for our older Michiganders, thank you for going above and beyond and doing your part. And for every health care provider who's putting their own lines -- their own lives on the line to save others, thank you for doing your part. This is a hard time, but the good news is that the vast majority of people in our state are doing the right thing. And it's pushing the curve down. It's working, saving lives.  Yesterday, I went to Novi to inspect Suburban Showplace alternate care site. I want to thank the owners of Suburban. I want to thank Ascension Health System. I want to thank the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Army Corps, the National Guard, the Department of Health and Human Services and FEMA.   Something remarkable happened while we were there. And the head of Region 5, our person that we work with so often from FEMA, acknowledged that the build-out of Suburban Showplace, which was originally slated to be a 1,000- bed facility, is now a 250-bed facility. We will have the capacity to increase that if it's necessary. But because of this stay-home order, it might not be, and so we're only building it out for 250 at this time.  He also showed me his phone, a text from someone in another state asking how they can replicate what is happening here in Michigan. People are taking notice. We're working incredibly hard and well with our partners at the federal level. So today's update with regard to the number of positive cases that have been reported is 28,095. In those numbers are also 1,921 deaths.  We must continue to stay home whenever we can, so we can protect our families.  Yesterday, the president met with a number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. One of them was a man from Northern Michigan, Mark Campbell, who was telling the president how he believes he caught the virus. He was explaining that he and his family decided to go up north and go skiing, which seemed like a safe activity, because very few people were traveling or going north, and no one was around. He told the president -- quote -- \"The only thing I can think of that was out of the ordinary is that I touched a gasoline pump handle.\"  I share that story because what we know is that COVID-19 can live on a stainless steel surface for 72 hours. Think about how many people touch a gas pump handle in the span of three days. And that's why we don't want anyone on the road who doesn't have to be there.   A couple of weeks ago -- I'm going to give you an update on PPE now. A couple of weeks ago, we had less than a day's worth of PPE in Southeast Michigan hospitals. We were working day to day. Since then, Michiganders and businesses have stepped up to donate...",

She is outlining the continuation of pretty stringent stay-at-home plans that she really locked down yesterday, no play on words there, to make them even tougher for residents in the state now, who cannot journey between homes, if they have vacation homes or what have you, in the state, also can't use motorboats.  You can't buy plants or garden supplies at stores. You cannot go crossing the street and see the neighbors or friends in the middle of the day without some oversight here.  But it's the kind of stuff that has sent alarming protests across the state, saying, she went too far. They understand distancing rules and sheltering provisions, but she has gone way, way, way too far. We're monitoring whether she is going to lift or ease up on some of that, given the outcry she's gotten from residents in her state.   But this next guest is leading the effort to say, dial it back, dial it way back. Meshawn Maddock is the Michigan Conservative Coalition, co-founder, Operation Gridlock organizer.

I mean, her last press conference -- last press conference two days ago, I heard responses from people saying that it feels -- I felt like she was mocking the Michigan workers and mocking the Michiganders for things that they have had taken from them.  I mean, right now in Michigan bureaucrats have shut down our industry. And today was a perfect example of people in Michigan rising up and trying to put a voice. And the only way we could put a voice was by putting people safely in their cars and driving to the capitol.

We had over 10,000 vehicles, the Michigan Police Department let us know. Michigan State Police reported 10,000 vehicles. I was there locked in traffic every single road trying to get into Lansing, cars, trucks.   Half of them were workers' vehicles with their small businesses and workers representing their businesses. Those people never left their vehicles. There was a small group of people with some other counterprotests, somewhere around 200. Those are the numbers from the Michigan State Police that were gathered on the lawn.  We yelled at them to get back in their cars. I had to step out to do a few interviews. And I gently yelled at all of them, please get back in your cars. But we don't really have any control over that. They're exercising their First Amendment right. And I hope they knew what they were doing. It was very cold outside, so they weren't out there for as long. I can tell you, almost all of the people got into their cars with the people that they have been sheltering with, packed a snack, drove to Lansing to show their protest. The most fun that they had within the last 48 hours making signs. I can't even tell you what some of these signs were. And it -- I have to admit, it felt a little fun for a few minutes, because it's been so depressing. Michigan has been just under tyranny.   We had to lay off seven employees of our own. But I got emotional, Neil. When I walked through the line, getting back to my vehicle, I went Facebook Live. And when you look into these cars, and you see a bookstore, you see a coffee shop owner, a small insurance agency owner, a paint store owner, landscapers, bricklayers, I mean, I could go on and on. These are real people with real families and bills to pay. They have mortgages to pay. So they got to go to Lansing and kind of have a little parade.",

The motorboat thing vs. the canoe thing, motorboats bad, canoes OK, it just seems like much more of a strict measure than was already in place.

The day after she got out in Michigan and mocked us by taking away many of our liberties and hobbies and jobs, and putting workers out of work, she had some T-shirt company make a T-shirt with the name that the president gave her, and she went on late-night television.  I mean, you tell me how that feels to the workers in Michigan and the people struggling to make ends meet, not to mention the fact that our unemployment system in Michigan is completely archaic and can't service the unemployment.  My husband is the state representative. All he is doing is feeling -- fielding phone calls of people trying to get their unemployment checks, and that system is gone.

We have not heard anything back.  But, again, nerves are frayed on both ends, as these lockdown measures continue, not only in states like Michigan, but across the country, but particularly frayed nerves in Michigan right now, where many are saying the governor might have overdone it. But if this telegraphs any unwinding of those provisions by the end of the month, when a lot of states might be considering doing just that, it doesn't look like it's the case in Michigan. Having said that, and when we come back, a number of states are toying with the idea of gradually -- and they mean gradually -- and in staggering fashion, getting back to something approaching business, not as usual, but business that right now would be very unusual, if they get back to anything approaching it.  This on the same day we have heard that Germany will get back to business as usual, lifting lockdown provisions or kind of lockdown provisions that have been in effect now for the better part of three weeks come next week. Schools will be back in service on May 3 as well in Germany, but that's Germany. So far, that is not the United States. We're on top of it all. Stay with us. You're watching \"Your World.\"",

She was an important part of negotiating that, which is why it's the first chapter of the 880-page bill. And it's also why it's running out of money so quickly. So, we know that it works.

There's no need to be concerned about the safety. I'm sure you're aware that the virus doesn't transmit through meat. But as we see the supply chain having difficulties in agriculture, it does raise questions of supply and availability. There is no shortage of animals. There's no shortage of meat, but we do have a disruption in the supply chain, as we see workers either get sick or stay home for their own well-being.

Some of the ralliers that we had been talking to, including one earlier leading this charge, in the show said they will not give up until she eases them. It doesn't look, for the time being, like the governor will. We will stay on top of it, as a number of states are looking at easing up on their own restrictions that have been in place now for the better part of three to four, in some cases six weeks in some states, like, for example, Ohio. Then there's the issue of, what would make states do that? What would make the federal government be more inclined to consider that, working with the states? You hear a lot about an improvement in the number of cases, new or otherwise, going down for 14 straight days. You have also heard a lot more about testing. We would need a lot more testing, so that we can know a lot more what we're dealing with here. I want to explore that with Scott Whitaker, the AdvaMed president and CEO and the former chief of staff over at the Department of Health and Human Services. Sir, very good to have you. Where are we on COVID-19 testing? I know there are a variety of such tests available, including one that will look at antibodies, which could indicate whether you even ever had this yourself. But update me.  SCOTT WHITAKER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ADVAMED: Yes, we're scaling up dramatically. March 12 was the first test that was approved by the FDA. So, at that point, very few tests were being conducted at the time. Today, there are about 20 tests on the market. We're scaling up to the point where we will have about 28 million tests available by the end of April. So it's tremendous progress. But, Neil, that's just on the front end of diagnosing the disease. On the back end of determining how much immunity you have, those tests are in the process right now. We will see more of those in the coming weeks as well, as we work through the process with FDA.  CAVUTO: You know, Scott, I know there are a variety of different tests. The idea is to get a good, strong sampling to know exactly what we're dealing with here. I know that we had started a little slow in this country, where one out of about 300,000 to 400,000 Americans were being tested. It's dramatically shrunk to, I'm told now, under one -- under -- 100,0000.",

So that's one thing that we need, for sure. I think continuing the work that we're doing on treating the disease, and also protecting health care workers is critically important as well, and then informing the public that it's not just diagnostic testing alone that gets people back to work, but it's diagnostic testing, along with the CDC rules that they have put on to continue the social distancing, to make sure that we're phasing our way back into the workplace in an appropriate way.",

      "utterance": "All right, Bill, thank you very, very much. We're following developments very, very closely in Lansing, Michigan, to the left of your screen. We will be hearing from the Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, right now. Her even tougher stay-at-home policies now have invited this wrath that Grady Trimble just talked to Bill Hemmer about, where there's a traffic jam of people saying, we understand stay at home, but this is beyond crazy. The governor taking a number of stringent measures to demand that residents quit moving between homes, quit crossing the street to go to other friends. Don't use motorboats, use a canoe. It got to be so surreal for these people that, whether you're on the left or the right, a lot of people felt the governor overextended herself. Let's listen to how she's responding to this criticism right now, Governor Whitmer now talking to her state."

      "utterance": "And they're on the front lines every single day helping us get through this crisis. Every time I speak to them, I feel the impact this virus has had on them and their families. A staff member of mine has a family member who is a nurse. And at the end of his long shifts, he will often stay in the garage and cry before going into the house. Another friend of mine has multiple sclerosis and a compromised immune system. She has been in her apartment for five weeks. We have all missed birthdays and celebrations, whether they were weddings or holidays, with our family and friends. Incredible sacrifice has been made by the people of Michigan. And it's really paying off. These are hard times, but we are getting to get through this together. I know that there are many who are struggling with their mental health right now. People are lonely and isolated and frustrated and would give anything to return back to normal. And I have to tell you, I would too. We're going to get there. It's going to take some time. It won't all happen overnight, but we will get there, if we are smart, we do what we need to do and everyone plays their part. We have to mitigate risk. And so while we will be reunited with our friends and loved ones again, it's important that we continue to double down on our efforts today. For those of you who held your Easter brunch or your Passover, your Seder dinner over Zoom, instead of being in person, thank you for doing your part. For every teacher who's instructing your students online, thank you for doing your part. For every grocery store clerk who is working incredibly long hours, so that special hours can be available for our older Michiganders, thank you for going above and beyond and doing your part. And for every health care provider who's putting their own lines -- their own lives on the line to save others, thank you for doing your part. This is a hard time, but the good news is that the vast majority of people in our state are doing the right thing. And it's pushing the curve down. It's working, saving lives. Yesterday, I went to Novi to inspect Suburban Showplace alternate care site. I want to thank the owners of Suburban. I want to thank Ascension Health System. I want to thank the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Army Corps, the National Guard, the Department of Health and Human Services and FEMA. Something remarkable happened while we were there. And the head of Region 5, our person that we work with so often from FEMA, acknowledged that the build-out of Suburban Showplace, which was originally slated to be a 1,000- bed facility, is now a 250-bed facility. We will have the capacity to increase that if it's necessary. But because of this stay-home order, it might not be, and so we're only building it out for 250 at this time. He also showed me his phone, a text from someone in another state asking how they can replicate what is happening here in Michigan. People are taking notice. We're working incredibly hard and well with our partners at the federal level. So today's update with regard to the number of positive cases that have been reported is 28,095. In those numbers are also 1,921 deaths. We must continue to stay home whenever we can, so we can protect our families. Yesterday, the president met with a number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. One of them was a man from Northern Michigan, Mark Campbell, who was telling the president how he believes he caught the virus. He was explaining that he and his family decided to go up north and go skiing, which seemed like a safe activity, because very few people were traveling or going north, and no one was around. He told the president -- quote -- \"The only thing I can think of that was out of the ordinary is that I touched a gasoline pump handle.\" I share that story because what we know is that COVID-19 can live on a stainless steel surface for 72 hours. Think about how many people touch a gas pump handle in the span of three days. And that's why we don't want anyone on the road who doesn't have to be there. A couple of weeks ago -- I'm going to give you an update on PPE now. A couple of weeks ago, we had less than a day's worth of PPE in Southeast Michigan hospitals. We were working day to day. Since then, Michiganders and businesses have stepped up to donate..."

      "utterance": "All right, we are monitoring very, very closely Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She is outlining the continuation of pretty stringent stay-at-home plans that she really locked down yesterday, no play on words there, to make them even tougher for residents in the state now, who cannot journey between homes, if they have vacation homes or what have you, in the state, also can't use motorboats. You can't buy plants or garden supplies at stores. You cannot go crossing the street and see the neighbors or friends in the middle of the day without some oversight here. But it's the kind of stuff that has sent alarming protests across the state, saying, she went too far. They understand distancing rules and sheltering provisions, but she has gone way, way, way too far. We're monitoring whether she is going to lift or ease up on some of that, given the outcry she's gotten from residents in her state. But this next guest is leading the effort to say, dial it back, dial it way back. Meshawn Maddock is the Michigan Conservative Coalition, co-founder, Operation Gridlock organizer.

That is probably the most -- that is the nicest tone that she has had so far. She's been downright mocking. I mean, her last press conference -- last press conference two days ago, I heard responses from people saying that it feels -- I felt like she was mocking the Michigan workers and mocking the Michiganders for things that they have had taken from them. I mean, right now in Michigan bureaucrats have shut down our industry. And today was a perfect example of people in Michigan rising up and trying to put a voice. And the only way we could put a voice was by putting people safely in their cars and driving to the capitol. And I hope to God that she heard that message loud and clear, because it's time to get workers back to work in Michigan safely."

But the fact of the matter is, a lot of those protesters, by converging on Lansing, and where else it's going on, violated distancing policies already in place, and might have endangered their health and other people's health. Your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "MADDOCK",
      "utterance": "You know what? That's kind of a spin. We have heard it. I was there. I was there from 9:00 in the morning on. We had over 10,000 vehicles, the Michigan Police Department let us know. Michigan State Police reported 10,000 vehicles. I was there locked in traffic every single road trying to get into Lansing, cars, trucks. Half of them were workers' vehicles with their small businesses and workers representing their businesses. Those people never left their vehicles. There was a small group of people with some other counterprotests, somewhere around 200. Those are the numbers from the Michigan State Police that were gathered on the lawn. We yelled at them to get back in their cars. I had to step out to do a few interviews. And I gently yelled at all of them, please get back in your cars. But we don't really have any control over that. They're exercising their First Amendment right. And I hope they knew what they were doing. It was very cold outside, so they weren't out there for as long. I can tell you, almost all of the people got into their cars with the people that they have been sheltering with, packed a snack, drove to Lansing to show their protest. The most fun that they had within the last 48 hours making signs. I can't even tell you what some of these signs were. And it -- I have to admit, it felt a little fun for a few minutes, because it's been so depressing. Michigan has been just under tyranny. We had to lay off seven employees of our own. But I got emotional, Neil. When I walked through the line, getting back to my vehicle, I went Facebook Live. And when you look into these cars, and you see a bookstore, you see a coffee shop owner, a small insurance agency owner, a paint store owner, landscapers, bricklayers, I mean, I could go on and on. These are real people with real families and bills to pay. They have mortgages to pay. So they got to go to Lansing and kind of have a little parade."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, Meshawn, you did mention -- you did mention the paint makers and paint stores and garden supplies. Do you know the good governor excluded purchases of those items to tighten this -- these stay-at-home provisions? I mean, she's the first governor to do anything quite like that. The motorboat thing vs. the canoe thing, motorboats bad, canoes OK, it just seems like much more of a strict measure than was already in place. The governor has said it's to address the fact that Michigan has suddenly shot up to the state with the third highest number of cases and now accelerating that way in deaths. But it does raise questions as to why these particular measures."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADDOCK",
      "utterance": "It doesn't make any sense. Your guess is as good as ours. That's really why this came about. The only thing that I can tell you is, it feels like shameless self-promotion. I mean, how much attention has she gotten from this? How much attention does she continue to draw? The day after she got out in Michigan and mocked us by taking away many of our liberties and hobbies and jobs, and putting workers out of work, she had some T-shirt company make a T-shirt with the name that the president gave her, and she went on late-night television. I mean, you tell me how that feels to the workers in Michigan and the people struggling to make ends meet, not to mention the fact that our unemployment system in Michigan is completely archaic and can't service the unemployment. My husband is the state representative. All he is doing is feeling -- fielding phone calls of people trying to get their unemployment checks, and that system is gone. So, we have no answer for why she's doing what she's doing."

Following this very, very closely, Meshawn Maddock leading this campaign against what the governor is trying to do. We did put out a call to Governor Whitmer to talk to us about this. We have not heard anything back. But, again, nerves are frayed on both ends, as these lockdown measures continue, not only in states like Michigan, but across the country, but particularly frayed nerves in Michigan right now, where many are saying the governor might have overdone it. But if this telegraphs any unwinding of those provisions by the end of the month, when a lot of states might be considering doing just that, it doesn't look like it's the case in Michigan. Having said that, and when we come back, a number of states are toying with the idea of gradually -- and they mean gradually -- and in staggering fashion, getting back to something approaching business, not as usual, but business that right now would be very unusual, if they get back to anything approaching it. This on the same day we have heard that Germany will get back to business as usual, lifting lockdown provisions or kind of lockdown provisions that have been in effect now for the better part of three weeks come next week. Schools will be back in service on May 3 as well in Germany, but that's Germany. So far, that is not the United States. We're on top of it all. Stay with us. You're watching \"Your World.\""

He and the vice president is part of this new council that's going to advise the president on when exactly, how to reopen America, essentially. He was getting some thoughts from Jeff Bezos, from Mark Zuckerberg, and a host of others. In fact, when I was looking at some of the names here, from Steve Forbes, to Tim Cook, Condoleezza Rice, Jamie Dimon, it's a who's-who in the business, technology, political worlds. But, again, the boldfaced names Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos of Amazon certainly stand out. It doesn't end here, by the way.

But another problem cropping up as well, sources telling FOX News that the fund, that $350 billion for the Small Business association paycheck protection loans, they thought that they were going to hit the cap today.

The risk isn't worth it, because we know these patients do much worse when they get the COVID virus.

I guess they didn't know it was going to be this awful. But all was said and done, a sell-off that looked severe was actually much better than it had been. We will spell it all out -- after this. There's a $250 billion measure in the works to add to that, but it's kind of in limbo here. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the Democratic senator, joining us right now. Senator, you were not a fan, I believe, of the last stimulus package in the aggregate, the $2.2-$2.3 trillion one.

I was, along with Senators Rubio, Cardin, and Collins, one of the four people who negotiated that Paycheck Protection Program and worked very hard to see that it got into the CARES relief package. I do think we need more money. As you pointed out, we have already approved -- the SBA has already approved 1.1 million loans, over that, probably -- that was last night -- to the tune of about $280 billion. So, there's been a huge demand. We have seen a lot of our businesses in New Hampshire who have been approved for loans. We need to see that money flowing. And we need to address some of the challenges that have come up with the program. This has been a huge effort. It's bigger than anything the SBA has ever tried to do. So, it's understandable that there would be some glitches. We need to fix those for the next round. We need to make sure that loans are going to the mom-and-pop shops, the small retail stores that are so important to New Hampshire's rural communities, and make sure that they can get in the queue and get approved."

But it's -- the devil is going to be in the details of getting this $250 billion through, if Congress can't quickly come together and meet. You can't do it virtually, right?"

And one of the things that's happening, of course, is, you find Secretary Mnuchin, who was integral in negotiating this entire CARES package, especially this portion of the Paycheck Protection Program and the other economic parts of it. But one thing we know for sure is that the $350 billion for paycheck protection isn't enough. It's a wildly popular program. Senator Shaheen is exactly right. She was an important part of negotiating that, which is why it's the first chapter of the 880-page bill. And it's also why it's running out of money so quickly. So, we know that it works. We know it's in high demand. And I think we ought to put another $250 billion in it immediately, which we can do with a simple voice vote.

Now, I'd love to see some changes. I shared Jeanne's concern for the mom- and-pops, as she called them, sole proprietorships, self-employed. It took an extra week to get the rules written for that particular part of the business community, which means that they lost out on the first week of the loans going out. But -- but that's been corrected now. The rules are in place. Another $250 billion that is -- that is without bias, I think, would be the best way for our community banks to distribute this money.

Is the delay in opening that plant up, to say nothing of others, could that be a problem, certainly for shoppers who might be looking around and wondering where their pork is, where their beef is, where a lot of stuff is? Brian Duncan is the Illinois Farm Bureau vice president. And he joins us right now. Brian, how big an issue -- it started with this Smithfield plant, I guess. But it raised concerns about our meat supply, period. How does it stand in your eyes?  BRIAN DUNCAN, VICE PRESIDENT, ILLINOIS FARM BUREAU: Well, first of all, Neil, welcome back to the farm. Great to have you back with us again. And I think it's obvious that some people would have some concerns about the availability of meat, seeing and reading about the plant closings. There's no need to be concerned about the safety. I'm sure you're aware that the virus doesn't transmit through meat. But as we see the supply chain having difficulties in agriculture, it does raise questions of supply and availability. There is no shortage of animals. There's no shortage of meat, but we do have a disruption in the supply chain, as we see workers either get sick or stay home for their own well-being. And we're certainly grateful for those that are working and keeping the food moving. So it's a disruption.

Reassure them, if -- what you're saying, I have no doubt that you're accurate, but allay them of concerns that go beyond just the availability of meat or whether they can find it or whether the price goes up. What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "DUNCAN",
      "utterance": "Sure. The science is absolute on this, Neil. COVID doesn't transmit through me. So that science is unmistakable and absolute. And so consumers can rest assured that, when they buy that piece of meat at the grocery store and take it home to cook it, not only is it delicious and nutritious, Neil, but it's safe."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Brian, when you look at where the country stands now -- and it's directly affected you. When American business stops, I mean, you guys still have a job to do. You're urgently in demand, vital personnel. But I'm sure you want America to get back to work. I'm sure you want people back out of their homes, living their lives, or close to it. So, when you hear this talk of looking at ways states and the president can coordinate opening up for business, what do you want to see?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNCAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you raise a great point, Neil. What I want to see is a comprehensive plan that would allow parts of the country to open back up. Now, here in rural Illinois, the virus has -- there has been some cases, but it has been minor. And I am very much aware that there are parts of the country that have endured tremendous suffering for this -- through this crisis. And, obviously, those places need some time to get back on their feet. But I think a strategy that could be spoken with some definitive timelines and some definitive measurables on when we could get things opened back up, get the retail sector back moving, the food service sector back moving, could provide some certainty for agriculture in these very difficult times on how to get the demand engine would get started again, at least in the food service and hospitality sector, would be very welcome."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Brian, when I had the pleasure of talking to you throughout the China trade imbroglios, and then -- and the crisis, and the issue was the Chinese making good on the commitments they ultimately made. And now there's this dust-up we have with the World Health Organization and whether it was working in cahoots with China. We can get into the weeds on that one. I prefer not do. I just wonder whether it's going to impact China making good on its commitments to buy more stuff from us, if it looks like things are getting dicey between us. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNCAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that is a genuine worry out here. And I -- as you put this in context, this economic tsunami that's hit agriculture with the COVID virus, we were hoping to lean into some pretty good export sales to China with the signing of the phase one deal. Will that happen? China, I know, has still been purchasing some pork. But what their needs are going to be going forward is in question as well. And, yes, you're right, Neil. The deterioration of that relationship sure could continue."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

We have got the White House task force meeting today at 5:00 p.m. They might outline in about 20 minutes exactly where they are right now on this reopening of the United States you have heard so much about. And then some incredible breakthroughs we have on COVID-19 testing, including a saliva test that is almost instantaneous and leaves out any threat or dangers for doctors and nurses administering it. Fascinating -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, you don't like your tough stay-at-home measures, imagine what it's like in America right now, where the governor just doubled down and forbid residents with two homes in the state from going from home to home, even telling them they can't buy garden supplies and paint and stuff like that at stores. And if some of them are caught doing so, they could be fined. Well, that was the final straw for a lot of these protesters in Lansing, Michigan, which said, enough is enough. Now, the governor did get a chance to address that in announcement to reporters a few moments ago, Governor Whitmer saying that they are the ones causing problems, not she. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITMER",
      "utterance": "We know that this rally endangered people. This kind of activity will put more people at risk. And, sadly, it could prolong the amount of time we have to be in this posture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so, Governor Whitmer has not dialed back on any of those stringent measures. And this traffic protest to say, this is going way too far, will probably not ease up. Some of the ralliers that we had been talking to, including one earlier leading this charge, in the show said they will not give up until she eases them. It doesn't look, for the time being, like the governor will. We will stay on top of it, as a number of states are looking at easing up on their own restrictions that have been in place now for the better part of three to four, in some cases six weeks in some states, like, for example, Ohio. Then there's the issue of, what would make states do that? What would make the federal government be more inclined to consider that, working with the states? You hear a lot about an improvement in the number of cases, new or otherwise, going down for 14 straight days. You have also heard a lot more about testing. We would need a lot more testing, so that we can know a lot more what we're dealing with here. I want to explore that with Scott Whitaker, the AdvaMed president and CEO and the former chief of staff over at the Department of Health and Human Services. Sir, very good to have you. Where are we on COVID-19 testing? I know there are a variety of such tests available, including one that will look at antibodies, which could indicate whether you even ever had this yourself. But update me.  SCOTT WHITAKER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ADVAMED: Yes, we're scaling up dramatically. March 12 was the first test that was approved by the FDA. So, at that point, very few tests were being conducted at the time. Today, there are about 20 tests on the market. We're scaling up to the point where we will have about 28 million tests available by the end of April. So it's tremendous progress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But, Neil, that's just on the front end of diagnosing the disease. On the back end of determining how much immunity you have, those tests are in the process right now. We will see more of those in the coming weeks as well, as we work through the process with FDA.  CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Scott, I know there are a variety of different tests. The idea is to get a good, strong sampling to know exactly what we're dealing with here. I know that we had started a little slow in this country, where one out of about 300,000 to 400,000 Americans were being tested. It's dramatically shrunk to, I'm told now, under one -- under -- 100,0000."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And I'm just wondering what you, as a top medical expert yourself, would like to see before even considering unwinding some of these sheltering provisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think there are two things, Neil. We need more testing, for sure. And we're scaling up to do as much as we can, as I said, 28 million by the end of this month and scaling up even more dramatically as we move into the summer months. So that's one thing that we need, for sure. I think continuing the work that we're doing on treating the disease, and also protecting health care workers is critically important as well, and then informing the public that it's not just diagnostic testing alone that gets people back to work, but it's diagnostic testing, along with the CDC rules that they have put on to continue the social distancing, to make sure that we're phasing our way back into the workplace in an appropriate way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Are you confident there will be an unwinding at the end of this month, the beginning of the next month?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "I'm confident that it will begin unwinding soon. I don't know if we will be at the end of this month or the first of next month. But I feel confident, the way that we have scaled up, the work that we're doing with the FDA to get more tests into market, more penetration, more access, all of those things are being done at such a rapid pace, I am confident that, the closer we get to the summer, the better prepared we will be for reentering the workplace. And I'm -- we're anxious about that."

We would had a better understanding of this virus, and then how to deal with it. And I think we -- even today, we see them withholding information."

According to State Department e-mails from two years ago obtained by The Washington Post, U.S. Embassy officials visited the Chinese bio labs in Wuhan where scientists were studying coronavirus in bats and warned them about lax security. Yesterday, I asked the chairman of the Joint Chiefs about the origins of the pandemic."

And we have had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that. And I would just say, at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain."

I think right now what we're concerned about is, how do we treat people who are sick? How do we prevent people from getting sick? But, no, I'm not worried about this as a bioweapon."
