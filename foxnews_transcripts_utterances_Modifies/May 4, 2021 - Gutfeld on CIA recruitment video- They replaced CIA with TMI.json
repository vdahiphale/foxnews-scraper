Talk about oversharing How can this person go undercover? Aren't spies supposed to have a secret identity and not identify openly as 18 different things? Forget name, rank and serial number. Yes, my name is Susan Thomas. I am an art dealer traveling abroad. But really I'm a bisexual non-binary gender studies graduate with student debt and childhood trauma who's in the CIA. Whoops, I should have left that part out and I have to kill you. The whole point of being the CIA is not being true to our identity. Whether you're a Latin ex or Scottish, especially if you're Scottish. The bagpipes are a dead giveaway. So, I say get over yourself or selves. But sadly wokeness is now how we do business and even the CIA is in on it. Man, was I dumb? I thought that kind of P.C. builds had an expiration date once you graduated, like playing hacky sack or listening to Cat Stevens. The understanding was that this stuff was worthless once he left college, but I was wrong. The wokesters are now officially everywhere, drowning us with their box checking vernacular. Could you imagine being interrogated by a new age agent? Talk about torture. Ed, we saw you purchase the ingredients for the pipe bombs. You were obviously acting out against the racist classes as patriarchal colonizers, trying to prevent you from being your best, most authentic self as a result of your lived experiences as a survivor of your chronic bedwetting or as we call it creative peeing. You will confess to anything to stop them from droning on about themselves. Yes, yes, I had a bomb in my shoe. Please stop forcing me to list my favorite role models of color. So I admit this is like shooting sustainably raised salmon in a barrel. This video is not exactly top secret, and this woman is serving our country so good for her. But every blinking Yahoo on this planet can see how silly America's premier's intelligent agency actually is. Even Twitter laughed, but not the CIA. These videos came out of multiple meetings and strategy sessions. The fact that they put this out there, it's kind of a huge blind spot. And spy agencies shouldn't have blind spots. It's like your dad getting an earring for his 50th birthday. Maybe this video might even get people to join the CIA but me, this level of malarkey couldn't get me to join an orgy. But maybe that's the points. One more non-binary intersectional type means one less angry white male like me on staff. Right, angry white male?",

Talk about oversharing How can this person go undercover? Aren't spies supposed to have a secret identity and not identify openly as 18 different things? Forget name, rank and serial number. Yes, my name is Susan Thomas. I am an art dealer traveling abroad. But really I'm a bisexual non-binary gender studies graduate with student debt and childhood trauma who's in the CIA. Whoops, I should have left that part out and I have to kill you. The whole point of being the CIA is not being true to our identity. Whether you're a Latin ex or Scottish, especially if you're Scottish. The bagpipes are a dead giveaway. So, I say get over yourself or selves. But sadly wokeness is now how we do business and even the CIA is in on it. Man, was I dumb? I thought that kind of P.C. builds had an expiration date once you graduated, like playing hacky sack or listening to Cat Stevens. The understanding was that this stuff was worthless once he left college, but I was wrong. The wokesters are now officially everywhere, drowning us with their box checking vernacular. Could you imagine being interrogated by a new age agent? Talk about torture. Ed, we saw you purchase the ingredients for the pipe bombs. You were obviously acting out against the racist classes as patriarchal colonizers, trying to prevent you from being your best, most authentic self as a result of your lived experiences as a survivor of your chronic bedwetting or as we call it creative peeing. You will confess to anything to stop them from droning on about themselves. Yes, yes, I had a bomb in my shoe. Please stop forcing me to list my favorite role models of color. So I admit this is like shooting sustainably raised salmon in a barrel. This video is not exactly top secret, and this woman is serving our country so good for her. But every blinking Yahoo on this planet can see how silly America's premier's intelligent agency actually is. Even Twitter laughed, but not the CIA. These videos came out of multiple meetings and strategy sessions. The fact that they put this out there, it's kind of a huge blind spot. And spy agencies shouldn't have blind spots. It's like your dad getting an earring for his 50th birthday. Maybe this video might even get people to join the CIA but me, this level of malarkey couldn't get me to join an orgy. But maybe that's the points. One more non-binary intersectional type means one less angry white male like me on staff. Right, angry white male?"

Like this is a Tiktok challenge or whatever it was. There was some lady in line that said like, it needs to be 37 degrees Celsius, not 36, not 38, because I will know. I mean, people are psychopaths."

      "speaker": "BLACKBURN",
      "utterance": "It's amazing. Eat dessert first. That's how to start your day. No, here's the thing. Tiktok. I'm not a fan of TikTok. And when you get out there and you are going in intentionally to see if you can get someone frustrated, you can get the video you can put it up, you can have your moment, then you have to say what is the true purpose of this?"

All that you get in return is the reward of then, like barfing for the rest of the day. I read this order, it had: caramel drizzle, extra whipped cream, extra cinnamon dolce topping, seven pumps of dark caramel syrup, extra caramel crunch, honey blend syrup, frappe chips and heavy cream. Like who could survive that? Like that, that's, that's --"

      "speaker": "TYRUS",
      "utterance": "Oh, no, it's the official beverage of fat privileges. They should call that fat-tacular. That's disgusting. You know what they should do, like what Starbucks does to me a lot of times, they just say, we don't have it."

Tyrus, I mean, they -- that's how quick I am. There's nothing -- you get in you get out. You don't, you don't fantasize. And I mean this, like I said, just wow. You know that, after he gets that he should just drive down to the clinic and get tested for type two diabetes. I mean, this dude, this is just fat-tacular."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, he probably doesn't. But the thing is, now I'm thinking this is just a prank that they pull on people. That's all it is. So, this is just something to make the baristas life hell, which makes me very angry because these are hard workers."

      "utterance": "So, I was doing something I almost never do, which is watch \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC and it was weird. It seemed like Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski doesn't seem like they're getting along these days. Take a look. It was just, just an ugly, ugly. Like he -- I mean, he just seemed very, very, very angry. I don't know. And it was weird. It was subtitled in Russian. I think, I don't know what they're saying. Look at that. Very overprotective this little guy. Look at that. Oh my goodness. Sounds like we need an exorcism. All right. Set your DVRs every night so you never miss an episode.
