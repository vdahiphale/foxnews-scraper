      "sentences": "That's good enough for me, Sugar Plum. All right. You want to hear something that's going to blow your mind? I mean, besides the fact that it's been a week and Kat's still married? According to The New York Times, there is not a single-documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions such as walking past someone on the street, or eating at a nearby table. Yes, you heard that right. The New York freaking Times admits that outdoor COVID transmission is the biggest myth since Trump colluded with Russia. Not a single-documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as dining, strolling or giving Jesse waters the finger what you should do at every opportunity. I'm hyperventilating over this and yet, what do you see? People outside masked up. Sometimes wearing two. Others wearing face shields as if they're about to clean Shane MacGowan's teeth. He's the singer for the pokes. This is why I tell you to floss, Kat. She doesn't listen so how did we get here? Well, first we were lied to. Last month, the CDC told us that less than 10 percent of transmissions were from outdoors, which is true. Technically, .1 percent is less than 10 percent. And that's likely the real rate of transmission, .1 percent not 10. That's like 100-fold difference. I think. I don't know. But of course the media is spread that large number like herpes and a beehive full of sweaty bees. And now everyone looks like Michael Jackson impersonators in their stupid use asks, they're jogging, they're on bikes, they're in swimming pools even. It's embarrassing to be human. We all look like fools because it's pointless. It's like wearing a seatbelt to lunch or a football helmet to bed. Thank god those days are behind me. So, the CDC lied to us. They made a statement, they knew is technically accurate but intended to deceive through a 10th of a percent is literally less than 10 percent. But this is like saying there's less than 10,000 black bear attacks a year in the U.S. It's true. There's roughly one black bear attack a year. And I bet it's the same bear and the same guy. He's a pervert. The worst part the bear wasn't even wearing a mask. Stupid bear. So the mask guidelines are quite literally a cover up. The CDC still says if you're unvaccinated, you should wear masks outdoors. And even vaccinated should wear them at large events like concerts and sporting events and we love Gutfeld rallies. And they're still having kids wear them at summer camp at all times which I'm fine with because I hate children but I know it's wrong. But apart from Operation Warp Speed, our pandemic response isn't grounded in science. It's grounded in science fiction. I wonder how our angry white male feels about this.",

It's their business model. And when they run out of scary stats, they literally climb a mountain to find more. The Washington Post just ran a piece on the spread of COVID among -- get this, Mount Everest climbers. The press will literally go to the ends of the earth to find new places for people to be afraid of COVID. Yes, people who climb Mount Everest are at risk for COVID as opposed to the normal way of dying on Mount Everest. which is being impaled on a pile of frozen poop. And then they just leave you there. But their normal risk of dying on the mountain is between .5 and 1.1 percent. I want to put it in another way, it's somewhat less than 1,000 percent. But it's higher than the death rate for a 25-year-old, from COVID at any elevation. Something tells me when you go into Nepal to find the untold story of COVID, you're getting desperate, but I'm still waiting on the COVID numbers for people who live under the sea. So why is the mask lie so bad? Well, it's another transparent deception that makes the average person skeptical about everything the government tells us about COVID, even the true stuff. And it creates conflicts between self (BLEEP) and the nice people they're trying to mask shame.",

This lady must be a real laugh right during story hour. The Dewey Decimal System as we all know, categorizes all knowledge into 10 groups, then further subdivides those into sub sections. Now, this fact might surprise you. I don't care. According to Rianna, non- Western European subjects like Asian language or African geography are putting more broad sections, which I guess is bad. And in religion, Christianity has 89 sections compared to one for Islam. So, I guess that makes it racist. Hooray. But look, the Dewey Decimal System was invented in the West in 1873. So, it was the steam engine, the cotton gin, and the dashboard cigarette lighter. That doesn't make them racist, it just makes them old. And finally, when asked about alleged racism in College Libraries, Cornell students responded, what's the library? So, Lisa, in, you know, in between your massive reckless partying, have you been to a library lately and do you feel that they are racist?",

      "utterance": "That's good enough for me, Sugar Plum. All right. You want to hear something that's going to blow your mind? I mean, besides the fact that it's been a week and Kat's still married? According to The New York Times, there is not a single-documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions such as walking past someone on the street, or eating at a nearby table. Yes, you heard that right. The New York freaking Times admits that outdoor COVID transmission is the biggest myth since Trump colluded with Russia. Not a single-documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as dining, strolling or giving Jesse waters the finger what you should do at every opportunity. I'm hyperventilating over this and yet, what do you see? People outside masked up. Sometimes wearing two. Others wearing face shields as if they're about to clean Shane MacGowan's teeth. He's the singer for the pokes. This is why I tell you to floss, Kat. She doesn't listen so how did we get here? Well, first we were lied to. Last month, the CDC told us that less than 10 percent of transmissions were from outdoors, which is true. Technically, .1 percent is less than 10 percent. And that's likely the real rate of transmission, .1 percent not 10. That's like 100-fold difference. I think. I don't know. But of course the media is spread that large number like herpes and a beehive full of sweaty bees. And now everyone looks like Michael Jackson impersonators in their stupid use asks, they're jogging, they're on bikes, they're in swimming pools even. It's embarrassing to be human. We all look like fools because it's pointless. It's like wearing a seatbelt to lunch or a football helmet to bed. Thank god those days are behind me. So, the CDC lied to us. They made a statement, they knew is technically accurate but intended to deceive through a 10th of a percent is literally less than 10 percent. But this is like saying there's less than 10,000 black bear attacks a year in the U.S. It's true. There's roughly one black bear attack a year. And I bet it's the same bear and the same guy. He's a pervert. The worst part the bear wasn't even wearing a mask. Stupid bear. So the mask guidelines are quite literally a cover up. The CDC still says if you're unvaccinated, you should wear masks outdoors. And even vaccinated should wear them at large events like concerts and sporting events and we love Gutfeld rallies. And they're still having kids wear them at summer camp at all times which I'm fine with because I hate children but I know it's wrong. But apart from Operation Warp Speed, our pandemic response isn't grounded in science. It's grounded in science fiction. I wonder how our angry white male feels about this."

It's their business model. And when they run out of scary stats, they literally climb a mountain to find more. The Washington Post just ran a piece on the spread of COVID among -- get this, Mount Everest climbers. The press will literally go to the ends of the earth to find new places for people to be afraid of COVID. Yes, people who climb Mount Everest are at risk for COVID as opposed to the normal way of dying on Mount Everest. which is being impaled on a pile of frozen poop. And then they just leave you there. But their normal risk of dying on the mountain is between .5 and 1.1 percent. I want to put it in another way, it's somewhat less than 1,000 percent. But it's higher than the death rate for a 25-year-old, from COVID at any elevation. Something tells me when you go into Nepal to find the untold story of COVID, you're getting desperate, but I'm still waiting on the COVID numbers for people who live under the sea. So why is the mask lie so bad? Well, it's another transparent deception that makes the average person skeptical about everything the government tells us about COVID, even the true stuff. And it creates conflicts between self (BLEEP) and the nice people they're trying to mask shame."

You wear masks, you're patriot, don't wear them, you're Neanderthal who's trying to kill my grandma. It's all -- it's hard to keep us angry and divided. But the truth is far different.

In L.A., Times report in February revealed the organization had no black members. They claimed they tried to recruit their first black female last year but Rachel Dolezal passed. They pledged to reform and last week approved the plan to diversify its membership. Some studios including Amazon and Netflix say it's not aggressive enough of course, can't be woken up. And that they won't work with the Hollywood foreign press until more action is taken. Even Tom Cruise all four-foot-seven of him has taken a stand, probably on a box.

This lady must be a real laugh right during story hour. The Dewey Decimal System as we all know, categorizes all knowledge into 10 groups, then further subdivides those into sub sections. Now, this fact might surprise you. I don't care. According to Rianna, non- Western European subjects like Asian language or African geography are putting more broad sections, which I guess is bad. And in religion, Christianity has 89 sections compared to one for Islam. So, I guess that makes it racist. Hooray. But look, the Dewey Decimal System was invented in the West in 1873. So, it was the steam engine, the cotton gin, and the dashboard cigarette lighter. That doesn't make them racist, it just makes them old. And finally, when asked about alleged racism in College Libraries, Cornell students responded, what's the library?

According to the Journal Nature Medicine, it's the only journal you can smoke. MDMA, aka Mali combined with therapy was MDMA-mazing in treating severe PTSD. The New England Journal of Medicine also reported psilocybin the magic part of magic mushrooms was as effective as Lexapro for relieving depression, without the side effects of sexual dysfunction, or creepy T.V. commercials. This openness to mind expanding drugs follows marijuana legalization in many states, and like pot, has the potential to become big business if the drugs get FDA approval.
