The president likes that type of competition and encourages it.   MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" HOST: So, breaking tonight, the president \"likes that kind of competition,\" in a moment, the press secretary will be here to explain that comment and also to respond to a profanity laced tirade that was given by her new boss. He has put out another tweet to try to explain that -- that's Anthony Scaramucci -- and that is our top score tonight.  It all started last night when Politico published an article on Scaramucci's financial disclosures. In a now deleted tweet he wrote this: \"In light of the leaks of my financial disclosure info, which is a felony, I will be contacting FBI and Justice Department. #Swamp @Reince45,\" meaning Reince Priebus. So, it turns out that the information that was reported was public. It was not leaked. And that sent him, quickly backtracking on that, and then he tweeted this. \"Wrong! The tweet was public notice to leakers that all senior administration officials are helping to end illegal leaks,\" again, \"@Reince45.\" So, then, we move forward to what happened this morning. The White House communications director called into CNN to try to clear all of that up. But the interview did little more than throwing some more gasoline on what turned out to be a pretty raging fire already. Listen to this.  ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP (via telephone): We have had odds, with have had differences. When I said we were brothers from the podium, that's because we're rough on each other. Some brothers are like Cain and Abel. Other brothers can fight with each other and then get along. I don't know if this is repairable or not, that will be up to the president.",

So, according to Ryan Lizza's story, Mr. Scaramucci gave him a call and said, you know, why do you even know this? How do you know about this private dinner that's happening at the White House? And he says, \"They'll all be fired by me. I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I'll fire tomorrow. Reince Priebus, if you want to leak something, he'll be asked to resign very shortly. Reince is a blanking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.\" I mean, this is revelatory of what's going on inside the White House that I think, you know, American citizens look at that, and say, you know, \"Gee, is the business the priority here or is it the animus that exists between these two individuals at this point?",

Yesterday, they had a big announcement with Foxconn where they're investing billions of dollars in Wisconsin, going to create all these jobs, what are we talking about? We're talking about the president's -- his latest attack on Sessions and whether Sessions is still on the job. Now, we're talking -- you know, they have tax reform that they've unveiled today. Principles for tax reform. What are we talking about? We're talking about Scaramucci attacking the White House chief of staff as a schizoid paranoiac. I mean, they're stepping on their own story.

Because the fact of the matter is, and as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is -- you know, we're really glad she came on tonight, you know, made clear, she said, we want to talk about the jobs outside of the White House.

And so, he obviously has two people that he has relied upon in his White House, and I'm talking in particular now about Chief Of Staff Reince Priebus, and Anthony Scaramucci, the new communications director. They've both been loyal to the president, as far as I know. And the president is the one that needs to set the tone for these two guys.  Now, Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the press briefing today said that the president likes this kind of competition. Now, maybe this has gone too far. It's a little bit of a distraction. I would say, however, that one, let's not kid ourselves. Reporters love this kind of thing. They don't want Anthony Scaramucci to dial back his language. This is like, the best story that they can do. Because I will tell you this, reporters, human beings, they will always eat dessert first, OK? So, it's always much easier and much more fun to write about and talk about the telenovela that is the White House.  Imagine if you had cameras -- it's harder to make them eat their vegetables. Making them write a story only about Fox Con yesterday, or only about tax reform today, or only about health care tomorrow, you can do that, but only you at the top of the White House can make sure that happens.",

You can read that in the comments. He personally attacks both men, and really skirls a scandalous, offensive language. And you know, people are talking about, well, we have an agenda. This has been a very rough week for the White House.  Arguably, evidence of dysfunction, going from the president attacking his own attorney general, to now, you have the new communications director attacking the chief of staff and the chief political strategist for President Trump. President Trump, meanwhile, looks as if he's trying to stand back and say I like creative tension. But it's tension to no end, to no positive outcome. And open up this White House message to attacks from its critics. And what I'm noticing is, so many of the critics right now are fellow Republicans who are saying, as we've heard from people on this panel, you're not advancing the Republican agenda here, this is all about ego and competition.

And let me tell you about your exclusive interview with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the drama that was caused just off-camera that our viewers wouldn't had seen while you were talking at the top of this hour with Sarah Huckabee Sanders. All of a sudden, a line of reporters who had not been getting calls and emails returned from top White House aides for reaction to Anthony Scaramucci's strong comments in that New Yorker Magazine interview, started lining up just a few feet from where I am trying to grab Sarah Huckabee Sanders right after she finished with you. Once the interview ended, she walked off-camera, looked at her phone, and said give me a couple of minutes. I think she clearly wanted to find out if anything else dropped in the last couple of moments. Was there any new White House strategy to react? Asked the reporters to walk down the driveway, they did that, they waited for her, and she said much the same that she told you that they're not going to be distracted by all this. But I will note, remember, on a similar occasion when Sean Spicer was practically hiding in the bushes on the driveway. In contrast, Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced the music and took the heat from reporters and tried here tonight to push back.  But you're right. There's a lot of drama. On top of what Scaramucci said in the New Yorker magazine, you have Jeff Sessions still under fire here. And I've been told by some of the president's advisors that for now they believe the president had been talked down from firing Jeff Sessions. He's still very angry at the attorney general, but they believe he is at least calm down because they tell me that what they're telling the president is that firing the attorney general, a popular conservative, would spark a revolt among the very Republicans on the hill the president needs on health care, taxes, and the rest of his agenda. Republican Ben Sasse took to the senate floor to strongly discourage the president from going forward with one scenario being talked about, firing Sessions, and then using a recess appointment in August to install a replacement without having to get that replacement confirm. Sasse declaring the presidency is not a ball, and the nation is not a China shop. But the strongest defense of Sessions yet, came from Republican Lindsey Graham, who's also writing a bill that would block the president from firing special counsel, Robert Mueller, while the attorney general himself, as you noted, is speaking out for the first time to our own Tucker Carlson.",

If you think the last six months of press have been bad for President Trump, tried pushing through a message about his agenda when the Democrats -- first of all, you have difficulty finding somebody, and then the nomination, the confirmation battle would be horrendous, and it will go on for months, and months, and months, and drown on this issue. So I was writing about something that I thought was really problematic for the administration and hurtful to the president's attempts to get his message out. But I got to tell you, two hours, three hours after my piece went to bed, we'd began to have this drama with Anthony Scaramucci, who I know personally, I known for a number of years. First of all, accusing people of leaking what is actually a public document, his personal financial statement. Everybody who serves in the administration -- I had to do it seven years that I worked at the White House. I have to fill out a 278. It was available to anybody. He was working at the Export Import Bank, and somebody went over there and requested a copy of his document, which is available to the public, and then wrote about it. And for him to rant -- rave about that was bad enough. But then, to go on, as he's done over the last 24 hours, this profanity laced tirade to Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker is appalling beyond belief. How can anybody overcome that and work as a colleague in the future. He goes after the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, in deeply personal terms. He says objectionable and almost homophobic things about Steve Bannon, the president's senior advisor and chief strategist. I mean, these things are appalling. And I can't imagine that that is constructive at all and working towards the fulfillment of President Trump's agenda.",

But he's going after the Communications Department because Ryan Lizza tells him that he understood that certain individuals were having a dinner at the White House, and he recorded that. So, according to Ryan Lizza's story, Mr. Scaramucci gave him a call and said, you know, why do you even know this? How do you know about this private dinner that's happening at the White House? And he says, \"They'll all be fired by me. I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I'll fire tomorrow. Reince Priebus, if you want to leak something, he'll be asked to resign very shortly. Reince is a blanking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.\" I mean, this is revelatory of what's going on inside the White House that I think, you know, American citizens look at that, and say, you know, \"Gee, is the business the priority here or is it the animus that exists between these two individuals at this point?"

This is a big day today legislatively. We've got the health care vote coming up later tonight. Border wall just came out of the House Appropriations. We've got Russia sanctions bill that's just passed. We're focused on the agenda, moving forward. And sometimes, people on the staff get pretty passionate about that. Hopefully, they'll reel some of their language in. But again, I'm very focused. I know the president's very focused, and his team is on pushing his agenda forward."

And has done, you know, I think a lot that the White House would feel very happy about. But the last 48 hours has been sucked into this fight that's going on between these two men. It does bring into question whether or not that's an effective communicator."

I think we have to push forward and that's exactly what we are doing. We are focused on health care; it's going to be a big thing over the next several hours.

And I would imagine, you know, that from now on, you know, when it starts a conversation, he's probably going to say this is off the record because we all know that, you know, that's how it works.

The press and the media may make this the focal point of their day, but we're certainly not making it the focal point of ours. We're moving forward. We're focused tonight.

But this person is quoted, you know, works in the White House said, \"This is getting out of hand. I'm honestly getting concerned for my safety in the office tomorrow. This type of behavior is unbelievable.

And that's why we're working every day to build the economy, get regulations out of the way so that we have a better environment for job creation. In terms of people's safety, I certainly hate that somebody feels that way, but I've worked with an incredible team over the last six months. We have a great group of people.

He wants them to crack down on immigration which they've done, which we've spent a great deal of time talking about today, and the president will do so tomorrow on Long Island.

He said, in very -- sort of very strong language, said if the president tries to nudge Sessions out or fire Sessions, we are not going to move forward with any effort to replace him. Grassley said the same thing. They're basically putting it on the marker and saying he is your attorney general, Mr. President, and if you try to sneak another way around that, we're going to block you at every turn. In fact, Lindsey Graham uses the language, it might the end of the Trump presidency."

And so, all those stuff that's happening around her and she's having to manage it. And I think what you see also is that there's a lot of pent-up resentment between the new Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, and the Chief Of Staff, Reince Priebus. I think that the show that they put on last week, saying that, oh, no, everything's fine, we get along great. I don't necessarily think that that's true. And now we see them in these comments that there's a lot that has to be decided by the president. This is not something that Scaramucci can decide or Reince Priebus can decide. I actually think this decision comes down to the president. They've both made their case. And if they're both going to stay, then the president has to make that happen. If Reince is going to go, there's going to be other changes. I would suggest making them soon because the transition causes them not to be able to talk about the things that are going on."

But this was Anthony Scaramucci's response: he said, \"I sometimes use colorful language.

Marc, you know, before you do that, actually, let's put up one more of these quotes, so that you can -- you know, so the folks at home who may not have seen some of these can see them. And as I've pointed out, we're not putting them all up for very good reasons, because they're not really PG-rated. He says, \"I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to build my own brand off of the blank strength of the president. I am here to serve the country.\" I mean, he's really -- you know, has lashed out a number of people and threatened to fire the entire Communications Department in the course this, because he was upset that a leak happened that explained who he was having dinner with, with the president of the White House.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders was just on and she said that he's just so passionate about the president's agenda. Well, if he's so passionate about the president's agenda, stop stepping on it. Yesterday, they had a big announcement with Foxconn where they're investing billions of dollars in Wisconsin, going to create all these jobs, what are we talking about? We're talking about the president's -- his latest attack on Sessions and whether Sessions is still on the job. Now, we're talking -- you know, they have tax reform that they've unveiled today. Principles for tax reform. What are we talking about? We're talking about Scaramucci attacking the White House chief of staff as a schizoid paranoiac. I mean, they're stepping on their own story. And if they were getting stuff done, and this was all the sideshows, that will be fine. But they're not getting stuff done. And it's just an absolute train wreck."

So, I think that that, you know, feeling of being fired up when you see something like that comes out of a patriotic place. I think and hope -- whether you're a Democrat or you're a Republican. Because the fact of the matter is, and as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is -- you know, we're really glad she came on tonight, you know, made clear, she said, we want to talk about the jobs outside of the White House. But the problem is that there's so much -- you know when you make it all about you, which is what this appears to do in this particular instance, and the other individuals that you work with, you undercut that message in a huge way.

And so, he obviously has two people that he has relied upon in his White House, and I'm talking in particular now about Chief Of Staff Reince Priebus, and Anthony Scaramucci, the new communications director. They've both been loyal to the president, as far as I know. And the president is the one that needs to set the tone for these two guys. Now, Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the press briefing today said that the president likes this kind of competition. Now, maybe this has gone too far. It's a little bit of a distraction. I would say, however, that one, let's not kid ourselves. Reporters love this kind of thing. They don't want Anthony Scaramucci to dial back his language. This is like, the best story that they can do. Because I will tell you this, reporters, human beings, they will always eat dessert first, OK? So, it's always much easier and much more fun to write about and talk about the telenovela that is the White House. Imagine if you had cameras -- it's harder to make them eat their vegetables. Making them write a story only about Fox Con yesterday, or only about tax reform today, or only about health care tomorrow, you can do that, but only you at the top of the White House can make sure that happens."

It's that nobody inside the White House is interested in getting out. Everybody is locked in a death match. And so, what you have is Scaramucci versus Priebus, but also versus Steve Bannon. You can read that in the comments. He personally attacks both men, and really skirls a scandalous, offensive language. And you know, people are talking about, well, we have an agenda. This has been a very rough week for the White House. Arguably, evidence of dysfunction, going from the president attacking his own attorney general, to now, you have the new communications director attacking the chief of staff and the chief political strategist for President Trump. President Trump, meanwhile, looks as if he's trying to stand back and say I like creative tension. But it's tension to no end, to no positive outcome. And open up this White House message to attacks from its critics. And what I'm noticing is, so many of the critics right now are fellow Republicans who are saying, as we've heard from people on this panel, you're not advancing the Republican agenda here, this is all about ego and competition. He said Cain and Abel, as what Scaramucci said, is his relationship with Priebus. That didn't end so well."

One of this generation's great, General Jack Keane, joins us, and he will weigh in on that in just a moment. Plus, an update to a story that we first told you about last night, there are now new calls for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to be investigated into how she handled the scandal surrounding a former I.T. aide, who is now charged with bank fraud.

It's showing Debbie Wasserman Schultz scolding the Chief of the Capitol Police, who was there to protect her and everyone else who works on Capitol Hill. So, this is starting to get a lot more attention. RNC Chair, Ronna McDaniel, is calling for the former DNC head to testify about all of this before Congress, and about the man who you see on the right-hand side of the screen, Imran Awan, who recently was arrested as he was leaving the country. He's her former I.T. aide. Tim Canova, Wasserman Schultz's 2018 Democratic primary opponent, has been taking another step further, saying that the video shows obstruction of justice. He joins us now along with Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com News Editor; and Mo Elleithee of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, both are Fox News contributors.

So, was she threatening that somehow the budget would be impeded if he did not cooperate and handover the -- what is it, a laptop or computer that she said was hers? At the very least it shows a pattern of mismanagement. And we saw that throughout her tenure as the DNC chair. The DNC lost an awful lot of seats, the Democratic Party in the last few years when she was chair of the DNC. In addition to losing seats, she didn't cooperate with turning over the servers of the DNC. There's lots of questions about that. And there's even a fraud lawsuit against the DNC, which really goes to her tenure as the chair of the DNC."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And he worked for several members of congress on the hill, and he and other family members who also worked in the I.T. business with him made $4 million working on the hill. I mean, who knew that you could make that much money as an I.T. specialist. So you've got to ask yourself what's going on in here and what exactly are they being paid to do."

He was wiring money to Pakistan after having access to the house I.T. system, and her question should be not when the capitol police are going to give me my computer, which could have been compromised back, but please look into as much as you can to make sure that my office wasn't compromised, that my fellow Republicans and Democrats weren't compromised, and that there are people in Pakistan who now have our information."

The Chinese, once they had acquired nuclear weapons, then they wanted to acquire ICBM's, we protested loudly. But once they acquired them, we acquiesced. That's what he's betting on.

Obviously, the other option -- using a preemptive strike, that's not going to work in my judgment because Kim Jong-un will recognize that as an act of war and respond accordingly. And we certainly have all sorts of different military options from low-end to high-end that we can possibly execute.

So I think this time that we have here, we've got to come to our senses here. We've got about 2500 soldiers after Secretary Carter lifted the transgender band, by which -- by the way the military did not ask for it, but he lifted it. And after that about 2500 soldiers came forward and changed their gender.

He spoke to Tucker Carlson just moments ago. You're going to see all of that at 8:00 tonight. So the last seven days at the White House have been really nothing short of chaotic. The newest headache is this bombshell interview from Anthony Scaramucci. It's a rant against White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and it gets very vulgar at times. Ed Henry has the latest on this. He's on the north lawn where it's been pretty busy out there tonight, Ed."

      "utterance": "It has lot of drama, Martha. And let me tell you about your exclusive interview with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the drama that was caused just off-camera that our viewers wouldn't had seen while you were talking at the top of this hour with Sarah Huckabee Sanders. All of a sudden, a line of reporters who had not been getting calls and emails returned from top White House aides for reaction to Anthony Scaramucci's strong comments in that New Yorker Magazine interview, started lining up just a few feet from where I am trying to grab Sarah Huckabee Sanders right after she finished with you. Once the interview ended, she walked off-camera, looked at her phone, and said give me a couple of minutes. I think she clearly wanted to find out if anything else dropped in the last couple of moments. Was there any new White House strategy to react? Asked the reporters to walk down the driveway, they did that, they waited for her, and she said much the same that she told you that they're not going to be distracted by all this. But I will note, remember, on a similar occasion when Sean Spicer was practically hiding in the bushes on the driveway. In contrast, Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced the music and took the heat from reporters and tried here tonight to push back. But you're right. There's a lot of drama. On top of what Scaramucci said in the New Yorker magazine, you have Jeff Sessions still under fire here. And I've been told by some of the president's advisors that for now they believe the president had been talked down from firing Jeff Sessions. He's still very angry at the attorney general, but they believe he is at least calm down because they tell me that what they're telling the president is that firing the attorney general, a popular conservative, would spark a revolt among the very Republicans on the hill the president needs on health care, taxes, and the rest of his agenda. Republican Ben Sasse took to the senate floor to strongly discourage the president from going forward with one scenario being talked about, firing Sessions, and then using a recess appointment in August to install a replacement without having to get that replacement confirm. Sasse declaring the presidency is not a ball, and the nation is not a China shop. But the strongest defense of Sessions yet, came from Republican Lindsey Graham, who's also writing a bill that would block the president from firing special counsel, Robert Mueller, while the attorney general himself, as you noted, is speaking out for the first time to our own Tucker Carlson."

The attorney general also told the associated press in another interview he has no plans to step down, but the president has every right to fire him if he wants, but again, Session saying he has no plans to step down. You can see that full interview, top of the hour, right here on Fox News."

      "utterance": "Yeah. We look forward to that. Ed, thank you very much. Ed Henry at a busy White House. Tonight, Karl Rove is former deputy chief of staff. He knows what it's like to work in the west wing. He did that, of course, under President George W. Bush, and he's also a Fox News political contributor. So Karl, I mean, you have a unique perspective on this. You have been in those halls and worked there. When you look at the back and forth that we have seen over the course of this week, which you wrote about today in the Wall Street Journal. And then, in particular, the story that broke tonight, what you make of it?"

      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I wrote my piece for this morning's journal, I went to bed yesterday afternoon, and so it was mainly focused on Sessions, and I thought Sessions was being -- first of all, mistreated by the president, and I thought the president was acting stupidly because if he removes Jeff Sessions there will be hell to pay for the next six months or longer. If you think the last six months of press have been bad for President Trump, tried pushing through a message about his agenda when the Democrats -- first of all, you have difficulty finding somebody, and then the nomination, the confirmation battle would be horrendous, and it will go on for months, and months, and months, and drown on this issue. So I was writing about something that I thought was really problematic for the administration and hurtful to the president's attempts to get his message out. But I got to tell you, two hours, three hours after my piece went to bed, we'd began to have this drama with Anthony Scaramucci, who I know personally, I known for a number of years. First of all, accusing people of leaking what is actually a public document, his personal financial statement. Everybody who serves in the administration -- I had to do it seven years that I worked at the White House. I have to fill out a 278. It was available to anybody. He was working at the Export Import Bank, and somebody went over there and requested a copy of his document, which is available to the public, and then wrote about it. And for him to rant -- rave about that was bad enough. But then, to go on, as he's done over the last 24 hours, this profanity laced tirade to Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker is appalling beyond belief. How can anybody overcome that and work as a colleague in the future. He goes after the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, in deeply personal terms. He says objectionable and almost homophobic things about Steve Bannon, the president's senior advisor and chief strategist. I mean, these things are appalling. And I can't imagine that that is constructive at all and working towards the fulfillment of President Trump's agenda."
