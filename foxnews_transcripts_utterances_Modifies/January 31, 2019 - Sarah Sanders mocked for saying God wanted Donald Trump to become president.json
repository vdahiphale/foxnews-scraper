I saw something in there about -- having to do with psychological reasons, like if the birth is psychologically traumatic to the woman, which -- I don't see is a risk of life. But then you could extend it to the terrible twos. If you're talking about psychological trauma to the mother, you could just go into being a teenager because, I mean, it doesn't get any better.

And women are faced with a lot of tough decisions. There is a pretty strong consensus in this country that late-term or partial birth abortion is very, very wrong. Split down the middle on abortion. Actually, I think we're a little bit more pro-life, but only 13 percent of Americans support partial birth abortion.  And you can tell how horrible it is and grotesque by the way that people refuse to talk about it in detail. They talk about it in vague clinical terms, because when you actually talk about the procedure in graphic detail, you can't help but feel shame if you support it. And that's why there's a media blackout on it, and that's why you can tell even the woman supporting the bill didn't want to talk about it.

But I think this is -- I think Ralph Northam is on the right track when he speaks and says this is a decision to be made between women and their doctors, not politicians in some legislature. And the current law right now it says you can have an abortion in the third semester if, in fact, you see that the child has some medical issues that would complicate issues or a threat to the mother's life. Again, you need two doctors plus the primary care physician to make this decision now. The new bill would have reduced the number of doctors involved. So -- but what we're talking about here is a situation in the country where I think right now it's like -- I think there's seven states where there's only one abortion clinic in the whole state, which is essentially forcing the politicians' attitudes on women.

And we are charged as human beings at the top of the food chain, we have a brains and hearts, and we have science, and we have faith, and all of that informs how we think about things and how we talk about things. A fetus is not viable, to their point, until it's born. And then it's born and it has these inalienable rights that our country bestows upon the innocent. So I don't mind having the debate. It should be held respectfully, of course.  But I do think that the reason that the Democrats are finding themselves in this position today with all of the scrutiny is because they were super un- careful. And I also think that they don't realize that people are actually paying attention. You might not read the bill in Virginia, but that means that everyone else is still going to talk about it. This bill just passed in New York. There's another one happening in Rhode Island. And the bill was tabled in Virginia, but the Republicans narrowly have the majority in Virginia.

You love your dog. You love reading. You're a Republican. He didn't marry you and then try to change you into a Democrat dog-hating non-reader. OK, he accepted it and love you for who you are. Now the problem is she also says capitalism is rules -- without rules is theft, OK? We have so many rules in capitalism. There's a 185,000 pages in the federal registry of codes, and that's not including city regulations and state regulations. I would say that socialism with rules is theft. So they have this new green deal or whatever, OK, where they would eliminate all oil and gas in ten years."

Since 1970, the number of people who have been suffering from starvation style poverty, not just being poor, but suffering from starvation around the world has decreased by 80 percent. In 1970, it took Americans two months to save up enough money to buy a TV. Today it takes two days to make that much money. Capitalism has been the only form of government -- of government or system program that's actually taking people out of poverty. We've seen the war on poverty fails. We've seen that these social programs are running out of money and they want more of them. A quarter of people in the world today are living on a dollar -- less than a dollar a day. A couple of years ago, 1 in 20 people."

And the other thing that Katie brings up that you just said quickly but it's really important. Technological innovation is making us so well-off, so even when we're making slightly more money, we're actually infinitely richer.

That we've been talking about humanitarian crises, you know, people are shouting at Republicans for splitting up families. Is that worse than splitting up babies? The fact is you actually need pro-lifers to make noise about this because no one else will. I mean, a total blackout of the movie Gosnell tells you everything you need to know.

Because there's -- what made this bill interesting, and correct me if I'm wrong, because we rarely read the bills, but I tried. I saw something in there about -- having to do with psychological reasons, like if the birth is psychologically traumatic to the woman, which -- I don't see is a risk of life. But then you could extend it to the terrible twos. If you're talking about psychological trauma to the mother, you could just go into being a teenager because, I mean, it doesn't get any better. So I think -- I mean, I think this bill has been tabled and I think people are realizing that it is absolute nuts to say that, well, you know, it's not about a threat to the mother's life. It's a threat to her psyche. That's the thing that's scary. And then they reduce the number of doctors who could sign off on this to make it easier. That was also something. So, I think -- the good news is, because there's outcry it causes people to look at this stuff and it makes you wonder what would happen if there was no pro-life movement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",

Well, I think that it's important to say that I'm not conflating the two issues because he specifically said when we talk about third trimester abortions, and then went on to talk about it. So he may have answered the question in terms of hospice care, but he did say he was talking about third trimester abortions and didn't actually answer the question, Jesse, from the interviewer, in the radio interview because he didn't condemn the bill or say that he supported it."

But when I saw the sonogram of my twins, it definitely had a huge personal impact on me. I know other people have that same feeling. But everybody's different. Everybody's journey is different. And women are faced with a lot of tough decisions. There is a pretty strong consensus in this country that late-term or partial birth abortion is very, very wrong. Split down the middle on abortion. Actually, I think we're a little bit more pro-life, but only 13 percent of Americans support partial birth abortion. And you can tell how horrible it is and grotesque by the way that people refuse to talk about it in detail. They talk about it in vague clinical terms, because when you actually talk about the procedure in graphic detail, you can't help but feel shame if you support it. And that's why there's a media blackout on it, and that's why you can tell even the woman supporting the bill didn't want to talk about it. And -- but I believe, and as Greg said, the more you talk about it in detail, the more people know what it is and the more people can say no."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So, Juan, this bill was voted down but it was cosponsored by 20 Democrats. One of the Virginia delegates, John Adams who cosponsored the bill, apologized to his constituents for cosponsoring it after admitting that she didn't read it. What about Democrats in deciding that they're going to introduce all of these bills across the country and it enables women up to labor to have late-term abortions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I just want to second what Jesse said. I think it's very difficult topic to talk about it. We go back and forth here on The Five but this is a very touchy subject for so many people. I don't take it lightly. You know, I love kids and I love my grandkids. But I think this is -- I think Ralph Northam is on the right track when he speaks and says this is a decision to be made between women and their doctors, not politicians in some legislature. And the current law right now it says you can have an abortion in the third semester if, in fact, you see that the child has some medical issues that would complicate issues or a threat to the mother's life. Again, you need two doctors plus the primary care physician to make this decision now. The new bill would have reduced the number of doctors involved. So -- but what we're talking about here is a situation in the country where I think right now it's like -- I think there's seven states where there's only one abortion clinic in the whole state, which is essentially forcing the politicians' attitudes on women. And I don't think that's right. I just don't think it's right. And, Jesse, by the way, the numbers I see from Pew says 58 percent of Americans, a majority, say yes to legal abortion in almost -- all or most cases."

The question on this is that -- OK, if the Democrats don't want to have a situation like this where they say that their words are being misinterpreted, then -- first of all, read the bill before you cosponsor it. That's a good idea. But also read them carefully because these words really matter. And we are charged as human beings at the top of the food chain, we have a brains and hearts, and we have science, and we have faith, and all of that informs how we think about things and how we talk about things. A fetus is not viable, to their point, until it's born. And then it's born and it has these inalienable rights that our country bestows upon the innocent. So I don't mind having the debate. It should be held respectfully, of course. But I do think that the reason that the Democrats are finding themselves in this position today with all of the scrutiny is because they were super un- careful. And I also think that they don't realize that people are actually paying attention. You might not read the bill in Virginia, but that means that everyone else is still going to talk about it. This bill just passed in New York. There's another one happening in Rhode Island. And the bill was tabled in Virginia, but the Republicans narrowly have the majority in Virginia. They had to fight for it. The bill was table 3 to 2. And it could come back at any time, so that's why it will be a big political issue in 2020."

It ain't us, which poses a problem for left-wing activists who needed America to protest.

Recycling was sold to us as a magical solution but even mainstream media outlets like 60 Minutes know it's garbage. So, as usual, our nation's busybodies ignore the consequences of their actions. Plastic straws are necessary for people with disabilities as well as the elderly. But who cares. Every band is considered progress for feverish prigs. After all, why should someone possess a products that makes life easier when the lives of the activists are so grim, more so than those straws, they truly suck.

They're working on something called It's A Penalty Campaign to harness the power of sport, to prevent abuse exploitation and trafficking on a global scale. So major sporting events like the Super Bowl become this hotbed of trafficking, so It's A Penalty is attempting to stop that. They have a short film; it's being played by airlines in Atlanta area hotels to help spread the message. Guess what? This morning, in the lead-up to the Super Bowl, federal law enforcement officials announced that they have arrested 33 people in the Atlanta area all ready for sex trafficking in a planned operation.

He led the Brooklyn Dodgers to their first World Series victory in 1955 and Major League Baseball is going to be celebrating the centennial of his birth all year long, the entire 2019 season. They started today with an exhibit at the New York City Museum. After his death, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, Presidential Medal of Freedom.
