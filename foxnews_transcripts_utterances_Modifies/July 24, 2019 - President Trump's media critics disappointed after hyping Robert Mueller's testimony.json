On Republicans, he said that they defended something great today. He even called them warriors. Robert Mueller, on his presentation, the president just said he believed that he didn't have a presentation. He did not have material when he went into those hearing rooms today.

And the way he was pushing back on the press right there, shows you how sure of himself he is that he's closed this chapter and impeachment. I believe the impeachment train has stopped dead on the tracks.

Huh, it turns out the book was better than the movie, especially for the Democrats.   Well, you can't get away from the facts, and I think that's what the Democrats tried to show today. They laid out the case for obstruction, they laid out that Russia interfered, and as I -- you know, as you heard even at the very end, from Adam Schiff on the -- the chair --Democratic chair intelligence committee, he still thinks that there's a case to be made here.

Remember he said how much it will cost less than that. 37 people and entities charged with crimes, 25 ongoing criminal cases referred, seven convicted including five top Trump campaign officials. And then he had no collusion, no this or that. 10 instances of obstruction. Yes. No exoneration. That's some of what we heard today. I just want to go to another point. At the same time as we're on this path of the Mueller investigation to recognize that the Mueller investigation was prohibited from looking into the President's finances and that is what our committees of jurisdiction have been doing. As we legislate for the good of the American people, we're also investigating so that we have the grist for the mill to litigate in court and those cases we've won in lower courts. They of course appealed. We feel strongly that our position - about the position of Article 1, the legislative branch having the right to have oversight over every other branch of government. But that's important because it means we can get the information to show the American people what the obstruction of justice was further all about. I'm very, very proud of our committees, the Judiciary Committee and great Chairman Jerry Nadler, the Intelligence Committee, great Chairman Adam Schiff. We're going to hear from them now. We're also joined by Elijah Cummings, Chair of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, a committee that has winning its courts in case as well.

Today, the American people heard directly about what the special counsel investigation uncovered as to Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the President's cooperation with it and obstruction of justice. Mueller made clear that the President is not exonerated. Mueller found evidence of obstruction of justice and abuses of power by the President. He said - the report said the President could be indicted for obstruction of justice after he leaves office. Mueller found that Trump would and did benefit from Russia's help and that the campaign welcomed that help. Mueller found multiple instances where all three elements for charging criminal obstruction of justice were met trying to fire the special counsel in order to stop the investigation. Trying to have people lie and cover up for him for the same purpose, trying to limit or impede or constrict the special counsel's investigation, trying to tamper with witnesses, tamper with witnesses, cooperating with investigators. All of these were found with great evidence. President Trump went to great lengths to obstruct this special counsel's investigation. Anyone else who acted in this way if they were not the sitting President would face criminal prosecution, would face indictments. Only the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that you cannot indict a sitting President has saved or is saving the President from indictment, because all the elements of these crimes were found with substantial evidence and the people have now heard this. The President's chant of no obstruction is nonsense. His chant that he's been totally exonerated is a simple lie.",

This nation owes him an enormous debt of gratitude. So, Director Mueller, I want to thank you personally for all of your service. Today, the director outlined in powerful words, how Russia intervened massively in our election, systematically in a sweeping fashion. How during the course of that intervention, they made multiple approaches to the Trump campaign? And far from shunning that foreign involvement in our election, the Trump campaign welcomed it, made full use of it, put it into its communications and messaging strategy and then lied about it. Lied about it to cover it up, lied about it to obstruct the investigation into that very attack on our democracy. Part of what I found so powerful about his testimony today was not just when he was asked about the law but when he was asked about the ethics, the morality, the lack of patriotism of this conduct. And perhaps one of the most chilling moments I think in our committee was when he expressed the fear that this become the new normal. And of course, I think what is animating that fear of the director would certainly animates it for me is the fact even after the nightmare of the last two and a half years, the President of the United States will still not forswear receiving foreign help again. That to this point, the President still continues to call this Russian attack on our democracy a hoax. Something that Director Mueller today directly refuted that he still calls a witch hunt something that Director Mueller today directly refuted. And so, we go into this next election more vulnerable than we should be. We can't control completely what Russia does although we must do everything, we can to harden our election defenses to make sure there are paper trails, to make sure that we deter and disrupt any kind of Russian intervention. But we cannot control that completely, but we can control what we do. And Director Mueller made it clear in no uncertain terms that it's up to us whether we act ethically and patriotically, whether we refuse to be a party to a foreign attack on our democracy. And once again, I thank him for his service.",

And the way he was pushing back on the press right there, shows you how sure of himself he is that he's closed this chapter and impeachment. I believe the impeachment train has stopped dead on the tracks. And the kind of questions that the White House correspondents were asking, it's almost like they didn't even watch the hearing, how biased and baseless they were. Are you worried about being indicted when you leave office? No, he's absolutely not worried about that."

And the president was really waiting for a moment like this to button the whole thing up.

But we live in an age of cable news and clicks and social media and you can see the wave right there, right? So the wave -- and I think that's what President Trump is picking up on is, oh, my opponents feel deflated. And you heard that from Jesse, right? No, you know, no collusion, no obstruction. It's easy to forget, Trump and the Republicans didn't want these hearings. But you get the hearing and now you get into a situation where I think a lot of people are saying, you know what, we thought the movie was going to be better than the book. Huh, it turns out the book was better than the movie, especially for the Democrats. Well, you can't get away from the facts, and I think that's what the Democrats tried to show today. They laid out the case for obstruction, they laid out that Russia interfered, and as I -- you know, as you heard even at the very end, from Adam Schiff on the -- the chair --Democratic chair intelligence committee, he still thinks that there's a case to be made here. And the one thing that Mueller was clear on is Russia interfered in 2016 to help Trump, and they continue to interfere as we head toward 2020."

He answered George H.W. Bush. He was quickly corrected by one of the lawmakers that it was Ronald Reagan. Questions about -- how many of the witness interviews did you sit on?

He was not running this investigation, he was asleep at the wheel, they trotted him out because he's got such great brand, because he's served this country so honorably for so many years. But he had no clue what was going on. No clue about the hiring process. He didn't know any of the details. He was stammering and he was stumbling.

And, he had no control over his own team. He said he didn't even ask any questions when he hired his staff. They hired 14 Democrats, no Republicans, Clinton donors, Clinton lawyers, people that partied with Hillary the night she lost, they come on the team, he didn't even know about those conflicts, and when he found out about them, he didn't do anything about the conflict."

So, the more that they use these golf clubs, it keeps them from actually coming up and generating ideas that might attract voters.

You could not impeach a President for obstructing a crime that the lead investigator said, he wasn't obstructed on. And of course, you're going to fight back when you've been framed by Democrats and then investigated by only Democrats who were coming after your company, your family, your personal assets and trying to set perjury traps for you, trying to tee up impeachment and trying to set up an obstruction case against you. You're going to fight back. Yet he not only fought back, he complied. He never claimed executive privilege. He handed over thousands of documents and he won and that's what the Democrats want to impeach him for. Now, POTUS never fired Robert Mueller. He never even said, fire Robert Mueller. He merely asked his personal lawyer to go ask the acting AG, hey, can we replace Robert Mueller with someone who is not conflicted.

But just let me say quickly in response to what Jesse was saying, Jesse, this is not again a street criminal activity. You've got to understand that when Trump says to his lawyer to Don McGahn, go fire Mueller. Call me back. What are you talking about? That's on the record. That's in the report, you can read it."

This is a statute did they use against multinational companies for auditing irregularities and for shredding documents. They creatively empowered this statute to make any executive action criminal. So, and they actually brought that up. They said, Barack Obama could be charged under the over interpretation of this statute when he went on the record and said that Hillary Clinton's e-mail server was not that big of a deal and wasn't a threat to national security.

And obviously you know this was put off by week for some very, very obvious reasons. And you know Robert Mueller came out himself and forcefully said in writing and in person that he did not want to testify.

Now, you have a question. What do we do go forward, you get this big August break coming up as we come back in September, are the Democrats going to come back to this?

They're going to hold a press availability after the Mueller hearings, how they plan to proceed after the hearings took place this morning. This has been such a huge narrative for them. And you've heard so much from the Presidential candidates on this Juan. I'd ask you, what part is this now going to play in 2020. How much can Democrats still lean on this narrative."

The President likes to have his poster that said the Mueller Report took this many day, cost this much money. This, that and the other. Well we have a corresponding contradictory chart. Mueller investigation by the numbers. $40 million recovered for the U.S. government. Remember he said how much it will cost less than that. 37 people and entities charged with crimes, 25 ongoing criminal cases referred, seven convicted including five top Trump campaign officials. And then he had no collusion, no this or that. 10 instances of obstruction. Yes. No exoneration. That's some of what we heard today. I just want to go to another point. At the same time as we're on this path of the Mueller investigation to recognize that the Mueller investigation was prohibited from looking into the President's finances and that is what our committees of jurisdiction have been doing. As we legislate for the good of the American people, we're also investigating so that we have the grist for the mill to litigate in court and those cases we've won in lower courts. They of course appealed. We feel strongly that our position - about the position of Article 1, the legislative branch having the right to have oversight over every other branch of government. But that's important because it means we can get the information to show the American people what the obstruction of justice was further all about. I'm very, very proud of our committees, the Judiciary Committee and great Chairman Jerry Nadler, the Intelligence Committee, great Chairman Adam Schiff. We're going to hear from them now. We're also joined by Elijah Cummings, Chair of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, a committee that has winning its courts in case as well. So, I'm going to yield with great respect to all three of our Chairman and then we'll take some questions. First, I'll yield to distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler."

      "utterance": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today, the American people heard directly about what the special counsel investigation uncovered as to Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the President's cooperation with it and obstruction of justice. Mueller made clear that the President is not exonerated. Mueller found evidence of obstruction of justice and abuses of power by the President. He said - the report said the President could be indicted for obstruction of justice after he leaves office. Mueller found that Trump would and did benefit from Russia's help and that the campaign welcomed that help. Mueller found multiple instances where all three elements for charging criminal obstruction of justice were met trying to fire the special counsel in order to stop the investigation. Trying to have people lie and cover up for him for the same purpose, trying to limit or impede or constrict the special counsel's investigation, trying to tamper with witnesses, tamper with witnesses, cooperating with investigators. All of these were found with great evidence. President Trump went to great lengths to obstruct this special counsel's investigation. Anyone else who acted in this way if they were not the sitting President would face criminal prosecution, would face indictments. Only the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that you cannot indict a sitting President has saved or is saving the President from indictment, because all the elements of these crimes were found with substantial evidence and the people have now heard this. The President's chant of no obstruction is nonsense. His chant that he's been totally exonerated is a simple lie."

      "utterance": "First of all, I want to thank Director Mueller for a lifetime of service to the country from his days as a young Marine in Vietnam through his decades of service as a prosecutor, as the Director of the FBI and through his service as special counsel. This nation owes him an enormous debt of gratitude. So, Director Mueller, I want to thank you personally for all of your service. Today, the director outlined in powerful words, how Russia intervened massively in our election, systematically in a sweeping fashion. How during the course of that intervention, they made multiple approaches to the Trump campaign? And far from shunning that foreign involvement in our election, the Trump campaign welcomed it, made full use of it, put it into its communications and messaging strategy and then lied about it. Lied about it to cover it up, lied about it to obstruct the investigation into that very attack on our democracy. Part of what I found so powerful about his testimony today was not just when he was asked about the law but when he was asked about the ethics, the morality, the lack of patriotism of this conduct. And perhaps one of the most chilling moments I think in our committee was when he expressed the fear that this become the new normal. And of course, I think what is animating that fear of the director would certainly animates it for me is the fact even after the nightmare of the last two and a half years, the President of the United States will still not forswear receiving foreign help again. That to this point, the President still continues to call this Russian attack on our democracy a hoax. Something that Director Mueller today directly refuted that he still calls a witch hunt something that Director Mueller today directly refuted. And so, we go into this next election more vulnerable than we should be. We can't control completely what Russia does although we must do everything, we can to harden our election defenses to make sure there are paper trails, to make sure that we deter and disrupt any kind of Russian intervention. But we cannot control that completely, but we can control what we do. And Director Mueller made it clear in no uncertain terms that it's up to us whether we act ethically and patriotically, whether we refuse to be a party to a foreign attack on our democracy. And once again, I thank him for his service."

I first want to applaud Chairman Nadler who heads our Judiciary Committee and certainly our Chairman of Intelligence Committee for what they did today and their committees. What they did was paint a picture for America. One of the most chilling things that I have noticed that I witnessed is when a member of - a former member of our committee, Mr. Amash, a Republican went to a town hall meeting. And got a round of applause in a Republican district after he had said that he felt that the President should be impeached. But that wasn't a thing that got me, what really got me was when a lady at the end of the townhall meeting said, I didn't know that there was anything negative in the Mueller Report about President Trump. This says a lot. And to her credit, our speaker made it clear that we needed to paint a picture for America, so they could fully understand what is going on.
