Next year, the predictions are that we are going to have a trillion-dollar deficit.  And I can't see loading up a Republican repeal bill with all kinds of goodies, I mean, a super fund for insurance bailouts, super fund for opiate abuse. You name it. There's a super fund for about anybody that wants money in this bill now. But it's just not the right way to go. But you could fix it if we have a clean repeal and then you have a separate spending bill that, for the big- government Republicans who think spending is the answer, put it on a bill that the Democrats like, and they can work with the Democrats on the big- government aspect to it.

They now have increased it to $180 billion.  We were at $2 billion for opioid abuse. Now we're $45 billion. My understanding, from talking to people, we appropriated money last year for opioid abuse. They haven't spent what we appropriated last year. They cannot yet figure out where to spend the money. And now we're going to have a super fund.  So, I mean, this has gotten crazy.
