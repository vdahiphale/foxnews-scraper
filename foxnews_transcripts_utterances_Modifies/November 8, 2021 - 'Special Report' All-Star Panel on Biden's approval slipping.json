What are your thoughts? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": It's not just interesting, Bret. It's fascinating the way they are trying to spin this. If the American people didn't like how fast the Democratic agenda was progressing, why did they reward the party that was opposing it? That's what we saw happen last week. And the administration, the White House, Democrats in general, are trying to spin this otherwise. And it's not just Biden's approval rating falling generally across the board. It's falling with those specific groups that helped him win office in the first place -- independents, suburban voters, suburban women, and so forth. So I think this is a reality check that the Democrats have to realize is going on here. And I'm kind of fascinated that they have failed to come to grips with reality.",

The flight from the Democrats was disproportionately in the suburbs, and the idea that these home-owning, child-rearing, taxpaying voters just want more progressive candidates is not a sustainable one.\" Guy, that's pretty clear, but if you look at AOC's tweets or other members of the squad, they say the reason Terry McAuliffe lost was because he wasn't progressive enough.",

And by the way, the quote that you played from the White House deputy press secretary saying that we're confident that our policies will help the overwhelming majority of Americans, I'm paraphrasing, this poll that we were just citing from \"USA Today\" asked that question. One out of four voters agreed that they would be helped by the policy. That's in line with a recent ABC News poll. That is not a good number for them.

And, of course, he has this virtual meeting coming up with the President Xi, and he said something along the lines of he does not want conflict with China, and he also doesn't want there to be an accidental conflict with China.

And that's an indication that they see China as somewhat of a threat, a sort of grudging acknowledgment that Trump and the Trump administration was on the right track there. But I think they need to step up their game. China, we also have to remember that a lot of times with these autocracies, a lot of what we see is a reflection of what is going on internally in these countries. And right now China is worried about Taiwan independence. They are worried about energy issues in terms of working with Australia, for example, to make sure their energy needs are met in China. So this is a reflection of all of that. But at the end of the day, what we don't want is for China to perceive any sort of weakness in the U.S. And that's what concerns me. And whether that weakness is displayed in how eager we are over climate issues, how eager we are in terms of getting out of Afghanistan, how eager we are in terms of a nuclear deal with Iran, that is what we are projecting right now under the Biden administration. And China is paying attention to that. And so that's where I think the Biden administration really, really needs to be careful in its dealings with China right now. They have their own internal issues, but how they respond to those internal issues will be in part a reflection of how the Biden administration is responding to how we're projecting our might militarily and otherwise, economically and otherwise, American might worldwide.",

Then you throw on top of that the COVID origins and the cover-up and lies about that, the destruction, slowly and systematically of Hong Kong's democracy in violation of international law, the genocide against the Uyghurs, you put all of this together, and the global community is going to just say OK, let's give this big P.R. win to Chairman Xi and the CCP in 2022?

Jason, it's interesting to see the reaction from the administration, from Democrats, to the Virginia win to the narrow Republican loss in New Jersey, to the other things that we saw from the election last week and what's yet to come on this battle with the Build Back Better bill. What are your thoughts? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": It's not just interesting, Bret. It's fascinating the way they are trying to spin this. If the American people didn't like how fast the Democratic agenda was progressing, why did they reward the party that was opposing it? That's what we saw happen last week. And the administration, the White House, Democrats in general, are trying to spin this otherwise. And it's not just Biden's approval rating falling generally across the board. It's falling with those specific groups that helped him win office in the first place -- independents, suburban voters, suburban women, and so forth. So I think this is a reality check that the Democrats have to realize is going on here. And I'm kind of fascinated that they have failed to come to grips with reality."

      "utterance": "Yes. This is a \"New York Times\" editorial, \"New York Times\" editorial. It says \"Bill Clinton saved his presidency and here is how Joe Biden can, too. Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema are not outliers in the Democratic Party. They are, in fact, the very heart of the Democratic Party, given that 53 percent of Democrats classify themselves as moderates or conservative. You can't dismiss a clear electoral trend. The flight from the Democrats was disproportionately in the suburbs, and the idea that these home-owning, child-rearing, taxpaying voters just want more progressive candidates is not a sustainable one.\" Guy, that's pretty clear, but if you look at AOC's tweets or other members of the squad, they say the reason Terry McAuliffe lost was because he wasn't progressive enough."

      "utterance": "And that's the consensus among progressive Twitter broadly, which seems to be driving so much of the conversation at the elite level in our politics, including at the White House. We are seeing a dominance of progressive Twitter right now, which is not serving the administration political ends very well, I think it's safe to say. And by the way, the quote that you played from the White House deputy press secretary saying that we're confident that our policies will help the overwhelming majority of Americans, I'm paraphrasing, this poll that we were just citing from \"USA Today\" asked that question. One out of four voters agreed that they would be helped by the policy. That's in line with a recent ABC News poll. That is not a good number for them. The people are not clamoring for this Build Back Better bill, no matter how often they say they are."

We have been nothing but transparent and clear about our growing concerns over the kinds of capabilities that the Chinese military is continues to develop. We need to take this threat seriously, and platitudes from the Pentagon about this simply aren't going to get it done and aren't going to convince Xi Jinping, the leader in China, to behave differently."

And certainly they recognize full well that they have got to defeat that in any conflict they would have in the Pacific, whether it's over Taiwan or the South China Sea."

We can show those satellite images on the screen. Mockups of the aircraft carriers for exercises. And add this to the current mix of what we're looking at. You have the hypersonic missile test that caught the intelligence and the Pentagon off guard. You have aggressive flyovers of Taiwan increasing, not decreasing. And some very belligerent language coming from the Chinese. We are back with the panel. Jeff, where do you think this is on the White House alert, you know, as far as what they talk about, what they care about on the national security front?"

      "utterance": "I think it's high. And I think, Bret, that it just underscores the extent to which China and the relationship with China is sort of the underpinning all of President Biden's foreign policy. When I was -- when he was at the G-20 and I was traveling with him last week, he was asked about China. And, of course, he has this virtual meeting coming up with the President Xi, and he said something along the lines of he does not want conflict with China, and he also doesn't want there to be an accidental conflict with China. And it really is at the core of virtually all of the decisions that they are making on all sorts of things, on everything from climate change to economic policy to defense."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "They have. And that's an indication that they see China as somewhat of a threat, a sort of grudging acknowledgment that Trump and the Trump administration was on the right track there. But I think they need to step up their game. China, we also have to remember that a lot of times with these autocracies, a lot of what we see is a reflection of what is going on internally in these countries. And right now China is worried about Taiwan independence. They are worried about energy issues in terms of working with Australia, for example, to make sure their energy needs are met in China. So this is a reflection of all of that. But at the end of the day, what we don't want is for China to perceive any sort of weakness in the U.S. And that's what concerns me. And whether that weakness is displayed in how eager we are over climate issues, how eager we are in terms of getting out of Afghanistan, how eager we are in terms of a nuclear deal with Iran, that is what we are projecting right now under the Biden administration. And China is paying attention to that. And so that's where I think the Biden administration really, really needs to be careful in its dealings with China right now. They have their own internal issues, but how they respond to those internal issues will be in part a reflection of how the Biden administration is responding to how we're projecting our might militarily and otherwise, economically and otherwise, American might worldwide."

      "utterance": "It's actually astounding to me that the Olympics just seem to be just moving forward next year in communist China given the last two years. You just ticked off a whole list of the increasingly, I'd say brazen military provocations. There was also this report about antisatellite weapons being tested by the Chinese that could affect our satellites. Then you throw on top of that the COVID origins and the cover-up and lies about that, the destruction, slowly and systematically of Hong Kong's democracy in violation of international law, the genocide against the Uyghurs, you put all of this together, and the global community is going to just say OK, let's give this big P.R. win to Chairman Xi and the CCP in 2022? What message would that send the Chinese aside one of very weakness and a lack of resolve in the international community really do to do anything serious. I think that would embolden the Chinese, and I fear that's exactly what's going to happen."

It's going to be a critical meeting, and we are going to be watching it closely. As far as the Olympics is concerned, they have been saying repeatedly that the U.S. is still going to participate, and I suspect they are going to stick with that line."
