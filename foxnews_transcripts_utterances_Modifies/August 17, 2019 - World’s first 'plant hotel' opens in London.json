It's the brainchild of online plant retailer, Patch which offers its hundred room hotel services free of charge. It's a five star luxury leaf lodge and it's open to all plants. Well, except for Robert. He is a jerk to the help. So the hotel includes free food, personalized attention from an in-house wellness team and a hydration spa treatment. Simply pick a room, drop off your plants and pick them up when you get back. I love this idea because I love plants. My favorite is this one.",

Finally found something he's good at. Dana Perino couldn't do that. Shannon Bream could run out of steam after the third F-word. She wouldn't be able to go past it.
