Tonight, we now await the moment at the Capitol Rotunda where it will officially open to the public. There are thousands of people who are outside. Mourners around the country, around the world, who will ascend the steps and have been walking in to pay their respects to honor the life and the legacy of the late president who died peacefully at his home on Friday evening.  He is best described by his son, George W. Bush, the 43rd president, as a \"man of the highest character,\" and the best dad of son, or daughter, could ask for.  In moments, we talked to President Bush, Bush -- President Bush's White House chief of staff -- excuse me, John Sununu, who is standing by. But first, we go to Peter Doocy, live outside the Capitol with what to expect this evening.  And in the coming days as the nation celebrates the life of President George Herbert Walker Bush. Good evening again, Peter.",

The American have Disabilities Act, people benefit from that every single day today. And certainly, the clean-air -- extension of the Clean Air Bill, which had been stalemated for 13 years.

But carrying a message every day, it was not kind of his thing.  But he made up for it in my opinion by making not just all of us feel comfortable, the world leaders feel comfortable. He knew every world leader by name, he knew them before they were world leaders. And he called them not when there's a crisis, but when he had five minutes during a day, he used those five minutes to call world leaders, and say, \"What do you think?\" And when the President of the United States calls a world leaders a place in a third-world country.

The second thing and he stated this publicly. He fully intends to replace United States as the global leader in the world, somewhere around 2030- 2040. These are their goals and they never stated their goals publicly before. This is how serious they are. So it remains to be seen what is going to happen as a result of this.",

We've made a down payment two years of Defense increases but we needed the fence build-up similar to what Reagan did in the early 80s. Why is that? Because the devastating cuts of sequestration we've had on a defense budget, the technology gap has closed with Russia and China. And I spent a year on a commission looking at our national defense strategy and we are saying that the United States is more at risk than we've been in decades and we could struggle, struggle to win a war and could possibly lose it. And the people on this commission are not prone to be alarmist. We are not hyping the enemy here. We are we ran war games to make certain we understood what is actually happening here. So I think clearly Director Mulvaney of OMB has told a President, listen, everybody in the government should take the cut hit. Defense is only 15 percent of the budget. You don't continue to build up, the money you would save from giving defense a haircut is so small in terms of helping the deficit. It's not going to make much progress.

But I also have to note that the most significant things that we learned last Thursday when Michael Cohen pleaded guilty for the second time is not what Michael Cohen told the court and not what Bob Mueller told the court. It's what Michael Cohen told the FBI when they debriefed him for 70 hours. Now, we don't know what that was. But 70 hours of debriefing and a reduction of a sentence from a potential of 60 years if you were to charge of five years per lie, which is what the statute permits down to six months, it means he must have told him something and they must have corroborated it and they haven't tipped their hand yet as to why that is.",

And sadly, she died that Tuesday. While as we recall it was a long funeral process and he had to take that procession going from Houston all the way up to Texas A&M for the burial. Then, come all the way back. And then he got ill. But once he got up to Maine he got out of that house and get away from everything he had five great months in Maine. I talked to him on his birthday June 12th. I talked to Barbara and George every year, her on the 8th, him on the 12th. In a sidebar, I hear Barbara one year she said, Digger, for four days of our lives together, we are the same age for four days because then on the 12th I'm married to this old man. Vintage Barbara. But anyhow, I called him on his birthday, I was over in France with a friend of mine who he knew Basil Sellers, and he was a great. He sounded good because he's fishing, he's out on his boat and he's just distracted from what he had with his relationship with Barbara. But once he came back in October, and being in that house where she died, and I talked to him last Thursday or a week ago, Thanksgiving, and he sounded OK. He was over in Neil's house for Thanksgiving dinner. He came home and I got him at the time where we could just talk for a couple minutes. He sounded OK. But then of course as we well know, and as I said to him as I was hanging up, George, I will call you. Of course, he said, Digger, you've always been good to me. And I said no, you've been good to me, I'll call you Christmas. And then of course as we saw, he passed. But my relationship, as we know, I've seen him as my father-son in the business, people are together 50, 60 or 70 years as they were, when one dies within the year, the other one passes.

He, and certainly, his budget agreement which was very controversial. But that budget agreement produced the only surpluses that this country has had in decades. And so, what was a controversial piece of legislation, one in which the Democrats forced them to pay the ransom of accepting taxes turned out to be an extremely important piece of legislation for the financial stability of the country. The American have Disabilities Act, people benefit from that every single day today. And certainly, the clean-air -- extension of the Clean Air Bill, which had been stalemated for 13 years.

And the president lost by I think, 4-3/4 to two-thirds or three-quarters of Perot's votes should have been Bush's.

And his slogan in that campaign is \"A President you don't have to train.\" You know his background, et cetera. Very impressive. He was wonderfully impressive. My wife is waiting down the car for us. We were running late a little bit in the Ritz Hotel in Boston. And then, president insisted upon coming down to the car and talking to my wife for a while before he let us leave because he cared. He knows my kid's names, he knows where they going to school. My oldest daughter a China expert, and when she went to the Bush school, he gave her a scroll given to him by the president of China. It's the reason for war, and a scroll, very valuable. And because he loved her and he wanted her to know he cared that she was she turned on Harvard to go to his school. But everybody knows him. He knows a kid you go with him end up in the White House. He goes the garden, the garden is known. But he knows their names, he knows the kid's names. The personal side to Bush that makes him extraordinary, he is something that most politicians that I know don't have, lots of real friends. Not political buddies, but lots of real friends."

Because he wasn't always great at by his own admission at being the great communicator, the Reagan style great communicator. And perhaps, what you're talking about is part of it. Because he was just very real, very authentic, and maybe not as comfortable in that role. He gave that famous speech where he said, \"I am that man.\" When he was stepping up and saying, \"I'm ready, I want to be President of the United States. I want to be number one.\" Thoughts on that, Ron."

But, when it counted, he could step up. The Commission speech was a spectacular speech. When the Berlin Wall fell, unbelievable speech. So it -- on important days, he could step up. But carrying a message every day, it was not kind of his thing. But he made up for it in my opinion by making not just all of us feel comfortable, the world leaders feel comfortable. He knew every world leader by name, he knew them before they were world leaders. And he called them not when there's a crisis, but when he had five minutes during a day, he used those five minutes to call world leaders, and say, \"What do you think?\" And when the President of the United States calls a world leaders a place in a third-world country.

I think this is more about delaying the inevitable as much as they possibly can, wait out this president that they can. I know for a fact that under President Xi, he has made a decision to dominate and control the Indo-Pacific region, an area where we used to have significant influence and he's moving very strongly to do that, economic warfare, intimidation, coercion, and some militarization on the vehicles. The second thing and he stated this publicly. He fully intends to replace United States as the global leader in the world, somewhere around 2030- 2040. These are their goals and they never stated their goals publicly before. This is how serious they are. So it remains to be seen what is going to happen as a result of this."

When we realized that everybody piled on. Let's help them. Let's get in there with our business investment and here's the bet we were making that following that economic reform, that political reform would follow and they would become something of a democracy. Wrong. What has followed is more authoritarianism and they're very geopolitically ambitious and economic warfare is another vehicle. So the President on shore has a different view before he passed away of what China is doing in the world and what he had been. And that was pretty much the universal view at the time."

You know, obviously, the President has said he wants to make cuts in a lot of areas and defense is apparently part of that plan, the five percent across-the- board agency cuts. It is -- do the President is committed to that or do you think there is an opening do perhaps leave defense off that list given all of the hard work that's been done."

      "utterance": "I think he's open to discuss it and that's going to take place. I know that Senator Jim Inhofe and Congressman Mac Thornberry would have a discussion with him on this very subject tomorrow. Here's the issue, Martha. We've made a down payment two years of Defense increases but we needed the fence build-up similar to what Reagan did in the early 80s. Why is that? Because the devastating cuts of sequestration we've had on a defense budget, the technology gap has closed with Russia and China. And I spent a year on a commission looking at our national defense strategy and we are saying that the United States is more at risk than we've been in decades and we could struggle, struggle to win a war and could possibly lose it. And the people on this commission are not prone to be alarmist. We are not hyping the enemy here. We are we ran war games to make certain we understood what is actually happening here. So I think clearly Director Mulvaney of OMB has told a President, listen, everybody in the government should take the cut hit. Defense is only 15 percent of the budget. You don't continue to build up, the money you would save from giving defense a haircut is so small in terms of helping the deficit. It's not going to make much progress. What you've got to make certain to do as president United States is provide the resources so the American people are secure and safe. That's the number one job."

      "utterance": "So, this is basically the case as they lay it out with regard to Michael Cohen. And it says, Mueller mentions that Cohen tried to e-mail Russian President Vladimir Putin's office on January 14, 2016, and again, in the middle of that month, but Mueller who personally sign the document admitted the fact that Cohen did not have any direct points of contact at the Kremlin and had resorted to sending e-mails to the general press mailbox. What do you make of that? And you know, the fact it basically said he had reached out to the Kremlin but didn't add that he had actually not a single contact there and had to go through this generic press mailbox?"

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "So, I have two observations. One is that Cohen obviously manifested a serious amount of incompetence and for some reason Bob Mueller has chosen to reveal that. I mean, trying to e-mail the president of Russia about a billion-dollar land deal and using a public e-mail box is really absurd. But I also have to note that the most significant things that we learned last Thursday when Michael Cohen pleaded guilty for the second time is not what Michael Cohen told the court and not what Bob Mueller told the court. It's what Michael Cohen told the FBI when they debriefed him for 70 hours. Now, we don't know what that was. But 70 hours of debriefing and a reduction of a sentence from a potential of 60 years if you were to charge of five years per lie, which is what the statute permits down to six months, it means he must have told him something and they must have corroborated it and they haven't tipped their hand yet as to why that is."

And I see potentially some of that at work in the story and this investigation so we'll see how that turns out in the end. I do want to ask you because I heard you talk about this earlier today, you felt that one of the significant things to remember about President George H.W. Bush were his nominations to the Supreme Court and a lasting impact of Clarence Thomas as a pick. Quick thought on that for me, judge."

      "utterance": "The impact of Justice Thomas is truly beyond President Bush president Bush's wild imaginings for three reasonings. One, after 27 years, he is now regarded as having authored truly brilliant opinions on shrinking congressional overreach, stopping the Congress from regulating areas of the Constitution that it doesn't authorize. Second, even his adversaries, even those who fought fiercely to prevent them from getting on the court, have finally recognized these opinions. How do I know this? They show up in casebooks that law students study, and those case books are written by a very, very liberal faculty members. Third, Justice Thomas holds the record for his own law clerks themselves becoming federal judges and high-ranking government administrators. These are things that George Bush could have never imagined. Right now, he's the senior justice of the Supreme Court, one to whom the others look."

My next guest Digger Phelps best known for his legendary career at the university where he coaches men's basketball for 20 years. He's also shared a deep bond with President George H.W. Bush. Their relationship born from a chance encounter in a golf tournament and developed into a deep friendship of more than four decades. Here now, former Notre Dame basketball coach, Digger Phelps. Digger, welcome, great to have you here this evening, sir. You know, I want to start with something about, you just mentioned to me before we came on, you said its undertakers and I want to talk about what happens when people were so close and so loving as this relationship was between Barbara Bush and President Bush. And what you witnessed over the last year."

      "utterance": "Well, going back to when they obviously for 73 years have been together, when Barbara got in sick last April and she was in the hospital, she came home that Sunday on April 15 and I called George on Monday the 16th and said to him, George, I will go to the grotto and light a candle for Barbara. And sadly, she died that Tuesday. While as we recall it was a long funeral process and he had to take that procession going from Houston all the way up to Texas A&M for the burial. Then, come all the way back. And then he got ill. But once he got up to Maine he got out of that house and get away from everything he had five great months in Maine. I talked to him on his birthday June 12th. I talked to Barbara and George every year, her on the 8th, him on the 12th. In a sidebar, I hear Barbara one year she said, Digger, for four days of our lives together, we are the same age for four days because then on the 12th I'm married to this old man. Vintage Barbara. But anyhow, I called him on his birthday, I was over in France with a friend of mine who he knew Basil Sellers, and he was a great. He sounded good because he's fishing, he's out on his boat and he's just distracted from what he had with his relationship with Barbara. But once he came back in October, and being in that house where she died, and I talked to him last Thursday or a week ago, Thanksgiving, and he sounded OK. He was over in Neil's house for Thanksgiving dinner. He came home and I got him at the time where we could just talk for a couple minutes. He sounded OK. But then of course as we well know, and as I said to him as I was hanging up, George, I will call you. Of course, he said, Digger, you've always been good to me. And I said no, you've been good to me, I'll call you Christmas. And then of course as we saw, he passed. But my relationship, as we know, I've seen him as my father-son in the business, people are together 50, 60 or 70 years as they were, when one dies within the year, the other one passes. And here it is some seven months later and he passed."

    {
      "speaker": "PHELPS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, that was right after 9/11. And we stayed in touch about 9/11. And yet, as we all know, the Texas A&M Notre Dame game at College Station was about two weeks after that and he invited me down. I went back and Lech Walesa was there from Poland. And he gave a great talk the night before the game about solidarity and what they went through in their country as they get rid of, obviously the communist dictatorship. And then of course, with Osama Bin Laden, and knowing what went with 9/11 this became a real crisis which obviously ended under Obama's tenure, but going back to G.W. and everybody else involved, it was a 10-year program to end that life of Osama Bin Laden. But he knew with solidarity, and some 3,000 people listened to Lech Walesa and what they went through in Poland. And here we are in the United States. And that's how he was as not just the president but more importantly as a person. He can relate to anybody. He had many great friends; Barbara and he were the best of everybody's life and I was just blessed to be part of them and I'll miss them all."
