But the point being is that he's a gaffe machine, and he's always been a gaffe machine. But he was making -- the point he was trying to make wasn't a gaffe, which is that we should be working across the aisle with people who we disagree with. He wasn't arguing for segregation. He was arguing for civility. That, I disagree with you, Mara, is a very controversial position in the Democratic Party today. Before this happened, he got slammed for saying that Mike Pence was a decent guy. Hold on. And he had to apologize for it. Then he got slammed for saying we should have middle ground on climate change, and he had to apologize for that."

And this is a big problem for Joe Biden. Let's not underestimate this. His lead in our Real Clear Politics average right now is 17 points. His lead among African- American voters is 35 points. This is a core constituency for Biden. To the extent that this causes erosion among that group to other candidates, it's going to hurt him in a big way."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",

      "utterance": "And the fact is the progressives are driving a lot of the narrative on Twitter and other places, right. And Joe Biden may never get to the vote the way this thing is going if he continues to make gaffes. I think he's going to have to apologize for this. He's going to try and have to put it behind him. Absolutely."

And he was forced to capitulated on a 40-year position that is a majoritarian position in the American public but is unacceptable in the Democratic Party today. The Democratic Party as defined by the candidates who are running for the Democratic nomination is not for compromise, is not for reaching across the aisle. They don't want to sit down. It's not just they are against Donald Trump. They are against working with Republicans. They want a Green New Deal. They want Medicare for all."

There are so many ways and different people that are going to show up to vote now. The way turnout now works and abilities that we have to turn out voters, the poling can't understand that. That's why it was so wrong in 2016. It was 100 percent wrong. Nobody got it right."

But that's more than the first eight totals as you see there, Biden, O'Rourke, Sanders. It's a big campaign chest, Mara, and it's going to make a big difference."

He has hundreds of million dollars and a huge head start to develop this big social media presence, to test out all sorts of message and how to micro-target them to the right Facebook group. Any incumbent would have a tremendous advantage."

This came out this week. This Quinnipiac poll is the same Quinnipiac that looked at Florida for the governor's race where they had Andrew Gillum over Ron DeSantis by seven on election day, right before election day. Obviously, DeSantis went on to win. He went on to win slightly, but he went on to win. We have to be careful with these head-to-head polls, Tom."

      "utterance": "We absolutely have to be careful with head-to-head polls, certainly national polls and general election polls and even the state polls at this point in the race, because part of this is it comes down to a binary choice. And the candidates have not been defined, particularly on the Democratic side. I disagree with Brad Parscale on the idea that Trump is going to win this landslide. We are in an evenly divided country. We have been for a long time. It is coming down to the same five or seven states that it was in 2016. I think it's going to be close, but by no means is Trump out of this, and by no means is it decided right now."
