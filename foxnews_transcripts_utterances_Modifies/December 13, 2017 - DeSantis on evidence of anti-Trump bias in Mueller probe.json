      "sentences": "All right. Welcome, everybody to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. Last night, we told you about some highly disturbing text messages about President Trump sent by the lead FBI investigator on the Mueller probe. Now, we have our hands on more of this guy's text. They are even more troubling than we originally thought. More details in just a moment.  Also, tonight, more fallout from the Alabama special election. Beware, though, of the false conclusions being pedaled about marking the end of Trump's agenda, Trump's political agenda RIP. It's all bull. The real reasons to be learned from the Alabama Senate race are coming up in the ANGLE. You don't want to miss that.  And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said the president is bullying her. What?  Plus, I will go toe to toe with the one of the Republican lawmakers who is pushing for a sort of immigration amnesty when it comes to the DACA kids. But first, our top story, the dramatic testimony today of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein before the House Judiciary Committee. Now, Mr. Rosenstein is the man who appointed Bob Mueller as special counsel to lead the Russia probe and today, he doggedly defended his choice, not really surprising.  But even as these alarming pieces of evidences are emerging about the rank anti-Trump bias in the investigation. Now we told you about some of it last night when we reported on the text between FBI Agent Peter Strzok and his gal-pal and colleague, Lisa Page. She also works at the FBI. So, in the text, Page called then-Candidate Trump a, quote, \"Loathsome human being while Strzok referred to the future president as, quote, \"an idiot.\" But bear in mind, Strzok is the guy who led the Hillary Clinton e- mail server investigation so I'm sure he was really tough on that.  He interviewed Hillary in the one pre-4th of July interview she did. He interviewed Huma Abadin and later, he was involved in the Russia probe. The guy is like Selig, he's everywhere, but there's more.   On August 15th of last year, Strzok texted Page, \"There is no way Trump gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40.\" My friends, it's one thing to have a political opinion. It's quite another thing for members of America's top law enforcement agency to discuss ways to prevent Donald Trump from being elected president. Now we should note here that Strzok was removed from the Mueller probe after FBI officials became aware of these texts. But I say there must be more to the story and today, Republicans demanded real answers from Rosenstein.",

Now, he sees in the face of these text messages, we have the lead agent on Hillary who exonerated her, and then the lead agent on the Russia case saying, yes, maybe he doesn't get elected. We are talking in McCabe's office, who the deputy director of the FBI.  This is in the middle of a campaign where we can't, the FBI, take that risk. We need an insurance policy to prevent Trump from getting elected. This is one thing to have a bias and an appearance of impropriety.

Their job is to enforce the law.  Now, I think if there is a more innocent explanation of this, I imagine Mr. Srzok will with a chance to try and provide it.

Now, I will say this about Bob Mueller. I never worked with Mueller. I've talked to many people about Mueller. I have many friends who worked for him. I have friends who worked with him and friends who worked over him. Whether they like him or don't like him, every single one of them defined him as a very honorable man.   But, he is tone deaf. He was naive here in the team he assembled. One thing people forget about Strzok. This was a mistake Mueller made.

Blaming the president and conservative populism and blaming Steve Bannon or Mitch McConnell for the fall of Roy Moore. The truth is the race had zero to do with substance and everything to do with salacious allegations in a deeply flawed candidate and for those trying to use Moore's defeat to damn conservative populism, remember the populist issues that Trump won on were literally -- I don't think -- no time when I peeked in on the election that did I hear any of them discussed.  Not immigration, trade, tax cuts, deregulatory efforts, none of those things were ever really debated in the Alabama race. Now, a man that many believed could run against Doug Jones in 2020 said this on my radio show today. REP. GARY PALMER, R-ALA. (via telephone): There was no policy discussed in in election. There was no substance to this. There was no discussion of Trump's policies or Roy Moore's policies. They made sure Doug Jones' policies were not discussed. It was all about scandal.",

      "sentences": "This was all about the allegations against Moore and of course, his missteps. The volatile nature of this special election in Alabama was a joke from its inception. Now, Luther Strange could have stayed in the seat until 2018. But once that special election was announced by the governor, Mitch McConnell and his pack rushed in and they protected or tried to protect Strange rather than just let the people duke it out and sort it out, probably a better path. Consultants for Congressman Mo Brooks were reportedly warned that they should not work against Luther Strange. Reports are they were actually threatened. Then the president's involvement, first, the president put his right leg in for Strange and then took it out and put in for Moore.  But still the attempts to pin this -- I think this whole lost on Trump or his agenda certainly are just ridiculous. It's predictable. Alabama remains Trump country. People love Trump down in Alabama. The voters there are some of the most vocal on the issues that got Trump elected. Immigration enforcement, lower taxes, second Amendment Rights, and the bottom line is they just didn't like Roy Moore. The man, by the way, who lost the governorship there twice, and including coming in fourth against Robert Bentley, who was not exactly, yk, Ronald Reagan in his personality or approach. Look, as Matt Drudge tweeted last night, \"Just too much crazy in nerve racking times. There is a limit.\" I agree with him. I think the pinball machine hit tilt and Alabamans just wanted the game to end, wanted it over. And also, Trump didn't win by being like Roy Moore. Remember, thinking back on the election. You look at Roy Moore and Trump and their approach, they are not similar. Trump was all about making America great again. Roy Moore was about making Alabama grimace again. Now, here's a lesson for Republicans. You can't fight everyone at once. You can't take on the Democrats, the media, the entertainment industry and the establishment of your party unless your candidate has the money and the bravado and the media savvy to win. That's what Trump did, but it's a rare skillset. How many people have it? And that kind of hand to hand political combat demands candidates, who are fearless, and they are unafraid to do interviews a month before an election, and I don't with a 12-year-old reporter. The other takeaway, by the way, is the critical need for Republicans to engage minority voters especially in parts of the country that are traditionally hostile to the brand of the GOP.  Think about it, in Alabama, 30 percent of the electorate were black voters surpassing turnout for Obama and Hillary. So, the GOP needs to reach out to this community. Keep doing those campaign style events. Because remember when Trump went to the black church in Detroit during the general election. They may not have liked him, but I'm telling you, you show up and talk to voters and they end up respecting you more. They know you cared just to show up to hear their concerns. Republicans have to do this across the country. Today, at the White House, by the way, the president announced a black pastor to talk about his tax plan and what can it do for the black community. This was good.",

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome, everybody to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. Last night, we told you about some highly disturbing text messages about President Trump sent by the lead FBI investigator on the Mueller probe. Now, we have our hands on more of this guy's text. They are even more troubling than we originally thought. More details in just a moment. Also, tonight, more fallout from the Alabama special election. Beware, though, of the false conclusions being pedaled about marking the end of Trump's agenda, Trump's political agenda RIP. It's all bull. The real reasons to be learned from the Alabama Senate race are coming up in the ANGLE. You don't want to miss that. And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said the president is bullying her. What? Plus, I will go toe to toe with the one of the Republican lawmakers who is pushing for a sort of immigration amnesty when it comes to the DACA kids. But first, our top story, the dramatic testimony today of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein before the House Judiciary Committee. Now, Mr. Rosenstein is the man who appointed Bob Mueller as special counsel to lead the Russia probe and today, he doggedly defended his choice, not really surprising. But even as these alarming pieces of evidences are emerging about the rank anti-Trump bias in the investigation. Now we told you about some of it last night when we reported on the text between FBI Agent Peter Strzok and his gal-pal and colleague, Lisa Page. She also works at the FBI. So, in the text, Page called then-Candidate Trump a, quote, \"Loathsome human being while Strzok referred to the future president as, quote, \"an idiot.\" But bear in mind, Strzok is the guy who led the Hillary Clinton e- mail server investigation so I'm sure he was really tough on that. He interviewed Hillary in the one pre-4th of July interview she did. He interviewed Huma Abadin and later, he was involved in the Russia probe. The guy is like Selig, he's everywhere, but there's more. On August 15th of last year, Strzok texted Page, \"There is no way Trump gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40.\" My friends, it's one thing to have a political opinion. It's quite another thing for members of America's top law enforcement agency to discuss ways to prevent Donald Trump from being elected president. Now we should note here that Strzok was removed from the Mueller probe after FBI officials became aware of these texts. But I say there must be more to the story and today, Republicans demanded real answers from Rosenstein."

Now, he sees in the face of these text messages, we have the lead agent on Hillary who exonerated her, and then the lead agent on the Russia case saying, yes, maybe he doesn't get elected. We are talking in McCabe's office, who the deputy director of the FBI. This is in the middle of a campaign where we can't, the FBI, take that risk. We need an insurance policy to prevent Trump from getting elected. This is one thing to have a bias and an appearance of impropriety.

That I think a reasonable reading of that is that these people viewed their role as protecting America from the consequences of its political decisions. That's not their job. Their job is to enforce the law. Now, I think if there is a more innocent explanation of this, I imagine Mr. Srzok will with a chance to try and provide it. I think that Mr. Desantis may know better, but I would expect a number of subpoenas coming out of the House Judiciary Committee to talk to all of these people we have seen mentioned showing their anti-Trump bias and their activism on behalf of the Democrats.

Now, I will say this about Bob Mueller. I never worked with Mueller. I've talked to many people about Mueller. I have many friends who worked for him. I have friends who worked with him and friends who worked over him. Whether they like him or don't like him, every single one of them defined him as a very honorable man. But, he is tone deaf. He was naive here in the team he assembled. One thing people forget about Strzok. This was a mistake Mueller made. Strzok even before these texts were found never should have been assigned to the Trump investigation. The agent who was a top agent in the Hillary e-mail investigation never should have been assigned in the first place for that."

Now Strzok's emails are problematic. I am a former prosecutor. I got to tell you, I've been involved on politically sensitive investigations, both look at what Mueller did. Mueller addressed it.

The truth is the race had zero to do with substance and everything to do with salacious allegations in a deeply flawed candidate and for those trying to use Moore's defeat to damn conservative populism, remember the populist issues that Trump won on were literally -- I don't think -- no time when I peeked in on the election that did I hear any of them discussed. Not immigration, trade, tax cuts, deregulatory efforts, none of those things were ever really debated in the Alabama race.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This was all about the allegations against Moore and of course, his missteps. The volatile nature of this special election in Alabama was a joke from its inception. Now, Luther Strange could have stayed in the seat until 2018. But once that special election was announced by the governor, Mitch McConnell and his pack rushed in and they protected or tried to protect Strange rather than just let the people duke it out and sort it out, probably a better path. Consultants for Congressman Mo Brooks were reportedly warned that they should not work against Luther Strange. Reports are they were actually threatened. Then the president's involvement, first, the president put his right leg in for Strange and then took it out and put in for Moore. But still the attempts to pin this -- I think this whole lost on Trump or his agenda certainly are just ridiculous. It's predictable. Alabama remains Trump country. People love Trump down in Alabama. The voters there are some of the most vocal on the issues that got Trump elected. Immigration enforcement, lower taxes, second Amendment Rights, and the bottom line is they just didn't like Roy Moore. The man, by the way, who lost the governorship there twice, and including coming in fourth against Robert Bentley, who was not exactly, yk, Ronald Reagan in his personality or approach. Look, as Matt Drudge tweeted last night, \"Just too much crazy in nerve racking times. There is a limit.\" I agree with him. I think the pinball machine hit tilt and Alabamans just wanted the game to end, wanted it over. And also, Trump didn't win by being like Roy Moore. Remember, thinking back on the election. You look at Roy Moore and Trump and their approach, they are not similar. Trump was all about making America great again. Roy Moore was about making Alabama grimace again. Now, here's a lesson for Republicans. You can't fight everyone at once. You can't take on the Democrats, the media, the entertainment industry and the establishment of your party unless your candidate has the money and the bravado and the media savvy to win. That's what Trump did, but it's a rare skillset. How many people have it? And that kind of hand to hand political combat demands candidates, who are fearless, and they are unafraid to do interviews a month before an election, and I don't with a 12-year-old reporter. The other takeaway, by the way, is the critical need for Republicans to engage minority voters especially in parts of the country that are traditionally hostile to the brand of the GOP. Think about it, in Alabama, 30 percent of the electorate were black voters surpassing turnout for Obama and Hillary. So, the GOP needs to reach out to this community. Keep doing those campaign style events. Because remember when Trump went to the black church in Detroit during the general election. They may not have liked him, but I'm telling you, you show up and talk to voters and they end up respecting you more. They know you cared just to show up to hear their concerns. Republicans have to do this across the country. Today, at the White House, by the way, the president announced a black pastor to talk about his tax plan and what can it do for the black community. This was good."

The Republican Party is in the race and then pull out and then go back in the race. Look, it's very difficult when you have a candidate who doesn't have support from everybody.

They are losing on issue after issue. So they go back to the same old line that they lost the election on in October which is the old accusers. And I think people are getting weary of it.

She stands hand in hand with the Clinton family, the Clinton crime syndicate, in numerous instances, Hillary Clinton is her mentor. She threw Hillary Clinton and Bill under the bus in the last couple of months. Al Franken was her colleague. She has thrown him under the bus expeditiously. And Donald Trump is the person who has given three or four campaign contributions. He gave her contributions as a member of the Congress running for her second race, and a couple of times in her special election to become a United States senator.

You wrote a letter to Paul Ryan and 34 of your fellow congressmen signed it. And in this letter you say it's an important agenda item now to give these 800,000 people brought here as young people amnesty.

And my personal position, now I can't speak for everybody that's on the letter because there's different opinions and stuff like that and where they want to be with this. But for me personally I am with the president. I think what President Obama did was illegal. I think it's under Congressional purview. And him pushing it down there, I agree with that 100 percent.

So if you want to point the finger, Jimmy, point it at the Democrats. And by the way, Kimmel is a millionaire who doesn't need CHIP or any other program to provide health care for his beautiful child.
