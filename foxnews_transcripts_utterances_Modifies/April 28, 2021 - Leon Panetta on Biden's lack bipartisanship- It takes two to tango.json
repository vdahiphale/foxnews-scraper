It's a $1.8 trillion plan to help America's kids and families, we're told. But that is on top of spending that has already been building under this president, including a $2.25 trillion infrastructure package, what could amount to, when all is said and done, about $2 trillion already spent on COVID relief.  We're going to get into the details of all of that, fair and balanced, with John Barrasso, the Republican senator from Wyoming, and Leon Panetta, Bill Clinton's chief of staff, and whether we are building up a lot of debt very, very quickly.  Now, of course, back in the -- in the Bill Clinton years, we started seeing those deficits being pared down and turned into surpluses. This president is very confident that a lot of these initiatives will lead to economic booms that might have the same effect. We shall see.  Right now, we're going to go to Peter Doocy at the White House with what we can expect in a bit of a different setting tonight, right?",

It's a trillion dollars in investments, then $800 billion in tax cuts for American families, $200 billion for universal preschool, $109 billion for two years of free community college, and then $225 billion for free childcare.

Look, when you tax businesses, that ricochets back on the people that live and spend money in our country. So, they're going to raise taxes on individuals, on businesses, on investments, on -- on death, on inheritance, all of those things. Everyone will ultimately pay. And that will hurt the economy.  What we know is that, when we cut taxes in 2017, more people worked, higher wages, lower unemployment, the things that you would want in a growing economy. When you raise taxes, it goes the other way. So, I have a lot of concerns about what I'm expecting to hear tonight, which is Joe Biden giving away the store.",

Act two is his so-called infrastructure, where less than 6 percent of the money goes for roads and bridges. And then act three is what we're going to hear tonight, I believe, in terms of free everything, free college, free childcare, you name it. That's so far the three-act play for Joe Biden.

But that is the backdrop for my next guest. Leon Panetta is the former White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton. And, if you think about it, that tech boom, the Internet boom, everything associated with it, it started gaining traction in the Clinton years. And that approach, along with zeroing in on spending, government spending, helped get deficits turning into surpluses, and for the first time in American history, the debt slowly, but surely and steadily wiped away.  That was then. A number of Democrats who agreed with President Biden's approach are saying the same thing will happen now. Leon Panetta kind enough to join us. Leon, good to see you. When you look at these tech numbers, and you think of that boom that really -- the technology boom that started in the '90s and into the early 2000s, do you think that your colleagues in the Democratic Party have it right, that a boom, whether it's done by government spending here, which might be a leap, will be able to wipe out a lot of these deficits, maybe take a stab at the debt?

The reason Bill Clinton was able to do what he did was because we put together a very tough budget that had about $500 billion in deficit reduction, $250 billion in spending savings, $250 billion in revenues.  And it complemented actually what George Bush did with his budget. And for that reason, those two budgets, we were able to ultimately balance the federal budget and create a surplus for this country.

We are learning more about the extent to which Governor Andrew Cuomo's aides tried to reportedly cover up the true number of COVID-19 deaths in the state's nursing homes, The New York Times reporting that, since early spring, earlier than we -- than what was reported before, the aides tried to purposely hide this data. Reportedly, Cuomo's senior aides prevented the state's health department from publishing a scientific paper which incorporated the true nursing home death toll data. An audit of the death numbers was not made public for months. And two Health Department letters drafted for state lawmakers on the subject were never sent. Now, Governor Cuomo's administration is reportedly under investigation by the FBI and the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, looking at whether Cuomo's team purposely covered up the true death toll data in nursing homes. Remember, this was requested by the Department of Justice twice last year. It has already been reported that Cuomo's top aides omitted more than 3,000 nursing home COVID-19 deaths from a July Department of Health report, saying they could not verify how many residents died at hospitals, despite the fact that we know they were collecting all of this data since last April. An attorney representing Cuomo's office told The Times this: \"The whole brouhaha here is overblown, to the point where there are cynical suggestions offered for the plain and simple truth that the chamber wanted only to release accurate information that they believed was totally unassailable.\" Now, Governor Cuomo's administration, Neil, is not only accused of purposely hiding this information, but they're accused of doing so because they feared of political consequences. Remember, there is also the accusation that this was purposely done because Governor Cuomo was publishing a book last year, and that this report that came out last July was timed at the exact moment that he was negotiating an at least $4 million book deal for that memoir on leadership skills -- Neil.",

Be that as it may, it's -- this is still pretty murky. If you -- if you're going to guess, you read The New York Times, we have been following this, it's Rudy's ties to the Ukraine, whether he was lobbying for these business interests overseas with the president and whether he broke laws doing that. I will say this. I spent some time talking -- speaking with Rudy's people who were friends with Rudy. If he stepped out of the line on something like this, something that he should know, that he's really slipping, there's something wrong here, because this is something that Rudy, as a longtime lawyer, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District, the premier law enforcement office in the country, which is probably doing the investigation into him right now, which is somewhat unprecedented. I don't think I have ever heard of a former U.S. attorney being investigated by the office he once ran. He would really have to -- he really screwed up here. But, again, I will say this, Neil. As in so many of these lobbying cases, it's murky about whether someone is officially lobbying and whether that is actionable in terms of a crime. Clearly, they're looking at -- for his e- mails to see what he was thinking about, state of mind, intent to do something illegal, whether he knew was illegal when he did it. That's a huge thing. Sometimes, people step over the line because they don't know. And we should also point out, Neil, that this is an investigation. It doesn't -- it doesn't -- he's not guilty of anything.

But, to your point about the trillions upon trillions of dollars, the infrastructure package that he proposed for about $2 trillion a few weeks ago has not been debated yet in the Congress. They were still trying to figure out what infrastructure actually means or what qualifies as infrastructure. But they are now moving forward with about $1.8 trillion in new spending proposals. It's a combination of spending proposals and tax relief for American families.

It's a $1.8 trillion plan to help America's kids and families, we're told. But that is on top of spending that has already been building under this president, including a $2.25 trillion infrastructure package, what could amount to, when all is said and done, about $2 trillion already spent on COVID relief. We're going to get into the details of all of that, fair and balanced, with John Barrasso, the Republican senator from Wyoming, and Leon Panetta, Bill Clinton's chief of staff, and whether we are building up a lot of debt very, very quickly. Now, of course, back in the -- in the Bill Clinton years, we started seeing those deficits being pared down and turned into surpluses. This president is very confident that a lot of these initiatives will lead to economic booms that might have the same effect. We shall see. Right now, we're going to go to Peter Doocy at the White House with what we can expect in a bit of a different setting tonight, right?"

So, we have got a graphic to show you how it breaks down. It's a trillion dollars in investments, then $800 billion in tax cuts for American families, $200 billion for universal preschool, $109 billion for two years of free community college, and then $225 billion for free childcare.

That led to $3 trillion in revenue lost, because the economy tanked because of their policy agenda. This administration is basically the next one from the Biden administration -- from the Obama administration.

But we got lambasted for suggesting that we could be anywhere near 3 percent growth.

I'm wondering if that is sending a signal to Democrats that, the more they do this, the better the response, in other words, that a majority of Americans like this spending, I guess, as long as they don't have to pay for it.

And I think now we're faced with the reality where the Biden administration can just put forward proposal after proposal that rounds to $2 trillion, and it's completely normal. But I think the American people are going to be on to it. I don't think they want a transformed federal government that takes over all of their lives and takes on the responsibility to have universal pre-K and continue to dump money into education, when we have already have sizable education spending in this country. So I do think it will lead to an awakening of the American people. But I think that we're seeing an ongoing legislating and proposing in the pandemic era where trillion dollars is normal."

Senator, I have a pretty good idea where you are on all of this spending, because, even through the Trump years, you were worried about deficits building and debt building. And it's still building. But a majority of Americans favor and like what they're seeing here, I'm not saying by overwhelming margins. But are you worried that, whatever your own doubts, it does seem to be resonating with the American people? They like it, maybe, as I was just raising with the former OMB director, because they don't have to pay for it. What do you think?"

And he doesn't have any of the superpowers that he would like to have. His powers are in basically destroying jobs and I believe damaging the economy. The impact of the average family in this country, it's $46,000 for every household. I mean, that is a heavy weight on the economy. We're talking about more money in six months of Joe Biden's presidency than all that we spent to win World War II. So, we're talking about a massive amount of red ink."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that what we're seeing, with this amount of red ink, that there's going to have to be tax increases if Joe Biden is going to be able to deal with all of this. You're talking about taxes that everyone is going to have to pay, not just some higher income or businesses. Look, when you tax businesses, that ricochets back on the people that live and spend money in our country. So, they're going to raise taxes on individuals, on businesses, on investments, on -- on death, on inheritance, all of those things. Everyone will ultimately pay. And that will hurt the economy. What we know is that, when we cut taxes in 2017, more people worked, higher wages, lower unemployment, the things that you would want in a growing economy. When you raise taxes, it goes the other way. So, I have a lot of concerns about what I'm expecting to hear tonight, which is Joe Biden giving away the store."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you have any concerns right now, Senator, that these initiatives -- like infrastructure, for example, Republicans have come up with a plan that I think is about a quarter to a third of what the president's is. But it would not involve tax increases. I believe user fees, tolls, that sort of thing. How likely is that? Is that the best -- when Democrats ask, is that the best Republicans are countering, is that the best alternative that Republicans are coming up with to challenge what the president wants to do on infrastructure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's core infrastructure. It's roads and bridges. It's the sorts of things that most Americans think of when they think of infrastructure. Remember, the president's proposal, which is basically act two of the spending -- act one was the so-called coronavirus relief, which -- where very little went for health care. Act two is his so-called infrastructure, where less than 6 percent of the money goes for roads and bridges. And then act three is what we're going to hear tonight, I believe, in terms of free everything, free college, free childcare, you name it. That's so far the three-act play for Joe Biden. With the infrastructure proposal that we have made -- and I was one of the for proposing that at the news conference the other day -- it's core infrastructure. It will help with roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways."

Without getting into the weeds here, the stock is up about 5 percent in after-hours trading, and this despite all the pile-on by politicians of both parties right now to go after Facebook. But it is a juggernaut and continues to be even more of one. About 10, 15 minutes from now, we're going to be getting numbers of the same quarter from Apple. We will keep you posted on those. But that is the backdrop for my next guest. Leon Panetta is the former White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton. And, if you think about it, that tech boom, the Internet boom, everything associated with it, it started gaining traction in the Clinton years. And that approach, along with zeroing in on spending, government spending, helped get deficits turning into surpluses, and for the first time in American history, the debt slowly, but surely and steadily wiped away. That was then. A number of Democrats who agreed with President Biden's approach are saying the same thing will happen now. Leon Panetta kind enough to join us. Leon, good to see you. When you look at these tech numbers, and you think of that boom that really -- the technology boom that started in the '90s and into the early 2000s, do you think that your colleagues in the Democratic Party have it right, that a boom, whether it's done by government spending here, which might be a leap, will be able to wipe out a lot of these deficits, maybe take a stab at the debt?

The reason Bill Clinton was able to do what he did was because we put together a very tough budget that had about $500 billion in deficit reduction, $250 billion in spending savings, $250 billion in revenues. And it complemented actually what George Bush did with his budget. And for that reason, those two budgets, we were able to ultimately balance the federal budget and create a surplus for this country. That approach to budgeting has gone to hell. And the budget process itself has been broken for the last number of administrations. And unless we begin to come back to some degree of discipline with the budget that looks at both spending and revenues together--"

But I did -- I did wonder about how Bill Clinton reached across the aisle, worked with Newt Gingrich, welfare to work, all of these memorable bipartisan projects. There's nothing bipartisan about what's going on now. And I guess the hope is that all of this trillions upon trillions of spending, something's got to stick and will create a boom.

He's going to have to develop some kind of bipartisan approach in order to get it passed. That's the bottom line.

It is possible, but much of it hinges on bipartisan cooperation and a commitment to being as creative in how you address spending as to how you address tax cuts or hikes, depending on your point of view. All right, we have a lot more coming up. More on this Rudy Giuliani situation, where federal investigators initiated a search warrant at his New York City apartment. What were they looking for, and what's going to happen now? After this."

Now, the only detail is whether it was deliberate. Let's go to Bryan Llenas, who's following this story in New York -- Bryan."

      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon. That's right. We are learning more about the extent to which Governor Andrew Cuomo's aides tried to reportedly cover up the true number of COVID-19 deaths in the state's nursing homes, The New York Times reporting that, since early spring, earlier than we -- than what was reported before, the aides tried to purposely hide this data. Reportedly, Cuomo's senior aides prevented the state's health department from publishing a scientific paper which incorporated the true nursing home death toll data. An audit of the death numbers was not made public for months. And two Health Department letters drafted for state lawmakers on the subject were never sent. Now, Governor Cuomo's administration is reportedly under investigation by the FBI and the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, looking at whether Cuomo's team purposely covered up the true death toll data in nursing homes. Remember, this was requested by the Department of Justice twice last year. It has already been reported that Cuomo's top aides omitted more than 3,000 nursing home COVID-19 deaths from a July Department of Health report, saying they could not verify how many residents died at hospitals, despite the fact that we know they were collecting all of this data since last April."

      "utterance": "\"The whole brouhaha here is overblown, to the point where there are cynical suggestions offered for the plain and simple truth that the chamber wanted only to release accurate information that they believed was totally unassailable.\" Now, Governor Cuomo's administration, Neil, is not only accused of purposely hiding this information, but they're accused of doing so because they feared of political consequences. Remember, there is also the accusation that this was purposely done because Governor Cuomo was publishing a book last year, and that this report that came out last July was timed at the exact moment that he was negotiating an at least $4 million book deal for that memoir on leadership skills -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't have a lot of information right now. Rudy is supposed to come out and provide some sort of statement. I found it interesting that he did not host his radio show on WABC 77, a talk radio show. He did not do that. They had some filler in for that involving the mayoral race. Be that as it may, it's -- this is still pretty murky. If you -- if you're going to guess, you read The New York Times, we have been following this, it's Rudy's ties to the Ukraine, whether he was lobbying for these business interests overseas with the president and whether he broke laws doing that. I will say this. I spent some time talking -- speaking with Rudy's people who were friends with Rudy. If he stepped out of the line on something like this, something that he should know, that he's really slipping, there's something wrong here, because this is something that Rudy, as a longtime lawyer, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District, the premier law enforcement office in the country, which is probably doing the investigation into him right now, which is somewhat unprecedented. I don't think I have ever heard of a former U.S. attorney being investigated by the office he once ran. He would really have to -- he really screwed up here. But, again, I will say this, Neil. As in so many of these lobbying cases, it's murky about whether someone is officially lobbying and whether that is actionable in terms of a crime. Clearly, they're looking at -- for his e- mails to see what he was thinking about, state of mind, intent to do something illegal, whether he knew was illegal when he did it. That's a huge thing. Sometimes, people step over the line because they don't know. And we should also point out, Neil, that this is an investigation. It doesn't -- it doesn't -- he's not guilty of anything. And -- but I will say this/. For the FBI to raid his home and take his computer, a federal judge would have to show you -- they would -- the U.S. attorney's office would have to show probable cause, or they have to have something here."

Let's just say it was a blowout quarter. Sales were up more than 50 percent, 54 percent. It also blew past sales estimates in almost every product category, $90 billion promised in share buybacks. You announce that kind of a report, not surprising, your stock rises close to 5 percent. Ditto Facebook, out with similar strong earnings today. So, the technology world continues to make money hand over fist. Stay with us. You're watching \"Your World.\""

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It is probably more closely watched of earnings in general, forget about just technology, because Apple has become a key economic barometer pretty much for the country, and maybe the markets as a whole. Its sales and earnings sizzling in the latest quarter, usually considered a slower quarter, after the busy fourth-quarter Christmas shopping season. But this one was just nothing less than a blowout, overall sales at 54 percent higher than the year-ago period, much stronger than they thought. Just to put it in some context right now, the number of iPhones it sold, 65 percent more than last year, the number of iPads, about 70 percent more, personal computers, around 78 percent more. After-hours trading, the stock is jumping, continuing a trend we have seen with the likes of Facebook and Alphabet, to a lesser extent with Microsoft. To Art Hogan, National Securities Corporation, Scott Martin, Kingsview Asset Management. Art, to you first. What do you make of what's happening with Apple and, more to the point, technology in general?"

Neil, one of the things we think about a lot as we sort of normalize the economy is, how many of these companies really pulled forward a lot of demand because of the pandemic? We're all working at home. We knew we need new laptops and iPads and phones, et cetera. And, clearly, this quarter shows that that's not the case for Apple right now. They continue to create demand for their new products. And, clearly, we're just at the tip of the iceberg for the 5G rollout. What's more interesting to me is that they just added $90 billion to their current buyback program, right?"

For a lot of our viewers who sort of get caught in this and want to know, what does that mean, obviously, when a company expresses enough confidence to buy it stock, that limits the available stock, lets the market go higher, and all of that. But having said all of that, Scott Martin, it is a good reflection the American consumer, in this case, the global consumer as well, coming out of this pandemic, not that they were hurting during it. But what do you make of that consumer's appetite to buy items that aren't necessarily cheap?"

It makes those purchases probably a little easier. Now, Art made the point, and you did as well, I mean, this -- we're in the midst of -- or the early innings, really, of a 5G, iPhone upgrade cycle. So that's really, I think, what is showing up in this quarterly report. What else is interesting, though, that could be just pursuant to maybe more of that consumer demand that's out there, Neil, is the services part of Apple, which, really -- I mean, gosh, guys, in the last few years, has really taken on a life of its own. I mean, you're talking about Apple iCloud. You're talking about the App Store. You're talking about Apple Music and Apple Arcade, which, yes, I play at home with my kids."

Because the markets, which were on a tear under Donald Trump, continue to build on that under Joe Biden. And I'm just wondering how long this goes on. Are there enough doubters out there, enough issues or worries to justify it? Usually, when everyone capitulates and says, oh, the hell with it, I'm just riding this bull as long as he can go, what do you tell people?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I will tell you this. I think that, interestingly, this has been one of those years where earnings estimates have gone higher during the quarter. That's only happened twice in the last 10 years. So, we're clearly seeing the beginning of what's going to be some pretty parabolic earnings growth, and, obviously, GDP growth, as the economy normalizes. So, I don't think we have been able to correctly factor in what the S&P 500 can earn next year. In the middle of last summer, we thought that was going to be about $172. Coming into this morning, it looks like $186. And I bet you anything it's going to be north of $190 for the S&P 500 earnings for 2021 by the end of this reporting season."

Do the stocks need to take a pause at some juncture? Yes. And I think we have had some rotational corrections. Technology sold off a month ago. It's back in favor now. Cyclicals are selling off right now. They were very much in favor for the entirety of the first quarter. The Russell 2000 had an 8 percent drawdown. It's back in favor again. So, I think what we're seeing is rotational corrections, which makes it a very healthy market."

I noticed Wall Street doesn't have any discretion as to whether it's coming through more spending or tax cuts, but they seem to like it just fine. If they're worried about it, they have a funny way of showing it. What do you think?"

Cloud computing and cloud security are two of those other themes. Apple falls into that category of 5G. On the other end of that barbell, I want you to have exposure to economically sensitive cyclicals. And then we're going to look at your portfolio and keep that barbell level every two months, so that, if technology is running ahead, we're going to take profits and put it into cyclicals. If you did that in 2020, you outperformed the S&P 500 by 475 basis points, and the same thing is holding true through the first quarter of this year.

All of this, though, at a time that the president isn't only going to be talking about all that planned spending, better than $6 trillion worth, if you even go back to the COVID relief a few weeks back, but his new plans that will include for families and kids initiatives that will provide everything from pre-day care coverage and a lot more.

The social distancing on screen isn't going to be the only thing that looks different, because viewers at home grew accustomed over the eight Obama States of the Union or joint addresses to Congress of seeing Joe Biden seated behind him in the vice president's seat. This is going to be the first time that Biden steps up to the mic, and it's going to be the first time that there are two women seated behind him, the vice president, Kamala Harris, and the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. We have not seen the president yet today. He, we understand, over the last two-and-a-half days has been very involved with the crafting of this speech, making sure that everything is perfect. We heard one of the White House officials this morning say that it is about 5,000 words right now. We don't know how much he is going to be slowed down by applause. But, to your point about the trillions upon trillions of dollars, the infrastructure package that he proposed for about $2 trillion a few weeks ago has not been debated yet in the Congress. They were still trying to figure out what infrastructure actually means or what qualifies as infrastructure. But they are now moving forward with about $1.8 trillion in new spending proposals. It's a combination of spending proposals and tax relief for American families. There are some progressives, though, who might not be completely happy with everything they hear because of what is going to be left out. Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders led a group of progressive senators in writing to the president, asking him to use this opportunity to announce that he is expanding Medicare eligibility and that he wants to lower -- that he has a concrete plan to lower prescription drug prices, both things that candidate Biden promised and that during the transition Biden talked about happening within the first 100 days. Day 100 tomorrow, those things are not happening. So listen for that afterwards -- Neil."
