We're seeing it in the markets. And whether, as your previous guest noted or not, it may not get spent in capital expenditures. But if not, it is going to be going somewhere. It is going to go into payroll growth. It is going through payroll increases. It is going go through keeping prices at level because profitability will go up. And who does that benefit? It benefits the consumer on the street. So, repatriating money from overseas, among other things, cutting the taxes that employers pay is good for employees, and that's what America needs.",
