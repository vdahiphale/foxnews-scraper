      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's Wednesday, what they used to call Hump Day. You think you've had a stressful week? Imagine being Kamala Harris. You take your first big trip south of the border to what we used to call the developing world and you're pretty excited about it because you know that as a licensed person of color, all the other people of color you're going to meet will be thrilled to see you. That's how it works in the people of color community. They've got so much in common and getting along is effortless. It's one big happy community. You're oppressed, they're oppressed. You'll be friends. If you're Kamala Harris, that's what you've always assumed. But it turns out, you were wrong. You finally get to Guatemala and you discover that actually the people there detest you. They could care less about all the glass ceilings you say you've shattered, they're not impressed by your Political Science degree, or the fact that you once chaired the Black Law Students Association in college. They find you phony and annoying. In fact, they strongly prefer the orange man you replaced. At least, he was funny. So, they tell you to buzz off and go home. Get out of here and don't come back. Imagine how that must feel if you're Kamala Harris? Quite the psychic blow. So, you can't really blame the unnamed White House staffer who swooped in to save the day, hiring a fake Univision reporter to suck up to Kamala Harris and make her feel better. We can't prove that happened, though it does make sense. We do know that Univision denies that the lady who told Harris, \"I voted for you\" at a press conference had ever worked for the network. So, whoever she was, she made Kamala Harris's day. \"Thank you,\" Harris replied gratefully. And then her spirits raised, Kamala Harris returned to immigration policy. What is her immigration policy, exactly? Simple. Now, that we've solved every domestic problem and turned this country into a peaceful, happy utopia, it's time to take all the money we've got leftover and give it to Central America. Only by doing that can we solve the, quote, \"root causes of immigration.\" Watch.",

Take a trip on Bay Area Rapid Transit sometime and you'll see what we mean, which is not to say that transforming Honduras into Monaco will be effortless. A project like that could take weeks.

We'll have to check with the BU Professor on that and get back to you. But in the meantime, here's an idea, kind of a random one: why don't we fix the United States first? With a conversation with, all of people, the President of El Salvador not so long ago and he made that point. We were in his country shooting a documentary on MS-13 and immigration. During that interview, the President pointed out that actually, it might make more sense for people on say the South Side of Chicago to apply for refugee status in El Salvador, not the other way around, because it is less dangerous in El Salvador.",

It is not just a talking point. It's actually true. According to the numbers, El Salvador is, in fact safer than many major American cities. El Salvador, safer than Baltimore, for example. In 2018, Baltimore had 51 murders per 100,000 people; the same year, San Salvador had a smaller number, 50 per 100,000. San Salvador was long, the most dangerous city in the hemisphere. Baltimore, by the way, also has a higher murder rate than Guatemala, Honduras and Afghanistan. So, why don't people who live in Baltimore have a right to apply for asylum in Central America? Thanks to good leadership, El Salvador is getting safer. Meanwhile, thanks to people like Kamala Harris, our country is becoming far more dangerous. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): From vicious attacks in broad daylight to cold-blooded murders by night, another summer of sin is already underway in New York City. Shootings year-to-date are up 81 percent. This weekend alone, 27 people were wounded in 22 shootings, including a Manhattan Federal prosecutor hit by a stray bullet in the face while having dinner at a restaurant. Bullets went flying in New Jersey this weekend where a birthday party turned into a mass shooting. Fourteen party goers were shot, two died. Community members blame gang wars. Chicago had a worst weekend where nine people were killed and 38 injured by gunfire. The victims include a 15-year-old boy shot in the head while sitting on a front porch.",

The formerly peaceful City of Knoxville for example, Tennessee. Knoxville is now on track for its deadliest year in history, even worse than last year which had set the previous record? So what happened to Knoxville? Well, the same thing that always happens to places that decline -- terrible leadership. Neo-liberal nonsense, frenzies of guilt fueled professional class self-hatred, elected morons like Indya Kincannon. Indya Kincannon is somehow the Mayor of Knoxville. She recently announced that she would personally join in painting a BLM mural, quote: \"I understand now more than ever, it is not okay just to stand up to justice inequity,\" she told reporters. \"We must all be actively antiracist.\" Antiracist? So what are the practical consequences of so called antiracism? What we know, we see it all around us. The consequences are more misery and more race hatred. No question about that. Ask your kids what they're learning in school. Behind the scenes, this ideology means fewer and less effective police. Crime spikes, drug addicts living in the park, children murdered in drive- bys. That's all still happening across the country. In fact, it's happening more, but getting less coverage. You rarely hear the phrase \"defund the police\" these days. Why? Because normal people of all colors, of all political registrations, normal people found that slogan terrifying and deranged because it is. So Democrats told their troops to pick a new euphemism. But the idea didn't disappear, it is still with us. Here is Congresswoman Cori Bush of St. Louis explaining that police are the real threat to public safety.",

A lot of people are dying in St. Louis, but not at the hands of police. What's happening there? Well, the murder rate in St. Louis has literally skyrocketed. You're now more likely to be shot to death in St. Louis than you are to be killed in Guatemala City. Guatemala City, a place that has been famous for decades for being violent. But St. Louis is now more violent. That's true. So, maybe it's our country that needs the attention these days. J.D. Vance is a best-selling author. He joins us tonight. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. It's the emotional intensity that people like Kamala Harris bring to the problems of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and they have real problems, and I appreciate empathy. But they bring this intensity to these problems, and they completely ignore the real and wholesale suffering in their own cities. What is that about? J.D. VANCE, AUTHOR, \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\": Well, I think it's about the fact that they don't know how to solve the problems in their own cities. So, not far from where Kamala Harris lives, not far from where Joe Biden lives, of course, in the White House, you will see tent cities all over Washington, D.C. You see these things in many major American cities. And what I find so preposterous about Kamala Harris is that she is of course fake about almost everything, but she seems to generally get fired up when she talks about this immigration question. But she seems to have no compassion for the people who are living in those tent cities in her own country, the country that she is the number two chief executive for. And I tend to think that when you get really angry about something, it is often because you're the most ignorant about it. I think Kamala Harris has no idea how to solve the problems for those people. She refuses to accept any blame, or any failure, and so she's just deflecting and distracting from the real problem.",

And if you think about the entire ideology of the American ruling class for the last five to ten years, it's that many American citizens are privileged, that they suffer from racial fragility, if they even dare to complain about the conditions of their own country, and I think what this is ultimately about is an effort to silence American citizens from complaining about the real problems that exist. Let's face the basic facts, our cities are disgustingly violent. They are increasingly dirty and they are increasingly unsafe to raise a family. They are also by the way, increasingly expensive. We know that many Americans can't afford single family homes in some of our biggest cities. I would love it if the American Vice President showed even a little compassion for the people who are living in these terrible conditions in her own country.

So, who? Well, thankfully, there's a doctor in the house, Dr. Jill. The White House publicity team released this action shot today of Dr. Jill -- who we should tell you, by the way is not actually a doctor -- hitting the books as she readies herself to represent America in the global family of nations, \"Preparing for the G7\" reads the caption. She has got her reading glasses on and a pen in hand. You can see her husband's monogrammed jacket on the chair behind her. She is sitting at Joe Biden's own desk on Air Force One. So, the point couldn't be clearer, Dr. Jill is in charge now. But what's in the binder? That's our question. What exactly is Dr. Jill reading? We can't say of course. We don't have that clearance. But we can hope that finally after all these years, she is taking the time to edit her now famous doctoral dissertation, the one on community colleges in Delaware. Dr. Jill apparently was in a rush when she wrote it the first time that accounts for the many typos including in the first paragraph of the introduction, as well as for the unforgettable sentences like this one, quote: \"According to the Retention Director at Cecil Community College, Cecil Community College has made a concerted effort to address retention.\" In other words in Delaware's community colleges, Retention Directors say they are addressing retention. Those were Dr. Jill's findings and they make sense. The question though is, could there be a better way to say it? We'd like to think as she jets above the Atlantic on Air Force One on the way to the G7 Summit, Dr. Jill is searching for just the right words. Good luck, Dr. Jill. Now, you might recall from a few years ago, a Google engineer called James Damore. Damore was fired for suggesting that there might be biological differences between men and women. He is a science man after all. Now, at the time, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai issued a lengthy statement saying that Google encourages discussions of its policies, but they canned him anyway. Now Google has fired another engineer after he questioned the storyline. His name is Taras Kobernyk. He was based in Zurich, Switzerland. Google fired him after he wrote a memo criticizing Google's so-called equity programs, which, as they all do amount effectively to racism. In his memo, Kobernyk pointed out the Google employees were circulating something called the antiracist ally-ship starter pack. That included articles claiming that, quote, \"White people have no culture.\" That's not hostile or anything. Another article defended looting. Now Google says that Kobernyk was fired for disrupting the workplace, not for his views or that memo. That man, Taras Kobernyk joins us tonight. Taras, thanks so much for coming on tonight.

If you believe in critical race theory, if you think that what Dr. Martin Luther King said that he envisions a country that -- seeing people for the content of their character, not their color -- if you think that's wrong, then yes, you are a racist. If you believe that critical race theory, which teaches children that white is an incurable kind of disease, that you will never be able to not be racist, that somehow or another, you have to be punished for the sins of the past.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's Wednesday, what they used to call Hump Day. You think you've had a stressful week? Imagine being Kamala Harris. You take your first big trip south of the border to what we used to call the developing world and you're pretty excited about it because you know that as a licensed person of color, all the other people of color you're going to meet will be thrilled to see you. That's how it works in the people of color community. They've got so much in common and getting along is effortless. It's one big happy community. You're oppressed, they're oppressed. You'll be friends. If you're Kamala Harris, that's what you've always assumed. But it turns out, you were wrong. You finally get to Guatemala and you discover that actually the people there detest you. They could care less about all the glass ceilings you say you've shattered, they're not impressed by your Political Science degree, or the fact that you once chaired the Black Law Students Association in college. They find you phony and annoying. In fact, they strongly prefer the orange man you replaced. At least, he was funny. So, they tell you to buzz off and go home. Get out of here and don't come back. Imagine how that must feel if you're Kamala Harris? Quite the psychic blow. So, you can't really blame the unnamed White House staffer who swooped in to save the day, hiring a fake Univision reporter to suck up to Kamala Harris and make her feel better. We can't prove that happened, though it does make sense. We do know that Univision denies that the lady who told Harris, \"I voted for you\" at a press conference had ever worked for the network. So, whoever she was, she made Kamala Harris's day. \"Thank you,\" Harris replied gratefully. And then her spirits raised, Kamala Harris returned to immigration policy. What is her immigration policy, exactly? Simple. Now, that we've solved every domestic problem and turned this country into a peaceful, happy utopia, it's time to take all the money we've got leftover and give it to Central America. Only by doing that can we solve the, quote, \"root causes of immigration.\" Watch."

To address the root causes as though it's something that can be dealt with overnight. To feel the effects of those root causes on our shores. And the root causes are based on the problems and the challenges that people are facing in countries like Guatemala, which is why I was there. We have to address the root causes."

Uber shortages in Midtown over holiday weekends, and the patriarchy. Once we solve those, we're done. We've solved the problem. So, it's simple, make Latin America perfect. That's all we need to do. It shouldn't be hard. People like Kamala Harris have a demonstrated record of dramatically improving everything they touch. Take a trip on Bay Area Rapid Transit sometime and you'll see what we mean, which is not to say that transforming Honduras into Monaco will be effortless. A project like that could take weeks. But no matter how long it takes, we have a moral responsibility to do it, because as Sandy Cortez learned during her recent undergraduate days at Boston University, we are the ones who made Central America crappy in the first place.

We were in his country shooting a documentary on MS-13 and immigration.

      "utterance": "We'll show you more from that. It's on our \"Originals\" episode on FOX Nation. It's about how El Salvador tamed MS-13. But the President's point, what you just saw, is not crazy. It is not just a talking point. It's actually true. According to the numbers, El Salvador is, in fact safer than many major American cities. El Salvador, safer than Baltimore, for example. In 2018, Baltimore had 51 murders per 100,000 people; the same year, San Salvador had a smaller number, 50 per 100,000. San Salvador was long, the most dangerous city in the hemisphere. Baltimore, by the way, also has a higher murder rate than Guatemala, Honduras and Afghanistan. So, why don't people who live in Baltimore have a right to apply for asylum in Central America? Thanks to good leadership, El Salvador is getting safer. Meanwhile, thanks to people like Kamala Harris, our country is becoming far more dangerous."

Bullets went flying in New Jersey this weekend where a birthday party turned into a mass shooting. Fourteen party goers were shot, two died. Community members blame gang wars. Chicago had a worst weekend where nine people were killed and 38 injured by gunfire. The victims include a 15-year-old boy shot in the head while sitting on a front porch."

It's kind of hard to hide the body most of the time. So, we know for a fact that major American cities saw a massive increase in homicides. Overall, 33 percent increase in homicides last year and that's continuing this year.

So what are the practical consequences of so called antiracism? What we know, we see it all around us. The consequences are more misery and more race hatred. No question about that. Ask your kids what they're learning in school. Behind the scenes, this ideology means fewer and less effective police. Crime spikes, drug addicts living in the park, children murdered in drive- bys. That's all still happening across the country. In fact, it's happening more, but getting less coverage. You rarely hear the phrase \"defund the police\" these days. Why? Because normal people of all colors, of all political registrations, normal people found that slogan terrifying and deranged because it is. So Democrats told their troops to pick a new euphemism. But the idea didn't disappear, it is still with us. Here is Congresswoman Cori Bush of St. Louis explaining that police are the real threat to public safety."

I don't like to keep seeing my people die in the hands of police, and nothing is happening. I don't like that. So, I think -- I can't care about people's feelings. I can't care about, you know, if you like what I'm saying or not, my people are dying and that's what I have to look at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"My people.\" What does talk like that bring us in the end? No, we're good. But in point of fact, everything she said is untrue. A lot of people are dying in St. Louis, but not at the hands of police. What's happening there? Well, the murder rate in St. Louis has literally skyrocketed. You're now more likely to be shot to death in St. Louis than you are to be killed in Guatemala City. Guatemala City, a place that has been famous for decades for being violent. But St. Louis is now more violent. That's true. So, maybe it's our country that needs the attention these days. J.D. Vance is a best-selling author. He joins us tonight. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. It's the emotional intensity that people like Kamala Harris bring to the problems of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and they have real problems, and I appreciate empathy. But they bring this intensity to these problems, and they completely ignore the real and wholesale suffering in their own cities. What is that about? J.D. VANCE, AUTHOR, \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\": Well, I think it's about the fact that they don't know how to solve the problems in their own cities. So, not far from where Kamala Harris lives, not far from where Joe Biden lives, of course, in the White House, you will see tent cities all over Washington, D.C. You see these things in many major American cities. And what I find so preposterous about Kamala Harris is that she is of course fake about almost everything, but she seems to generally get fired up when she talks about this immigration question. But she seems to have no compassion for the people who are living in those tent cities in her own country, the country that she is the number two chief executive for. And I tend to think that when you get really angry about something, it is often because you're the most ignorant about it. I think Kamala Harris has no idea how to solve the problems for those people. She refuses to accept any blame, or any failure, and so she's just deflecting and distracting from the real problem."
    },
    {

      "utterance": "But Kamala Harris, who of course, now is in a motorcade, but she has served in the Senate, you know, for a number of years now and there are 99 other senators, as well. And they literally walk over the bodies of drug addicts, mentally ill people unconscious, living right outside their office, and they never say a word about it. And then they turn this kind of moral blast furnace on the rest of us about how we screwed up Central America. I mean, that is deranged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, it is extremely deranged. And if you think about the entire ideology of the American ruling class for the last five to ten years, it's that many American citizens are privileged, that they suffer from racial fragility, if they even dare to complain about the conditions of their own country, and I think what this is ultimately about is an effort to silence American citizens from complaining about the real problems that exist. Let's face the basic facts, our cities are disgustingly violent. They are increasingly dirty and they are increasingly unsafe to raise a family. They are also by the way, increasingly expensive. We know that many Americans can't afford single family homes in some of our biggest cities. I would love it if the American Vice President showed even a little compassion for the people who are living in these terrible conditions in her own country. She was elected or whatever to govern this country. She's not doing it."

The White House publicity team released this action shot today of Dr. Jill -- who we should tell you, by the way is not actually a doctor -- hitting the books as she readies herself to represent America in the global family of nations, \"Preparing for the G7\" reads the caption.

So, the point couldn't be clearer, Dr. Jill is in charge now. But what's in the binder? That's our question. What exactly is Dr. Jill reading? We can't say of course. We don't have that clearance. But we can hope that finally after all these years, she is taking the time to edit her now famous doctoral dissertation, the one on community colleges in Delaware."

      "speaker": "Dr. Jill apparently was in a rush when she wrote it the first time that accounts for the many typos including in the first paragraph of the introduction, as well as for the unforgettable sentences like this one, quote",
      "utterance": "\"According to the Retention Director at Cecil Community College, Cecil Community College has made a concerted effort to address retention.\" In other words in Delaware's community colleges, Retention Directors say they are addressing retention. Those were Dr. Jill's findings and they make sense. The question though is, could there be a better way to say it? We'd like to think as she jets above the Atlantic on Air Force One on the way to the G7 Summit, Dr. Jill is searching for just the right words. Good luck, Dr. Jill. Now, you might recall from a few years ago, a Google engineer called James Damore. Damore was fired for suggesting that there might be biological differences between men and women. He is a science man after all. Now, at the time, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai issued a lengthy statement saying that Google encourages discussions of its policies, but they canned him anyway. Now Google has fired another engineer after he questioned the storyline. His name is Taras Kobernyk. He was based in Zurich, Switzerland. Google fired him after he wrote a memo criticizing Google's so-called equity programs, which, as they all do amount effectively to racism. In his memo, Kobernyk pointed out the Google employees were circulating something called the antiracist ally-ship starter pack. That included articles claiming that, quote, \"White people have no culture.\" That's not hostile or anything. Another article defended looting. Now Google says that Kobernyk was fired for disrupting the workplace, not for his views or that memo. That man, Taras Kobernyk joins us tonight. Taras, thanks so much for coming on tonight. What did you say in your memo? And it will summarize for us?"

Things that I didn't think were right, that were disruptive and long term, just damaging for -- even for racial things, for racial relations. So Google is basically undermining things as it was supposed to improve. And I wrote it, because we were having conversations about this topic with other employees. And also my manager, she was aware of me having some concerns, and she was asking me about these concerns. So, I did what people usually do in such cases at Google. You want to discuss something with someone, you write a document, you share it, and then you discuss what is in there. After I had done it, my manager told me to remove the document. I was told that the document was inappropriate, offensive, containing cherry picking examples, and so on. I ultimately refused to delete the document and that's when Google fired me."

Mostly that the things Fauci said in public for the last year and a half are very different from the things he said in private. In private, he admitted that masks, the paper kind you buy at the drugstore don't work. They don't protect you from COVID. He didn't say that in public, he lied about it. In public, he told us under oath that he had not funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In private, he admitted he did. So, Tony Fauci hasn't really responded in detail to these discrepancies until today when he did respond. Here's what he said."

The question is, why would people like that, all of them have college degrees want to defend Tony Fauci on the details? Not as a man, maybe they like him as a person. But when Tony Fauci in an e-mail says masks don't work, but doesn't tell you that, tells you you're required to wear one. When he sent money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain-of-function research, why would they defend that? And why don't we know more? Why isn't Fauci under some form of Federal investigation? Why isn't he getting half the treatment that say, Roger Stone is? That's a fair question. Josh Hawley, Senator from Missouri has asked it, and he joins us tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. So, it's simple, and I don't think it's an outrageous thing to ask for that there was some sort of organized effort by the Federal government, an investigation to get to the bottom of this, why isn't there one?"

You're a conspiracy theorist, they said. Dr. Fauci has said, you know, this was a naturally originating virus, we shouldn't ask questions. It turns out, Tucker, there are a lot of really legitimate questions, and I mean, a lot of really legitimate questions about the involvement, the potential involvement of a lab. We need to get to the bottom of it. Dr. Fauci, by the way, knew very well. His e-mails tell us he knew in January of 2020 that there was a possible lab connection there. Of course, he also knew about his connection to gain-of-function research at that same lab, and yet he was dishonest about it and continues to be dishonest about it. That's a big problem."

He's not interested in the facts and he has tried to prevent the facts from getting to the American public. You know, the American public deserves the truth. They can be trusted with the truth, they deserve to have the truth. That's why I think that the U.S. government needs to declassify everything it knows about the origins of COVID-19, but we need a congressional investigation. Dr. Fauci needs to testify about his role in any gain of function research, and we also need to know if people within the U.S. government tried to prevent the government, our Intelligence Agencies from figuring out and finding out if this in fact, did have a lab connection, the COVID-19 virus."

But it's not just Fauci who believes he is immune from criticism. You're also not allowed to say anything negative about BLM or the Cultural Revolution now going on. One of the few people who has explored the implications of the depth of our intellectual life is a Professor of -- at all places -- Brown University. His name is Glenn Loury.

How many times can you accuse them of failing to see your humanity when in fact you are living in the freest country and you are the richest people of African descent ever to have walked on the planet? I'm talking about black Americans. How many times can you do that and not have them get the idea that they've got an identity, too, that is a racial identity and it's not yours.

It's not the national bird of the United States. But then they started to hear the noises. What they didn't mention in that package is that they are also very destructive. If you have like a dark colored car, dark blue, dark black that you keep it nice and shiny, if the peacock see their reflection in it, they will scratch your car because they think they're attacking another peacock.

So, they're producing a tremendous amount of feces on top of your car, which has an acid that will burn the paint in your car. I mean, this is nonstop.

And I remember I was on \"FOX and Friends\" and I said, I think the President is a racist. No, that's not quite right. I think he just has a problem with the white culture. Well, then, I mean, holy cow, what do you mean by white culture? I don't know, Marxist. Tell me now what you mean by white culture? I didn't -- I was not versed on critical race theory. I wasn't versed in the language of Marxist. Now, Barack Obama, I am. I take my apology back. I was exactly right and I even stated it right. You are a racist. If you believe in critical race theory, if you think that what Dr. Martin Luther King said that he envisions a country that -- seeing people for the content of their character, not their color -- if you think that's wrong, then yes, you are a racist. If you believe that critical race theory, which teaches children that white is an incurable kind of disease, that you will never be able to not be racist, that somehow or another, you have to be punished for the sins of the past. I know that goes to your critical race theory, Barack Obama. But I don't believe in that. I'm sorry, I don't believe in that. And I also don't believe in collective salvation, which you do. By the way, you rejected Jeremiah Wright. How you are you feeling about the new senator from Georgia? How do you feel about him, I wonder? I'll bet you, you love him.

We're going to have to change our language, the way we talk to each other. We're going to have to change our traditions. Well, that's exactly what we're doing.
