President Trump calling for the press conference late last night, eager to get his side out on the Comey testimony. Things got heated very quickly. We're going to have a big lineup for you on all of this tonight. Charles Krauthammer is here with us tonight, Professor John Banzhaf and former justice department lawyer J. Christian Adams weigh in expert insight in terms of what the president is up against here as the Trump legal team is now ready to file a former complaint against James Comey for leaking his own memos to the press. But first, we begin with chief national correspondent Ed Henry, joining us from the White House lawn with the fiery response that we got earlier today from the president. Ed?",

Oh, and by the way, the president left the door open to the possibility that there might be tapes of some of these calls or meetings. We'll get to that in a moment. The president firing back of course at Comey who had charged that the president is a liar and that's why Comey says he had to document their meetings and their phone calls to the contrary. The president believes that Comey's testimony actually backs him up and shows that the president was told on numerous occasions he was not under investigation and there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The president pushing back this morning first in a tweet saying, \"Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication and wow, Comey is a leaker.\" That a reference to the fact that Comey himself admitted he leaked information to The New York Times through a third-party. The president's legal team tonight has a new statement out basically saying they have more evidence of Comey leaking other information about his meetings with the president, they want the justice department to investigate that and at his news conference, the president piled on Comey.",

If it's about did Trump himself collude with the Russians, this is sort of the question, Trump 2016, he was exonerated. There's not a shred of evidence, it could be developed it could be shown later. But as of today and as of months and months now, investigation begun in July of last year. We see no evidence of that. And the irony is this whole debacle accord because the head of the FBI tells the president three times in private, you are not the target of the investigation. You are essentially clean. But won't say it in public. And that was the origin of the cloud that Trump was referring to. It came out in the testimony yesterday of Comey. I think under questioning from Senator Feinstein that the cloud was the general picture but the specific issue was why couldn't you tell the country and yet in the absence of that, you had all of these stories, all the media full of Trump and collusion.",

Basically, he was angry about the way he was gotten rid of, the brutal way it was done, it was also very politically stupid way to do it. There would have been other ways to do it where you give him a gold watch, you have a press conference, you praise him, you give him some kind of award and you sent him on his way. I think he's very upset about that, he felt like he had to protect himself and the reputation. And he came out swinging. But it's not -- he is not the choir boy he makes himself out to be. He is not the secular saint to Democrats to make him out to be. In an act of supreme hypocrisy since a few months ago, they were saying he was the villain who swung the election to Donald Trump.

Because of that, we had a bomb k-9 with us and we decided not to use the dog fearing that it would have its paws lacerated by the glass.  So, Anthony and I decided to do a manual search of the area. When we were doing that, we heard an explosion, we didn't know from what direction but we were informed by police radio that an officer was down at one police plaza.

Oh, and by the way, the president left the door open to the possibility that there might be tapes of some of these calls or meetings. We'll get to that in a moment. The president firing back of course at Comey who had charged that the president is a liar and that's why Comey says he had to document their meetings and their phone calls to the contrary. The president believes that Comey's testimony actually backs him up and shows that the president was told on numerous occasions he was not under investigation and there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The president pushing back this morning first in a tweet saying, \"Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication and wow, Comey is a leaker.\" That a reference to the fact that Comey himself admitted he leaked information to The New York Times through a third-party. The president's legal team tonight has a new statement out basically saying they have more evidence of Comey leaking other information about his meetings with the president, they want the justice department to investigate that and at his news conference, the president piled on Comey."

If this investigation which began about Russian collusion or Russian interference is really about collusion with the Trump administration, Trump campaign. If it's about did Trump himself collude with the Russians, this is sort of the question, Trump 2016, he was exonerated. There's not a shred of evidence, it could be developed it could be shown later. But as of today and as of months and months now, investigation begun in July of last year. We see no evidence of that. And the irony is this whole debacle accord because the head of the FBI tells the president three times in private, you are not the target of the investigation. You are essentially clean. But won't say it in public. And that was the origin of the cloud that Trump was referring to. It came out in the testimony yesterday of Comey. I think under questioning from Senator Feinstein that the cloud was the general picture but the specific issue was why couldn't you tell the country and yet in the absence of that, you had all of these stories, all the media full of Trump and collusion."

There could have been one or two people who I know were aligned but unless you can show a direction from the candidate, unless you can show collusion, it means nothing. So on that, I think he's clean. That's what we've heard it from Comey himself. The question is will Mueller pursue this, you know, layoff of Flynn something - I mean, that is kind of peripheral, very narrow, even Comey says that's only about the lying about speaking with the Russian ambassador. It's not about the Russia probe in general, so if it's going to be in three months, I think he comes out OK."

As Trump says, I hit back to 10 times as hard as I am hit, this is what Comey did. Basically, he was angry about the way he was gotten rid of, the brutal way it was done, it was also very politically stupid way to do it. There would have been other ways to do it where you give him a gold watch, you have a press conference, you praise him, you give him some kind of award and you sent him on his way. I think he's very upset about that, he felt like he had to protect himself and the reputation. And he came out swinging. But it's not -- he is not the choir boy he makes himself out to be. He is not the secular saint to Democrats to make him out to be. In an act of supreme hypocrisy since a few months ago, they were saying he was the villain who swung the election to Donald Trump. But I think these are human emotions. You get whacked, you want to whack back, that's what we saw."

Do you believe the Trump legal team has a case against James Comey for what really stunned everyone yesterday was his admission that he decided when he woke up in the middle of the night one night that he was going to pass his FBI created journal of what was transpiring in his work as the director over to the press himself?"

They can't fire him, all they can do is put him on a blacklist and not hire him again as an investigator. There is a statute, federal statute which reports to criminalize stealing or purloining government records. The problems here are going to be the same thing I ran across many years ago in the Debategate controversy, number one, is this -- are these documents government records, bit more importantly, you simply make a copy of a record and give it to somebody, does that really count as stealing, purloining or converting?

Even if he is not a government employee, the office of professional responsibility at the DOJ and the inspector general routinely make recommendations and file complaints with the state bar agencies. So, James Comey is a member of at least one bar association, perhaps more. And if the office of professional responsibility issues a report, they can send it to the state bar and say that he violated ethical rules. This is not complicated stuff. And frankly, the Trump team could make complaint to Mr. Comey's bar associations, wherever he's a member of a bar that he violated ethical obligations.

If I simply make a copy of a document and a share it with somebody, I haven't stolen it. That's what happened in Debategate. A copy of a document went over to the other side, the original remained where it was and the argument was made, there was no theft. I was able to convince the judge otherwise, but it's nice to hear.

      "utterance": "An incredible night, real political upset here at the conservatives. Had not expect to win comfortably, did not at the end of the day receive overall working majority. The outlook ahead is certainly to be very tough for Prime Minister May. She is about to move forward with a minority government but depending on the support of the Democratic unionists. She is going to be dependent upon another political party to be able to govern over the course of the coming years, a very precarious situation certainly for the Prime Minister at this time, but she has vowed to move forward with Brexit and ensure that it will take place. Now that is a very important message to send to the British people that Brexit will be implemented, the will of the British people will certainly be delivered."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I guess that is my biggest question, when the Brexit vote happened, that was also a huge upset, a really shocking vote for people watching the situation. Is the vote that we saw yesterday a reflection on Brexit, our people no longer happy with that idea? Or is it more a reflection on Theresa May?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARDINER",
      "utterance": "It will, certainly not a rejection of Brexit after all of the opposition labor Party led by Jeremy Corbyn now backs Brexit and pledge during the campaign to implement Brexit. Only one major UKY Political Party stood on a platform of opposing Brexit. It wasn't a rejection of opposing the exit from the European Union at all. However major questions are being raise today about Theresa May performance as a Prime Minister and her leadership will be on the campaign, there are certainly doubts within the conservative party with regard to the Prime Minister's future. This was not it has to be said a very effectively run campaign, Also Theresa May during the course of the campaign, trying to move the party more to the sense of ground rather than keep it on the right. I don't think it actually helps in terms of bringing out the votes."

      "utterance": "So fascinating to watch, because we see, we see some of what we've seen here at home in the United Kingdom, not having a lot of traction. Very loose parallels and more nationalist movement on one side and you have Jeremy Corbyn who in some ways lines with Bernie Sanders, where he and Trump had a little bit of common grounds. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARDINER",
      "utterance": "Certainly Jeremy Corbyn shares a lot in common with Bernie Sanders, he is even further to the left of Bernie Sanders. He makes Bernie Sanders look like Ronald Reagan. I do think overall, the British people, they do want to see Brexit taking place. They want to see a stronger Britain on the world state. They want to see it outside of the European Union. I think Jeremy Corbyn offers a sort of big government message that appeals to younger voters, that was a problem for the conservatives."

      "utterance": "Hi Martha, Oscar Lopez Rivera is a Puerto Rican nationalist who moved to the U.S. when he was 14 and later became convinced that Puerto Rico was a U.S. colony. Lopez became the leader of FALN, a Spanish acronym that translates to armed forces of national liberation, a terror group that fought for the independence of Puerto Rico and in the 1970s and 80s was behind more than 100 bombings in New York, Chicago, and D.C. Those attacks killed at six and injured hundreds including several police officers, the deadliest bay in the 1975 bombing of France's tavern in New York financial district that killed four and injured 60. Lopez Rivera was never convicted of killing or injuring anyone. He was convicting convicted of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. Government, and explosives are found in apartment links to him. Those who had investigated the Tavern bombings said Lopez Rivera was behind it, listen."

Richard Pastorella Former NYPD bomb squad detective injured in one of those blasts and Joseph Connor who lost his father to an FALN terrorist attack in New York City attacks, it's good to have both of you here. Thank you for being here tonight and just a brief version, you went over to dismantle a bomb after helping some of your fellow officers who had been hit by a bomb, and you lost quite a lot."

      "speaker": "RICHARD PASTORELLA FORMER NYPD BOMB SQUAD",
      "utterance": "I did. On the evening of December 31st 1982, New Year's Eve night, most officers were of Times Square of course and we were very short staffed. I myself assigned to the bomb squad. I was a Bomb technician, I was a junior manager, and most of the seniors had off. I had a partner with me a dog handler, and we had received a call that a bomb had exploded at 26 and earl plaza, the FBI office in Manhattan and we responded to there. Virtually every window and the back of the building had been blown out. There were shards of glass everywhere. Because of that, we had a bomb k-9 with us and we decided not to use the dog fearing that it would have its paws lacerated by the glass. So, Anthony and I decided to do a manual search of the area. When we were doing that, we heard an explosion, we didn't know from what direction but we were informed by police radio that an officer was down at one police plaza. Realizing we had a physical injury, we responded there. When we approached the scene there, I could see there was an officer prone on the ground in a large pool of blood, there were two other emergency service officers."

      "speaker": "PASTORELLA",
      "utterance": "That is true. One of the commodities you don't have his time, you don't know how much time is built into the bombs. There were Asian people wandering around in the area in the vicinity of two live explosives. We decided to move them back, get them out of the way. We had to pick some people up and take them to safe distance. I went to examine the paper bags that the dog indicated that contained explosives and as I reached out for it, it exploded in my face."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PASTORELLA",
      "utterance": "That is unfortunately a fact. They say he is not being honored, he is. He is receiving an award for a national hero of Puerto Rico. For the life of me, I can't understand how he is a national hero. He is been in prison for 35 years for the sedition against the United States."

I empathize, kids who can't see their grandparents or their parents, but my father didn't cause it, Lopez and his group caused it."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "People forget what it was like, bombs going off all the time. We think about ISIS, we look at the terror, but that was happening in this country. It was happening largely, because of the FALN and because of Lopez and now he is going to be honored this weekend."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONNOR",
      "utterance": "Lopez is being honored as a hero. Aside from being a terrorist, what did Oscar Lopez Rivera do to push the independence of Puerto Rico? Only 5 percent of Puerto Ricans have ever wanted independence, 70 percent will vote to become a state. I want them to explain what did Lopez ever do to get an award for freedom if not being a terrorist?"
