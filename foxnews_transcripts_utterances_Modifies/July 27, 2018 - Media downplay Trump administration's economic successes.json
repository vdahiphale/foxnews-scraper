      "sentences": "Welcome to the \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I'm Laura Ingraham from Washington. Ahead time, the stories that matter to you told in a way you're not going to hear from anywhere else, of course. Well the economy? Roaring. Exemplified today in a sterling GDP number. But is that enough for president's critics? You would not believe what some of the reactions have been, but it's great news for all Americans. Plus, remember that Michael Cohen bombshell that dropped on CNN last night? We covered it last night on the ANGLE. We'll we're going to tell you how flimsy it really is. And tonight's Friday follies, Raymond Arroyo reveals the stunning lack of creativity in Hollywood and one stinky plane -- oh this story -- I can't believe we're doing that story.  But we start tonight with a story you won't get anywhere else. The revenge of the Obama era judicial nominees. Two cases, actually three if we can get to the third, that show you how certain judges can have an outside influence over the policy of this country, the President of the United States and your lives. First, a federal district court judge Thursday denied a Trump administration request to dismiss a lawsuit challenging their decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. A policy by the way that is completely constitutional, completely sound. Judge Jesse Furman from the U.S. District Court for the southern district of New York, a Barack Obama appointee, said that the challengers had successfully proven that there's \"a heightened risk in the current political climate of a lower response rate due to the president's 'anti-immigrant rhetoric.'\" I kid you not.  That's not a pundit, that's a judge. That's not all. A federal judge in Portland, Oregon has ruled that allowing a transgender high school student in an Oregon school district to use the boy's locker room and restrooms does not violate the privacy rights of other students who may object to sharing that space. U.S. district judge Marco Hernandez, you guessed it -- also an Obama appointee -- threw out the lawsuit filed by parents for privacy. They wanted this group called Parents for Privacy and Balance in Dallas saying the ruling, if the parents are upset, they can just \"remove their children from Dallas high school if they disapprove of the transgender student access to these facilities.\" Huh -- well thanks.  Well to discuss this trend of the politicized judiciary run amuck, let's bring in top two attorneys. Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and an RNC committee woman from California and Scott Bolden, Chair of the National Bar Association political action committee. I'm lonely in here without either of you but I'm going to have to make due. Scott, you're usually here, dude --",

And you know, you saw the exact same reasoning that Judge Furman used here, which is that Wilbur Ross, who's nominally in charge of the census in his department, had made some remarks about the reasoning behind wanting to count citizens that raised an issue of animus. Now the United States Supreme Court recently ruled this animus theory which was used in the Trump travel ban cases is bogus and not one of the elements that should be applied. And you know, Clarence Thomas has spoken out on this issue as well of nationwide injunctions. So basically, this is a confusion and an unelected judge trying to supersede and impose his values over the president gets to do -- asking a very reasonable question, the executive branch --",

Ahead time, the stories that matter to you told in a way you're not going to hear from anywhere else, of course. Well the economy? Roaring. Exemplified today in a sterling GDP number. But is that enough for president's critics? You would not believe what some of the reactions have been, but it's great news for all Americans. Plus, remember that Michael Cohen bombshell that dropped on CNN last night? We covered it last night on the ANGLE. We'll we're going to tell you how flimsy it really is. And tonight's Friday follies, Raymond Arroyo reveals the stunning lack of creativity in Hollywood and one stinky plane -- oh this story -- I can't believe we're doing that story. But we start tonight with a story you won't get anywhere else. The revenge of the Obama era judicial nominees. Two cases, actually three if we can get to the third, that show you how certain judges can have an outside influence over the policy of this country, the President of the United States and your lives. First, a federal district court judge Thursday denied a Trump administration request to dismiss a lawsuit challenging their decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. A policy by the way that is completely constitutional, completely sound. Judge Jesse Furman from the U.S. District Court for the southern district of New York, a Barack Obama appointee, said that the challengers had successfully proven that there's \"a heightened risk in the current political climate of a lower response rate due to the president's 'anti-immigrant rhetoric.'\" I kid you not. That's not a pundit, that's a judge. That's not all. A federal judge in Portland, Oregon has ruled that allowing a transgender high school student in an Oregon school district to use the boy's locker room and restrooms does not violate the privacy rights of other students who may object to sharing that space. U.S. district judge Marco Hernandez, you guessed it -- also an Obama appointee -- threw out the lawsuit filed by parents for privacy. They wanted this group called Parents for Privacy and Balance in Dallas saying the ruling, if the parents are upset, they can just \"remove their children from Dallas high school if they disapprove of the transgender student access to these facilities.\" Huh -- well thanks. Well to discuss this trend of the politicized judiciary run amuck, let's bring in top two attorneys. Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and an RNC committee woman from California and Scott Bolden, Chair of the National Bar Association political action committee. I'm lonely in here without either of you but I'm going to have to make due. Scott, you're usually here, dude --"

And you know, you saw the exact same reasoning that Judge Furman used here, which is that Wilbur Ross, who's nominally in charge of the census in his department, had made some remarks about the reasoning behind wanting to count citizens that raised an issue of animus. Now the United States Supreme Court recently ruled this animus theory which was used in the Trump travel ban cases is bogus and not one of the elements that should be applied. And you know, Clarence Thomas has spoken out on this issue as well of nationwide injunctions. So basically, this is a confusion and an unelected judge trying to supersede and impose his values over the president gets to do -- asking a very reasonable question, the executive branch --"

I know it's the ninth circuit, so anything goes in the ninth circuit, but that seems like a very -- that seems like a harsh ruling against that parent's group. But maybe I'm misreading it."

So if you look at the numbers that just came out, we've got a capital spending boom, structures investments sky rocket because of the drilling and the trade deficit went down and contributed to higher GDP growth. And so everything about the Trump agenda is working and that will drive the critics crazy. I'd like to add one last thing, I promise not to filibuster. There can be a sugar high in economics.

We know the soybean crop is about to be harvested in September and prices have gone down. And they've partly gone down recently because the Chinese did stockpile lots of soybeans in anticipation of the trade dispute. And so that is true. But there's other things in the trade data too, like the reshoring of activity because we're no longer an unattractive tax environment. But the biggest news in today's GDP report which I think is going frustrate the democrats, is this old thing called inventories, right? And so if everybody's decided they're optimistic about the country and they go out and buy stuff, then the firms will ratchet up their production. But if consumption is really, really high, then they're going to have to run down their inventory because they're selling stuff off the shelves, right? Because their production can't adjust so fast.

There's nothing bad about having a four percent GDP growth number. That's good. That's good for America and the president is entitled to say this was a good number. You can see he was beaming with pride. The question now is how can we continue to sustain that? It's worth remembering just last quarter was a mediocre number. So we had around two percent. Now we got four percent. Let's hope we get more four percent and not return to the two percent. But I don't think there's anything that you should convince yourself that was bad about this number.

Now, that doesn't take away from the GDP today. The GDP today is very good. But just be a little careful. There's several aspects of the GDP number today that looks like they're probably temporary.

Dozens of homes have been destroyed and thousands more threatened by the flames. Scorching temperatures, strong winds, and drought are fueling the fire. Forecasters don't expect a break in the weather any time soon. And sky gazers around the world were treated to a rare sight, a blood moon. Look at that. This complete lunar eclipse was the longest of this century. It lasted an hour and 43 minutes to be exact. With the exception of North America, much of the world caught a glimpse of the red moon.

Make them filibuster. At least let them show their cards. But we're sitting back and not doing anything because they hurt our feelings. They say they're stronger on immigration than we are. What she did forget to say is to point out that all of the 9/11 terrorists were here legally."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No. Actually, one had overstayed a visa. It was on the wrong type of visa. One shouldn't have been on the visa. So originally on an overstayed visa. But calling 9/11 an incident as an American citizen, I know Nancy has been a little slow lately, but that's just abhorrent. It's beyond outrageous. Michael, this argument about abolish ICE, which undergirds what Nancy's talking about here, it's exploded across the country. These protests, whipping up people. They feel bad because of separated kids, I understand that. But they backfired. These protests have backfired and most people think we need ICE because they do human trafficking work, they do the great drug interdiction work. Yet the Democrats thought that was going to be political nirvana. And I don't see it. I think it's been a complete disaster for them, this idea."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL CUTLER, FORMER SENIOR SPECIAL AGENT, INS",
      "utterance": "And by the way, it's interesting she brings up 9/11. I have been raising the issue forever. I've arrested terrorists as an immigration agent. Most people don't realize the second largest contingent of agents assigned to the joint terrorism taskforce are immigration agents. And I provided testimony to the commission. So when she said, well, one of the things was border security, she's right. The other part of it, the embedding tactic, was immigration fraud. That's the bailiwick of ICE, the same agency that she was demanding be disbanded. So how in the world can you be in two places at one time except, of course, Washington, with the idea that we're going to take immigration out of the equation when the 9/11 Commission found that multiple failures of the immigration system, particularly interior enforcement, that was the key words in the 9/11 Commission report. How do you eliminate interior enforcement and say you're following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission? It's crazy."

Attorney General And Jeff Sessions was up in Boston yesterday, and he announced arrests in this major identity fraud operation where 25 individuals are now standing accused of stealing Social Security numbers to obtain what amounted to a quarter of a million dollars in government benefits. So if you're not outraged by that, wait until you hear about this story's connection to the border."

They're just sitting out there floating around, probably using your Social Security number or my Social Security number. But ICE can only do what Congress tells it to do. ICE is dependent on the INA law. Congress sitting there blaming ICE, both parties are blaming ice and DHS for their failure to act for the last 18 to 20 years --"

Just in New England and fentanyl is involved, too, but we're going to stay on this issue. Thank you for joining us. And up next, it isn't just Twitter that is trying to snuff out conservative voices. Wait till you hear about what Facebook tried to do regarding a candidate running for Congress in Florida. That and Peter Thiel's message for Silicon Valley, next."

And today their stock is down over 20 percent. Facebook's stock has cratered after they missed their earnings estimates for the first time in three years. And to make matters worse, the social media giant is now accused of banning this ad from a Florida Republican because of the Second Amendment message. Watch."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely, Laura. We have been obviously running statewide for over a year now and running multiple ads every single day, just run of the mill stuff. Like this, like that. We go and post this mom and apple pie pro Second Amendment, pro President Trump, pro NRA endorsement ad, and it gets flagged immediately. And so we do what it tells you to. Appeal it. Let us know why you don't think it should be flagged. And of course, we wait and we wait and we wait. No response. And here we are five weeks out from our primary, 2 million voters in Florida we have to talk to, and we're losing time while they, I don't know, review it. It gets lost in the black hole. And so we called them out in the media, put out a release and said that we've been blocked from talking about this straightforward message that I've been sharing across the state for the last year-and-a-half. And until we called them out for it, they didn't take any action. Of course, once we did that, the bad publicity, they called us up immediately, apologized, authorized it. But, really, it's just the precedent. You go look through Facebook's policies and automatically anything that deals with guns or ammunition, it gets flagged. And I'm running for office, so I have got a platform. They paid attention to me. But what about private citizens? The average person that is trying to use this platform to talk about the things they believe in, the things they want to share? Where do they call?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, they don't have the same opportunity that you have, certainly, as you said, the platform. And it makes you wonder how often this happens in the course of a day. There's a lot of stuff on these social media platforms that most people find objectionable but it doesn't get flagged. Whether it's nudity, semi-nudity, or violence from film clips. So how do you make that judgment? This is where I do kind of prefer the free market, unless it's someone being mutilated or something that's really violent, incitement to violence. But thus far there is no other problem with Facebook today, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "No. So they're running our ads now and have told us we shouldn't have any more problems. But again, it just shows you where their mindset is at. Why are guns automatically flagged? But you have got things likes abortion. You can run an abortion ad. That would be totally --"

I was in summer camp. We had such a wild week of news, it was great to have you every step of the way. We covered the FISA warrants, Michael Cohen's wild claims, and we ended with phenomenal economic news for all Americans, more evidence of a robust economy under the guidance of President Trump. We are really blessed in this country. Enjoy your family, enjoy your weekend, fly your flag if you can. I will see you right back here on Monday from New York.
