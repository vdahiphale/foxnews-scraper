Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": my exclusive interview with U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, as President Trump returns to the campaign trail last night, sharing a message of unity and resilience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, telling supporters -- quote -- \"The silent majority is stronger than ever.\"  The attorney general sharing his concerns over censorship and mail-in ballots ahead of the 2020 election, sitting down with me on Friday, just hours before his controversial announcement that the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, would resign from his post. President Trump ultimately firing the Manhattan prosecutor yesterday, after he refused to voluntarily step down.  A.G. Barr and his relationship with the president and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And fallout today after violence erupted in the Seattle protest zone, largely abandoned by police, where one person was shot and killed on Saturday, another critically injured.  We begin my exclusive interview this morning with Attorney General William Barr with this and the challenges that now face police across America.",

We have got a once vibrant town in Seattle, a residential and business town, being taken over, now called the Capitol Hill Organized Protest, or CHOP, or CHAZ, Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. In Minneapolis, demonstrators hurling bricks at cops, setting buildings on fire, and then, of course, peaceful protests and not-so-peaceful protests as a result of the death of George Floyd. As the number one law enforcement individual in the country, what are you going to do to bring law and order back?",

It's the job of the Department of Justice to mete out justice fairly and even-handedly in that particular case, and not be influenced by the mob. The second aspect is these demonstrations, which are fine. Protests and demonstrations are fine. But when they become mob violence, we need to restore public order. We can't be ruled by mobs. We have to be ruled by the legal process.  Now, in this particular situation, there's obviously legitimate demonstrators out there raising concerns about police abuse. But a lot of these demonstrations have been hijacked by essentially anarchistic groups and professional agitators, who are really in it just for the violence and the confrontation.   And so I do make a distinction between legitimate, peaceful demonstrators and these violent agitators who are involved throughout the country.",

      "speaker": "BARR",
      "sentences": "Yes.  I mean, even before this happened, I was speaking out about how the job of being a policeman in the United States these days is the toughest job in the United States. They're under a lot of pressure. And I was concerned even before these pressures that we were having difficulty maintain the levels of police we need in our cities, retaining them. And, obviously, this environment, where they're demonized, will deter a lot of people from continuing to serve as police. And, also, I'm concerned of the effect, that they may pull back some of their enforcement activities and not take those risks.   So, I think it could lead, as it's led in other situations, to an actual increase in violent crime and more deaths. The -- you know, I understand an event like Minneapolis and why it struck such a chord in the African-American community. There has been longstanding distrust of law enforcement. And that partly comes out of the fact that, for much of our history, our laws were explicitly discriminatory.  And for the past few decades, we have been reforming our institutions to make sure they reflect our values. And the police have been engaged in that. And we shouldn't let this incident and the actions of a bad few obscure the fact that the police have made a lot of progress.  Instances of the shooting of black unarmed males has been dropping. It was 38 five years ago. Last year, it was 10, 10 in the nation. And six of those were involved in attacking the police officers at the time they were shot. So, while any death is too many, the fact is that, in proportion, it's relatively small. I mean, there are 8,000, roughly 8,000 homicides of African-Americans in our country every year, 8,000. Ten last year were due to force by shooting an unarmed black male. So, we have to keep that in perspective. And we also have to keep in perspective that the police forces are much more diverse. The leadership of the police is much more diverse. They are committed to reform. Community policing has been taking hold around the country.   And that reform has to continue. And what we have to do is bring out of these episodes, Minneapolis, something that's good, and that is, it will galvanize the public will to continue that process of reform. But it has to be fair reform to the police.",

One of the things that's always bothered -- a Democratic senator once used the expression -- I thought it was actually a good one -- that being the attorney general is like being the sheriff in one of these old Western movies. When the mob shows up at the jailhouse door, you're standing up in front of the jail.  And, sometimes, that mob wants to hang the person, and, sometimes, they want to spring the person. And it's the job of the attorney general not to be influenced by the mob, but try to do justice in that particular case. And I think police are at risk, sometimes, when some event like this happens of -- or we have to make special effort to make sure that they get due process. And the unions do play a role in that.",

But I certainly would have liked to have seen the Georgia Bureau of Investigations complete their investigation before charges were brought, and also the use of a grand jury. The grand jury process provides some protection, to have the citizens in a group decide that there's been a crime committed. And there was no grand jury used in this case. So, I think it's important to go through the right processes before charging someone.  I also think there was a fundamental difference, obviously, between what happened in Atlanta and what happened in Minneapolis, of essentially kneeling on someone's neck for almost nine minutes who was already incapacitated.",

So, the basic idea is that, if you're acting as essentially a bulletin board, and you're open to all comers, and third parties can post their content on your Web site, and you're not being selective about it, it's open to all comers, then you shouldn't be deemed a publisher, because we want to encourage that kind of forum for third-party views. That ran into problems, and -- because we wanted to encourage -- during the early days of the Internet, we wanted to encourage platforms to take off obscene material or harassing material or other kinds of offensive material like that. And so what we said was, in the law, Section 230, if you take that down, that doesn't make you a publisher, if you take down objectionable material like that. Unfortunately, they started taking down viewpoints and started really being selective and, based on whether they agreed with a viewpoint or not, taking it down.  And that should make them a publisher. But they said, under Section 230, they weren't. That was one of the problems that was arising under Section 230. So, we have proposed a change to address that. What we have said is, you can take down stuff that is unlawful, and you can take down stuff that's not -- does not accord with your terms of service. But you have to make your terms of service clear. You have to have a reasonably based reason for taking down the particular content and show that it violated your terms of service. And you need to give someone notice and a process whereby they can dispute that.",

      "sentences": "Right. There's something very disturbing about what's going on. To some extent, there was a bait and switch over the past couple of decades. These companies held themselves out as open to all comers. That's how they built up all their membership and their networks, saying, you know, we have a wide variety of views. People can come in and post their views and their positions and their statements. And that's what led to people to join it and then get the strong market position they have. Then they have switched. Now they're being more selective, and they're starting to censor different viewpoints. But you have this concentration of these very large companies that had that kind of influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints in our society. And that is a fundamental problem, because our republic was founded on the idea, and the whole rationale was that there would be a lot of diversity of voices, and it would be hard for someone to be able to galvanize a big faction in the United States that could dominate politically and oppress a minority. And yet now we have, with the Internet and with these big concentrations of power, the ability to do just that, to quickly galvanize people's views, because they're only presenting one viewpoint, and they can push the public in a particular direction very quickly.  And our whole Constitution and system was based on not having that, and having a wide diversity of voices. So, one way that this can be addressed is through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices.",

The thing we have going for us, especially when there's intense division in the country, is that we have peaceful transfers of power. And our way of resolving it is to have an election. But when government, state governments start adopting these practices like mail-in ballots that open the floodgates of potential fraud, then people's confidence in the outcome of the election is going to be undermined. And that could take the country to a very dark place, if we lose confidence in the outcomes of our elections. So, that, the censorship -- the censorship has a number of effects. It also -- free speech, being able to get your viewpoint out, is a release. It takes some of the pressure out.

And so what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world. The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They have stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets about future technology, they're stealing the future of the American people. If they start leading in some of these fundamental foundational technologies like 5G, which will be the platform of much of our future manufacturing in the United States, they will have tremendous leverage over the United States. If all our industrial practices and our manufacturing practices are built on a platform that they dominate, they will have ultimate leverage over the West. So, I think this is a competition for the future. They haven't been competing fairly. And the president has confronted this, when no one else has.

Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": my exclusive interview with U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, as President Trump returns to the campaign trail last night, sharing a message of unity and resilience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, telling supporters -- quote -- \"The silent majority is stronger than ever.\" The attorney general sharing his concerns over censorship and mail-in ballots ahead of the 2020 election, sitting down with me on Friday, just hours before his controversial announcement that the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, would resign from his post. President Trump ultimately firing the Manhattan prosecutor yesterday, after he refused to voluntarily step down. A.G. Barr and his relationship with the president and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And fallout today after violence erupted in the Seattle protest zone, largely abandoned by police, where one person was shot and killed on Saturday, another critically injured.

We have got a once vibrant town in Seattle, a residential and business town, being taken over, now called the Capitol Hill Organized Protest, or CHOP, or CHAZ, Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. In Minneapolis, demonstrators hurling bricks at cops, setting buildings on fire, and then, of course, peaceful protests and not-so-peaceful protests as a result of the death of George Floyd. As the number one law enforcement individual in the country, what are you going to do to bring law and order back?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well, all these situations really involve two dimensions of the rule of law. One is the individual case that's precipitated the demonstrations and so forth. It's the job of the Department of Justice to mete out justice fairly and even-handedly in that particular case, and not be influenced by the mob. The second aspect is these demonstrations, which are fine. Protests and demonstrations are fine. But when they become mob violence, we need to restore public order. We can't be ruled by mobs. We have to be ruled by the legal process. Now, in this particular situation, there's obviously legitimate demonstrators out there raising concerns about police abuse. But a lot of these demonstrations have been hijacked by essentially anarchistic groups and professional agitators, who are really in it just for the violence and the confrontation. And so I do make a distinction between legitimate, peaceful demonstrators and these violent agitators who are involved throughout the country."

There are people who don't want this autonomous area in Seattle around their homes."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, even before this happened, I was speaking out about how the job of being a policeman in the United States these days is the toughest job in the United States. They're under a lot of pressure. And I was concerned even before these pressures that we were having difficulty maintain the levels of police we need in our cities, retaining them. And, obviously, this environment, where they're demonized, will deter a lot of people from continuing to serve as police. And, also, I'm concerned of the effect, that they may pull back some of their enforcement activities and not take those risks. So, I think it could lead, as it's led in other situations, to an actual increase in violent crime and more deaths. The -- you know, I understand an event like Minneapolis and why it struck such a chord in the African-American community. There has been longstanding distrust of law enforcement. And that partly comes out of the fact that, for much of our history, our laws were explicitly discriminatory. And for the past few decades, we have been reforming our institutions to make sure they reflect our values. And the police have been engaged in that. And we shouldn't let this incident and the actions of a bad few obscure the fact that the police have made a lot of progress. Instances of the shooting of black unarmed males has been dropping. It was 38 five years ago. Last year, it was 10, 10 in the nation. And six of those were involved in attacking the police officers at the time they were shot. So, while any death is too many, the fact is that, in proportion, it's relatively small. I mean, there are 8,000, roughly 8,000 homicides of African-Americans in our country every year, 8,000. Ten last year were due to force by shooting an unarmed black male. So, we have to keep that in perspective. And we also have to keep in perspective that the police forces are much more diverse. The leadership of the police is much more diverse. They are committed to reform. Community policing has been taking hold around the country. And that reform has to continue. And what we have to do is bring out of these episodes, Minneapolis, something that's good, and that is, it will galvanize the public will to continue that process of reform. But it has to be fair reform to the police."

    },

      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think, generally, in our history, immunity used to be absolute. And then they dropped it down to qualified to permit some lawsuits in egregious cases. But, without qualified immunity, I think most people would not take the job as a police officer. So, we would essentially be doing away from our police departments."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "I think it largely depends on the unions. And it's hard to generalize. But I do think that police unions have an important role to play. And I do think that police management has to be able to get rid of bad apples. But, by the same token, I think there has to be due process. One of the things that's always bothered -- a Democratic senator once used the expression -- I thought it was actually a good one -- that being the attorney general is like being the sheriff in one of these old Western movies. When the mob shows up at the jailhouse door, you're standing up in front of the jail. And, sometimes, that mob wants to hang the person, and, sometimes, they want to spring the person. And it's the job of the attorney general not to be influenced by the mob, but try to do justice in that particular case. And I think police are at risk, sometimes, when some event like this happens of -- or we have to make special effort to make sure that they get due process. And the unions do play a role in that."

The DOJ's proposal on social media -- coming up next. The police officer who shot Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta is charged with felony murder, along with 10 other crimes. While many protesters cheered the decision by the DA, others say the prosecutor moved too fast. I asked the attorney general what he thinks about that case and also about anti-conservative bias among our top social media companies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "There is a lot of activity in Atlanta right now because of the charges against the officer who killed Rayshard Brooks. We saw the video of Brooks grabbing the officer's Taser, using the Taser against him. The officer's being charged with felony murder. He could face execution. Did that case merit murder charges, or is that officer being lumped in with the upset over George Floyd?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Well, because I might be called upon as attorney general to pass judgment on that case under civil rights laws, I don't want to get into the specifics of it. But I certainly would have liked to have seen the Georgia Bureau of Investigations complete their investigation before charges were brought, and also the use of a grand jury. The grand jury process provides some protection, to have the citizens in a group decide that there's been a crime committed. And there was no grand jury used in this case. So, I think it's important to go through the right processes before charging someone. I also think there was a fundamental difference, obviously, between what happened in Atlanta and what happened in Minneapolis, of essentially kneeling on someone's neck for almost nine minutes who was already incapacitated."

Now, systemic, in terms of the law enforcement and the police agencies, I don't think there is systemic law enforcement in those agencies. I think there may be individuals, and there are individuals, who may have bias. And, sometimes, that may emerge and be manifested in some act. But I don't think it's systemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I ask, because there's something -- there are bad cops, and there's just a system that maybe has things that are built into it that should be looked at. For example, if a white kid gets caught underage drinking, the parents are going to do anything they can to avoid that conviction on the kid's record that will follow him and he will carry the rest of his life. So, they will do diversion program, diversion program. Are we offering the same diversion programs to blacks and whites?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "In some jurisdictions, yes, in some, probably not as much as we should. As I said, this is a process of reforming our institutions, looking for inequities, and making sure that we address them."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me move on to freedom of speech and what just took place, the DOJ planning to roll back the legal protections, the monopoly legal protections, that technology companies enjoy. What prompted this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, the basic idea is that, if you're acting as essentially a bulletin board, and you're open to all comers, and third parties can post their content on your Web site, and you're not being selective about it, it's open to all comers, then you shouldn't be deemed a publisher, because we want to encourage that kind of forum for third-party views. That ran into problems, and -- because we wanted to encourage -- during the early days of the Internet, we wanted to encourage platforms to take off obscene material or harassing material or other kinds of offensive material like that. And so what we said was, in the law, Section 230, if you take that down, that doesn't make you a publisher, if you take down objectionable material like that. Unfortunately, they started taking down viewpoints and started really being selective and, based on whether they agreed with a viewpoint or not, taking it down. And that should make them a publisher. But they said, under Section 230, they weren't. That was one of the problems that was arising under Section 230. So, we have proposed a change to address that. What we have said is, you can take down stuff that is unlawful, and you can take down stuff that's not -- does not accord with your terms of service. But you have to make your terms of service clear. You have to have a reasonably based reason for taking down the particular content and show that it violated your terms of service. And you need to give someone notice and a process whereby they can dispute that."

      "utterance": "Google did select Federalist, Zero Hedge, and tried to cut off their advertising revenue. Senator Tom Cotton also told me that he got a call from someone at Twitter who said, take down your tweet immediately about the police needing the military to back them up. Otherwise, we're deleting your account entirely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Right. There's something very disturbing about what's going on. To some extent, there was a bait and switch over the past couple of decades. These companies held themselves out as open to all comers. That's how they built up all their membership and their networks, saying, you know, we have a wide variety of views. People can come in and post their views and their positions and their statements. And that's what led to people to join it and then get the strong market position they have. Then they have switched. Now they're being more selective, and they're starting to censor different viewpoints. But you have this concentration of these very large companies that had that kind of influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints in our society. And that is a fundamental problem, because our republic was founded on the idea, and the whole rationale was that there would be a lot of diversity of voices, and it would be hard for someone to be able to galvanize a big faction in the United States that could dominate politically and oppress a minority. And yet now we have, with the Internet and with these big concentrations of power, the ability to do just that, to quickly galvanize people's views, because they're only presenting one viewpoint, and they can push the public in a particular direction very quickly. And our whole Constitution and system was based on not having that, and having a wide diversity of voices. So, one way that this can be addressed is through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I am worried about censorship. I'm worried about a number of things going into the election, one, the censorship of robust debate. I'm also worried about undermining the public confidence in the integrity of the elections. The thing we have going for us, especially when there's intense division in the country, is that we have peaceful transfers of power. And our way of resolving it is to have an election. But when government, state governments start adopting these practices like mail-in ballots that open the floodgates of potential fraud, then people's confidence in the outcome of the election is going to be undermined. And that could take the country to a very dark place, if we lose confidence in the outcomes of our elections. So, that, the censorship -- the censorship has a number of effects. It also -- free speech, being able to get your viewpoint out, is a release. It takes some of the pressure out. If people are prevented from expressing their views, that's where you start getting extremism. And so the more ventilating of viewpoints we have, the healthier it is for our country."

There's questions about whether or not it even denies a secret ballot, because a lot of the states have you signing the outside of the envelope. So, the person who opens -- person who opens the envelope will know how people voted. There's no -- right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots, and be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot.

You go back to 2016, and there were two investigations going on, one into Hillary Clinton's e-mail use and one into Donald Trump and collusion with Russia. We know, officially, there was no collusion. With the Hillary Clinton investigation, Jim Comey was told by your predecessor, Loretta Lynch, to call it a matter, not an investigation.

U.S. attorney John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe continues, as we learn new information about efforts to unmask individuals during the final weeks of the Obama administration.

I haven't heard any Democrats raise any upset over the fact that wiretapping of an American citizen was illegal, an FBI agent changed evidence, changed a document, a whole host of issues. So, am I to believe that, if we don't get the results of the John Durham investigation before the election, and Donald Trump loses, we won't hear another word about this?"

And it's, like, not even a whoops. They're just onto the next false scandal. So, that has been surprising to me that people aren't concerned about civil liberties and the integrity of our governmental process. In terms of the future of Durham's investigation, he's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments, hopefully before the end of the summer. But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election."

They're very difficult to investigate, especially where a lot of people had access to the information and because, at the end of the day, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a particular person who did it, and also because the news organizations don't cooperate in those investigations, obviously. But we are pursuing leak -- leaks aggressively where we think there's a realistic possibility that we could find out who it is. So, we have a lot of leak investigations under way.

And so, under the law, we are bringing a civil action to enforce his agreement that he would do that before publishing.

    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "The way I look at is, this is fundamental challenge to the United States. Since the late 19th century, our opportunity and our growth, our prosperity as a country has come from our technological leadership. We have been the technological leader of the world. In the last decade or so, China has been putting on a great push to supplant us, explicitly. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy. And so what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world. The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They have stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets about future technology, they're stealing the future of the American people. If they start leading in some of these fundamental foundational technologies like 5G, which will be the platform of much of our future manufacturing in the United States, they will have tremendous leverage over the United States. If all our industrial practices and our manufacturing practices are built on a platform that they dominate, they will have ultimate leverage over the West. So, I think this is a competition for the future. They haven't been competing fairly. And the president has confronted this, when no one else has. And the American business community has been a big part of the problem, because they're willing, ultimately, many of them, to sacrifice the long-term viability of their companies for short-term profit, so they can get their stock options and move into the Gulf resort. That's what's driving some of this. They're not taking the long-term view and the national view of the American -- of maintaining the American strength."

But unlike Huawei -- Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. So, just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable market is probably around $90 billion, and the Chinese government has set up a fund of 100 -- over $100 billion to subsidize it. So, they can go to countries and say, hey, we will put this in cash-free, very cheap money. So, that's what we're competing against with Huawei. And companies like Ericsson and Nokia are the strongest Western competitors in this sector.

You know, it's too bad that one of the great tragedies, I think, has -- the Chinese people are a great people, with a great history, very industrious and able. And the hope was that, by bringing them into the world system and economic system, there would be a liberalization of their government.
