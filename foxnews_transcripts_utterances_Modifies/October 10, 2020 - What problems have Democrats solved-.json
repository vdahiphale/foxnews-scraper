It's easy to stick to some key points and turn every topic to your advantage. If I were a Democrat, I'd hammer Trump on the virus, too. That's politics.  Biden just throws out 200,000 dead as proof Trump failed, and says the economy is bad. That's his campaign in a nutshell.  But Biden was against both travel bans and wanted to keep the country locked down longer. So Biden would have killed more people and jobs. Case closed. Biden doesn't even have a plan to confront the virus. I asked Juan to define it the other day on \"The Five\" and he couldn't.",

The C.D.C. says over 200,000 Americans OD'd on opioids under Obama-Biden -- dead. They didn't lift a finger to fight fentanyl flying in from China. The I.G. says 300,000 veterans died under Obama-Biden waiting in lines at VA Hospitals. The Obama-Biden VA doled out bonuses to managers who kept sick vets on secret wait lines. That's ugly stuff. And when Biden says Trump downplayed the virus, throw Fauci in his face.  Democrats love Fauci. Fauci told Americans the virus was low risk, to go about their lives. Same exact thing Trump said. Fauci and Trump on the same page. They didn't want to panic the people.   And when Biden says Trump blew it on the virus, throw Fauci right back in his face again. Fauci said the Trump team took early action and did an excellent job. You can't argue with Fauci, right? Biden is always barking about Trump crowds and no social distancing. But when Democrats flooded the streets, arm-in-arm, all summer rioting over police, Biden didn't care. Biden backed the mob. Biden is moaning about Trump not wearing a mask, but Biden just wears his as a prop. Look at him here talking to people close up. No mask.  When Democrats think the cameras are off, no mask. Here's Governor Cuomo, no mask. Here is Dianne Feinstein, no mask. Here is Pelosi in the beauty salon. Here's CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins who is always mask shaming people. Watch her rip the mask off when she thinks the cameras are off.  Every time Democrats blame Trump for the virus, they are giving the Chinese communists a free pass. Biden wanted to keep the economy locked down longer. Schools and sports locked down longer. Biden would have killed this country. Biden is for lockdowns, not opening up.   And for the economy, this is easy. In just three years under Trump-Pence, families got about an $8,000.00 raise. Not even close to under Obama-Biden. It is a middle class boom for  everybody: whites, blacks and Hispanics. And the poverty rate went down and inequality shrunk. Those are the straight facts.  And today's recovery is the fastest on record. We already got half the jobs back we lost in just six months. Obama-Biden had the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, and the American economy shrank the least. And came back quicker and stronger than the rest of the world. Biden will kill the recovery with lockdowns, tax hikes and regulations. No doubt about it. And you can't trust a word Biden says on healthcare.",

In fact, I just went back and pulled up an interview I did in mid-October with Megyn Kelly in 2016, where she gave me all the standard Washington lines. And I said, yes, I think he will carry Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and she clearly thought I was crazy.  So we just got a poll in today from Trafalgar, which is the most accurate poll in the last two elections. They now show Trump carrying Arizona by about five points. They show him carrying Ohio. I think a lot of things are moving in the right direction, and I think, to the point you started with, you know, there are two ways to look at this. Back when the Chinese virus first showed up, the estimates were we could lose 2,200,000 Americans. The President took very decisive action. And you could argue he saved two million American lives. And who was on the other side? Oh, Biden, Pelosi, Harris, Cuomo, de Blasio, I mean, all of the Liberal Democrats thought this was a joke.   So you can either say Donald Trump is responsible for 200,000 dead, or with equal honesty, and say Donald Trump saved over two million Americans who are alive today because he took actions that the Democrats were attacking him for. I think that thing is simple. The other thing that is happening, by the way, that I think is going to keep growing. The first time this campaign, the news media is going after Biden and it's because he won't say whether or not he is going to pack the Supreme Court.",

R.N.C. running for the hills. It's very similar the way it's lining up today where, you know, he does get sick, which takes him off the campaign trail. You get these suppression polls, where they're over sampling Democrats by double digits, and say that Trump is down in Texas and Georgia, and things like that. So that gets Independents and Senate Republicans a little nervous and you know, you get these reports in \"The Times\" like people are starting to bail. But then when you look at the enthusiasm on the Trump side and the registration numbers, and the economic numbers. There is a survey out by Gallup that says a majority of Americans, a healthy majority, believes they are better off today than they were four years ago.

And the Senate -- the founder -- you know, our founders didn't create filibuster, but they most certainly wanted a Senate to act as a body that sort of slowed things down so that we took some time to analyze situations, and that's why it's tough to get things passed in the Senate. And I think the filibuster has been abused by both parties. That said, the reason why they want to get rid of the filibuster is not because they think that we need to be doing more, it's because this time, they are not going to do what they thought was a mistake under the Obama administration. They're going to go for it all. And if you talk to people on the left, they'll argue that the biggest mistake Obama made was not going through all of it.

If I were a Democrat, I'd hammer Trump on the virus, too. That's politics. Biden just throws out 200,000 dead as proof Trump failed, and says the economy is bad. That's his campaign in a nutshell. But Biden was against both travel bans and wanted to keep the country locked down longer. So Biden would have killed more people and jobs. Case closed. Biden doesn't even have a plan to confront the virus. I asked Juan to define it the other day on \"The Five\" and he couldn't."

The C.D.C. says over 200,000 Americans OD'd on opioids under Obama-Biden -- dead. They didn't lift a finger to fight fentanyl flying in from China. The I.G. says 300,000 veterans died under Obama-Biden waiting in lines at VA Hospitals. The Obama-Biden VA doled out bonuses to managers who kept sick vets on secret wait lines. That's ugly stuff. And when Biden says Trump downplayed the virus, throw Fauci in his face. Democrats love Fauci. Fauci told Americans the virus was low risk, to go about their lives. Same exact thing Trump said. Fauci and Trump on the same page. They didn't want to panic the people. And when Biden says Trump blew it on the virus, throw Fauci right back in his face again. Fauci said the Trump team took early action and did an excellent job. You can't argue with Fauci, right? Biden is always barking about Trump crowds and no social distancing. But when Democrats flooded the streets, arm-in-arm, all summer rioting over police, Biden didn't care. Biden backed the mob. Biden is moaning about Trump not wearing a mask, but Biden just wears his as a prop. Look at him here talking to people close up. No mask. When Democrats think the cameras are off, no mask. Here's Governor Cuomo, no mask. Here is Dianne Feinstein, no mask. Here is Pelosi in the beauty salon. Here's CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins who is always mask shaming people. Watch her rip the mask off when she thinks the cameras are off. Every time Democrats blame Trump for the virus, they are giving the Chinese communists a free pass. Biden wanted to keep the economy locked down longer. Schools and sports locked down longer. Biden would have killed this country. Biden is for lockdowns, not opening up. And for the economy, this is easy. In just three years under Trump-Pence, families got about an $8,000.00 raise. Not even close to under Obama-Biden. It is a middle class boom for everybody: whites, blacks and Hispanics. And the poverty rate went down and inequality shrunk. Those are the straight facts. And today's recovery is the fastest on record. We already got half the jobs back we lost in just six months. Obama-Biden had the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, and the American economy shrank the least. And came back quicker and stronger than the rest of the world. Biden will kill the recovery with lockdowns, tax hikes and regulations. No doubt about it. And you can't trust a word Biden says on healthcare."

Now if they ask about a peaceful transition of power, they'll say yes, in 2024. We expect to win. And don't lecture Trump about a peaceful transfer, Biden spied on his campaign, framed Flynn during the transition and tried to impeach him in an election year.

They couldn't even launch a website. They can't even keep the lights on in California. This is a layout for reelection. Take note and go for their throats.

      "utterance": "I commend you. That was really well done. Oh, I think, the election in a couple of weeks, Trump wins. I think we're exactly where we were in 2016. In fact, I just went back and pulled up an interview I did in mid-October with Megyn Kelly in 2016, where she gave me all the standard Washington lines. And I said, yes, I think he will carry Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and she clearly thought I was crazy. So we just got a poll in today from Trafalgar, which is the most accurate poll in the last two elections. They now show Trump carrying Arizona by about five points. They show him carrying Ohio. I think a lot of things are moving in the right direction, and I think, to the point you started with, you know, there are two ways to look at this. Back when the Chinese virus first showed up, the estimates were we could lose 2,200,000 Americans. The President took very decisive action. And you could argue he saved two million American lives. And who was on the other side? Oh, Biden, Pelosi, Harris, Cuomo, de Blasio, I mean, all of the Liberal Democrats thought this was a joke. So you can either say Donald Trump is responsible for 200,000 dead, or with equal honesty, and say Donald Trump saved over two million Americans who are alive today because he took actions that the Democrats were attacking him for. I think that thing is simple. The other thing that is happening, by the way, that I think is going to keep growing. The first time this campaign, the news media is going after Biden and it's because he won't say whether or not he is going to pack the Supreme Court."

I thought Trump did well there then you have \"Access Hollywood,\" the Republican establishment starts bailing. You see October polls. He is down 13 points and things like that. R.N.C. running for the hills. It's very similar the way it's lining up today where, you know, he does get sick, which takes him off the campaign trail. You get these suppression polls, where they're over sampling Democrats by double digits, and say that Trump is down in Texas and Georgia, and things like that. So that gets Independents and Senate Republicans a little nervous and you know, you get these reports in \"The Times\" like people are starting to bail. But then when you look at the enthusiasm on the Trump side and the registration numbers, and the economic numbers. There is a survey out by Gallup that says a majority of Americans, a healthy majority, believes they are better off today than they were four years ago. I mean, this is lining up for again, you have Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Arizona in the Republican camp, and then you just got to pick off one of the four Rust Belts, and you're over 270."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Not only did Mike Pence take her apart on policy, but she did herself damage just by the antics, the facial expressions, the countenance -- just -- it was not a mature presentation by Kamala Harris. She wasn't likable. So I think that hurt -- and then if you combine that with them not answering basic questions about what they're going to do to the court, I don't see this going in a good direction on the issues for them."

Because all the energy, all that money, all the activism in the Democratic Party is coming from the far left and they've been talking about and insisting on this for a very long time. And I want people to understand, this is not going to end at nine or -- I mean, we can have a Supreme Court one day that has like 15 or 18 people, 19 people every time some party gets elected, and you don't like the makeup of the court, you just add, you know, two more people to it. I mean, that's what they do in the third world. That would be ridiculous. The answer to the question is yes. They are going to move to try to do that. And I believe that they're going to do that no matter what would have happened with the Supreme Court nomination now. That's why almost a year ago, I filed a constitutional amendment to keep the number where it is and bring us some stability."

Joe Biden -- we know Joe Biden, he has been on tape saying he doesn't want to pack the court. But he is, you know, being controlled by the far left, and he doesn't want to give the President a headline. I think that's probably the weakest answer you could ever give. And if they do, do this, not only that they want to nuke the filibuster. That if Bernie is in charge in the Senate, do you want Bernie Sanders in charge in the Senate if Joe wins?"

Look, the filibuster is not in the Constitution, it's a rule and a lot of people haven't liked it for a long time, but I looked at the way our system was constructed. And the Senate -- the founder -- you know, our founders didn't create filibuster, but they most certainly wanted a Senate to act as a body that sort of slowed things down so that we took some time to analyze situations, and that's why it's tough to get things passed in the Senate. And I think the filibuster has been abused by both parties. That said, the reason why they want to get rid of the filibuster is not because they think that we need to be doing more, it's because this time, they are not going to do what they thought was a mistake under the Obama administration. They're going to go for it all. And if you talk to people on the left, they'll argue that the biggest mistake Obama made was not going through all of it. Not just Obamacare, single payer, and cap in trade. Why didn't we just go for everything when we had the chance? They're not -- they're going to do that this time. I guarantee it. Absolutely."

That's none of her business. Just like if somebody got infected in the Capitol, the President wouldn't have the right to say, well, when was the last time senator so and so tested negative because we want to contact trace him. Two separate branches of government. The 25th amendment is already in the Constitution. There's already a provision and process for doing that.

I expect him to win Florida. And obviously, you know, we need to win Florida to win the presidency. But we can't just win it with Florida. We've got to win in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and all of these other places. And I could say that about this election, and I could say it about 2016 and 2012, and all the way back to 2000 as we all well remember. So, you know, I think it's going to be close. But I think the President will win in the end. No one is going to win Florida by five points, either way, we're not that kind of state, one or two-point winner Florida is a big win'"
