      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining me straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, here in an interview with new reaction to the escalating border crisis after his recent visit to a border facility with Vice President Mike Pence.  And as millions in Hong Kong continue to protest a controversial extradition bill backed by China, I will speak to one of the men leading the charge to preserve the freedom of Hong Kong. Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai is here. Founder of Next Digital will join me exclusive.  Then, Texas Congressman Michael McCaul on why the U.S. is green-lighting $2 billion in arm sales to Taiwan and his concerns about a key NATO ally buying weapons from Russia.  All that and a lot more right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And tensions are boiling over this morning on Capitol Hill, as the crisis on the southern border nears a breaking point. The Trump administration says that Mexico's actions have helped cut illegal immigration, but border facilities are still overcrowded.  They are busting, as Vice President Mike Pence saw when he joined a group of Republican lawmakers to visit a temporary detention center in Texas on Friday. That same day, a fiery House hearing where current and former officials told Congress it must take action to solve the problem. My first guest this morning was with the vice president on Friday. He joins me now exclusive. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is here. He is chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.  And, sir, it is always a pleasure to have you on the program.",

Fifty-two thousand people have been released into the interior of the United States from this one Border Patrol area alone. What did I see? A system about to break. I saw brave men and women who are doing an incredible job under difficult circumstances.  And I'm going to introduce a resolution next week praising them, the men and women of the Border Patrol and their allies. I saw 900 illegal immigrants that were captured for coming into our country illegally housed in detention facilities that was meant for 385. So they had to put a tent in the back. What I saw is a bunch of people who have been here before, broke the law before, and we're not going to let them go. I don't care if they have to stay in these facilities for 400 days. We're not going to let those men go that I saw. It would be dangerous.  And also I saw that 60 different nations are sending people here illegal.

Last year, it was 120,000. We have released 52,000 because we can't hold them.  By next year, there will be a half-a-million. If you can set one foot on American soul and claim asylum, you're entitled to a hearing. The hearing is years away. You never show up. So you get here home-free. I'm saying you can't apply for asylum in America anymore. You got to do it in your home country or Mexico. I'm also saying we can't process a minor claim in 20 days. Give us more time the process minor claims, so families -- 30 percent of the people with small children are fake families.   The word is out in Central America, you bring a small child to the United States, you're home-free. I want to change that narrative. My bill will stop 90 percent of this.

And 10 years down the road, there was no limit on the enrichment program itself. So, the difference between making fuel rods for a commercial reactor, which you enrich it at 4 or 5 percent -- 3 or 4 percent, and a bomb is 90 percent enrichment. Here's the good deal. The Iranians shouldn't be allowed to enrich uranium at all. They shouldn't be allowed to reprocess nuclear material at all, because that's how you make a bomb. They can have a nuclear reactor, but make sure they buy the fuel from the Russians or the Chinese, if they don't want to buy it from us. Fifteen countries have nuclear power programs, but they don't make their own fuel. The Iranians are enriching uranium, not to make fuel, but to make a bomb.",

Joining me straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, here in an interview with new reaction to the escalating border crisis after his recent visit to a border facility with Vice President Mike Pence. And as millions in Hong Kong continue to protest a controversial extradition bill backed by China, I will speak to one of the men leading the charge to preserve the freedom of Hong Kong. Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai is here. Founder of Next Digital will join me exclusive. Then, Texas Congressman Michael McCaul on why the U.S. is green-lighting $2 billion in arm sales to Taiwan and his concerns about a key NATO ally buying weapons from Russia. All that and a lot more right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And tensions are boiling over this morning on Capitol Hill, as the crisis on the southern border nears a breaking point. The Trump administration says that Mexico's actions have helped cut illegal immigration, but border facilities are still overcrowded. They are busting, as Vice President Mike Pence saw when he joined a group of Republican lawmakers to visit a temporary detention center in Texas on Friday. That same day, a fiery House hearing where current and former officials told Congress it must take action to solve the problem. My first guest this morning was with the vice president on Friday. He joins me now exclusive. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is here. He is chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee. And, sir, it is always a pleasure to have you on the program."

Democrats are also advocating decriminalizing entry into the United States and providing free health care to illegal immigrants once they get here. They're becoming the party of open borders and free health care, and you can't deport somebody who lost their court case. This is insane.

Then we let the entire family go because we don't want to separate families. We can't process a case in 20 days. What did I see? Fifty-two thousand people have been released into the interior of the United States from this one Border Patrol area alone. What did I see? A system about to break. I saw brave men and women who are doing an incredible job under difficult circumstances. And I'm going to introduce a resolution next week praising them, the men and women of the Border Patrol and their allies. I saw 900 illegal immigrants that were captured for coming into our country illegally housed in detention facilities that was meant for 385. So they had to put a tent in the back. What I saw is a bunch of people who have been here before, broke the law before, and we're not going to let them go. I don't care if they have to stay in these facilities for 400 days. We're not going to let those men go that I saw. It would be dangerous. And also I saw that 60 different nations are sending people here illegal. We caught people from Iran, Syria, every place in the world. They're coming through our border."

And AOC and Democrats are trying to break the system, so that we let these people go. They came here illegally, 700-and-something adult males, with criminal backgrounds by many of them, repeat offenders who've been caught before. We're not going to let them go.

It says you can't apply for asylum in the United States if you're from Central America. So we're being overwhelmed. We have had 280,000 people captured at this area of the border this year. Last year, it was 120,000. We have released 52,000 because we can't hold them. By next year, there will be a half-a-million. If you can set one foot on American soul and claim asylum, you're entitled to a hearing. The hearing is years away. You never show up. So you get here home-free. I'm saying you can't apply for asylum in America anymore. You got to do it in your home country or Mexico. I'm also saying we can't process a minor claim in 20 days. Give us more time the process minor claims, so families -- 30 percent of the people with small children are fake families. The word is out in Central America, you bring a small child to the United States, you're home-free. I want to change that narrative. My bill will stop 90 percent of this. We're going to vote before the August recess. I'm willing to spend money to help Central America. Democrats have mentioned that. I will do that. But we have got to change our laws, or this never stops."

Once they hear that you can no longer get released in America by bringing a small child, they will stop coming. Once they hear you can't apply for asylum in America, you have to do it in your own country, they stop paying the smugglers. My bill puts the smugglers out of business. This journey that these people are taking are dangerous. The smugglers and the coyotes are making billions of dollars transporting these people. And I got to change the narrative. America needs to change the narrative. To my Democratic friends, we are going to vote on my bill. I will meet you halfway. We will do things for Central America, but we're not going to turn our back on this problem any longer."

They picked the child up in Central America. They bring them to the United States. Everybody's released, and the child goes back to Central America to do it again. It's $8,000 for adults, $4,000 for families. And here's our law. If you bring a small child to America with you, we can only hold that child for 20 days. Since we don't want to separate families, we release them all. We released 52,000 people into the interior of the United States at that station this year alone because we don't have places to hold them and we can't keep the family together."

God knows what happens to them on the way. And when they get here, 98 percent of them stay. And the parents who send them know that, if you want your child to come to America, hire a coyote. What I want is these children to be sent back to their country. I'm willing to help their country do better, but we have got to shut off the flow and turn on the aid. If we don't change our laws, this thing is going to completely blow up in our face. And the Democratic Party should do as much as Mexico is doing to help the president. Mexico has upped its game, 28 percent reduction in crossing, because Mexico's gotten serious about it. Our Democratic colleagues are perpetuating a system that's dangerous to children. And it's going to result in a national security nightmare for America, because the terrorists could easily get in this group."

      "utterance": "Yes, I think we need more sanctions. The president has been measured. I appreciate that. The president got out of a bad deal. Why was it a bad deal, Maria? Because, under the deal they cut with the ayatollah, he could keep his enrichment program. There was no real inspections. And 10 years down the road, there was no limit on the enrichment program itself. So, the difference between making fuel rods for a commercial reactor, which you enrich it at 4 or 5 percent -- 3 or 4 percent, and a bomb is 90 percent enrichment. Here's the good deal. The Iranians shouldn't be allowed to enrich uranium at all. They shouldn't be allowed to reprocess nuclear material at all, because that's how you make a bomb. They can have a nuclear reactor, but make sure they buy the fuel from the Russians or the Chinese, if they don't want to buy it from us. Fifteen countries have nuclear power programs, but they don't make their own fuel. The Iranians are enriching uranium, not to make fuel, but to make a bomb."

Israel thought it was a terrible deal. If I were President Trump, I would actually ask the people in the region, are you OK with my new deal? And what would a new deal look like? Mr. President, the only good deal available to you and the world is to make sure the ayatollah has no centrifuges, he can't reprocess and he can't enrich uranium, because if you give him those tools, one day, we will have a bomb. The best deal is to have a nuclear power program where they can't make their own fuel, like 15 other nations."

So a new deal would say sanctions don't come off unless you stop dismembering the Mideast, and you can never enrich or reprocess uranium, because that's how you make a bomb. You can't have a nuclear power program. I would tell the Europeans, if you want to side with the Iranians, be my guest, but you are not going to use an American bank, you're not going to do business with the American economy.

When they write on the side of the missile \"Death to Israel,\" they mean it. He's been trying to make a nuclear weapon, not a peaceful nuclear power program. You don't build a nuclear reactor under a mountain if you're trying to build a nuclear power program for peaceful purposes. So the guy is a absolute radical religious Nazi, and the world is sitting on the sidelines. And the only thing between a bomb and Iran is Donald Trump and the state of Israel. The Europeans can't be counted on. So, I'm willing to grind any country or company into the ground if they try to empower the ayatollah to have the ability to make a bomb."

If you make the fuel, you can run a nuclear power program, but if you make the fuel, it's just a small step to making a bomb.

They have got ballistic missiles, in violation of the U.N. agreements and resolutions.

It would blow up in their face politically. President Trump would get reelected. We would take back the House and the Senate, because Mueller said there was no collusion. The facts and the law didn't justify bringing an obstruction case. There was no underlying crime. This is all politically motivated. Does anybody really think Jerry Nadler's trying to get to the truth or that he will do a better job than Mueller? This is people who don't believe Trump is legitimately president. They never accepted the 2016 outcome, and they're trying to destroy his presidency. This is just another effort to destroy Donald Trump. It will blow up in their face. And I promise your listeners, after Horowitz issues his report about the flawed FISA warrant, I'm going to deep-dive into how all this stuff started. How could it go so far if there was no collusion?"

Because he took over this job, remember, in early '17. That's a year-and- a-half -- a full year, almost a year-and-a-half, before the midterm elections. So, when in that time did he find out that there was no collusion? And if he knew way before the midterms, why sit on it until after the midterm elections?"

When Hillary Clinton was investigated, she -- people for her literally took material and beat it up with a hammer. They destroyed evidence, and no one was prosecuted. No one was flipped. Nobody was prosecuted for minor offenses to get them to talk against Clinton. Everything they did to break the Trump world, they treated Clinton with kid gloves. They hated Trump. They wanted Clinton to win. This was a politicized investigation. It should scare every American. They got a warrant against Carter Page based on a dossier prepared by a foreign agent that's a bunch of garbage. I'm going to get to the bottom of it and explain how one campaign was treated differently than the other to make sure it never happens again."

Will we see criminal charges on any of these people who actually put their finger on the scale in their powerful positions and tried to stop Donald Trump?

I'm not a prosecutor. My job is to provide oversight to make sure we fix the system, that no other president has to go through what Donald Trump went through. But, yes, I think there are plenty of people involved in the 2016 election, the way they investigated the Trump campaign, the FISA warrant application, where they have criminal liability. But we will leave that up to Mr. Durham. But I promise you, we're going to look at the other side. Mueller was the final word for me on all things Trump and Russia.

Your reaction to that or how we're dealing with China? Do you think we will see a deal between the Chinese and the U.S.?

He's got out of the Iran deal. He's built up the military. I really like President Trump's foreign policy. But dealing with China is a national security issue, just not an economic issue.

We Hong Kong people is fighting the same war as you are fighting with China in your cold war, which is just starting, and, you know, just it's almost like that we are fighting your war in your enemy camp. You have obligation and the interest to support us, because we -- seven million people in China is a very, very tiny half-percent, you know, zero, half-percent of the population.

Because, definitely, in 20 years, China is going to be biggest economy in the world.

This has been going on for a long time, Maria. But it's really hitting a hot spot right now. And we have to support Taiwan. They stand for freedom and democracy in the region.

Where do you sit on this, as we look at a new threat from Iran and we look at provocations from China, et cetera?"

      "utterance": "I think it is a very dangerous, reckless policy by the Democrats to repeal the 2001 AUMF with no replacement to it. I'm all for arguing about updating the 2001 AUMF after 9/11, but this would legalize -- or -- I'm sorry -- illegalize all global counterterrorism operations in the world that we're conducting. And then they want to repeal the 2002 with Iraq. And, of course, we know ISIS is still a threat in Iraq. And, then, finally, they want to preemptively put forward an AUMF for Iran, even though the president has not gone to war with Iran. In fact, every indication I have seen is, he doesn't want to go to war with Iran. That's why he didn't respond back militarily after they shot down a U.S. military asset. He's trying to use a diplomatic route here. So, these are all three very -- I think very misguided."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, even as Iran is pretty clearly telling us they want to enrich uranium further and break the terms of that Iran deal. All right, quickly on Turkey now, I know that we're selling Turkey military equipment, your committee overseeing that. They are also buying military equipment from Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "Very problematic. You have a NATO ally buying Russian military equipment. I sat down with the foreign minister of Turkey and the ambassador, and warned them, just as Secretary Pompeo did, that you can't have it both ways. You can't be a NATO ally and buy Russian military equipment. And what endangers it even more so, we offered them the Patriot missile battery system. They chose the Russian instead. This actually blocks the F-35 sales, because the S-400 actually tracks our F-35s and would put our F-35 planes in jeopardy if Turkey goes forward, which it appears, Maria, that they are doing. And then what makes it even more egregious is that this will now kick in the Russian sanctions bill that we -- Lindsey Graham and I passed, you know, last year. Now we have to look at, are we going to sanction a NATO ally for buying Russian military equipment? I think Erdogan is making a serious mistake. I would urge him and his administration to reject Russian military sales and buy American."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, by the way, we should point out that that S-400 that they are buying from Russia can actually shoot down the F-35."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "Precisely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I understand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "They're incongruent. You can't have both of them in the same country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Wow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "We have a military base in Turkey, which even complicates it even that much more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "That's really frightening. All right, real quick, before you go, look, you heard Lindsey Graham earlier on the border bill. You tried this. You had the Goodlatte-McCaul bill. You dealt with DACA. You dealt with the loopholes. And what happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "We fixed it, I mean, $25 billion for border. We had a merit-based immigration system. We, most importantly, did away the legal loopholes, these asylum laws that we need to change, because that's the magnet that the cartels know how to exploit to get in family units into the United States, and within 20 -- in 20 days."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "But the Democrats wouldn't sign it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "Every Democrat voted against it. And we had a DACA fix as well. And it's very unfortunate we didn't pass that."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Sir, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining me."
