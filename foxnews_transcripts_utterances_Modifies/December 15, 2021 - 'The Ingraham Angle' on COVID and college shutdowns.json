      "sentences": "Alright. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. The January 6th Committee continues to embarrass itself. Adam Schiff was just caught fabricating a text message from Jim Jordan to Mark Meadows. We have all the details. And speaking of January 6th, our dear friend Liz Cheney, and her alliance with the Democrats to punish members of her own party has repercussions. Tonight, we speak to the woman who launched a primary against her in Wyoming. Plus, the DNC held a holiday party last night. You were not there, what? And Nancy and Joe were showing their age. Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen. But first, we won't be fooled again. That's the focus of tonight's angle. If there's one thing that most Americans agree on, it's that they're tired of COVID. A new Monmouth poll shows that 60 percent feel worn out by the pandemic, of those 36 percent said, they feel worn out a lot. That's compared to 39 percent, who say they don't feel worn out at all by the pandemic and it's just restrictions. By the way, who are these people who don't feel worn out by the pandemic? Well, I guess they must either live in red states, where COVID's treated like any other virus, or they're among the bunch running our colleges and universities. Because some college administrators obviously preferred the way things were at the start of COVID. A closed campus, virtual learning, limited students socializing. In fact, the schools loved it so much that they've begun to shut down their normal operations again, almost two years into the virus, they're doing this. Cornell University, which has a 97 percent vaccination rate among students, faculty and staff just issued a COVID red alert and will be completely shutting down campus in the middle of finals week. And by the way, no December graduation ceremony either, all finals are online. Imagine how the parents who shell out more than $60,000 per year or more than $80,000 for out-of-staters, for the kid's tuition, for the room and board. How do the parents feel? Like suckers. At Georgetown University they've canceled all in-person social gatherings and events, and also mandated that final exams be given virtually writing on their website. While these cases are not severe, and vaccination continues to provide strong protection, it is critical that we act to limit the further spread of cases. OK. This makes no sense. Do they shut down the campus for other bugs that are inconvenient, but not deadly? Of course not. Princeton University has also succumbed to lockdown mania, moving finals online, canceling events, and mandating masks. And not to be outdone by Georgetown, Princeton will also be mandating booster shots in order for students to return to campus in the spring. Now this boosterism will obviously pick up steam at universities across America, even though there's no indication that the boosted escape symptomatic Omicron infection. Right now, the booster is required at Smith College, UMass Amherst, Bentley, NYU, GW, Notre Dame and others. And the deadlines for getting your boosters are coming up. As terrifying a thought as it is, universities are the leading indicator as to where government is actually going. Fauci already tipped his very small hat on this issue.",

Take the Cornell outbreak for instance, in the last week, the school has recorded nearly 900 cases and according to the school's VP of University Relations, virtually every case of the Omicron variant to-date has been found in fully vaccinated students. A portion of whom had also received a booster shot. In other words, the booster may not hurt you, but it won't necessarily help you either. So why insist on it at all, especially for younger healthy kids and adults. But that's not the only evidence. We can look abroad to a place like Gibraltar, the so-called most vaccinated place in the world. 99 percent of the population there is vaxxed, and over two-thirds are boosted. Yet, Gibraltar has seen cases increased with 66 new daily infections reported on average, equivalent to 52 percent of its peak back in January. Now this has prompted local officials to cancel Christmas parties, official events, and they're urging people to hold off on getting together for any Yuletide fun. Now since Gibraltar is part of the UK, I should note that the booster brain bug has infected British leaders as well.",

Students should all hunker down together, take their exams and be done with it. The last thing you want are the kids rushing home to be virtual and taking their exams virtual and then spreading COVID to their elderly relatives. But that's precisely what the scenario, the scenario that's been created by these universities. Now, to most normal people, turning a society upside down for a virus is simply insane. We already know the costs have been catastrophic. So, why do liberals love lockdowns and mandate so much? Why? Thinking about this today, I asked a bunch of friends, I think liberals are truly more comfortable living in a lockdown world. They don't trust people to make their own decisions, unless it's maybe it's about stuff like abortion, pot, or porn. And they generally low the people who live in, especially the red states and thus want to dominate them control them. Every time they get a chance to restrict people's freedom, they'll do it. This is their default position. Watching what's happening in Australia, in Europe, at our colleges, I really believe that some parts of the world may never be free again, not for years, maybe even decades. So, you have a big decision to make. What kind of country do you want to live in? What type of governor, do you want leading your state? Thankfully, here in the United States, we do have a lot of free states. But the Far Left went crazy on the Atlantic magazine recently for merely publishing an article about how outside urban areas, Americans have essentially moved on with their lives and don't really pay much attention to COVID anymore. That's misinformation, the radicals wail, you're putting public health at risk by just reporting that. Of course, that's just another lie and a classic exercise and projection. It's the fear mongers, the panic pushers, the control freaks, who've destroyed lives. They've robbed children of joy and experiences. They've driven teenagers to suicide and adults to drug overdoses. Fauci, Walensky, the entire public health cabal have become their own contagions. But now more Americans are on to their sick, twisted game. And they won't be fooled again. If you want your life back, if you don't like where all this is heading, you'll have to start organizing now, because by the Election Day in 2024, we could be up to eight boosters. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Dr. Houman Hemmati, Board Certified MD, Ph.D. research scientist. Dr. Hemmati, what's your message to the schools that are now locking down over this Omicron variant?",

You did it once, for over a year, closed down colleges, universities, elementary schools all the way through high school? And did we do anything in a meaningful, tangible way to reduce spread, to reduce hospitalization, to reduce death. That was before even we had vaccines. It was before we had medications. And it was before we actually knew how the virus transmitted and how it infected people and who was at risk. Now, we know all those things. We have vaccines, we have amazing medications with many more in development, they're about to come out. And on top of that we know how this transmits and how it doesn't transmit. And most importantly, we know that the young are not generally at risk. And with this Omicron variant, especially, it's not causing any hospitalizations or deaths. You look at Cornell's president admitted today, that kids in their college, these university students have not become hospitalized or died. There's an outbreak, but it's an outbreak just like an outbreak of a cold. Sure, you have a lot of infections in terms of numbers, but they shouldn't be looking at infection numbers, they should be looking at how many people actually are sick, very sick, or even dying, and they're not. And so, what's - this is a blessing. It's nice, it's wonderful. But unfortunately, if you begin to treat this with hysteria, and hype and panic, you're actually making things worse, not better.

      "utterance": "Alright. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. The January 6th Committee continues to embarrass itself. Adam Schiff was just caught fabricating a text message from Jim Jordan to Mark Meadows. We have all the details. And speaking of January 6th, our dear friend Liz Cheney, and her alliance with the Democrats to punish members of her own party has repercussions. Tonight, we speak to the woman who launched a primary against her in Wyoming. Plus, the DNC held a holiday party last night. You were not there, what? And Nancy and Joe were showing their age. Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen. But first, we won't be fooled again. That's the focus of tonight's angle. If there's one thing that most Americans agree on, it's that they're tired of COVID. A new Monmouth poll shows that 60 percent feel worn out by the pandemic, of those 36 percent said, they feel worn out a lot. That's compared to 39 percent, who say they don't feel worn out at all by the pandemic and it's just restrictions. By the way, who are these people who don't feel worn out by the pandemic? Well, I guess they must either live in red states, where COVID's treated like any other virus, or they're among the bunch running our colleges and universities. Because some college administrators obviously preferred the way things were at the start of COVID. A closed campus, virtual learning, limited students socializing. In fact, the schools loved it so much that they've begun to shut down their normal operations again, almost two years into the virus, they're doing this. Cornell University, which has a 97 percent vaccination rate among students, faculty and staff just issued a COVID red alert and will be completely shutting down campus in the middle of finals week. And by the way, no December graduation ceremony either, all finals are online. Imagine how the parents who shell out more than $60,000 per year or more than $80,000 for out-of-staters, for the kid's tuition, for the room and board. How do the parents feel? Like suckers. At Georgetown University they've canceled all in-person social gatherings and events, and also mandated that final exams be given virtually writing on their website. While these cases are not severe, and vaccination continues to provide strong protection, it is critical that we act to limit the further spread of cases. OK. This makes no sense. Do they shut down the campus for other bugs that are inconvenient, but not deadly? Of course not. Princeton University has also succumbed to lockdown mania, moving finals online, canceling events, and mandating masks. And not to be outdone by Georgetown, Princeton will also be mandating booster shots in order for students to return to campus in the spring. Now this boosterism will obviously pick up steam at universities across America, even though there's no indication that the boosted escape symptomatic Omicron infection. Right now, the booster is required at Smith College, UMass Amherst, Bentley, NYU, GW, Notre Dame and others. And the deadlines for getting your boosters are coming up. As terrifying a thought as it is, universities are the leading indicator as to where government is actually going. Fauci already tipped his very small hat on this issue."

      "utterance": "You know my own personal opinion Kate is what you said is correct, it's going to be a matter of when, not if. Our booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron. If you are fully vaccinated, get your booster shot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But as I already said, data shows that the boosted can still carry the virus and spread the virus. Take the Cornell outbreak for instance, in the last week, the school has recorded nearly 900 cases and according to the school's VP of University Relations, virtually every case of the Omicron variant to-date has been found in fully vaccinated students. A portion of whom had also received a booster shot. In other words, the booster may not hurt you, but it won't necessarily help you either. So why insist on it at all, especially for younger healthy kids and adults. But that's not the only evidence. We can look abroad to a place like Gibraltar, the so-called most vaccinated place in the world. 99 percent of the population there is vaxxed, and over two-thirds are boosted. Yet, Gibraltar has seen cases increased with 66 new daily infections reported on average, equivalent to 52 percent of its peak back in January. Now this has prompted local officials to cancel Christmas parties, official events, and they're urging people to hold off on getting together for any Yuletide fun. Now since Gibraltar is part of the UK, I should note that the booster brain bug has infected British leaders as well."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They can't prevent transmission. For the 100th time, the vaccines do not stop viral transmission. So, why on earth are they shutting down schools again, it makes zero sense. Students should all hunker down together, take their exams and be done with it. The last thing you want are the kids rushing home to be virtual and taking their exams virtual and then spreading COVID to their elderly relatives. But that's precisely what the scenario, the scenario that's been created by these universities. Now, to most normal people, turning a society upside down for a virus is simply insane. We already know the costs have been catastrophic. So, why do liberals love lockdowns and mandate so much? Why? Thinking about this today, I asked a bunch of friends, I think liberals are truly more comfortable living in a lockdown world. They don't trust people to make their own decisions, unless it's maybe it's about stuff like abortion, pot, or porn. And they generally low the people who live in, especially the red states and thus want to dominate them control them. Every time they get a chance to restrict people's freedom, they'll do it. This is their default position. Watching what's happening in Australia, in Europe, at our colleges, I really believe that some parts of the world may never be free again, not for years, maybe even decades. So, you have a big decision to make. What kind of country do you want to live in? What type of governor, do you want leading your state? Thankfully, here in the United States, we do have a lot of free states. But the Far Left went crazy on the Atlantic magazine recently for merely publishing an article about how outside urban areas, Americans have essentially moved on with their lives and don't really pay much attention to COVID anymore. That's misinformation, the radicals wail, you're putting public health at risk by just reporting that. Of course, that's just another lie and a classic exercise and projection. It's the fear mongers, the panic pushers, the control freaks, who've destroyed lives. They've robbed children of joy and experiences. They've driven teenagers to suicide and adults to drug overdoses. Fauci, Walensky, the entire public health cabal have become their own contagions. But now more Americans are on to their sick, twisted game. And they won't be fooled again. If you want your life back, if you don't like where all this is heading, you'll have to start organizing now, because by the Election Day in 2024, we could be up to eight boosters. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Dr. Houman Hemmati, Board Certified MD, Ph.D. research scientist. Dr. Hemmati, what's your message to the schools that are now locking down over this Omicron variant?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. HOUMAN HEMMATI, BOARD CERTIFIED MD",
      "utterance": "Well, my message Laura, is this, you did it once, and what did it achieve? You did it once, for over a year, closed down colleges, universities, elementary schools all the way through high school? And did we do anything in a meaningful, tangible way to reduce spread, to reduce hospitalization, to reduce death. That was before even we had vaccines. It was before we had medications. And it was before we actually knew how the virus transmitted and how it infected people and who was at risk. Now, we know all those things. We have vaccines, we have amazing medications with many more in development, they're about to come out. And on top of that we know how this transmits and how it doesn't transmit. And most importantly, we know that the young are not generally at risk. And with this Omicron variant, especially, it's not causing any hospitalizations or deaths. You look at Cornell's president admitted today, that kids in their college, these university students have not become hospitalized or died. There's an outbreak, but it's an outbreak just like an outbreak of a cold. Sure, you have a lot of infections in terms of numbers, but they shouldn't be looking at infection numbers, they should be looking at how many people actually are sick, very sick, or even dying, and they're not. And so, what's - this is a blessing. It's nice, it's wonderful. But unfortunately, if you begin to treat this with hysteria, and hype and panic, you're actually making things worse, not better. And as you pointed out, Laura, they're sending the kids home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, they're treating this like its smallpox. This is, this is lunacy. I mean, I wake up every day and say, are we still doing this? Is this really what we're still doing? I mean, I know you must know people. Dr. Hemmati, I certainly, I know, four people, just over the past week, who've gotten COVID, both vaxxes and boostered have COVID in their late 20s. They're healthy people, late 20s have a scratchy throat, a little congestion. But that's about it. They're sitting at home and they're calling friends and texting. But they're all boosted and vaxxed, and they're still getting it, but they're fine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMATI",
      "utterance": "Correct. And by and large, the young, that's their experience, and even to the middle age, but the young, especially, college students, and school kids are not where we need to focus. If we are actually concerned, which maybe we should be maybe not. But if we are actually concerned, maybe we should be imposing these restrictions on nursing homes and hospitals, limit visitors to nursing homes. That's a great way to do it. But why schools, why the people who are at least risk doesn't make any sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, Dr. Hemmati, given the recent surge in cases, though, in the northeast, I want you to listen to Joe Biden from August. BIDENL Make no mistake. So that's the - excuse me, the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas account for one-third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now fast forward to today, Dr. Hemmati. In New York now has nearly doubled the average daily cases as Texas, and about four times as Florida. So that's despite a 71 percent of vaxx rate in New York, only 63 percent in Florida, just 56 percent in Texas. What does that tell you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMATI",
      "utterance": "Look, what it tells us is that this is a virus, right. And it's just like any other virus. The virus mutates and it becomes resistant to vaccines. And what it also tells us is that a vaccine doesn't necessarily reduce infection. What the vaccine does is it may reduce and people who are at risk severity of infection for many of them, it may reduce the risk of hospitalization or death for many of them. But in terms of stopping the virus, ending the pandemic, stopping spread. It's very clear that this is not going to happen. Just by relying on vaccines alone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Early therapeutics should be a key tool in the toolbox, correct? Not lockdowns."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMATI",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Look, we have those therapeutics, many more are in development and should be approved very soon. And once those are, they should become as widespread as candy, we should make these available to people. So, the moment they begin to have symptoms, even before they wait for a test, get the medicine and then you can find out if you're infected, continue it. And if not, you can stop. And this way we can really reduce the rates of hospitalization and death, which is really what matters, not the case counts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We already have a lot of those therapeutics, Vitamin D, zinc, and a lot of other good stuff out there. But there'll be more. Dr. Hemmati, great to see you tonight. Thank you. And a new round of university lockdown has exposed the deep seated corruption in higher education. A fact that a university could take money from students and force vaccines on them, then shut down anyway is outrageous. Joining me now is Todd Zywicki, Professor of Law at George Mason University, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute. Todd, parents and students should be demanding refunds if they start doing this virtual stuff again, correct?"

    {
      "speaker": "TODD ZYWICKI, GEORGE MASON LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "That's right, Laura, and I'm a parent and a professor. As a parent, my son's a senior in college, he lost a year and a half of college. Yes, it was great to have him home. But these kids need to be in school, you go to college to go to college. And are they seriously going to talk about shutting down again. As a professor what I've seen among my peers in the academy, it's basically these neurotic baby boomers and these titled millennials, who really don't want to teach, they want to go online, they don't want to go to the trouble of commuting and that sort of thing. And so, they're jumping in every chance they can to basically stop teaching in the like. The universities take these kid's money, they take the parents money, they build these miraculous rec centers and dining halls and all this sort of stuff. And then they lock them in their dorms. And it's just - it's not what we are supposed to do as professors, and people who run universities, we're supposed to take care of these kids, we're supposed to educate these kids and not teach them to fear their own shadow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

They've already had COVID, many of them, they're being forced out of school. A lot of these schools don't - are very stingy with the exemptions. They're being forced out. University of Chicago, other state universities. This is terrifying, they're healthy, young people, healthy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYWICKI",
      "utterance": "That's right. And as you said, Laura, especially if they have COVID. If you're talking about a kid who's 20 years old, who's already had COVID. I mean, that's as good as it gets pretty much and at that point, all you're talking about with vaccines are side effects. And what we know is that the side effects are even greater for young people after they've recovered from COVID. And so, it's just really vicious. It's a really inhumane policy, a one-size-fits-all policy that basically forced these kids, but to choose between interrupting their education and having to really risk their health in order to do this. And as you said, the vaccines don't really stop transmission, anyway. And a kid who's already had COVID in particular does nothing at all."

Adam Schiff, as you note has a lengthy history of doctoring evidence, fabricating evidence, making up stories. He claimed for years that he personally had seen evidence that Donald Trump was a trader who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. The idea that this Committee which is staffed full of people who falsely claimed that Donald Trump stole the 2016 election, and put the country through so much trauma for so many years, with their lies, lies about that, lies about the first impeachment. They actually doctored evidence in the second impeachment, doctoring evidence appears to be what they do. In this case, he mischaracterized the actual context of this, this note, which was relaying legal advice from someone else. He falsely claimed that it was written by Jim Jordan, which is kind of funny, because Jim Jordan doesn't usually write complex legal arguments and send them out in text form. And then they deleted paragraphs of this actual note to make it seem different than what it was. But this is just what they do, because they're not actually in the search for truth. They're in the search of scoring partisan points."

It's good that they're admitting that. They first falsely claimed that they were trying to show evidence of a grand conspiracy for an insurrection that everybody on the Right was participating in. Yesterday, when Liz Cheney who has such difficulty. She's such an emotional difficulties right now, she by reading those texts showed that her own claims about some grand conspiracy of an insurrection on the Right were false, that everybody on the Right condemns political violence, and that they're very consistent about doing so. And so, this January 6th Commission isn't about what they had falsely claimed. But they're also - I think it's really important to note, the January 6th Commission is in violation of its own rules, it is required to have a certain number of members that it doesn't have. It is required to have a Republican ranking member, Liz Cheney has been falsely presenting herself as the Republican ranking member when she was in fact, picked by Pelosi, and there is no Republican ranking member on the committee. That is required, that is required that they have won because they're supposed to run their subpoenas by the Republican ranking member. They're supposed to coordinate with the Republican ranking member. The Republicans are supposed to get equal time to ask questions. Liz Cheney is falsely presenting herself as filling that role, when in fact, she was chosen by Nancy Pelosi, so she's a Democrat appointed member of the committee."

But we just had a poll come out last week. It shows that I'm leading Cheney by 20 points. So things are going very good in Wyoming. And as I said, I've been traveling the state. I cannot even tell you about the number of people that I've been meeting with over the last several months. And the fact is that every time that I go to a new town, there more and more people who show up. And the one message that I hear over and over again is you have to defeat her. I go to restaurants, I've been sitting in restaurants eating meals, and I have people come up to me that I've never met my life, and they say the only thing I want to say to you is you have to beat that woman. You have to send her packing. She does not live in Wyoming, she's not from Wyoming."
