It's why, as a kid, every wanted to be -- everybody wanted to be Simon in a game of Simon says. It's like becoming a narc who sells cocaine or a New York Governor with faster hands than a blackjack dealer.  But then there's Cori Bush. This fiery ball of hypocrisy makes Maxine Waters sound like Mahatma Gandhi.

I am not sure you can find a truer version of fascism taking shape if you watched home movies of Mussolini. For -- in order for the radical to assume power, they must follow the -- these three key steps: undermine the stability of institutions that keep us secure, claim they are for equality for the people, then, gain power and assume authority, minus the previous safeguards for citizens. Suddenly, their promise of equality evaporates in the police that they so vilified, now works for them only.   Meet the new boss, worse than the old boss because this boss has no interest in actual equality, only punishment. Of course, this is the same lady who vowed revenge against the McCloskey couple, after the Missouri governor pardon them after they pled guilty to misdemeanors, after pointing guns at trespassing BLM protesters.",

They've already shut down the First Amendment and they're working their way through the list. They're like Brian Stelter eating his way through the menu at McDonald's.  Now, Bush claims she gets death threats, and I don't doubt it. If you're in the public eye, that's a certainty. I get them regularly, almost always from the same e-mail address. But at least you know, at least -- at least Kat has the decency to threaten me in person. But do I have a full security detail? No. Well, yes, if you count my yellow belt and slap fighting from Tiger Showmance.  So, it's getting weird. The radicals are no longer in the streets spitting at cops, destroying property. They're now in office. They're making changes and they're taking names. They are protected, and you are not. It's not the end of the world. But what's that look like anyway? Does it all come at once or in dribs and drabs? Radicals are really good at this stuff. They know America is a distracted and ambivalent Gulliver in the land of Lilliput, addicted to their screens. While we scrolled, they strolled right in and they tied us down. While we got fat and relaxed glued to Twitter and TikTok, the rads overtook teachers' lounges, H.R. departments, government. And the only thing standing between us and these petty tyrants is a doddering president whose only passion is ice cream. It's time to put the phone down and start stepping up. It's time to get as pissed off as they are. Playing Candy Crush or words with friends, are not going to cut it anymore.",

And go with good old fashioned qualification. That way race, ethnicity, and gender wouldn't play a role in hiring. Again, that's assuming everyone's guilty of conscious and unconscious bigotry. Well, that backfired like a weapon maintained by sailors who spent all their time at diversity training. This week, the Vice Admiral in charge of personnel did an about face it admitted that removing photos actually caused diversity to tank. And that's because all that was left was experience and credentials to go by. Meaning, at its core wokeness is racist. And like all racism, it's a big dumb waste of time. Unless you're a diversity consultant, then you turn a profit faster than anyone selling earplugs in Kat's apartment building. So, now, they're reconsidering adding photos back in. The lesson here, when you try too hard to be woke, you end up focusing on race instead of making sure your boats don't crash. I personally demand headshots of every one of my potential minions. Not because I'm racist, but because I don't want anyone working for me to be any more good looking than I am.

Now, \"Jeopardy\" has seen a slew of guest host since Alex Trebek passed away including Dr. Oz, why? Katie Couric. And of course, Ken Jennings.

It's like becoming a narc who sells cocaine or a New York Governor with faster hands than a blackjack dealer. But then there's Cori Bush.

They've already shut down the First Amendment and they're working their way through the list. They're like Brian Stelter eating his way through the menu at McDonald's. Now, Bush claims she gets death threats, and I don't doubt it. If you're in the public eye, that's a certainty. I get them regularly, almost always from the same e-mail address. But at least you know, at least -- at least Kat has the decency to threaten me in person. But do I have a full security detail? No. Well, yes, if you count my yellow belt and slap fighting from Tiger Showmance. So, it's getting weird. The radicals are no longer in the streets spitting at cops, destroying property. They're now in office. They're making changes and they're taking names. They are protected, and you are not. It's not the end of the world. But what's that look like anyway? Does it all come at once or in dribs and drabs? Radicals are really good at this stuff. They know America is a distracted and ambivalent Gulliver in the land of Lilliput, addicted to their screens. While we scrolled, they strolled right in and they tied us down. While we got fat and relaxed glued to Twitter and TikTok, the rads overtook teachers' lounges, H.R. departments, government. And the only thing standing between us and these petty tyrants is a doddering president whose only passion is ice cream. It's time to put the phone down and start stepping up.

Last September in an effort to boost diversity among seamen, the Navy announced it would mix of fissile photos and determining officer promotions. Did you hear that? They got rid of the photos. And go with good old fashioned qualification. That way race, ethnicity, and gender wouldn't play a role in hiring. Again, that's assuming everyone's guilty of conscious and unconscious bigotry. Well, that backfired like a weapon maintained by sailors who spent all their time at diversity training. This week, the Vice Admiral in charge of personnel did an about face it admitted that removing photos actually caused diversity to tank. And that's because all that was left was experience and credentials to go by. Meaning, at its core wokeness is racist. And like all racism, it's a big dumb waste of time. Unless you're a diversity consultant, then you turn a profit faster than anyone selling earplugs in Kat's apartment building. So, now, they're reconsidering adding photos back in. The lesson here, when you try too hard to be woke, you end up focusing on race instead of making sure your boats don't crash. I personally demand headshots of every one of my potential minions. Not because I'm racist, but because I don't want anyone working for me to be any more good looking than I am. Here my latest candidates for my personal assistant, this is Hans, this is Lars, and this is Clive. They're also playing. It's a shame I had to let them all go.

And they're trying to get as many different individuals from certain groups, and these are in places military, CIA, where you'd think that meritocracy would be a thing that we could all agree on. You just want the best people to make sure that planes aren't blowing up or that we're beating the enemy. But it turns out, there's a lot of stuff that goes on. Here's the issue that it runs into time and again, they want quotas, essentially. But we know we can't have quotas, that's a legal issue. So, they want to get as close to a quota as they can, without actually saying we have a quota. This is true at Harvard. That's why it's going to Supreme Court right now. So, they're trying to find a way to make it seem like there's a meritocracy, but diversity is a holistic consideration.

Hurray. \"Jeopardy\" executive producer Mike Richards is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the show as its permanent host. Well, he could be the best \"Jeopardy\" host since Richard Dawson. But the actual deal may take a while as all the negotiations are in the form of a question. I've got a smattering of humor. Now, \"Jeopardy\" has seen a slew of guest host since Alex Trebek passed away including Dr. Oz, why? Katie Couric. And of course, Ken Jennings. The show's highest winning and most famous contestant, who is also a jerk, so if he's out of the running, that would be great news. I'd also know exactly which show should deserve credit."
