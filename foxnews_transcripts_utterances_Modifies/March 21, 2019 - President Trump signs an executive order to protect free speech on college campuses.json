You're looking live at the East Room, where the president of the United States is about to sign an executive order that he says will put brakes on federal grants on colleges accused of stifling free speech.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And how is all of this going to work?  Let's go to Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest -- Kevin.",

      "sentences": "Always good to be with you, Neil.  Keep this in mind. The president has made this clear for some time. If you're getting federal dollars in your college or university, you better be offering free speech and fair speech, or else. Let me take you back to 2017, for the people who sort of haven't been following this story for quite some time. The president going all the way back then made it clear that he was very disappointed in one school in particular, the University of California, Berkeley.  He said: \"If U.C. Berkeley doesn't allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view, no federal funds?\"   Well, it's a viewpoint, Neil, you will recall, he echoed once again a few weeks ago during an address to the Conservative Political Action Convention right here in Washington, D.C. In fact, there, he previewed today's executive order. Now, all this, by the way, comes after the now infamous assault that occurred last month on the Cal Berkeley campus, when a Turning Point USA recruiter was viciously attacked. I just want to share some of the highlights from the executive order the president is laying out today. He wants to promote free speech. Colleges could be denied certain federal research and education grants if they don't comply with federal standards.   Data transparency. He wants to require the Education Department to publish information on earnings, debt, default rates and loan repayment rates to colleges, creating sort of a scorecard, if you will. And, lastly, risk-sharing. That would require the Education Department to submit policy recommendations about institutions sharing the financial risk of student loans. Here's the president just a short time ago.",

You have seen on many college campuses, if you think a certain way, you're not allowed to speak, or they say, well, the security, it will cost too much. We can't have you come.  That all ends today.

And if they are, if there's a paper trail, and you could imagine, my friend, there will be a lot of people watching this carefully, they can run afoul of federal dollars, and we're talking about into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Neil. I don't think you want to mess with this if you're a college or university. You want to make sure that you're informing your -- not only your institution, but in particular your security personnel, be careful, be fair, offer access, and, most importantly, and this is crucial, protect the people when they come to speak -- Neil.",

I mean, it's a well-known fact that nine out of 10 liberal -- college professors are liberals.   So providing this other conservative voice, another point of view is important on campuses. So the different departments and agencies are going to put some enforcement mechanisms in place. We don't know what those look like yet. And there are some serious questions around that.

So they're a little more downbeat than a U.S.-focused person would be. I mean, it's very likely our tax cuts basically kick in as a sort of economic stimulus plan, or we would be in the same boat as many of these European countries. It's also true, as the president noted, that rates went a little too high too fast. We weren't in that hot of an economy. I personally think short-term rates should have been 2 percent. That's it, and they should let longer-term rates be at 3, and kept up some of the quantitative tightening. That would have given everyone the confidence of a normal yield curve. Right now, we have this issue of it looks recessionary, to Gary's point, and that in itself is scaring people. But, again, I think the tax cuts word a good time, coincidentally perhaps, and the president was right. Rates went a little too high in a not-that- strong global economy.",

You're looking live at the East Room, where the president of the United States is about to sign an executive order that he says will put brakes on federal grants on colleges accused of stifling free speech. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And how is all of this going to work? Let's go to Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest -- Kevin."

If you're getting federal dollars in your college or university, you better be offering free speech and fair speech, or else. Let me take you back to 2017, for the people who sort of haven't been following this story for quite some time. The president going all the way back then made it clear that he was very disappointed in one school in particular, the University of California, Berkeley."

Berkeley doesn't allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view, no federal funds?\" Well, it's a viewpoint, Neil, you will recall, he echoed once again a few weeks ago during an address to the Conservative Political Action Convention right here in Washington, D.C. In fact, there, he previewed today's executive order. Now, all this, by the way, comes after the now infamous assault that occurred last month on the Cal Berkeley campus, when a Turning Point USA recruiter was viciously attacked. I just want to share some of the highlights from the executive order the president is laying out today. He wants to promote free speech. Colleges could be denied certain federal research and education grants if they don't comply with federal standards. Data transparency. He wants to require the Education Department to publish information on earnings, debt, default rates and loan repayment rates to colleges, creating sort of a scorecard, if you will. And, lastly, risk-sharing. That would require the Education Department to submit policy recommendations about institutions sharing the financial risk of student loans. Here's the president just a short time ago."

Now, to hear White House officials tell it, Neil, this has real teeth, because it has a mechanism now to punish universities that don't offer free and total access to competing voices. You have seen on many college campuses, if you think a certain way, you're not allowed to speak, or they say, well, the security, it will cost too much. We can't have you come. That all ends today. And that's the White House's aim here -- Neil, back to you."

They are going to actually try to look at what the schools are doing when speakers try to come. Are they shutting them out specifically? And if they are, if there's a paper trail, and you could imagine, my friend, there will be a lot of people watching this carefully, they can run afoul of federal dollars, and we're talking about into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Neil. I don't think you want to mess with this if you're a college or university. You want to make sure that you're informing your -- not only your institution, but in particular your security personnel, be careful, be fair, offer access, and, most importantly, and this is crucial, protect the people when they come to speak -- Neil."

We got Democratic strategist David Burstein, and last, but not least, GenBiz spokesperson David Grasso. Holly, for the president, can an executive order settle fairness on college campuses?"

And I think what the president's doing here is putting those schools on notice that, hey, we're not going to tolerate what you have done in the past, maybe made too many excuses for not letting other voices be heard on your campuses. I mean, it's a well-known fact that nine out of 10 liberal -- college professors are liberals. So providing this other conservative voice, another point of view is important on campuses. So the different departments and agencies are going to put some enforcement mechanisms in place. We don't know what those look like yet. And there are some serious questions around that. But, first of all, it's putting everybody on notice and we're having a good conversation about it, which is important, I think."

      "utterance": "Well, I think this is thought leadership. You know, it's going in the right direction. And some of the some of the things that are buried in this executive order include a lot of student loan reforms, not only a scorecard on am I getting a good value for my education? What type of debt have I financed my education with? Because people don't realize that all student debt isn't created equal. There's subsidized debt. There's unsubsidized debt, et cetera, et cetera."

Maybe you should consider an A school. And to me, while a lot of this is hard to enforce, like free speech, I agree with you 100 percent. I think it's thought leadership and it's a step in the right direction. We have to take a stand. And I think this should be bipartisan and popular amongst all people. Well, so far, it is not bipartisan."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

The colleges nixed it, they say, for the students' safety, but, again, it tilts the guest list for those to speak at these schools. The president is trying to address that by -- with a mechanism that will make sure they're able to speak and the schools don't cancel them. But how do you do that?"
    },

      "speaker": "DAVID BURSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's a big part of the problem here, because, frankly, I don't think any -- well, I will say, for myself, I believe that students on college campuses, actually, there's a lot of research on the brain that actually shows it's really important for people have access to diverse viewpoints. People can always choose not to go, right, so there's no way to force people to listen."
    },

      "utterance": "I mean, and you had this incident at Yale where -- and you have had a number of these where professors are extremely liberal have run afoul of students and their -- and their personal views. So I do think there's a real problem here, because the enforcement is the question. It's the same question of how do you enforce these questions about what speech should be allowed online or not that we have been talking about. You can't just sort of say, we're going to do this, because it really gets into really fundamental philosophical questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Then it gets into something that conservatives typically wince at, and that is the government coming in to rectify the situation. And I'm wondering, as the president signs this executive order to enforce this, whether that will be the tricky part."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, but, again, they're getting billions and billions of dollars of my money that I worked really hard to earn. And I want to make sure that my money's being spent in a way that promotes lots of different views. So the president is representing the base of America who's paying taxes, working hard. They don't want their tax dollars going to support far-left, left viewpoints all the time. We need some diversity. We will see what the enforcement mechanism..."

      "utterance": "It's a really tough thing, it's a really tough case to sell. And in a lot of cases too, you have to look at it's not only instruction. There's also research -- $40 billion a year goes into research. And there's ways -- there are tangible ways to make research more bipartisan. I 100 percent agree with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The only thing I think they can do is here is just to let conservative speakers, or if there's going to be a conservative protest, allow it to go without people getting unhinged, and I guess the occasions on the left that happens to allow that to happen, so there could be a free debate at these schools."

      "utterance": "Right. So, if the president wants to make a statement about it to his base, which seems like -- which is mainly what executive orders do -- they have said the details on this are going to be forthcoming. But how do you even just define conservative? How do -- from a legal perspective, how would you define what makes something conservative vs. liberal, right?"

Real quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad here. There is a growing optimism right now that this market, despite all the tweets and the disruptions and everything else along the way, continues to raise higher, on optimism about technology, optimism about Apple, and optimism about the economy moving forward.

The FBI is now investigating not what happened with the crashes, but how these planes got approved by the United States government, in other words, how the FAA wrote off on it and how it passed all the government checks to become a vibrant choice for so many who are now at the point of looking at thousands of orders worldwide over the next few years. Now, that could be in doubt, this as Southwest pilots are saying they need a lot of extra training on these planes , particularly after the latest proposed software update, and so many are unaccustomed with the planes in the first place. Former acting FAA Administrator Barry Valentine. Barry, what was your reaction when you heard the FAA -- or the FBI was looking into how these got readily approved?"

That's a very complex technical exercise. And the Department of Transportation has fairly limited resources within the Office of the Inspector General, so it doesn't surprise me that they may have asked the FBI to provide support for them in going through this process. Also, it's one that I think everybody is interested in seeing addressed in a timely fashion, so the more resources, the better for being able to complete the full audit process."

    {
      "speaker": "VALENTINE",
      "utterance": "Oh, it's huge, because the FAA basically sets the standards for design, for construction and full performance of the aircraft. And then the manufacturer has the obligation of proving to the FAA that it, in fact, has met the design construction and performance standards that are required. And that is a collaborative effort between the FAA and the manufacturer, again, not just with Boeing, but people who make engines, people who make propellers, people who make helicopters, all kinds of craft, go through this same process of demonstrating that they meet the standards that are required."

And I should mention that I over the last many years have worked with a number of foreign civil aviation authorities to see that their version of the FAA is in fact providing adequate safety oversight of their airlines. And the training is an airline obligation. That's not the manufacturer's obligation. That's the obligation of the operator of the airplane to see to it that the crews, the people who fly and are on the airplane are qualified and trained to be doing the jobs they're doing. And I will say, candidly, that the degree to which that is done varies from country to country. I will put it that way."

People defend them. Then when everybody starts going crazy saying, how can you possibly do this, and everybody still digs in their heels and gets even more protective of the president. So the bottom line is, he gets away with it. It doesn't change things. And so he's not going to change at this point. And so I think he just needs to move on. This is one of those things that a lot of people accept the president because of his policies and forgive his personality quirks. And I would say this is even more than a personality quirk.

They think that he's calm, cool and collected. He represents a lot of things that is missing from the debate today. He doesn't seem angry. And that's really refreshing to folks. And then, when you talk to people who are in the room with him, they say there's just something about that guy. And I can tell you, almost every time when you're on the campaign trail, you feel it. There's an electricity around a certain candidate and you know it. And last time, it was Trump. Before that, it was Obama. And you feel it.

This was a who's-who in the business community meeting here in Washington, D.C., with President Trump earlier today for a discussion with the Business Roundtable Just to give you a few names that the commander in chief sat down with, for example, President Trump meeting with Jamie Dimon, Craig Menear if Home Depot. Josh Bolten is the CEO of the Business Roundtable, by the way. And Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple there as well, along with the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, the top trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, other members of the administration. Trade, I am told, Neil, was a focus of the of the discussion. The president talking about, I'm told, China with this group, the USMCA deal that's now in the hands of Capitol Hill, along with a possible trade deal with the E.U. As it was put to me, the president made the case for his negotiating style, i.e., tariffs. Now, it was also described to me that many within the room praised the state of the economy. However, the Business Roundtable as a group also revised its GDP forecast downward for the year from 2.7 percent to 2.5 percent. There was a concern among some that maybe some of the -- some of what we're seeing overseas with the global economy could present a headwind to the economy back here at home in the U.S. Just a little while ago, our friend Maria Bartiromo sat down with President Trump over here at the White House, interviewed him, and asked him about some of those slowdown concerns. And the president used it to once again criticize the Fed chair, Jay Powell. Watch here."

So they're a little more downbeat than a U.S.-focused person would be. I mean, it's very likely our tax cuts basically kick in as a sort of economic stimulus plan, or we would be in the same boat as many of these European countries. It's also true, as the president noted, that rates went a little too high too fast. We weren't in that hot of an economy. I personally think short-term rates should have been 2 percent. That's it, and they should let longer-term rates be at 3, and kept up some of the quantitative tightening. That would have given everyone the confidence of a normal yield curve. Right now, we have this issue of it looks recessionary, to Gary's point, and that in itself is scaring people. But, again, I think the tax cuts word a good time, coincidentally perhaps, and the president was right. Rates went a little too high in a not-that- strong global economy."

There's a little bit of rampant bullishness going on. But, overall, on a daily basis, I continue to see a clear lack of institutional selling. And on a day like today, I got to tell you, it's one of the best days I have seen a long time. It was almost like the Dow could have been up 600 points today.

Congressional Democrats are ramping up their own investigations. So it seems impervious to what the final report will be anyway. Anyway, attorney Lisa Kuharksi joins us, former federal prosecutor Jon Sale. Lisa, to you first. What are the rules on releasing all of that?

It could be a 400-page report that he sends to Barr. But we won't really know. And then Barr then takes this report. And, once again, he can redact it, and he can do deliver certain information.

      "utterance": "Well, let's -- let's be honest, right? The president has said, let's make the report public. So once he gets it, can now he hide behind his own words? And it does also give more weight to the Democrats saying, we should have subpoena power. What's confidential about the report, now that it's gone to the president? I mean, he doesn't have an absolute right to see the report. It kind of is -- the authority -- he's obviously the chief of law enforcement in the United States, and he appoints the people at Justice. And Justice -- he can simultaneously receive the report from Mueller, but really Barr can determine when he releases that. The likelihood that he has had access to conversations, that he has insider information that we don't have is certainly very high. And, as we all know, lawyers have a way of dispersing information without really saying it. So it's kind of interesting. But I think that it would indicate that Trump is feeling pretty good about what he's been told thus far."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, how do you decide who goes in that event?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "So, the first people that you're looking at is, you're going to look at the female heads of household. You're going to look there first and hope that that's going to alleviate some of the stress. The family units will then be -- the full family units will then be next. So there is absolutely a pecking order. We don't -- we do not let murderers go. We don't let known rapists go. We don't let people like that go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Whoever these people are let go, whether they're mothers or anyone, or the head of a family..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "... there's no way to keep following them, right? You don't have the resources to do that. So you really have no idea where they end up, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "No. No, we don't. I mean, they do have to provide us with an address that they say that they're going to. And that's the address that we will ultimately serve their court documents to. But, again, whether or not they actually go there, we never know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, in the end, would a longer, firmer, bigger wall prevent this sort of thing? The president says yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, what you have to do is, you have to be able to physically keep people from entering the United States. If they set one foot in the United States, they have the right to claim asylum. Once they claim asylum, they get put through that process. If we're able to physically keep people out, and to monitor the number of people that are coming through the actual ports of entry, which is the legal way to do it, then we can effectively drive down these numbers of people that are crossing the border illegally. But, unfortunately, it's just not happening today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so this emergency, as the president declares it, is very much an emergency to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes, I agree with him 100 percent. Again, 21 years in the Border Patrol, I was right in the thick of everything in the Tucson Sector when we were -- when we were making more arrests than at any time in the history of the Border Patrol. Right now, we're dealing with more people. We're on pace to deal with more people than we have ever dealt with before. This is in fact an emergency. It's greater than 2014. It's greater than the early 2000s, the mid-2000s. This is an emergency, and we're seeing -- seeing the effects of it right now."

      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
