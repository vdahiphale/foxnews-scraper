And it's also going to take oversight from Congress, folks like myself, to make sure that it actually happens.

So we have got to get a handle on that.  Some of this -- some of this bill will deal with that. We also have to figure out a way to expedite hiring, because there is a shortage. And you have to go through the bureaucracy of getting hired for that.

Look, I know that there's a lot of politics that are going on, where, on the left, they're like, OK, you are privatizing the VA. And let me get it very clear what my position is. It is the duty and the responsibility of the government to care for our veterans when they come back. However, there should be more private options that are out there. There are parts of the country that need -- that need the private sector to be able to supplement the VA and/or compete in some areas. And there are some areas that, quite frankly, need to VA to help them in their private care.
