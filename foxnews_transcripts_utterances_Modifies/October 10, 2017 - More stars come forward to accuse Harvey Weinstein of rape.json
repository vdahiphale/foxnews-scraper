Meantime, the chorus of condemnation of Weinstein is getting louder, Nicole Kidman and George Clooney among the latest to speak out. And former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who once considered the movie mogul a political supporter, issued a statement a couple of hours ago saying, quote, I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior. Now, Jesse, interesting to note that like the Clintons, the Obama's were also close to Harvey Weinstein. We have not yet heard from president or Mrs. Obama, who once described Harvey Weinstein as a, quote, wonderful human being, that was at the White House in 2013, Jesse.",

But also, here's a woman who normally -- she handles sort of class action, very high profile, sexual abuse, sexual assault cases. Gloria Allred has done the same thing.

We've seen it in other high profile cases this year. I want to take care to point it out. We're getting reactions now from Hollywood celebrities who have been working with him for decades, some of them. People like George Clooney, and Jennifer Lawrence, and Angelina Jolie, and the list goes on and on and on. A lot of folks who have spoken out to condemn Harvey Weinstein do so quite eloquently. I'll cite George Clooney who said straight up this is indefensible.  The problem with a lot of responses we're seeing, to me, comes from the things they say after they call him out. George Clooney himself did this in his interview. People like him and Jennifer Lawrence say that they have not personally been witnessed or privy to any of these behaviors from Harvey Weinstein. This is something we see all the time. And I don't know if there's a legal basis for this here, if there's legal reasons, like they're covering their butts and that's why they include things like this in their statements, but it just rubs me the wrong way that they will take care to say they haven't seen it. When do people rape and sexually assault victims in front of other people? Of course you haven't seen this behavior. Of course, Harvey Weinstein didn't ask a young woman to watch him take a shower naked in front of somebody else. This happens in private. Perpetrators go to great lengths to cover up their crimes. It's like if you're talking about a murderer in a court of law, well, I never saw him murder. You know, this is horrible but I never saw him murder anyone. Of course, you didn't.",

That little baby, Donald Trump, beat two dynasties, Bush and Clinton. And won three Democratic states in the election. I think he's just doing fine without adult supervision. Second of all, Corker likes to say the president is unfocused and off message. Trump has been hitting tax return hard reform. Corker is the one who's off message. Tweeting at the president? How does that help the people of Tennessee? Throwing spit balls at the president? No one likes Washington politicians. This only helps Trump's base when he punches these guys. I don't understand what Corker's objective is. It hurts the party. And to say that this is alienating senators from voting against his legislation, Corker is a true conservative.

So he was the first person shot at 9:59. At 10:06, the firing began on the people down here. And that, of course, lasted for 11 minutes.

Did somebody call it in? So you have to get all the call logs, see if anybody called down to say, \"OK, we heard a shot fired.\" What was, then, the response time going up? Obviously, the security guard, Mr. Campos, threw him off, because he wasn't expecting that. He was trying to start shooting. So that delayed him. And then he was trying to secure, you know, that room. And then he knew at that point that there was no chance to escape. Because if they would be coming in, and he had anticipated if they were going to come in, he was going to be able to see them with those cameras that he set up. But I think that's important. You look at the other piece of evidence that he had all those explosives in his car. If he was going to try and then escape, have a route to escape, and then drive that car into another location to explode it or detonate. It's very interesting. And you're just wondering whether or not there's any other materials in his house or he had anything written down. Because it seems he went to great, great lengths. OK? Not just a gun enthusiast or someone who liked to go do target shooting, but who really is this guy? What is his real background and his identity? And I really would start and look at source of funds and the financial trail to try to figure out, where was he sending money? Where was he receiving money? To find out kind of the story behind this.

Meantime, the chorus of condemnation of Weinstein is getting louder, Nicole Kidman and George Clooney among the latest to speak out. And former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who once considered the movie mogul a political supporter, issued a statement a couple of hours ago saying, quote, I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior. Now, Jesse, interesting to note that like the Clintons, the Obama's were also close to Harvey Weinstein.

But also, here's a woman who normally -- she handles sort of class action, very high profile, sexual abuse, sexual assault cases. Gloria Allred has done the same thing. Harvey Weinstein made sure that he hired her so she would have to recuse herself so she wouldn't be able to parade a dozen women before cameras.

We've seen it in other high profile cases this year. I want to take care to point it out. We're getting reactions now from Hollywood celebrities who have been working with him for decades, some of them. People like George Clooney, and Jennifer Lawrence, and Angelina Jolie, and the list goes on and on and on. A lot of folks who have spoken out to condemn Harvey Weinstein do so quite eloquently. I'll cite George Clooney who said straight up this is indefensible. The problem with a lot of responses we're seeing, to me, comes from the things they say after they call him out. George Clooney himself did this in his interview. People like him and Jennifer Lawrence say that they have not personally been witnessed or privy to any of these behaviors from Harvey Weinstein. This is something we see all the time. And I don't know if there's a legal basis for this here, if there's legal reasons, like they're covering their butts and that's why they include things like this in their statements, but it just rubs me the wrong way that they will take care to say they haven't seen it. When do people rape and sexually assault victims in front of other people? Of course you haven't seen this behavior. Of course, Harvey Weinstein didn't ask a young woman to watch him take a shower naked in front of somebody else. This happens in private. Perpetrators go to great lengths to cover up their crimes. It's like if you're talking about a murderer in a court of law, well, I never saw him murder. You know, this is horrible but I never saw him murder anyone. Of course, you didn't."

The actress who's never had a role who comes forward, and who knows their story is going to be squashed by a press who is complicit. Who has these book deals, who have these movie options, and therefore, they're not going to report on the story. The Matt Damon's of the world who squashed the 2004 New York Times story. It's really easy for Gwyneth Paltrow to come forward in 2017, when it's safe to go ahead and tell this when she has benefited from these relationships for decades. It's another thing that brave women are the ones whose careers were destroyed, who were sent packing back to the Midwest."

That little baby, Donald Trump, beat two dynasties, Bush and Clinton. And won three Democratic states in the election. I think he's just doing fine without adult supervision. Second of all, Corker likes to say the president is unfocused and off message. Trump has been hitting tax return hard reform. Corker is the one who's off message. Tweeting at the president? How does that help the people of Tennessee? Throwing spit balls at the president? No one likes Washington politicians. This only helps Trump's base when he punches these guys. I don't understand what Corker's objective is. It hurts the party. And to say that this is alienating senators from voting against his legislation, Corker is a true conservative.

And the very first shots that were fired were not down on the crowd here in Las Vegas but through a door into a hallway at a security guard who worked for Mandalay Bay who happen to be on that 32nd floor because there was a door alarm, an open door alarm that he was responding to. So he was the first person shot at 9:59. At 10:06, the firing began on the people down here. And that, of course, lasted for 11 minutes.

      "utterance": "You know, this is a pretty significant disruption in the story of what they had told and the timeline. And so much of this is, you know, critical in terms of the minutes that transpired. What kind of response they gave, whether or not they should have been alerted to shots fired up on that floor. Did somebody call it in? So you have to get all the call logs, see if anybody called down to say, \"OK, we heard a shot fired.\" What was, then, the response time going up? Obviously, the security guard, Mr. Campos, threw him off, because he wasn't expecting that. He was trying to start shooting. So that delayed him. And then he was trying to secure, you know, that room. And then he knew at that point that there was no chance to escape. Because if they would be coming in, and he had anticipated if they were going to come in, he was going to be able to see them with those cameras that he set up. But I think that's important. You look at the other piece of evidence that he had all those explosives in his car. If he was going to try and then escape, have a route to escape, and then drive that car into another location to explode it or detonate. It's very interesting. And you're just wondering whether or not there's any other materials in his house or he had anything written down. Because it seems he went to great, great lengths. OK? Not just a gun enthusiast or someone who liked to go do target shooting, but who really is this guy? What is his real background and his identity? And I really would start and look at source of funds and the financial trail to try to figure out, where was he sending money? Where was he receiving money? To find out kind of the story behind this. You hear the girlfriend saying, \"Well, he was making noises in the night. He seemed to be deteriorating mentally.\" Was he? Or was she just saying that?"

    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "Yes, because then he started shooting almost immediately. The security guard was shot at 9:59. He -- the shooter was active from 10:05 to 10:15. And where was the police? If they know a security guard was shot, and you've got an active shooter, you would think it will be less than two hours from the time he shoots the security guard until the shooter is pronounced dead. That was two hours. It was 9:59 to 11:58. Something happened here that they're not telling us about. And if there is a major element of this story that we're not aware of, that we're being shielded from, maybe you should let people know, and that would -- that would open up a whole new stream of tips. Because obviously, this shift in the timeline, this is pretty significant, because was he planning on shooting at the moment he started? Because it seems like he was jarred into action, with the camera either exposing the security guard outside or being confronted by him."

A mother bear and her two cubs entered the Antonio's Real New York Pizza in Estes Park, Colorado, after hours this past Sunday and went on a pizza eating spree. I'm familiar with it. Gobbling up the dough -- yum, yum, yum -- in the fridge before moving onto the salami. Yes. So the pizza place posted the video footage on its Facebook page, with a note that this could have been so much worse. The business says the bears caused some damage, including ripping out a window of the wall at the drive-through. They were hungry. They went bear crazy on it.
