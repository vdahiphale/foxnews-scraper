Or do you want to sit back and let terrorists hatch their plots and watch Americans die at home and on the battlefield? It's either/or, Tom. Either/or. One or the other. I challenge you to come on this broadcast and answer that question. Of course, Tom Brokaw will not do that, much too difficult. And he wouldn't associate with the peasants here on The Factor. No. He is up here. It drives me crazy. This stuff really makes me angry.  Now, it is worth noting that during World War II, USA did target civilians in Japan and Germany. It did what it had to do to win the war to deal with Tojo and the Nazis but now we have cadre of Americans who for some reason don't feel that the USA has a right to defend itself.   Every decent person laments civilian casualties anywhere. But again, in war, they happen. So, it's time to knock off the nonsense. The war on terrorism is real. The dead and wounded in Boston are real. And this ridiculous left-wing moral equivalency is insulting. And that's \"The Memo.\"",
