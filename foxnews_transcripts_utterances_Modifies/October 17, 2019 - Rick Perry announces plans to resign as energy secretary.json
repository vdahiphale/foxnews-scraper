It got the Turkish president to see the light and maybe because, the White House says, he also saw something else, the sanctions. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And it looks like the Turks have backed down, but that doesn't mean they're going put all their weapons down, at least not yet.

I want to share this from the foreign minister: \"We got what we wanted. There was an agreement that the Turkish armed forces will control this area, the YPG's heavy weapons will be collected. We will put Operation Peace Spring on hold for 120 hours so the YPG can vacate. This is not\" -- repeat -- \"this is not a cease fire.\" So, sometimes, it's all about the language.

That's in connection with illegal campaign finance contributions. U.S.-born David Correia and Ukrainian-born naturalized citizen Andrey Kukushkin are really peripheral figures to the broader investigation that now involves President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. They are charged, along with two other co-defendants, with making political donations of a foreign source, which is illegal, to win influence for a recreational marijuana business. According to the indictment, an unnamed foreign national on two separate occasions wired $500,000 from a foreign bank account as part of the conspiracy. The money was to be spent on state and national elections in Nevada and New York and elsewhere. Now, the two other defendants, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens born in the former Soviet Union, face additional and more serious charges. They were not in court today. The pair assisted Rudy Giuliani and his efforts to dig up damaging information about Joe Biden and his son Hunter in the Ukraine. They also paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for legal work. According to a 21-page indictment, Parnas and Fruman made illegal campaign contributions to an unnamed congressman to seek help in removing or recalling the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, who some Trump supporters considered to be critical of the administration. That unnamed congressman is Pete Sessions. A grand jury has now issued Sessions a subpoena for records in the case, including documents dealing with Giuliani. Sessions is not believed to be a target of the grand jury. And his office says he is cooperating with investigators. According to a published report, Sessions met at least on one occasion with all three men. That's Giuliani, Fruman and Parnas. And in a separate matter, that same indictment, Neil, says Parnas and Fruman made an illegal $325,000 contribution to a pro-Trump super PAC using a bogus company in order to conceal their involvement and the true source of the funding. The indictment says the pair sought to advance their own interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official, that official not named in the indictment. Now, as I said, the pair is slated to be arraigned next week here in Lower Manhattan in federal court. And as for Rudy Giuliani, Neil, he says he has done nothing wrong and was only trying to expose corruption in the Ukraine -- Neil.",

And it doesn't appear at this point as he has the parliamentary numbers to do so. That is because the DUP, his Northern Irish allies, do not agree with his deal. The main problem has always been how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. And the solution they have reached now is that, for the next few years, Northern Ireland will remain more closely aligned with the E.U. than the rest of the U.K. But this deal does hit many key points that Boris Johnson was seeking. Crucially, it allows the U.K. to negotiate its own free trade deals, and it also ends freedom of movement and unchecked immigration from Europe. So Boris Johnson now has two days to sell this to his own party, to his allies, to his rebels in the Labor Party as well. It's an uphill battle. He will have to cajole and bribe.

And it's not even a deal. It's a new E.U. treaty binding in international law. Now, look, he's made some progress on a couple of issues. But here's the kicker. The next stage of this would be a negotiation for a trade deal. Already, the European Union have said, we have to have regulatory alignment.

And that means we will not really be able to get back control of our borders, our laws and our money.

And so this agreement essentially gives them, by agreement through pen and paper, what they were trying to accomplish through slaughter and military means. So this is unacceptable, in the sense that we -- and it's like -- it's a second betrayal of our Syrian Kurdish allies. So, a 120-hour pause, good, but giving Erdogan everything that he wanted, including the ability to ethnically cleanse a big swathe of Northeastern Syria, not acceptable.

But it will require Turkey to stop slaughtering the Syrian Kurds, not just for 120 hours, but permanently, stop them from aiding and abetting ISIS, and requiring them and their proxies to return to where they were before they began this attack. So it's up to Turkey whether these very tough sanctions take place, but Congress is going to proceed as swiftly as possible, I hope.",

But you're still asking them to give up their homes and to give their communities and to relocate themselves. And, Neil, I think what we want to do is to see Turkey stop the fighting, and we want to see the Kurds protected. And the Kurds, the SDF has been very active in helping us to corral and to capture and to hold and to remove ISIS from this area. And they are protecting some of those prisoners.

So what do you want? Basically, which wasn't exactly how the meeting came apart. And it sort of went downhill from there. And there was obviously some back and forth. But, look, the biggest part of this is sort of the way the president talks to people. A lot of people have asked me if I was surprised. No. I mean, this is the way the president communicates.

      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. The two men left the courthouse just a few moments ago. They pled not guilty to a single charge of conspiracy. That's in connection with illegal campaign finance contributions. U.S.-born David Correia and Ukrainian-born naturalized citizen Andrey Kukushkin are really peripheral figures to the broader investigation that now involves President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. They are charged, along with two other co-defendants, with making political donations of a foreign source, which is illegal, to win influence for a recreational marijuana business. According to the indictment, an unnamed foreign national on two separate occasions wired $500,000 from a foreign bank account as part of the conspiracy. The money was to be spent on state and national elections in Nevada and New York and elsewhere. Now, the two other defendants, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens born in the former Soviet Union, face additional and more serious charges. They were not in court today. The pair assisted Rudy Giuliani and his efforts to dig up damaging information about Joe Biden and his son Hunter in the Ukraine. They also paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for legal work. According to a 21-page indictment, Parnas and Fruman made illegal campaign contributions to an unnamed congressman to seek help in removing or recalling the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, who some Trump supporters considered to be critical of the administration. That unnamed congressman is Pete Sessions. A grand jury has now issued Sessions a subpoena for records in the case, including documents dealing with Giuliani. Sessions is not believed to be a target of the grand jury. And his office says he is cooperating with investigators. According to a published report, Sessions met at least on one occasion with all three men. That's Giuliani, Fruman and Parnas. And in a separate matter, that same indictment, Neil, says Parnas and Fruman made an illegal $325,000 contribution to a pro-Trump super PAC using a bogus company in order to conceal their involvement and the true source of the funding. The indictment says the pair sought to advance their own interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official, that official not named in the indictment. Now, as I said, the pair is slated to be arraigned next week here in Lower Manhattan in federal court. And as for Rudy Giuliani, Neil, he says he has done nothing wrong and was only trying to expose corruption in the Ukraine -- Neil."

He got concessions from them and then they ratified it at the summit in Brussels today. But that wasn't even the hard part. Now, as you say, he has to pass it through the British Parliament. And it doesn't appear at this point as he has the parliamentary numbers to do so. That is because the DUP, his Northern Irish allies, do not agree with his deal. The main problem has always been how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. And the solution they have reached now is that, for the next few years, Northern Ireland will remain more closely aligned with the E.U. than the rest of the U.K. But this deal does hit many key points that Boris Johnson was seeking. Crucially, it allows the U.K. to negotiate its own free trade deals, and it also ends freedom of movement and unchecked immigration from Europe. So Boris Johnson now has two days to sell this to his own party, to his allies, to his rebels in the Labor Party as well. It's an uphill battle. He will have to cajole and bribe.

      "utterance": "Thank you. No, I don't. I mean, Boris calls it a great new deal. It's not great. It's better than what Theresa May negotiated. So I would now rate it as only being the second worst deal in history. It's not new, because 95 percent of it is the same as the previous agreement that Parliament rejected three times. And it's not even a deal. It's a new E.U. treaty binding in international law. Now, look, he's made some progress on a couple of issues. But here's the kicker. The next stage of this would be a negotiation for a trade deal. Already, the European Union have said, we have to have regulatory alignment. That means that our employment legislation, our environmental law, even our tax policy has to fit in with the European Union. And that means we will not really be able to get back control of our borders, our laws and our money. And, for America -- and here's the key thing -- it'll be many, many years now before we're allowed to negotiate a free trade deal with America, if we can do it at all. I would much rather, Neil, we scrapped this and had a clean break, a straightforward divorce. Let's just leave and get on with our lives."

It's better, but it's not good enough. And far, far better at the next general election, whenever that comes, that we work together in a leave alliance -- and I'd be very happy to do that."

We'd be half in, half out, stuck in a never-neverland, have years more of acrimony with these negotiations here in Brussels. I hope it fails. And I hope, in this next space that comes along, we get a national general election. And if Boris gets to that point and says, right, OK, do you know what, I'm going to get rid of this idea. We have tried it time and time again. It's failed. Let's go for the clean break. And the clean break means we can start talking to you guys seriously about doing a real trade deal. That's a win- win for both of us."

With him being a no-vote, and some of these other parties likely being no- votes, the 320 votes that Boris Johnson would need do not appear readily there. So we could be missing something and things could change. Let's say it fails. What does that mean for us and our markets, and theirs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALAN KNUCKMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, the markets usually have it right. And we had a pretty strong reaction on the British pound this morning. It had bottomed about out at 120 back in September. It got up to 130, a level it hadn't seen in a long, long time. Now, I'm more about price than politics. And what I see today is another example of a relief rally. We had one on Friday, when Trump declared victory. We had one today, when Brexit looks like it's going to be done. We're starting to see stocks stabilize. And we're starting to see -- I hate to use this word -- certainty. But the markets right now are 1 percent from the all-time forever top, after all of what we have seen. And, essentially, the S&P has traded between 2800 and 3000 since April. So that target is 3200 on this overall 10-year upward climb. We're in the middle of earnings season. I think that's going to show us the way. You can see how banks made $20 billion the first day on earnings in four banks alone, pure profit. So I think we're still on the right path. The bull market is not dead."

I don't know if that applies now that the Turks have decided to at least dial things back, some go as far as to say an outright cease-fire. There's a raging debate about that. But Chris Van Hollen is here. You just saw him there, Democrat of Maryland, who joins us right now. Senator, thank you for coming."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "So, Neil, first, if I could just say a word about the loss of a great Marylander from my state, the loss of a great American, Elijah Cummings, today. And the bipartisan tributes you see in his honor are a testament to the fact this was a person of principle and dignity and integrity, whether you agreed with him on every issue or not."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "So I just wanted to thank our colleagues for their expressions of support and condolences. The short answer to your question is, Senator Lindsey Graham and I have spoken. And we intend to proceed full-bore with our legislation and the sanctions. While a 120-hour cease-fire is welcome, the other terms of this agreement are 100 percent what President Erdogan and Turkey wanted in the first place. This is the entire reason they attacked our Syrian Kurdish allies, because they wanted to establish this about 20-mile zone within Northeastern Syria, where they would essentially clear out the people who live there, the Syrian Kurds. And so this agreement essentially gives them, by agreement through pen and paper, what they were trying to accomplish through slaughter and military means. So this is unacceptable, in the sense that we -- and it's like -- it's a second betrayal of our Syrian Kurdish allies. So, a 120-hour pause, good, but giving Erdogan everything that he wanted, including the ability to ethnically cleanse a big swathe of Northeastern Syria, not acceptable. And it will allow ISIS to come back and rebound, because it means our Syrian Kurdish allies are going to be spending their time addressing the Turkish threat, rather than the ISIS threat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, the president was surprised, we're told, yesterday, Senator, before this meeting he had with top congress men and women, that this repudiation of what he did in Turkey was -- just soured everything. Now, I talked to Republicans yesterday about what their definition happened in that room, today, Democrats what happened in that room. I don't know if you were there. But what it does seem to me is that this issue, leaving impeachment aside, this issue has stopped everything. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I wasn't in the room, Neil. I saw the same reports and images that you did. But I can say that President Trump's decision to withdraw those 100 U.S. Special Forces who'd been fighting with our Syrian Kurdish partners against ISIS, and, therefore, allow Turkey to attack the Syrian Kurds, and allow the resurgence of ISIS, has had a very strong bipartisan negative response here on Capitol Hill, which is why I have joined with Senator Lindsey Graham and a bipartisan group of senators to impose sanctions on Turkey until the conditions are met. We hope these sanctions don't take place. But it will require Turkey to stop slaughtering the Syrian Kurds, not just for 120 hours, but permanently, stop them from aiding and abetting ISIS, and requiring them and their proxies to return to where they were before they began this attack. So it's up to Turkey whether these very tough sanctions take place, but Congress is going to proceed as swiftly as possible, I hope."

Of course, he's been sort of brought up in this whole Ukraine investigation, who spearheaded what into talking to him. But he is stepping down as energy secretary. We will have more after this."

No time frame given on that, from what I can tell. Axios reporter Caitlin Owens. Caitlin, have you heard anything on this or know what transpired? I know he had been talking about or kicking around, the reports were, that he would be stepping down, but not this soon. What do you know?"

But it looks like, first of all, Rick Perry, the energy secretary, he has been -- he's really been dragged into this Ukraine scandal that's at the heart of the House's impeachment investigation right now. As news has dribbled out, his involvement has become more prominent. And now we have the news that he is resigning."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",

But he's -- again, as I said, he's become -- emerged as a very prominent player in the Ukraine scandal, involved in the pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. So, as the details of that have come out, now he is involved in scandal and is subsequently resigning."

And so this decision, while not entirely surprising, when you consider the length of time of service -- as you know, secretaries come and go -- but I do think it's worth pointing out, given the Ukraine story, the timing is all the more curious."

Three issues for that, the corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate."

      "speaker": "CORKE",
      "utterance": "Well, Democrats have also in the past pressured leadership and Ukraine to, for lack of a better description, play ball with ongoing investigations. In fact, we saw proof of that today. But I think the real issue for Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff is, was he clear in making the argument that it is business as usual to sort of have the sticks and the carrots? That's part of diplomacy, is what he was effectively saying. But in this environment, Neil, it may have come off a bit wrong-handed."
