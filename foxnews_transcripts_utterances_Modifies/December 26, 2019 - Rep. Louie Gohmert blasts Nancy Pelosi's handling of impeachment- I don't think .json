Well, House Democrats have just been caught -- and you'll be shocked -- have just been caught in one gigantic lie. For weeks, Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler told that President Trump must be impeached as quickly as possible.  They called him an imminent danger to our democratic republic and they forced him a vote in record time.  But now, Speaker Pelosi is still stalling. At this hour, she is still refusing to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.  And President Trump is calling her out today. He tweeted, quote: The radical left, do nothing Democrat said they wanted to rush everything through to the Senate because, quote, President Trump is a threat to national security, end quote. They are vicious, will say anything. But now, they don't want to go fast anymore, they want to go very slowly. Liars.  And, of course, the president is correct. Over Christmas, President Trump had even more to say about Pelosi's impeachment charade. Watch this.",

And second of all, I think she wants to influence the Senate trial, even though under Article I Section III of the Constitution, she has no power or authority over it whatsoever.

I mean, if you look at the American people who understand that this is a sham, and they understand that he was -- he's absolutely right that Nancy Pelosi is doing a disservice to this country. And she's doing a poor job.   And what that means is that she's not taking seriously her oath of office to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution. And this is a sham impeachment, not just from a political, partisan talking point. I mean, certainly, there are those of us who support President Trump but we support him because we understand that the Constitution does not allow the House to impeach for any reason whatsoever.

She knew two years ago from a letter from Devin Nunes that mirrors that -- his committee in the House found exactly for the most part, what the Horowitz report found, and she -- and the court is behaving as though all of this is brand-new and is shocking.

I mean, if there was something that went wrong here, it went wrong in the FISA court. Think about this -- it totally does not give anyone who's been monitored throughout the FISA court has no representation whatsoever, the one thing that the president said that so important here about getting rid of these bad players in the swamp is the fact that he needs to clean house, because if there's nobody to represent, think about this, that's the Fourth Amendment right to unreasonable searches and seizures.

Kerry, let me start with you because this entire environment here, when you're looking at the media covering the Democrats, the nature of what it is they're covering for, accusing Donald Trump of wanting the circus. He is not in charge of the Democratic Party. He didn't choose these candidates. They are dealing with the mess of what Barack Obama left them in the wake of Obamacare and his eight years. So, Donald Trump is sitting back and trying to run the country at the same time.

In particular, President Trump is, in fact, warning California and Governor Gavin Newsom, fix your state's homeless crisis or the feds are stepping in. And today, Trump continued to call out Newsom and Nancy Pelosi, tweeting, quote: California leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population, two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on -- sorry, should focus on that and her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem.

And second of all, I think she wants to influence the Senate trial, even though under Article I Section III of the Constitution, she has no power or authority over it whatsoever.

JENNA ELLIS, SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Yes, you know, the reality is politically that President Trump approval ratings and his polling numbers are the highest they've ever been and the Republican fund-raising is the highest it's ever been. I mean, if you look at the American people who understand that this is a sham, and they understand that he was -- he's absolutely right that Nancy Pelosi is doing a disservice to this country. And she's doing a poor job. And what that means is that she's not taking seriously her oath of office to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution.

I mean, certainly, there are those of us who support President Trump but we support him because we understand that the Constitution does not allow the House to impeach for any reason whatsoever.

Today, even \"The Washington Post\" called out MSNBC's Rachel Maddow for promoting the discredited Steele dossier, you know? I mean, I guess earlier today, if you thought a pig was flying past your window, you are correct. Joining us now with more, our FOX News contributor Sara Carter and John Sullivan, along with former U.S. attorney Brett Tolman. Thank you all for joining me here on this day after Christmas. I really do appreciate it. But, look, the left never stops so were not going to stop either. And when I say we, it really is a matter of the point that is reliant on the facts of the matter. And the nature of what is genuinely occurring. And let's start with, you know, what the president alluded to there, Sara, and Kim Strassel has a good piece because there's so many details, sometimes it can get confusing. We know that the main FISA judge is now bemoaning, oh, all this stuff, it's awful, from the Horowitz report, we've got to get all the new information, and, you know, how can we trust you? She knew two years ago from a letter from Devin Nunes that mirrors that -- his committee in the House found exactly for the most part, what the Horowitz report found, and she -- and the court is behaving as though all of this is brand-new and is shocking. Is this FISA judge, and is the FISA judge, possibly part of the swamp and part of the problem here?"

You know, we have known this for some time, those of us that have been investigating this obviously who have been knee-deep in all of this mess here in Washington, D.C., that according to Devin Nunes report and the original report that he wrote, that the FISA court must have known this. I mean, if there was something that went wrong here, it went wrong in the FISA court. Think about this -- it totally does not give anyone who's been monitored throughout the FISA court has no representation whatsoever, the one thing that the president said that so important here about getting rid of these bad players in the swamp is the fact that he needs to clean house, because if there's nobody to represent, think about this, that's the Fourth Amendment right to unreasonable searches and seizures. And what the FBI did, Kevin Clinesmith, being the FBI attorney in the case of Carter Page, was stomped all over -- all over Carter Page's rights, which were the rights of all American citizens. So --"

In 2007, there are problems with national security letters, create some new procedures. In 2016, as Obama was exiting the presidency, his Justice Department dropped hundreds of violations belatedly on the court. No one got a consequence then. That's why the greatest dirty political trick in American history was allowed to be carried out, no one fears the FISA court."

And, you know, just to add what we've heard it, the FISA court is a court that has extraordinary power that is able to actually get around the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments and delay their application to the targets that they are investigating. That's enormous power. So, now, we don't have accountability but we have the increased power that's been given, you know, for the last two decades. I was there in Congress when Jim Comey appeared and said, we will not surveil on U.S. citizens. Well, guess what? They did, they have been, and now, we need to find out how many other instances has there been a failure on the part of those who present evidence to our most powerful court."

I'm paraphrasing. But, Sara, we talk about getting rid of agencies or getting rid of particular courts, it really is President Trump interestingly who is standing there are now saying, enough is enough.

Now, the new extreme Democratic Party continues to drift further and further left, embracing open borders, higher taxes, and, of course, far less socialism. None of that does any good for humanity as we've seen historically. And get this, even Democratic insiders are now admitting that Bernie Sanders has a path to the nomination. From \"Politico\", quote: Suddenly, Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign is being taken seriously. Democratic officials, political operatives and pundits are reconsidering Sanders' chances. And if that isn't disturbing enough, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez said she'd be quite honored to be his vice president while admitting she's too young to even hold the office. So, tonight, it could not be more clear the new extreme Democrats are running the party and driving the narrative and putting so-called moderates like Joe Biden, if you want to call him a moderate, I guess in this world he appears to be, putting him on the defensive, because while Biden clings to his front runner stand us, the campaign continues to be plagued by awkward gaffes, a weak record and his son Hunter's shady dealings overseas. But, of course, the media continues playing defense for him. Let's take a look."

A circus is a circus, it's good for him, everybody gets confused, we ended talking about Hunter Biden. That's not good for the Democrats. And once we start going after Hunter Biden, what's next?

So, remember, Joe Biden is literally on tape admitting to a quid pro quo with Ukraine, leveraging taxpayer aid to get the prosecutor fired that was investigating Burisma Holdings and his zero experience son Hunter. And not only that, but a private investigation from a private investigation firm is alleging a new court filing that Hunter Biden is actually the subject of multiple criminal investigations. But the media would rather just ignore it, and ignore just how disconnected and how dangerous and how destructive this new Democratic Party has become. Joining me now for reaction is Trump 2020 campaign secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, along with \"The Washington Times\" columnist and FOX News contributor, Charlie Hurt, and \"Washington Examiner\" senior campaign reporter, Kerry Picket. Kerry, let me start with you because this entire environment here, when you're looking at the media covering the Democrats, the nature of what it is they're covering for, accusing Donald Trump of wanting the circus. He is not in charge of the Democratic Party. He didn't choose these candidates. They are dealing with the mess of what Barack Obama left them in the wake of Obamacare and his eight years. So, Donald Trump is sitting back and trying to run the country at the same time. Are they looking -- obviously, I think any of the individuals can become a nominee, but it is going to require the Democratic machine effectively to then anoint one. Clearly, they're still nervous about Biden. Are they serious about Bernie Sanders do you think?"

But then Joe Biden, all of a sudden, he's having these gaffes, having the entanglements with his son. And now, you know, we begin to see Elizabeth Warren have her pop. Buttigieg has pop. And then, all of sudden, they're going back down again. Now, we're seeing Bernie Sanders pop up again and they're beginning to wonder what's going on."

He's not really taking to task by the media at all. Elizabeth Warren was because of the absurd Medicare-for-All $52 trillion circus. So, she took some hits. So, she -- but the moment that any attention is paid to them, they sink. Charlie, do you think that this is going to be one of the cases where either they are hoping he will, but now, with Elizabeth Warren going away and going down, somebody's who's not mentioned, Charlie, is Bloomberg. Where do you sell all of this coming out in the next month or two as we head into the caucus?"

But, of course, as you point out, he's been running a disastrous campaign. It would not surprise me one bit to see out of all this wreckage, to see a Bernie Sanders wind up without nomination. After all, he won the nomination and 2016. It just so happens that the DNC and the Hillary Clinton got together and conspired to take it away from him but it wouldn't surprise me. But I also think that if Bernie Sanders winds up as the nominee for the party, I think he clearly loses and not only because he's just -- all his -- he's crazy, all his policies are totally infallible to the general election voters. I think they're even unpalatable probably to the cross-section of Democratic voters."

That is like five steps forward, three steps back. So we can't dismiss the effort that has to change the mentality of Americans on the scene. We have seen what they did not anticipate with Donald Trump reminding them of the greatness of the American ideal, and the importance of the republic and certainly capitalism. Kayleigh, at the same time, you've got to the other thing and I've seen the Hunter Biden dynamic, a little bit of a distraction, but it really in a way sits at a quarter of the problem with the swamp. It's the nepotism, the money, and you wonder how do you become a multimillionaire in public service? KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Right."

    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "It certainly will, because, Look, Tammy, when I travel the nation, go all the president's rallies, one thing I hear repeatedly is about the Washington swamp. And this notion that politicians go in, they are enriched, they profit off their time in public service and there's no better example of that than Hunter Biden who had no experience in oil and gas that gets this lucrative his contract in Ukraine, get this lucrative deal in China, both coincidentally after his father either leaves the foreign relations with the country or visits there in the case of China. This sits at the center. And when Hillary Clinton had her email problem and the Bleach Bitting and all of this came out, CNN, MSNBC, they did their best to cover it, to hide it. I was a contributor at the time, I saw it happen. Their attempt to hide these scandals from the American people. But I can tell you this, the American people are smart, they see through it, and they will see the scandals for what it is, just likely they did with the Hillary Clinton one."

Maybe the Hunter Biden thing, if he only had three networks to rely on that were covering up, you would not have all the information to be able to make those determinations. And then you've got Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez who seems to be your the representation of the problem when it comes to the voting, and to literacy, economically, historical literacy of who we are. And she attached yourself to Bernie Sanders, clearly it's not the Kennedy-Shriver Democratic Party anymore. But do you see the social media as part of the change in how the American people are responding in what they are willing to put up with because we're learning more every day?"

      "utterance": "Well, certainly. I mean, social media has a lot to do with this, Tammy. But remember, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also provides a lot of energy to this -- the primary for the Democrats, that the Democrats themselves in this primary really can't provide. But remember, she's not old enough. And unfortunately, they're going to have to wait maybe until 2024."

And with everything else we've seen, I think they're going to reject it in 2020. So, it's heartbreak. It's an important legacy of the American republic. So somebody there is going to have to get there act together. Kayleigh, Kerry, Charlie, thank you very much for joining me tonight. I appreciate it.

Respecting for people who have different type of lifestyles, or respecting people who have different opinions about different matters. And it has to go in both directions. When I hear people say that Hallmark is fascist because they represent a certain sense of traditional values, this is offensive to all. Now, Homer got in trouble because they took back a campaign about two women kissing on the Hallmark movie. Now, I don't -- that's perfectly fine with me, I don't think they should have gotten it back, they should've put it on and kept it on the air. There's nothing wrong with that. But to call them fascist over this? This is a part of the canceled culture, this is part of the college movement that they want to spread throughout life, that if you do anything wrong, you have to stop what you're doing and be canceled if you did anything controversial. If you stand for traditional values, you may not be speak, you may not be on the town square anymore. This is what's happening on college campuses and people want to spread it as a society."

      "utterance": "Well, it's tough, because, really, this is a generational battle with the left against any objective standards. You know, they don't want the 12-inch ruler. They want subjective values. I mean, I don't want to get overly complicated on this, but the whole essence of socialism is replacing our God-given rights, family values, objective items with a subjective rules interpreted by the government. That's the whole reason. I mean, Tammy, none of this by mistake, as you know having been on the left."

      "utterance": "And also, you know, we can agree to disagree on a variety of issues, but now, that is also forbidden because usually, you know, the arguments about tolerance do win out. It is the most intolerance, though, that are now that are on the left. That is where the sexism, racism, the homophobia live. It is a framework that perpetuates the idea that people should be isolated and punished ironically for being different. And that's what all civil rights movements in America were actually about was about demanding do not be treated differently because of who we are. Now look at who is demanding for the opposite now, it's the American left. We can reject it, it's also being aware that this is occurring and being able to have a conversation. Dan and Ari, thank you very much for joining me. I appreciate it. All right. Now, liberal-run cities are as we know, and not surprisingly, spiraling out of control, from coast-to-coast. Charlie Kirk and Deneen Barela's weigh in on that with us coming up next. Stay with us."

      "utterance": "My administration is strongly committed to helping Americans suffering from mental illness. Of the 11 million Americans living with severe mental illness, 4 million receive no mental health service of any kind. If you look at it, over 100,000 homeless individuals and I think that number has to be much, much higher than, Alex, wouldn't you think? They say over 100,000. If you look at some states, they have over 100,000, on in particular. Homeless individuals with serious mental illness. The same time, we need to keep very dangerous people off our streets, we want to take care of the mental illness where we have a lot of very dangerous on our streets."

      "utterance": "All right. Well, that was President Trump, of course. They're speaking out about his plan to take action against the growing crisis in America's major cities. And when I say major cities, they're liberal cities with a major crisis here. Particularly, of course, in California, Los Angeles, San Francisco. In particular, President Trump is, in fact, warning California and Governor Gavin Newsom, fix your state's homeless crisis or the feds are stepping in."

      "speaker": "And today, Trump continued to call out Newsom and Nancy Pelosi, tweeting, quote",
      "utterance": "California leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population, two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on -- sorry, should focus on that and her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem. But that, unfortunately, California cities are not the only ones in crisis. Violent crime continues to get worse in Baltimore because with 338 murders so far in 2019, the city is on track to set per capita record. Joining us now for reaction, FOX News contributor Deneen Borelli, and Turning Point USA founder and president, Charlie Kirk. You know, Charlie, I actually want to start with you. I'm a native of Los Angelino. It's my home state. It's a beautiful state. This is not natural. It's not because the weather is good. It's not because people who live in California are crazy and don't want to live inside. This is new. And every time I go back, every few months, it's worse, over and over again. And it's about liberal policies. What is your take of the sense of, you know, we know this, we discussed this. Newsom seems to be refusing to admit it. What's your take on this as a whole and whether or not California is going to get the act together with President Trump's ultimatum?"

      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, TURNING POINT USA FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Not anytime soon, and California is a test cage of how a beautiful functioning, vibrancy could be ruined it simply because of politics. Only because they voted for Democrats at every single level -- they're run by the public sector teacher unions and radical left-wing groups that have kept the borders open and the streets have now become totally unsafe. In San Francisco, in particular, drug users outnumber high school students, people currently enrolled in school. This is according to not exactly the right wing public station \"The San Francisco Chronicle.\" It's amazing what you're seeing, Tammy, because this is a state that should be leading in every single category, and, fortunately, the homelessness, the drug usage, it has become a public health crisis and the Democrats are simply to blame and yet they keep -- you actually mentioned it in preempting some of the arguments they use. They say, oh, where different it's because of the weather, it's nonsense. If it's because of Democrats, it's because of liberal control and the ruining America's once great city."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And this is does I think, Deneen, similar issue when we're dealing with with Baltimore, is that it shows you that policy matters. The leadership matters. We've seen that with President Trump, changing this horrible trajectory we were on after eight years with Barack Obama, with a horrible economy in fact, the economy brings people. But at the state level, Deneen, when we talk about drug users, I think something like 70 percent of crime, and the shootings, this entire maelstrom of Baltimore is related in some way to the drug trade. Where in policy in this regard, you know, the attempt to make things nicer or easier to people or to not be so harsh on quality of life crimes, isn't that what we are seeing in Baltimore at this stage? What's your take on that?"

      "speaker": "DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, what we are seeing in Baltimore is just absolutely horrible, Tammy. Look, the crime and the violence that we are seeing. Here's the recipe for disaster and you have corrupt politicians and you have some corrupt police officers. So, you have that going on and then you have the fact that there's so many disadvantages that are taking place because of the high taxes, because of failing public schools and onerous regulation."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And, you know, normally, it's horrible and we have the same dynamic in Chicago. You've got gun-control dynamics. But, really, and we've done it here in New York, of this notion of, you know, certain crimes that we see the broken crimes, like if you're urinating outside or drinking in public, that those are -- they are not good to act on those anymore. And those also send signals and have an impact on -- are like drug abuse, that they see it's a victimless crime. But then all of that increases, you know, the drug activity, and then, of course, police issues are not being able to arrest and you got corruption, Deneen, as you noted in the police department is awful. Charlie, I'll give you the last word on if President Trump -- do you prefer him to intervene or do you think he won't?"

    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Yes, the Fed should absolutely get involved. They should get involved in Chicago, Baltimore, and California. This is our country. It's a human rights crisis. It's a public health crisis. And what is happening needs to be addressed. I applaud the president's declaration for possible involvement."
