And during the 9:00 p.m. hour, we will only dip in very, very briefly to remarks from twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton because it would bore you otherwise.  We'll also show you the parallels between Hillary's pathetic 2016 campaign and Biden's basement bunker strategy.  Make no mistake: this new radical Democratic socialist party is a party for America's so-called elites. We'll explain that. They don't care about working people, blue-collar jobs, the Rust Belt, anyone in the Midwest. And true to form, by the way, tonight's big event will be kicked off by Biden's running mate from San Francisco, Kamala Harris.  Now, she's going to introduce this, this night tonight, it's only about a minute and a half, I'm told, two minutes max, and then I'm going to do something on the other side. But I want you to hear it, she'll speak later in the evening tonight. But then, we're going to do something the mob and the media refuses to do, we will actually vet the most liberal senator in 2019, it wasn't -- it wasn't Bolshevik Bernie. It was Kamala Harris. And we'll get to all of that.  Are we ready? OK, what's that -- apparently, she's live let's go.",

I know many of you plan to vote this year, but amidst the excitement and enthusiasm for this election, you've also heard about obstacles and misinformation, and folks making it harder for you to cast your ballot. So I think we need to ask ourselves, why don't they want us to vote? Why is there so much effort to silence our voices? And the answer is because when we vote, things change. When we vote, things get better. When we vote, we address the need for all people to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. So, each of us needs a plan, a voting plan. Joe and I want to make sure you're prepared. If you text \"VOTE\" to 30330, we'll help you come up with your plan and remember deadlines and get ready to vote in your community.   So send that text and encourage your family and friends to send one too. Now, let's enjoy another night of inspiration from around our country. I'll see you a little later tonight. And until then, I turn it over to my dear friend and tonight's moderator, Kerry Washington.",

      "sentences": "My dear friend, Sean Hannity, oh sorry.  That was Joe Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, kicking off night three of the worst infomercial on earth, also known as the Democratic National Convention.   Now, later tonight, she will deliver her, well, full at some point speech. Do not be fooled by anything Senator Harris has to say tonight. Now, no matter what she tries to sell, Kamala Harris is a radical -- far-left political opportunist, doesn't even like her own running mate. Remember, she accused Joe Biden of racism and sexism on multiple occasions. She said that she believes Joe Biden's accusers and Harris accepted the role of Biden's running mate for one reason and I assume she just wants to be president. She only got, what, 2 percent?  And after all, you know, according to a new poll, the majority of Americans and nearly half of all Democrats believe that Joe Biden will not be able to finish a four-year term. Now, sadly, per usual, it's up to us to vet Senator Harris who wants to be the next vice president of the United States. Now, the mob in the media will not tell you the truth. Our big night, we will tell you.  ABC, The New York Times have already referred to her as a pragmatic moderate. That is just a lie, a pure out and outright lie. In reality, she's anything but.  2019, she had a voting record to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders. She was the co-sponsor of that idiotic, socialist Green New Deal in the United States Senate, even wants to ban plastic straws, limit the consumption of your red meat. And she has vowed to enact gun confiscation programs, remember, I guess she chooses via executive fiat. Forget that other branch of government known as the legislative branch. She supports banning all private health insurance and supports Medicare for All, cost estimate $54 trillion, her new green deal estimate. Yeah, that would be $94 trillion. And the decision, she supported the idea of defunding the LAPD $150 million, appealing to the radical anarchists which is a really bad idea.  Now, I highly doubt you'll hear any of these insane radical positions tonight. Thus far, the theme of the DNC has been all about hating Donald Trump, a cult of hatred, psychosis and madness at some levels -- on some levels, along with, of course, vague, typical platitudes and bumper stickers and slogans, what is a clear attempt to mitigate their scary socialist agenda. The DNC might very well be the worst show ever on earth.   Frankly, this convention is so bad, and remember, not a lot of sports going on, not a lot happening -- not a lot of new stuff on TV, and the people are tuning out in droves. Now, what does this mean? We'll let you decide. Network viewership for the first two nights is now down last night a whopping 48 percent. Wow. Keep in mind, four years ago was Hillary Clinton and by the way, nobody particularly liked her. No one, well, was excited by Hillary Clinton, but this year, with Joe Biden, it's even worse. There is zero enthusiasm whatsoever. In fact, that's why he had to shore up, well, Bolshevik Bernie's base by adopting his crazy economic socialist plans and even plagiarizing a lot of -- a lot of it. That's why he has pledged trillions to Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal.  That is why he chose his running mate, the most liberal radical in the United States Senate from California, Kamala Harris. Now during her -second speech last night, yep, the real speaker of the House of Representatives, Pelosi speaker in name only , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez couldn't even be bothered to mention her own party's nominee and then she confirms everything that they're planning to do, which is full on radicalism the most radical ticket of any major party in history. That's how bad this is getting.  Take a look.",

But, hey, at least she's honest about the Democrats' radical socialist agenda, probably why she only got one minute, 60 whole seconds.  Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren who's scheduled to speak tonight has rarely ever been honest about anything true to form. Yesterday, she actually appeared on a DNC Native American panel -- you just can't make this stuff up. Remember, she was falsely claiming for a long time that she was a Native American for decades. She benefited for years from those false claims. And that's not all, yesterday, we also heard from two Louis Farrakhan, one of the biggest racist and anti-Semites in the country, yeah, two of his, well, let's say advocates -- Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory. Remember, they were kicked out of the women's march because of their bigotry, but they were welcomed, arms wide open at the DNC. Biden campaign later tried to distance themselves from Sarsour, but she was invited to appear at the convention. No word from Biden himself. He's in the bunker basement, might be taking a nap preparing for his big day tomorrow.   By the way, why won't he answer why Sarsour and Mallory were invited to appear?  Of course, Joe, he doesn't take any questions from the press. Remember, we told you this since March, Joe Biden has taken a whopping -- by our count - - 34 questions from his biggest supporters, the media mob, 34, since March. We're only 76 days away. He wants to be president. He'd been hiding in his basement bunker the whole time. Trump, well over 1,800. And his campaign is trying its best to hide him away indefinitely. And at this point everyone in the country can see that Joe Biden is struggling. He looks frail. He looks weak. He is constantly confused.  Let's take a look at this incredibly -- well, awkward moment from last night after Biden received enough delegates to be officially nominated to the Democratic socialist party. Take a look.",

Tomorrow, Biden will -- is now set to give a live acceptance speech and, of course, it makes it all the way through without totally collapsing, I'm sure he's been practicing for hours and hours and hours. The mob and the media, they'll give a standing ovation, the greatest speech ever.  At what point is anyone going to ask Biden questions like they asked John McCain in 2008 and Reagan in 1984 about his stamina, his fitness? Again, they did it to McCain and Reagan. His mental alertness, mental acuity, at what point is Biden sit down for an actual interview with any real journalist? I don't think one would hold him accountable anyway. At what point will Biden hold lengthy press conferences where he takes real questions, if ever? Is there something wrong with Joe? Why are they hiding him? What, is he not able to conduct an interview? What is his campaign so afraid of? We're 76 days away from a presidential election.   By the way, before the first debate, 16 states will allow early voting. I'd like to see the first debate before a single vote is cast in the United States. I think that's fair for the American people. You got a major party candidate hiding daily in a basement.  If Joe can't campaign, how do you trust him to be president? Here with reaction from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump is with us. OK, your dad, he's out there. It's not like they're going to give Joe hard questions. When he did the couple of press conferences, like, oh, it's -- I go -- who do I go next to David, it -- from NBC. I mean, something's odd.

The same thing with Michigan, and the same thing with all these.  I mean, the media sets the bar so low -- if my father didn't go to a battleground state for 660 days, oh my god, Sean, they'd be -- they'd be on top of him. They would go -- they'd be going crazy. He didn't even show up in the state that the DNC was supposed to be at. He hasn't been there for two-plus years and everybody gives him a pass. He has taken it for granted. They've set the bar so low.  I mean, all he has to do is live through the interview -- to the speech tomorrow.

I mean, you know, you know, free health care for every illegal immigrant, defunding police. I mean, think about the notion of defunding police. They tried to do that in New York. I mean, they defunded some. They got rid of all undercover police officers in New York and crime went up by 250 percent in three months, it doesn't work. But the point that you're making, Sean, is exactly right, right? They wanted somebody who was an absolute left-wing radical because honestly, even if Joe Biden was in office, you think he's actually going to be running government? I mean, the guy called Arizona \"city\" last week. He said he was running for Senate -- you know, senator of the United States. No, he's running for commander in chief and Arizona is a great state.

No private health care, she feels that it's the right of a president to just bypass the legislative branch of government, take away people's Second Amendment rights by executive fiat. That's pretty radical. She will eliminate fracking. She sponsored the radical New Green Deal in the U.S. Senate. That's $94 trillion. I don't think you need to graduate from Harvard or MIT to figure out when you only take in four and a half trillion dollars a year, that the $94 trillion in 10 years will bankrupt the country.  How is ending fracking and eliminating all fossil fuels -- how's that going to fly in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin and in Ohio and Midwestern states where your dad did bring the jobs back that Biden and Obama's that weren't coming back. But, by the way, the fact that we're fracking is a reason we also have $2 gasoline at the pump right now. It's a reason it costs a little to heat our homes on a relative basis versus seven years ago because my father made this country energy independent. But one other thing about Kamala Harris said that no one's bringing up but I don't know why. She's from San Francisco, beautiful city. Unfortunately, it's gone to absolute hell, Sean. I mean, you look at the crime in that city. You look at the homelessness in that city. You know, you walk down the street. There's people defecating, you know, in the streets. You walk your kid to school and your wife (ph) walking over hypodermic needles. And this is a city that she governed over.   So, you know, if you want the rest of the country, if you want these states, if you want, you know, all these swing states and the rest of the country to emulate San Francisco and the policies, I mean, people can't even live there the taxes are so high and you know again the city's gone to total hell -- you know, if you want -- then she -- then she's the perfect running mate for you. I mean, the problem with the DNC is they're tone-deaf to these issues. They're tone-deaf to what their party stands for and how radical it is, and how disconnected it is. It might work in New York City, Sean, it might work in Los Angeles, but it doesn't work in the other states, and they lose a lot of people.

I mean, we've seen the case studies. They don't work. We've seen this movie. We know how this movie ends. We just saw it over the last three months in New York. They strip out a thousand undercover NYPD officers and guess what? Crime goes up by 300 percent, Sean. This isn't a difficult thing to figure out. And I don't know why they continue to double down on it. This is not a winning issue for them. I mean, stripping private health care is not a winning issue. This is not a winning issue. Getting rid of the Second Amendment, not a winning issue. Coming after people's religion, not a winning issue. I mean, I don't get it. I don't -- I don't get why this is a policy.

When we got into office, the Middle East was a total mess. ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio. They'd just given Iran one of the worst deals ever, a pathway to a nuclear weapon. They were funding terrorism all over the world. President Trump went to the Middle East. He got all the Arab and Muslim leaders together and said, we have to do things differently. He re-established his relationship with Israel and that led to last week, President Trump, you know, achieving a success that nobody thought was possible that they all ridiculed him for trying to accomplish, which is the most significant peace deal in the Middle East in the last 26 years between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

He has a peace framework in Afghanistan. We had like I just said, a peace agreement in the Middle East. He's bringing his troops home. He's reducing -- he's renegotiating deals.  You know, the previous administration, they made a deal called TPP. They -- they were, you know, threatening to help the American workers.

But it requires discipline. It requires him to be ready to begin next week. The important speech for him next week is the acceptance speech where he has to do three things that are difficult to do -- he has to, one, explain in short concrete terms what it is that he's done. More importantly, he's got to say what it is that he wants to do. That second act is absolutely vital to a re-election campaign. And then he needs to find time in that speech to contrast himself with Joe Biden in a way that sticks. And that's difficult to do. I suspect the speechwriters have been hard at work on that for a while.

Donald Trump is increasingly the champion of working people in this country and that's why working people, people with high school degrees, people with not full college degrees increasingly are voting Republican and voting Trump.

You turn this on and there's nothing forward-looking. There's nothing optimistic or exciting about being in the greatest country on earth. Instead, they are still in fear and loathing of Donald Trump because of their envy and jealousy. The fact is -- and it's already been mentioned tonight -- the president is the president because he looks at all Americans. He's been criticized for not necessarily being ideological, but the fact of the matter is it is the forgotten man and woman that he appealed to in because he understands them and he came to love this country, and it's those same individuals who now have realized they voted correctly, it was right to elect Donald Trump, that we want the future. We do not want the past and this is what you I think you're going to see from what I've read about what the convention next week will be is the great American stories as opposed to the misery that the Democrats are living in and they want everyone else to live in. They have not brought up the violence, the anarchy the riots in American cities. They don't bring it up because they don't want to have to answer for it. So that is what the issue is, security, safety for your family, the ability to look to the future is something optimistic. The decision is clear. The president is the same guy he was in 2016. And clearly, he's got a great deal to talk about what he's been able to deliver. The media has conspired against him to keep those stories out of the living rooms of the American people, but everyone is beginning to watch and we will see those numbers change once the convention begins. And I -- just like I saw the president in ‘16, do not underestimate him, he knows what to do, he should trust his instinct and we'll be fine.",

So I think we need to ask ourselves, why don't they want us to vote? Why is there so much effort to silence our voices? And the answer is because when we vote, things change. When we vote, things get better. When we vote, we address the need for all people to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. So, each of us needs a plan, a voting plan. Joe and I want to make sure you're prepared. If you text \"VOTE\" to 30330, we'll help you come up with your plan and remember deadlines and get ready to vote in your community. So send that text and encourage your family and friends to send one too. Now, let's enjoy another night of inspiration from around our country. I'll see you a little later tonight.

That was Joe Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, kicking off night three of the worst infomercial on earth, also known as the Democratic National Convention. Now, later tonight, she will deliver her, well, full at some point speech. Do not be fooled by anything Senator Harris has to say tonight. Now, no matter what she tries to sell, Kamala Harris is a radical -- far-left political opportunist, doesn't even like her own running mate. Remember, she accused Joe Biden of racism and sexism on multiple occasions. She said that she believes Joe Biden's accusers and Harris accepted the role of Biden's running mate for one reason and I assume she just wants to be president. She only got, what, 2 percent? And after all, you know, according to a new poll, the majority of Americans and nearly half of all Democrats believe that Joe Biden will not be able to finish a four-year term. Now, sadly, per usual, it's up to us to vet Senator Harris who wants to be the next vice president of the United States. Now, the mob in the media will not tell you the truth. Our big night, we will tell you. ABC, The New York Times have already referred to her as a pragmatic moderate. That is just a lie, a pure out and outright lie. In reality, she's anything but. 2019, she had a voting record to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders. She was the co-sponsor of that idiotic, socialist Green New Deal in the United States Senate, even wants to ban plastic straws, limit the consumption of your red meat. And she has vowed to enact gun confiscation programs, remember, I guess she chooses via executive fiat. Forget that other branch of government known as the legislative branch. She supports banning all private health insurance and supports Medicare for All, cost estimate $54 trillion, her new green deal estimate. Yeah, that would be $94 trillion. And the decision, she supported the idea of defunding the LAPD $150 million, appealing to the radical anarchists which is a really bad idea. Now, I highly doubt you'll hear any of these insane radical positions tonight. Thus far, the theme of the DNC has been all about hating Donald Trump, a cult of hatred, psychosis and madness at some levels -- on some levels, along with, of course, vague, typical platitudes and bumper stickers and slogans, what is a clear attempt to mitigate their scary socialist agenda. The DNC might very well be the worst show ever on earth. Frankly, this convention is so bad, and remember, not a lot of sports going on, not a lot happening -- not a lot of new stuff on TV, and the people are tuning out in droves. Now, what does this mean? We'll let you decide. Network viewership for the first two nights is now down last night a whopping 48 percent. Wow. Keep in mind, four years ago was Hillary Clinton and by the way, nobody particularly liked her. No one, well, was excited by Hillary Clinton, but this year, with Joe Biden, it's even worse. There is zero enthusiasm whatsoever. In fact, that's why he had to shore up, well, Bolshevik Bernie's base by adopting his crazy economic socialist plans and even plagiarizing a lot of -- a lot of it. That's why he has pledged trillions to Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal. That is why he chose his running mate, the most liberal radical in the United States Senate from California, Kamala Harris. Now during her -second speech last night, yep, the real speaker of the House of Representatives, Pelosi speaker in name only , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez couldn't even be bothered to mention her own party's nominee and then she confirms everything that they're planning to do, which is full on radicalism the most radical ticket of any major party in history.

But, hey, at least she's honest about the Democrats' radical socialist agenda, probably why she only got one minute, 60 whole seconds. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren who's scheduled to speak tonight has rarely ever been honest about anything true to form. Yesterday, she actually appeared on a DNC Native American panel -- you just can't make this stuff up. Remember, she was falsely claiming for a long time that she was a Native American for decades. She benefited for years from those false claims. And that's not all, yesterday, we also heard from two Louis Farrakhan, one of the biggest racist and anti-Semites in the country, yeah, two of his, well, let's say advocates -- Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory. Remember, they were kicked out of the women's march because of their bigotry, but they were welcomed, arms wide open at the DNC. Biden campaign later tried to distance themselves from Sarsour, but she was invited to appear at the convention. No word from Biden himself. He's in the bunker basement, might be taking a nap preparing for his big day tomorrow. By the way, why won't he answer why Sarsour and Mallory were invited to appear? Of course, Joe, he doesn't take any questions from the press. Remember, we told you this since March, Joe Biden has taken a whopping -- by our count - - 34 questions from his biggest supporters, the media mob, 34, since March. We're only 76 days away. He wants to be president. He'd been hiding in his basement bunker the whole time. Trump, well over 1,800. And his campaign is trying its best to hide him away indefinitely. And at this point everyone in the country can see that Joe Biden is struggling. He looks frail. He looks weak. He is constantly confused.

The mob and the media, they'll give a standing ovation, the greatest speech ever. At what point is anyone going to ask Biden questions like they asked John McCain in 2008 and Reagan in 1984 about his stamina, his fitness? Again, they did it to McCain and Reagan. His mental alertness, mental acuity, at what point is Biden sit down for an actual interview with any real journalist? I don't think one would hold him accountable anyway. At what point will Biden hold lengthy press conferences where he takes real questions, if ever? Is there something wrong with Joe? Why are they hiding him? What, is he not able to conduct an interview? What is his campaign so afraid of? We're 76 days away from a presidential election. By the way, before the first debate, 16 states will allow early voting. I'd like to see the first debate before a single vote is cast in the United States. I think that's fair for the American people. You got a major party candidate hiding daily in a basement. If Joe can't campaign, how do you trust him to be president? Here with reaction from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump is with us. OK, your dad, he's out there. It's not like they're going to give Joe hard questions.

The same thing with Michigan, and the same thing with all these. I mean, the media sets the bar so low -- if my father didn't go to a battleground state for 660 days, oh my god, Sean, they'd be -- they'd be on top of him. They would go -- they'd be going crazy. He didn't even show up in the state that the DNC was supposed to be at. He hasn't been there for two-plus years and everybody gives him a pass. He has taken it for granted.

I mean, you know, you know, free health care for every illegal immigrant, defunding police. I mean, think about the notion of defunding police. They tried to do that in New York. I mean, they defunded some. They got rid of all undercover police officers in New York and crime went up by 250 percent in three months, it doesn't work. But the point that you're making, Sean, is exactly right, right? They wanted somebody who was an absolute left-wing radical because honestly, even if Joe Biden was in office, you think he's actually going to be running government? I mean, the guy called Arizona \"city\" last week. He said he was running for Senate -- you know, senator of the United States. No, he's running for commander in chief and Arizona is a great state.

I don't think you need to graduate from Harvard or MIT to figure out when you only take in four and a half trillion dollars a year, that the $94 trillion in 10 years will bankrupt the country. How is ending fracking and eliminating all fossil fuels -- how's that going to fly in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin and in Ohio and Midwestern states where your dad did bring the jobs back that Biden and Obama's that weren't coming back. But, by the way, the fact that we're fracking is a reason we also have $2 gasoline at the pump right now. It's a reason it costs a little to heat our homes on a relative basis versus seven years ago because my father made this country energy independent. But one other thing about Kamala Harris said that no one's bringing up but I don't know why. She's from San Francisco, beautiful city. Unfortunately, it's gone to absolute hell, Sean. I mean, you look at the crime in that city. You look at the homelessness in that city. You know, you walk down the street. There's people defecating, you know, in the streets. You walk your kid to school and your wife (ph) walking over hypodermic needles. And this is a city that she governed over. So, you know, if you want the rest of the country, if you want these states, if you want, you know, all these swing states and the rest of the country to emulate San Francisco and the policies, I mean, people can't even live there the taxes are so high and you know again the city's gone to total hell -- you know, if you want -- then she -- then she's the perfect running mate for you. I mean, the problem with the DNC is they're tone-deaf to these issues. They're tone-deaf to what their party stands for and how radical it is, and how disconnected it is. It might work in New York City, Sean, it might work in Los Angeles, but it doesn't work in the other states, and they lose a lot of people. And I think you see that in terms of the lineup that they -- they have out there tonight."

And there's one common denominator in all those states, guess what? They're run by radical, radical leftists. Both mayors and governors, their policies don't work. I mean, we've seen the case studies. They don't work. We've seen this movie. We know how this movie ends. We just saw it over the last three months in New York. They strip out a thousand undercover NYPD officers and guess what? Crime goes up by 300 percent, Sean. This isn't a difficult thing to figure out. And I don't know why they continue to double down on it. This is not a winning issue for them. I mean, stripping private health care is not a winning issue. This is not a winning issue. Getting rid of the Second Amendment, not a winning issue. Coming after people's religion, not a winning issue. I mean, I don't get it. I don't -- I don't get why this is a policy.

What we saw this week was President Trump got the first peace deal in the Middle East in the last 26 years. The president talked about President Obama and the previous administration. When we got into office, the Middle East was a total mess. ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio. They'd just given Iran one of the worst deals ever, a pathway to a nuclear weapon. They were funding terrorism all over the world. President Trump went to the Middle East. He got all the Arab and Muslim leaders together and said, we have to do things differently. He re-established his relationship with Israel and that led to last week, President Trump, you know, achieving a success that nobody thought was possible that they all ridiculed him for trying to accomplish, which is the most significant peace deal in the Middle East in the last 26 years between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. So, look, in the Democratic Convention, I'm hearing a lot of lecturing moralists tell us about how things should be, but in President Trump and in this administration, we have a lot of doers, we have businessmen, we have people who are held accountable. If you don't make it, you get fired like what happens in the real world. And President Trump demands results and that's what he's been able to deliver."

Now, but something did happen as a result. As a fear in the Middle East the region of Iranian hegemony and a nuclear-armed Iran, you have the U.S., Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Saudis, the Emirates uniting in ways that were unthinkable just four years ago because of what they did do that literally put the entire region in jeopardy."

You know, you hear the Democrats talk about how Donald Trump would ruin alliances. Well, what he's done is he's brought a common sense approach. He's met with people. He's rebuilt all of our alliances. What all those countries had in common is they felt totally betrayed by America and our long-standing relationships, and they saw that the previous administration did that terrible deal. So, that led to them getting together and thanks to President Trump's leadership, we've been able to get it. But the previous administration taking credit for this deal, that's like Joe Biden claiming that he gets credit for the historic criminal justice reform that President Trump passed because in 1994, he wrote the terrible racist laws that disproportionately sends black people to prison and because he did such a terrible law, we had to come and fix the criminal justice reform system.

You mentioned, OK, African-Americans record low after record low after record low unemployment for every demographic, more money for the longest period of time in history for historically black colleges, opportunity zones.

He wanted to put Americans first. He wanted to put our country first. And at the time, all the intelligentsia criticized that as saying it was all kinds of things that were terrible. But what President Trump has done is he said, how do I put American workers first, how do I put American families first, how do I end all these endless wars? And that's what he's been doing. He has a peace framework in Afghanistan. We had like I just said, a peace agreement in the Middle East. He's bringing his troops home. He's reducing -- he's renegotiating deals. You know, the previous administration, they made a deal called TPP. They -- they were, you know, threatening to help the American workers. That deal would have sent all of our jobs overseas and would have made most of our cars made in China. President Trump, you know, he passed the historic USMCA. We made a new trade deal with Mexico, new trade deal with Canada, new trade deal with South Korea, new trade deal with Japan, and obviously was the first person to take on China and make with that."

And so, we proposed a law yesterday that would apply to all cities in the state of Texas. If a city defunds law enforcement, they will lose the lifeblood of the revenue they receive from property taxes in Texas. What this does in English is going to defund cities and cities' ability to operate at all if they try to defund law enforcement. We, Sean, believe in law enforcement in Texas, and we are not going to allow a replication of the types of policies that we've seen destroy cities like Seattle and Portland and others."

We see every weekend, last weekend, 64 people shot in Chicago, including three teenagers and a 12- year-old. This is like -- these are war zones, and that they reject the help -- that they need to ask the president for help, he's begging them to take it, to restore order. But they refuse.

But it requires discipline. It requires him to be ready to begin next week. The important speech for him next week is the acceptance speech where he has to do three things that are difficult to do -- he has to, one, explain in short concrete terms what it is that he's done. More importantly, he's got to say what it is that he wants to do. That second act is absolutely vital to a re-election campaign. And then he needs to find time in that speech to contrast himself with Joe Biden in a way that sticks. And that's difficult to do. I suspect the speechwriters have been hard at work on that for a while. Seemingly, the White House policy apparatus has been preparing ideas for the second term agenda, but we'll see it next a week from a week from tomorrow and it's going to be the most important speech the president has given in the last four years."

We've had a couple of moments during the Democratic debate where they were playing to swing voters, but the election is going to be decided by, you know, 10, 11, 12 percent of the electorate. They can move one way or the other. We're going to see this race naturally tighten up after the Republican convention. Where it's going to end, I don't know, but I think it's going to be sort of four or five points.

You have these woke liberal college graduates that -- this elitist, people basically indoctrinated by the institute's -- institutions of higher learning. They are now the base of this new Democratic Party. Working men and women, which historically has been the base, you know, remember Biden and Obama said those jobs ain't coming back.

Republicans under Donald Trump have been losing college-educated, particularly suburban women voters, but all college-educated voters. Democrats have been hemorrhaging working class, blue-collar voters, and that's what's so fascinating to me about this election. Donald Trump is increasingly the champion of working people in this country and that's why working people, people with high school degrees, people with not full college degrees increasingly are voting Republican and voting Trump. It's a major generational change. Reporters being college graduates themselves and being surrounded by a milieu of similar minded thinking people still don't see that story. They missed it in 2016, and I have to wonder if they're missing it again now."

They didn't have the credibility. They defended the real quid pro quo with Joe and zero experience Hunter. I want to go ask you -- you know, you talk about demographics and so you mentioned suburban women and I'm thinking, OK, I would think law and order. Do they not see these liberal Democratic cities run by liberal Democrats for decades what's happening? What about minorities where the president, not Barack and Joe, set record after record low unemployment for every demographic group? Does that come into play?

But he's got to go beyond that. And the plus group I continue to see is African Americans, particularly African-American younger men. And this is where criminal justice reform is essential for the president to talk about. He's delivered on things that nobody else could even get close to delivering on and it's made a difference in people's lives, the lowest black unemployment in history, lowest Hispanic unemployment in history. These are areas that the president can do much better than Republicans traditionally do, please don't forget that next week, Mr. President. Hit that in your events at the convention, include that in your speech. You need base plus."

Georgia would make a big difference, keeping Georgia in the Trump category. So, that's the percentage I'm looking for there. The other factor is just what percentage of people are new voters. The president has done very well with that group. Again, there's just a tremendous number of blue-collar working-class people who just don't think it matters and that's the group that the president has a chance to excite."

Anyway, remember, she's delivering her address. This came one night after her husband Bill Clinton faced extensive criticism for speaking at the DNC. All right. Here with reaction to what we've seen so far, Michael Best law president and former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, let's start with you. OK, Karl, Ari been weighing in, what this election is about. OK, I don't disagree with the base plus. I think that is always the strategy. Where does the president get the plus and how does he get that?"

Don't make this left, right, liberal, conservative Democrat, Republican. Make it about America, make it about taking us up, not down. That's a vertical approach. Talk about the jobs. Talk about the security that we have when we control our borders, pushing back on China to protect our jobs, vertical, not horizontal. President delivers that message, I think it's going to be an astounding victory."

I haven't heard about, you know, there's a reason why America needs a wall so we can vet people that want to come in legally. I've heard nothing uplifting. It's just a pounding, you know, of hardcore left and what they're going to do and their free, free, free promises and get rid of oil and gas and raise taxes and open borders and amnesty and I'm like wow. Well -- is there any -- are they going to restore law and order? How about let's start there with the basics?"

      "utterance": "Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating and it's a disservice to everyone who has looked to the Democratic Party for some kind of leadership. But what they get instead are word salads, a lot of platitudes, sanctimony, veiled threats, a dynamic where it's depressing. You -- you watch this, there's a reason why the ratings are down. You turn this on and there's nothing forward-looking. There's nothing optimistic or exciting about being in the greatest country on earth. Instead, they are still in fear and loathing of Donald Trump because of their envy and jealousy. The fact is -- and it's already been mentioned tonight -- the president is the president because he looks at all Americans. He's been criticized for not necessarily being ideological, but the fact of the matter is it is the forgotten man and woman that he appealed to in because he understands them and he came to love this country, and it's those same individuals who now have realized they voted correctly, it was right to elect Donald Trump, that we want the future. We do not want the past and this is what you I think you're going to see from what I've read about what the convention next week will be is the great American stories as opposed to the misery that the Democrats are living in and they want everyone else to live in. They have not brought up the violence, the anarchy the riots in American cities. They don't bring it up because they don't want to have to answer for it. So that is what the issue is, security, safety for your family, the ability to look to the future is something optimistic. The decision is clear. The president is the same guy he was in 2016. And clearly, he's got a great deal to talk about what he's been able to deliver. The media has conspired against him to keep those stories out of the living rooms of the American people, but everyone is beginning to watch and we will see those numbers change once the convention begins. And I -- just like I saw the president in ‘16, do not underestimate him, he knows what to do, he should trust his instinct and we'll be fine."

That -- do we glean anything from that at all because I find the whole thing totally, completely unwatchable?"

But you're right, the reality is, is these conventions right now especially that it's not live and the people part of it is subtracted, these are not persuadable voters that are tuning in here. These are people that are -- that are set in stone. But to your point, this the -- these conventions are usually other than the election they are the super bowls of politics. And the Democrats are playing the exact same game plan that they did in 2016. Just go back and look -- Hillary Clinton in 2016 declared that Trump created a moment of reckoning Obama said that Trump was full of anger and hate. There are two themes in 2016 were two things. And what were they, they were the qualifications of Hillary Clinton and that Trump was too divisive and they -- and they -- and if you go back and watch it, they played the Russia card, they played the divisive card, they played the ugly rhetoric card. And you know what the country chose to drain the swamp and try and crush the way that things used to be. So, you know, it's the same thing again -- and I think if you listen what Tammy just said, what Governor Huckabee just said, they're a hundred percent right."

President Trump is the most genuine guy we've got.
