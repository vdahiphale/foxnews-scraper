      "sentences": "The closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange being rung by first responders, including the New York police commissioner, Dermot Shea, this a very different day than the trading day that they had six days after 9/11, when it was a who's-who of bipartisan political players and the rest of that were trying to come together after the markets had been closed. Today celebrating not only their eventual reopening and the comeback, but what had been a reminder of that, while New York and the financial capital was hit hard, it has come storming back, a testament to capitalism, and this country, and our resolve.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  You know, 20 years ago today, well, it was a Monday. And that day, the last day of innocence, as some have called it, would in no way hint of the trauma and the nightmare that would come and change America forever. But when it hit, it hit badly. And for the financial community, it hit badly as well, not only in terms of financial capital, but human capital.  Hundreds in the investment community died that day, more than 650 individuals that one firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, alone. There were many others, the death of firefighters and first responders that went into the hundreds, and growing questions as to whether New York could or would ever come back. My next guest remembers it.  Ted Weisberg joins us right now, Seaport Securities. He's been through many crises. Where were you that day, Ted?",

      "sentences": "Well, the day started out, I -- actually the reverse of where I am today. I was on the phone in my office, 60 Broad Street, 31st floor, beautiful, beautiful, crystal-clear New York days, looking out over the harbor.   We couldn't see the World Trade Center from our office, but we have a panoramic view of Lower Manhattan. And I was on the phone talking with a good friend and client in Bermuda. And, as we speak today, Neil, I'm remote in Bermuda talking to you in New York. And it's exactly 20 years later, just a little later in the afternoon. And he said to me, a plane just hit the World Trade Center. And I said, you're kidding? He said, no, no, I'm not kidding. And then the horror began to unfold. I got off the phone, I went down the elevator to go to the stock exchange, where I had been going every day probably for 40-some-odd years prior to that day. And I never got inside the building. When I hit the street, it was complete (AUDIO GAP) dust in the air. I call the office upstairs and said, everybody, get out. We will meet on the street, on Broad Street in front of the exchange.   I called the exchange. And some of our people didn't want to leave, and some did. And those that did, we all met on the street. And while we were standing out there, I don't know how long we were there, but we were there for certainly a good 20, 30 minutes, both towers collapsed. You couldn't breathe. We have all seen pictures. It was like, I guess if you're a skier, like a whiteout if you're skiing or driving in the mountains in a snowstorm. And you couldn't breathe because the dust was just in your -- getting everywhere. And, eventually, our group decided we need to get out from underneath the dust cloud. And so we walked over to the (AUDIO GAP) river and, eventually, three hours later walked all the way uptown, no cell phones because they were no towers, because the towers had collapsed and most of the cell towers were on top of the World Trade Center.  And you would look behind you and all you saw was smoke, piles of smoke going into the sky. And, eventually, we got up to the Upper East Side. Some folks bunked with each other.   But, at that point, most of the people that were with me all lived (AUDIO GAP) Manhattan. And then we kind of hunkered down until the morning of 9/17, the September of 17, when the stock exchange reopened and there we were at 9:30 good to go. It was very emotional, very sad.",

But Wall Street did come back.  But there were a lot of losses there. I'm not talking financial losses.

Keefe, Bruyette, as were pointing out, had lost about a third of its work force. Not only were people wondering whether the firm could survive, but whether they personally could move on after such huge personal losses.   But Keefe, Bruyette is doing just fine, thank you.  Its CEO joins us right now, Tom Michaud. We should point out that Keefe, Bruyette is now a part of the A Stifel Company financial empire. Tom, it's very good to have you, and remembering and looking back at that day and what your firm lost. But it came back. You guys came back.  And I understand a lot of it had to do with the fact that firms started helping each other get back on their feet, right?  TOM MICHAUD, CEO, KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS:  It was incredible. There -- the amount of goodwill and unity that existed at our company and around Wall Street and around the country was really part of the fuel that helped us go about and rebuild. And after this happened -- and I saw the tape that you just played with John.  John, myself and others, we sat down and we said, look, we're going to do two things. We're going to, number one, do everything we can to help the victims and their families. And number two is we're going to go about rebuilding the firm. That way, we will be able to do more to help the families, and because we can't let the firm end that way. We're not going to let the firm run by terrorists flying planes into our buildings. And, in many ways, it was almost therapeutic to be able to go out and to rebuild. And that was the energy afterwards.   But that was the feeling after those first couple of weeks and the fuel that caused us to move forward.",

The idea of somehow getting back, forget the financial losses, the human losses, and some of our best financial minds of that time were all gone.

But behind me right now is a flag that one of our survivors' wife painted for us shortly after 9/11 with all the names of those who passed away on 9/11. And it was the energy of rebuilding the firm, because it just felt to us like it was the right thing to do. And, like I said earlier, that was the fuel.   But I got to tell you, Neil, something now I think is interesting at the 20th anniversary, because while we always honor the victims, I think it's important that we remember what it took for the country to rebuild, because I -- over a quarter of the country today is probably too young to remember the events live.  And I'm worried that 9/11 may become just a couple of paragraphs in a history book. Meanwhile, you have to think about that goodwill, the unity and the resilience that was in our country. And so that's why I'm not sure if you're aware, but I'm a member of a organization called 9/11 Day. And we convinced President Bush to start and President Obama to sign a proclamation making 9/11 a national day of service and remembrance.  And so we have been encouraging Americans to not let the last chapter that gets written by the terrorists on what happened that day, but, instead, what do we do with it? And so we're encouraging a day of service to remember those who lost their lives and the effort that went into rebuilding. And I was confident that the American system would survive. I don't think I was ever worried about that. I was worried about New York City.",

They really believe, if they martyr themselves or kill infidels, they're going to go to paradise. It's like -- it's a simple reward that they really want.  And what they see this now, our retreat from Afghanistan, is a win for their God. Allah gave them this victory. So that I think will empower a lot of the sleeper cells. People in New York City, Saint Louis, London, France, they're going to see a win like this. And that's not going to stop them from getting a big truck and running people over or grabbing scissors or a knife and trying to continue the jihad because God wants them to win. And that's the sad truth, the way it works. So I'm concerned about that.

They're wonderful men and women in federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies that are sharing it. But there's also the issue of people not telling their bosses the truth, because, if they make them mad -- we see it in the military all the time -- if they make their boss mad, they might not get promoted. If they're a general, they don't want to make the politicians mad because they might lose their job that they get at a contractor, a contracting firm after they get out of the Navy. So some people, I'm concerned, have gotten rid of the greater good for personal power. That's what concerns me too, is a lot of people aren't telling each other the truth, because a lot of times the truth can get you fired.

But many of the companies whose CEOs are members of the Roundtable didn't already have vaccine mandates in place, but that could soon change. American Airlines' CEO, for one, sent a letter to employees after the announcement came through yesterday, saying: \"We are reviewing the executive order and are awaiting additional details. But based on what we see so far, it appears we will be impacted by these federally mandated efforts to increase vaccination rates.\" Many of the other companies we reached out to had something similar to say, but none has changed its policy just yet. Several labor unions are also chiming in. They want a say in how the mandates are implemented. A handful of companies had already required employees to get vaccinated, United Airlines, CVS, Kraft Heinz among them. United is going so far as to place workers who get a religious exemption on unpaid leave. The other facet to this is how workers will respond. A recent poll from ABC News and The Washington Post found that seven in 10 unvaccinated employees would likely quit their job if their employer required them to get vaccinated and didn't allow for medical or religious exemption. So, if as many people who say they would quit actually do, there could be major fallout from that, Neil, and likely a lot of legal challenges ahead as well.",

You never know, they say, in life, the unpredictability of it all, the rich and the poor and everyone in between who at any moment can be taken when they least expect it, leaving behind families who needed help and healing and, as Ken Feinberg would say, compensation as well.

If you think about it, 20 years ago this day was a Monday, the last innocent day before everything hit the fan, when all we were talking about were, well, a New York mayoral race and, at least in this city, the hope that maybe the Yankees or the Mets would surprise us. That was then. This weekend, we look into what is now. I will see you tomorrow for special coverage, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, as we look back and look forward.

Today celebrating not only their eventual reopening and the comeback, but what had been a reminder of that, while New York and the financial capital was hit hard, it has come storming back, a testament to capitalism, and this country, and our resolve. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" You know, 20 years ago today, well, it was a Monday. And that day, the last day of innocence, as some have called it, would in no way hint of the trauma and the nightmare that would come and change America forever. But when it hit, it hit badly. And for the financial community, it hit badly as well, not only in terms of financial capital, but human capital. Hundreds in the investment community died that day, more than 650 individuals that one firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, alone. There were many others, the death of firefighters and first responders that went into the hundreds, and growing questions as to whether New York could or would ever come back. My next guest remembers it. Ted Weisberg joins us right now, Seaport Securities. He's been through many crises. Where were you that day, Ted?"

      "utterance": "Well, the day started out, I -- actually the reverse of where I am today. I was on the phone in my office, 60 Broad Street, 31st floor, beautiful, beautiful, crystal-clear New York days, looking out over the harbor. We couldn't see the World Trade Center from our office, but we have a panoramic view of Lower Manhattan. And I was on the phone talking with a good friend and client in Bermuda. And, as we speak today, Neil, I'm remote in Bermuda talking to you in New York. And it's exactly 20 years later, just a little later in the afternoon. And he said to me, a plane just hit the World Trade Center. And I said, you're kidding? He said, no, no, I'm not kidding. And then the horror began to unfold. I got off the phone, I went down the elevator to go to the stock exchange, where I had been going every day probably for 40-some-odd years prior to that day. And I never got inside the building. When I hit the street, it was complete (AUDIO GAP) dust in the air. I call the office upstairs and said, everybody, get out. We will meet on the street, on Broad Street in front of the exchange. I called the exchange. And some of our people didn't want to leave, and some did. And those that did, we all met on the street. And while we were standing out there, I don't know how long we were there, but we were there for certainly a good 20, 30 minutes, both towers collapsed. You couldn't breathe. We have all seen pictures. It was like, I guess if you're a skier, like a whiteout if you're skiing or driving in the mountains in a snowstorm. And you couldn't breathe because the dust was just in your -- getting everywhere. And, eventually, our group decided we need to get out from underneath the dust cloud. And so we walked over to the (AUDIO GAP) river and, eventually, three hours later walked all the way uptown, no cell phones because they were no towers, because the towers had collapsed and most of the cell towers were on top of the World Trade Center. And you would look behind you and all you saw was smoke, piles of smoke going into the sky. And, eventually, we got up to the Upper East Side. Some folks bunked with each other. But, at that point, most of the people that were with me all lived (AUDIO GAP) Manhattan. And then we kind of hunkered down until the morning of 9/17, the September of 17, when the stock exchange reopened and there we were at 9:30 good to go. It was very emotional, very sad."

And he was referring to the markets eventually open -- opening again. That was about six days later. They careened. We had the quickest descent into a bear market then. But Wall Street did come back. But there were a lot of losses there. I'm not talking financial losses. All the investment heavyweights of the world really were centered in the financial community that was downtown New York, including Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. John Duffy headed that firm at the time.

People in the South Tower at that point were fine. They weren't sure what had happened in North Tower, even at that point in time. This was five to 10 minutes after the first plane had struck. When I attempted to call Christopher later, cell phone service was out. And that was after the second plane had hit. There were a group of them, a group of employees from the trading desk, that were trying to access the different stairwells to find an exit route, but were unable to. So, Kevin was actually the last person who spoke to Christopher."

      "utterance": "So, when we talk about Wall Street, we always talk about the money and all that, but these were personal events, CEOs, whole entire investment firms essentially gone in a moment, as I said, 658 at Cantor Fitzgerald alone. Keefe, Bruyette, as were pointing out, had lost about a third of its work force. Not only were people wondering whether the firm could survive, but whether they personally could move on after such huge personal losses. But Keefe, Bruyette is doing just fine, thank you. Its CEO joins us right now, Tom Michaud. We should point out that Keefe, Bruyette is now a part of the A Stifel Company financial empire. Tom, it's very good to have you, and remembering and looking back at that day and what your firm lost. But it came back. You guys came back. And I understand a lot of it had to do with the fact that firms started helping each other get back on their feet, right? TOM MICHAUD, CEO, KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS:  It was incredible. There -- the amount of goodwill and unity that existed at our company and around Wall Street and around the country was really part of the fuel that helped us go about and rebuild. And after this happened -- and I saw the tape that you just played with John. John, myself and others, we sat down and we said, look, we're going to do two things. We're going to, number one, do everything we can to help the victims and their families. And number two is we're going to go about rebuilding the firm. That way, we will be able to do more to help the families, and because we can't let the firm end that way. We're not going to let the firm run by terrorists flying planes into our buildings. And, in many ways, it was almost therapeutic to be able to go out and to rebuild. And that was the energy afterwards. But that was the feeling after those first couple of weeks and the fuel that caused us to move forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, because everyone talks about personnel and money lost and exchanges that were silenced for upwards of a week. And I get that. But, for you, it was personal. Certainly, at the time, for John, losing his son, it was personal, a third of your firm gone. The idea of somehow getting back, forget the financial losses, the human losses, and some of our best financial minds of that time were all gone. Did you ever wonder whether at least the way capitalism was known in the U.S. at that time would come back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAUD",
      "utterance": "I was a believer in that regards. And we just had a whole series of goals in front of us. And I keep saying it was like pushing a big rock up the hill. But behind me right now is a flag that one of our survivors' wife painted for us shortly after 9/11 with all the names of those who passed away on 9/11. And it was the energy of rebuilding the firm, because it just felt to us like it was the right thing to do. And, like I said earlier, that was the fuel. But I got to tell you, Neil, something now I think is interesting at the 20th anniversary, because while we always honor the victims, I think it's important that we remember what it took for the country to rebuild, because I -- over a quarter of the country today is probably too young to remember the events live. And I'm worried that 9/11 may become just a couple of paragraphs in a history book. Meanwhile, you have to think about that goodwill, the unity and the resilience that was in our country. And so that's why I'm not sure if you're aware, but I'm a member of a organization called 9/11 Day. And we convinced President Bush to start and President Obama to sign a proclamation making 9/11 a national day of service and remembrance. And so we have been encouraging Americans to not let the last chapter that gets written by the terrorists on what happened that day, but, instead, what do we do with it? And so we're encouraging a day of service to remember those who lost their lives and the effort that went into rebuilding. And I was confident that the American system would survive. I don't think I was ever worried about that. I was worried about New York City."

And as I was walking north towards Midtown, and after the buildings collapsed, I did wonder if I'd ever even come back to New York again. But rebuilding was actually therapeutic for us. And it felt like it was the right thing to do."

They really believe, if they martyr themselves or kill infidels, they're going to go to paradise. It's like -- it's a simple reward that they really want. And what they see this now, our retreat from Afghanistan, is a win for their God. Allah gave them this victory. So that I think will empower a lot of the sleeper cells. People in New York City, Saint Louis, London, France, they're going to see a win like this. And that's not going to stop them from getting a big truck and running people over or grabbing scissors or a knife and trying to continue the jihad because God wants them to win. And that's the sad truth, the way it works. So I'm concerned about that. Really want people to be visual and keep your head on a swivel, because just because you don't think you're at war doesn't mean someone's not at war with you."

But there are still people out there that simply want to get promoted for their own good, so they won't let people share their pie. And that's one of the problems. Now, don't get me wrong. They're wonderful men and women in federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies that are sharing it. But there's also the issue of people not telling their bosses the truth, because, if they make them mad -- we see it in the military all the time -- if they make their boss mad, they might not get promoted. If they're a general, they don't want to make the politicians mad because they might lose their job that they get at a contractor, a contracting firm after they get out of the Navy. So some people, I'm concerned, have gotten rid of the greater good for personal power. That's what concerns me too, is a lot of people aren't telling each other the truth, because a lot of times the truth can get you fired. And we see it in everything from Twitter to getting banned to people losing their jobs because they said something to offend someone who's woke."

Several labor unions are also chiming in. They want a say in how the mandates are implemented. A handful of companies had already required employees to get vaccinated, United Airlines, CVS, Kraft Heinz among them. United is going so far as to place workers who get a religious exemption on unpaid leave. The other facet to this is how workers will respond. A recent poll from ABC News and The Washington Post found that seven in 10 unvaccinated employees would likely quit their job if their employer required them to get vaccinated and didn't allow for medical or religious exemption. So, if as many people who say they would quit actually do, there could be major fallout from that, Neil, and likely a lot of legal challenges ahead as well."

      "utterance": "That meant that people were first responders and others who had the latent illnesses, they hadn't manifested themselves yet, cancer, emphysema, other diseases. Those diseases didn't bear fruit a decade later. So, Congress, I think correctly, had very little choice. Elementary fairness required that they reactivate the fund for purposes of compensating first responders and others who only in 2013, '14, '15, today are now manifesting those physical illnesses."

      "speaker": "FEINBERG",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think there were some variations. But, basically, the victim compensation one that I administered vs. victim compensation two very ably being administered today, they basically follow the same format. There may be some differences in eligibility and valuation, but they're basically the same."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, a lot of people look at this. And, obviously, you have been called in to do this again and again since 9/11. And it's changed the notion of how we reward people. That was part of the way Congress wanted it. But did it ever envision the controversy around it, that a fireman's family or policeman's family or Port Authority worker's family would not be as generously compensated as, let's say, a broker?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FEINBERG",
      "utterance": "Congress didn't think that way, no. Congress wanted to make sure that whatever I had to do to entice incentivize people into the program, do it. We don't want lawsuits. We don't want airlines being sued, the World Trade Center being sued. We want a better system in this particular tragedy to avoid litigation. I don't think you will see a 9/11 Fund again, I think it was a -- sort of a unique a reaction to an unprecedented disaster in American history."

I urge you to watch the Michael Keaton movie on this, \"Worth,\" because it puts in perspective the Herculean task Ken had. Ken, thank you very, very much. Looking back at that day and all that would come as a result of that day, compensating, everything else, it was the sheer, sheer enormity of the loss that hits home."

I was a few blocks away. One of the buildings collapsed. I ran, as did a number of the police and fire who were in the nearby streets, but a great many officers, New York's finest and New York's bravest, were trapped inside."

When trading does resume Monday, yes, you got the machines back, the wires back, the keyboards are up and running, and all of that, the data terminals connecting here to London, to Frankfurt, to Beijing. They're all working again. But you're all of a sudden looking at a lot of empty desks. We have heard about the lives lost and the buildings lost. I want to end tonight talking about the friends I have lost, the guests I have lost. I'm being a little selfish here, so many. But, finally, I'd like to focus on two, two eerily prescient gentlemen who were regulars on this show, Bill Meehan of Cantor Fitzgerald, and David Alger of Fred Alger Manager."

      "utterance": "There were many more who were lost that day, guests on this show, those who provided their financial expertise of America and where we were headed, with no idea about where they were headed, and how short those days would be before they were gone, in one case, someone who was on with me just a couple of days before the attacks. You never know, they say, in life, the unpredictability of it all, the rich and the poor and everyone in between who at any moment can be taken when they least expect it, leaving behind families who needed help and healing and, as Ken Feinberg would say, compensation as well. All of that was to be worked out, but not before the magnitude of the events that unfolded. If you think about it, 20 years ago this day was a Monday, the last innocent day before everything hit the fan, when all we were talking about were, well, a New York mayoral race and, at least in this city, the hope that maybe the Yankees or the Mets would surprise us. That was then. This weekend, we look into what is now. I will see you tomorrow for special coverage, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, as we look back and look forward.
