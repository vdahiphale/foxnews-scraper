I heard a Kurdish official tell a journalist, you're never going to find a driver to take you around at that price, not with all the bombs falling from the sky. Not with what they're doing to people. Some disturbing video emerging of what may be -- FOX has been unable to verify its authenticity -- a Turkish-backed Arab militia fighter executing a Kurdish fighter along the side of the road. As the fighter shoots the Kurd, he shouts, feel me, feel me. There are also reports, denied by the Turkish-backed era militia, that they have assassinated a female Kurdish political party leader. Once again, the Turks denying that.  As far as the bigger picture here goes, we are in day five of this military offensive. No sign of a slowdown. Turkey's President Erdogan pushing ahead with military action from the sky and from shelling. You can see plumes of smoke rise up from those towns as far as the action goes on the ground, they've taken control of a major city in Syria, they've taken control of major highways too.  So, the Kurdish fighters are in real danger of being cut off from each other, this despite worldwide criticism of Turkey's operation. There's a real concern among a number of world leaders that this operation could lead to the resurgence of the Islamic State in this area. Kurdish officials say they can't fight the Turkish army and guard ISIS prisoners at the same time. They say more than 700 ISIS supporters escaped from a camp just this weekend. As far as the U.S. position goes, they have threatened sanctions, but not enforced any financial sanctions as of yet. The Kurds, some leaders say they are deeply disappointed in the U.S., they feel like an ally has stabbed them in the back. Others still hope for a U.S. no-fly zone.  Chris, back to you.",

Joining me now, Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen, who has written that bill, along with Republican Lindsey Graham. Senator, you just heard Secretary Esper talking about the fact that the president has ordered him to pull U.S. troops, all of the U.S. troops, out of Northern Syria, basically to leave the Kurds on their own, and that we understand that they have made a deal -- cut a deal, the Kurds have, with Assad's forces in Syria and the Russians, and they're going to go them for protection against the Turks.

They're asking Turkey, oh please, please stop what you're doing. That is nothing, so that's why you're going to see a strong bipartisan response from the Congress. First of all, we want to insist that President Trump actually step up and do something. He said he was going to destroy the Turkish economy if Erdogan did this kind of thing, and yet, he's doing absolutely nothing. If fact, this administration sided with Russia and opposed a resolution at the United Nations Security Council, a statement condemning Turkey's actions.

She's avoided doing that, I think, partly to protect some of her members that come from Trump district, and partly because she knows she'll get barely any, if any, Republicans to support this, which will expose it as the partisan exercise that it is. But I think the White House is smart to litigate this to death because the longer they do, and the closer we get to November of next year, the more voters will say, why do we need to impeach?

There are now reports Turkish-backed militias are committing atrocities against the Kurds as part of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria. Eyewitnesses backed up by videos say militias are executing Kurdish fighters and civilians, and there is also evidence the Turks are hitting prisons holding thousands of ISIS fighters, allowing some to escape. In a moment, we'll talk with the secretary of defense, Mark Esper. But first, let's get the latest from Steve Harrigan, who is live inside Syria - - Steve."

      "utterance": "Chris, reports of those possible atrocities are spreading like wildfire here across Syria and when you cross over the border, you can really just sense people's fear. I heard a Kurdish official tell a journalist, you're never going to find a driver to take you around at that price, not with all the bombs falling from the sky. Not with what they're doing to people. Some disturbing video emerging of what may be -- FOX has been unable to verify its authenticity -- a Turkish-backed Arab militia fighter executing a Kurdish fighter along the side of the road. As the fighter shoots the Kurd, he shouts, feel me, feel me. There are also reports, denied by the Turkish-backed era militia, that they have assassinated a female Kurdish political party leader. Once again, the Turks denying that. As far as the bigger picture here goes, we are in day five of this military offensive. No sign of a slowdown. Turkey's President Erdogan pushing ahead with military action from the sky and from shelling. You can see plumes of smoke rise up from those towns as far as the action goes on the ground, they've taken control of a major city in Syria, they've taken control of major highways too. So, the Kurdish fighters are in real danger of being cut off from each other, this despite worldwide criticism of Turkey's operation. There's a real concern among a number of world leaders that this operation could lead to the resurgence of the Islamic State in this area. Kurdish officials say they can't fight the Turkish army and guard ISIS prisoners at the same time. They say more than 700 ISIS supporters escaped from a camp just this weekend. As far as the U.S. position goes, they have threatened sanctions, but not enforced any financial sanctions as of yet. The Kurds, some leaders say they are deeply disappointed in the U.S., they feel like an ally has stabbed them in the back. Others still hope for a U.S. no-fly zone. Chris, back to you."

I spoke to my counterpart a few days ago. I sent him a memo on Friday night, a formal response, warned them that if they do this incursion, which we oppose, we will see everything from the release of ISIS prisoners to humanitarian catastrophe. It will damage U.S. relations with Turkey, their staying in NATO. All of this is playing out exactly as we predicted, and we, again, urge President Erdogan to stop and go back to the status quo ante."

And now, what we're facing is U.S. forces in a -- trapped between a Syrian-Russian army moving north to take on the Turkish army that is moving south. It puts us in a terrible position. And the protection and safety of our service members comes first to me. I spoke with the National Security team yesterday. We all talked on the phone. I talked to the president, and he is concerned. And so, last night, he directed that we begin a deliberate withdraw of U.S. forces from the northern part of Syria."

You got to keep in mind, too, that, look, we didn't sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, on behalf of the SDF. Again, this is a terrible situation. That's why in the little over two months that I've been on the job, this has probably been the number one issue that I've dealt with, week after week, with our Turkish counterparts. We've done everything we can to dissuade them from doing this. We will -- we thought we were making very good progress on the so-called \"Safety Zone\" in Northern Syria, a way to keep the forces separated and to ensure we can keep both these good partners at odds ends. But as you know, Chris, this conflict has its roots that goes back 200 years, and in fact, in the -- in the last few years, since we began this relationship with the -- with the Kurds to take on ISIS, the Turks protested it from the beginning. This is now their third incursion into Syria in the last few years to do this."

We were their protection for the Kurds. After President Trump talked to President Erdogan last Sunday, President Trump decided to pull those troops out, and the Turks invaded. Isn't that the definition of abandoning the Kurds?"

      "speaker": "ESPER",

The first thing that we understood, I've understood from my counterpart, Secretary Pompeo from his, and certainly from President Erdogan, is they were fully committed to doing this, regardless of what we did. We thought it was prudent. It was my recommendation. I know the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed as well. We should not put U.S. forces in between a Turkish advance. We're talking less than 50, more like two dozen. There is no way they could stop 15,000 Turks from proceeding south."

Then the president has his phone call with President Erdogan, and you say, well, there's nothing we can do. One, did Erdogan say I'm going to come in anyway? Yes or no?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ESPER",

That was what I took from my conversations with my counterpart, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff took from his, Secretary Pompeo form his. Look, the fact is also, Chris, we are not going to go to war, another war in the Middle East, against Turkey, which is a longstanding NATO ally that has fought alongside us from Korea all the way through Afghanistan. That's not what we signed up for."

The National Security team will be talking today about it. We still have been holding out hope that we can get to Erdogan and tell him to stop what he's doing, return to the border and let's work on the safety zone, the mechanism. Those talks are still, by the way, underway right now. We want to get to that point and settle this situation now and stabilize it, so we can get back on the right path."

That is, number one, China and, number two, Russia. In this case, with Iran, we know that their malign behavior over the last 40 years continues to create instability throughout the entire Middle East, to include Northern Syria. So in that regard, we want to make sure that we have sufficient forces on the ground, first to help defend our partners, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and, secondly, to deter further Iranian provocative behavior that could lead to a conflict. We are not looking to a conflict in the Middle East and not with Iran. But as I said to them, they should not mistake our restraint for weakness. If they do and do something that would strike our interests of our allies, we will respond."

As you know, I came into office in late July, and since that time, as we looked at this issue periodically, the DOD's focus has been on three things. What is the importance, the value of the aide to Ukraine to deter Russian behavior, defend themselves? Number two, are they making progress on corruption which is of keen interest to the Congress? And then number three, how are we getting other NATO allies, European partners to also help assist the Ukrainians?"

This week, when Congress returns from recess, lawmakers plan to take up a bipartisan bill that would slap tough sanctions on Turkey. Joining me now, Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen, who has written that bill, along with Republican Lindsey Graham. Senator, you just heard Secretary Esper talking about the fact that the president has ordered him to pull U.S. troops, all of the U.S. troops, out of Northern Syria, basically to leave the Kurds on their own, and that we understand that they have made a deal -- cut a deal, the Kurds have, with Assad's forces in Syria and the Russians, and they're going to go them for protection against the Turks. Your reaction?"

      "speaker": "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, D-MD",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, what we're seeing on the ground right now is absolutely sickening. It's absolutely shameful that President Trump allowed Turkey to begin killing the Syrian Kurds who are our allies in the fight against ISIS. And that's why you have this big, bipartisan uproar. You have ISIS right now being the big winner, because the Syrian Kurds were our most effective partner in going after ISIS. Now, they're going to have a comeback. That's what Secretary Mattis, former secretary of defense, just said. You just heard the current secretary of defense essentially say the Trump administration is doing nothing. They're asking Turkey, oh please, please stop what you're doing. That is nothing, so that's why you're going to see a strong bipartisan response from the Congress. First of all, we want to insist that President Trump actually step up and do something. He said he was going to destroy the Turkish economy if Erdogan did this kind of thing, and yet, he's doing absolutely nothing. If fact, this administration sided with Russia and opposed a resolution at the United Nations Security Council, a statement condemning Turkey's actions. So Congress is going to first call upon the president to do the right thing, but we since we can't count on that, we will have this bipartisan legislation that will impose very stiff sanctions on Turkey until they stop their aggression and withdraw their forces."

There are reports this morning that ISIS sympathizers have already escaped, thousands of them. And here, you have Secretary Mnuchin saying, oh, well, we'll think about it. Maybe we'll do something. President Trump tweeting that he's going to destroy their economy. They look ridiculous right now. So that's why it's important that the Congress move forward on this front. I don't know what this administration's waiting for. All they're doing is talking while people are being killed."

But as we say, while this is going on, and I understand, you're -- the Congress comes back from recess tomorrow, the Kurds are being slaughtered. As you say, ISIS supporters and fighters are leaving. Have you gotten a commitment form Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, one, that he is going to take this up and, two, schedule it for a quick vote?

We believe momentum is building for the Congress to act, since this president has shown a total unwillingness to do something in the face of this slaughter. You're already seeing bipartisan movement in the Senate, the bill you discussed. You're also seeing bipartisan legislation in the House coming together. So the key is to act quickly. As you say, time is of the essence. But you know, when Congress wants to act quickly, it can. So the Senate could take this bill up, pass it, send it to the House and then send it to the president's deck.

I do understand that, in the House, you have a strong bipartisan group also pushing for sanctions, because everyday that it goes on, ISIS s the winner. I mean, these are the guys who pose the biggest terrorist threat to the United States in the world. They're celebrating what's happening here.

You have now, since the Zelensky phone call rough transcript was released, you have now called for -- supported the House impeachment inquiry. From what you have seen so far, do you believe that there is sufficient evidence that the president should be removed from office?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "Well Chris, what we've seen from this president, in that transcript and other actions, is a president who was abusing his power, using the power of the office of the presidency to try to get a foreign government, the Ukraine, to interfere on his behalf in an American election. And the evidence is also mounting that he withheld vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine that they need to stop Russian aggression. In my view, that is an impeachable offense, but -- but, the hearings will have to collect the evidence and the president and the White House will have an opportunity to put forward any exculpatory evidence they want. So, I won't reach any final conclusion until all the evidence is in, but the evidence that is in is very damming of the president's actions."

At this point, and again, briefly, do you see any chance that 20 Republicans are going to jump ship, Senate Republicans, jump ship on the president and vote to remove him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "Chris, I'm not going to prejudge anything, because there's still a lot of evidence to come in. The evidence about this Administration withholding very important military assistance to Ukraine, while the president tried, through is lawyer Giuliani and others to try to get Ukraine to interfere on President Trump's behalf in an election, as that evidence comes in I hope people will take a very close look at it and ask themselves, what would they have been doing and saying if President Obama had done something like that."

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jason Riley of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Charles Lane from \"The Washington Post,\" former DNC chair Donna Brazile, and Guy Benson of Fox News Radio. Jason, I am not often or easily shocked here at the anchor chair on Sunday mornings, but I have to say that the conjunction of reports that the -- that the Turkish-backed militia are committing atrocities and slaughtering, executing Kurdish civilians and soldiers, the fact that ISIS fighters are escaping, that the president has decided to pull all U.S. forces out of northern Syria and allow the Kurds to make common cause with the Assad regime and Russians, I find that shocking."

    {
      "speaker": "JASON RILEY, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of people find it shocking. Chris, the defense secretary said that our biggest strategic interests were China and Russia. Two big, important, powerful countries that are currently watching a couple ten pact dictators in Turkey and Syria thumb their nose at the United States, call the shots in terms of what Turkey is going to do, tell us what they are going to do, as the defense secretary said. I -- I find that -- that shocking as well. And the big concern here, of course, is we're abandoning allies in the Kurds. These are the people -- they were the ground came. We had the air support. We supported the intelligence, but they took the casualties, thousands of casualties. And they are now going to turn, out of self- preservation, to Russia and Syria if we are not going to back them. And the other problem here, Chris, is that, you know, ISIS is dispersed right now, but they are not defeated. And they will reconstitute if they have a safe place to do that. That is another problem with us leaving Syria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "The other question I have, Guy, on this is that the defense secretary, Mark Esper, says Turkey was going to do this anyway. They were going to come across the border and invade. We had troops, not a lot, but we had some troops on the border. We had U.S. fighters patrolling the area. They say they thought that Erdogan, the Turkish president, meant business. Do you really think he was going to take on the U.S., defy the U.S. and move in?"

Well, Turkey was going to do what they were going to do and we had nothing that we really had at our fingertips to stop them. No options. And I just find that hard to believe. I think many Americans find it hard to believe. It -- we don't have to say let's go to war with Turkey without saying behind the scenes, if you do this, the first boot on the ground, there's going to be a massive consequence. There will be military consequences. There will be economic consequences. I don't know if that was said, but it sounds like it was not. And I just keep coming back to this quote. It was a tweet from the president just a few days ago on the situation. Quote, anything that I and my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits, talking about what Turkey might do, I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey. I think many conservatives were rightly, deeply critical of President Obama on a red line in Syria. This wasn't a specific red line, but he said, if they go out-of-bounds, they're in huge trouble. The question that I have this morning is, what's the definition of out-of- bounds, if not what we're seeing right now?"

We know that this could lead to the reemergence of ISIS, or resurgence of ISIS. We know that it will likely lead to more conflict in the region.

Thirty-five thousand U.S. troops right now in Germany, 26,000 right now in South Korea, 55,000 in Japan. Chuck, what President Trump calls a police force has been a decision that if the U.S. puts troops on borders as tripwires, if you will, that sometimes -- oftentimes, in some -- these cases, for decades, it prevents wars. CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": We have, in the greater Middle East, about 60,000 troops. There're in places of lot of Americans probably don't even realize they are, like Oman and Qatar. And -- and, as you say, they're there for sort of a general securities function. What we're learning out of this situation is that many people who before his election regarded Donald Trump as some sort of dealmaker or pragmatist kind of got it wrong. He is deeply ideological about this point, that we are overcommitted overseas, people take advantage of us and advantage of our troop presence and don't pay for it and all we get out of it is money and lives lost. And that's a big part of the America first ideology that he deeply believes. And what he's learning is, that that simple grid, when you try to impose it over a complicated situation like this, it doesn't always work because he simultaneously promised we'll wipe out ISIS and we'll end the endless wars. And we're learning today that you can't really have both of those things."

We know if there's a vacuum, bad guys will fill it, particularly in this part of the world.

So instead of saying Rudy is my attorney, he said, Rudy has been my attorney. I said, uh-oh, that could not be good for Rudy. And, look, I'll tell you this, speaking to every single right-leaning person and Republican over the last few weeks, frankly, almost unanimously they're all saying, Rudy's a liability for the president. He's all over TV constantly. He's contradicting himself. He sometimes seems a little bit sort of crazed in -- in some of his responses. And now with this whole thing with the friends of Rudy getting arrested, this is a series of headlines that is not helpful to his client, who happens to be the president of the United States."

How big a liability, potentially, is that to the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "Well, when the president says he stands absolutely behind Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani probably ought to think about all the other people the president has said he stands behind, you know, including the Kurds today, and actually that is quite often in our history been the prelude to dumping him. There is a problem. I think Giuliani is a liability, both substantively and for all the optics reasons that Guy talked about. And now he is himself under a criminal investigation. It's kind of awkward to have your personal attorney in that position. But let's not forget, these two guys go back a long way. If -- if Donald Trump could be said to have a close, best friend, it might be Rudy Giuliani, going all the way back to New York. And so Rudy knows a lot, and maybe too much, to be cut loose just like that. So I would be surprised if in the very short term, before it absolutely becomes necessary, the president has to cut him loose, but definitely a lot of people want him to."

In the various court cases he says he has immunity from investigation, immunity from prosecution while he's president. And now, this week, he announced a complete halt in -- to any cooperation with Congress and his lawyer, the White House counsel, said this is unconstitutional and it's simply an attempt to overturn an election. Do you think -- I mean, on the one hand, if you say, I don't have to cooperate with the court's and I don't have to cooperate with Congress, do you think he can make that stick?"

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Counsel, make more -- hold more weight than others or potentially hold more weight than others with the court. We know the Constitution gives the Congress wide berth to define high crimes and misdemeanors. It can be whatever essentially they wanted it to. But there are sort of traditions that have been followed when it comes to impeachment inquiries, whether it was a Democratic Congress going after Nixon, or a Republican Congress going after Bill Clinton, and that was that you have an entire House vote on the formal inquiry to begin. And it gives a sort of bipartisan sheen to the proceedings and the current speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has ducked doing that. She's avoided doing that, I think, partly to protect some of her members that come from Trump district, and partly because she knows she'll get barely any, if any, Republicans to support this, which will expose it as the partisan exercise that it is. But I think the White House is smart to litigate this to death because the longer they do, and the closer we get to November of next year, the more voters will say, why do we need to impeach? Let's just go to the polls and decide if this amounts to something Donald Trump should lose his job over."

That evidence will be presented in articles of impeachment. The Senate will be able to look at this evidence and they will proceed to be the jury. I think the president should figure out what is his best strategy. Is -- is obstructing Congress, stonewalling the Congress, when the House has sole discretion. The Constitution gives the power to the House, the people's House, to make this decision. The president can go around name-calling all he wants, but Nancy Pelosi is focused on abiding by the Constitution and making sure that her committees come up with the evidence that will be presented to the American people and the Senate will act as jurors."
