      "sentences": "Now, I'm Laura Ingraham, and I think this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. Tonight, Dr. Fauci says that COVID is the perfect storm. We had storms tonight of viruses, of course, and we might never eradicate it. So what exactly does that mean for you and how do you go about your life? Dr. Scott Atlas is here tonight. He's going to tell us.  Also tonight, in an effort to appease the BLM movement, the English department at Rutgers University is declaring basic grammar biased. Prestigious former Professor Carol Swain says that this is pure racism. She's going to expose it.  Also, Barack Obama and Joe Biden recreate entourage. Remember that old HBO series and a political loser is a resurrected by streaming service. Raymond Arroyo explains it all in a special edition of \"Thursday Follies.\"  But first, \"Portland today, America Tomorrow,\" that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Over the last few days, Leftist radicals in Portland, many of them, Antifa and BLM supporters tried to burn down a federal courthouse with employees inside. They tried to rip down a Columbus statue in Chicago, throwing rocks and bottles at the police officers protecting it. 49 officers there were injured. And in Seattle, just last night, nearly 150 - don't you love calling them peaceful protesters - smashed windows and set multiple fires to businesses, including the storefronts of the very companies that swore their allegiance to Black Lives Matter. Of course, Joe Biden doesn't talk about any of this. After all the people causing the destruction are all going to vote for him.  And to the extent the media, aka the Biden campaign, actually cover the violence at all, they blame it on you know whom.",

Don't get in our way or we'll get 1,000 people to show up in your neighborhood, in front of your house, or even get AOC to support your primary opponent. The radicals are emboldened by these compliant and fearful Dems, and their ambitions go way beyond urban America. Of course, I know what you're thinking. You're saying, oh, Laura, this is limited to a few pockets of the country. It's not going to affect me in the suburbs. Rural Americans are safe, Laura, we have our Second Amendment rights. We're going to be OK.  Well, that's what the McCloskeys in St. Louis thought. But a corrupt Soros- backed city attorney figured out a way to make them out to be the bad guys in this situation, charging them with a felony and making an example out of them. If you try to defend your property, or your family from the violent mob we'll put you in jail.  Now right now, it's only Democrat Mayors and Governors who are giving aid and comfort to the rioters. But if Biden is elected, Antifa will consider it their victory and that means violence becomes an acceptable protest tactic and a staple of American life everywhere. Biden's DHS and DOJ will stand by and let it happen, calling it a legitimate act of expression in a country that after all, is systemically racist. In a Biden administration the chaos, like ongoing lockdowns, will become trusted means of intimidation and control in every town and city across all 50 states. Holy hell we'll be unleashed from coast to coast.",

He'll be fine no matter what happens. We're voting to save ourselves, our families, our kids, our churches, our schools, our whole way of life.

Really ridiculous quote. So Joe Biden has been in governance before, and no, he would not send aid at all. In fact, the BLM movement started under the Obama-Biden administration. And one of the thought here is that Joe Biden is the chaos candidate, whether it be how his administration fumbled Benghazi or Fast and Furious or IRS - the IRS scandal around it.  This idea that Joe Biden is going to be return to peace and normality. It's the exact opposite. You're going to have that band of radicals have unlimited power, and Joe Biden will basically just abdicate all of it to the AOC wing of the party.

And then there's probably about 25 or so that worked very well in cells. That does not mean that it's going to work and people and that requires, further testing and a variety of different steps.

But this particular type of virus that SARS-CoV-2 is, really needs those fats for a variety of reasons, both to get into cells, to amplify itself once it's in cells, and even it attaches fat to even some components of the virus itself. And so when fat content is very high, that's an environment where the virus is really going to thrive. And so in cell culture and cells in a petri dish, if you add something like Fenofibrate, you're really going to reduce the availability of those lipids or those fats, which really restricts the ability of the virus to replicate.

We know the fatality rate is much lower, we know who to protect. we're doubling down on the protection of the high-risk group. We're doing better with patients in the hospitals. I think we have to - we tell the American people here this is not out of control here. We are cautiously optimistic, because we see length of stays in hospital are only one third compared to April. Mortality of people entering the hospital is only one half. We're doing less people need an ICU, less people who are immunizing need a ventilator. We have better drugs now with a much better handling of how these patients should be treated. We have younger patients, lower risk, getting almost all the cases, not the high-risk people. And so the strategy here that has been outlined by the briefings this week is very clear. We know that more relaxation is going to get more cases. By the way, you don't eradicate a virus by locking down. That's just a complete misconception. We go with socializing, we're going to get more cases. We need to protect the vulnerable, double down on that. We need to have -- make sure that hospitals are not overextended. And in fact, most hospitals are not. When you look at the data, which I do 100 times a day, even Texas, Florida, Arizona, I'm cautiously optimistic here because the trends are stable or even coming down. Yes, there are certain hospitals that are isolated hospitals that are extended in capacity. That's going to be one of the rules of the federal government to make sure that they can handle the capacity. But there is absolutely no reason to panic here. We know what's going on here. This is not March or April. This is not some kind of black box of what's going on. Moreover, I just want to go on to one thing, which is that there's a lot of great data coming out about immunity. And it's probably not known to the public, but there's a lot of data that shows people have immunity, even people that didn't get the infection. There's a reason why the original shift with no social distancing only 24 percent of people got infection. And that's probably due to this T cell immunity which is present and is now showing the last three years from papers from Sweden's Karolinska Institute and Singapore, they take blood from people from SARS One, and 17 years later, there is indication that that blood still has an immune response. So I think people should be much more optimistic here.",

Number two, as the CDC outlined today and is now as clear as a bell, they are serious harms to children from closing schools. I think the president outlined this very well in the briefing. And number three, it's a national priority to educate our children. This is really just not even controversial. To add icing on the cake, we can do it by protecting the few high-risk teachers. Most teachers are not in the high-risk age group, as I've outlined before. Half of them are under 41 and under 82 percent under 55. They are not usually high risk, but we can accommodate that in schools with social distancing, and if they are still afraid, they can use long distance learning. But long distance learning is a proven failure now. And we also know, and the CDC acknowledged it in detail on their website today that children are not frequent spreaders of this infection. So there's really not a big risk here. In fact, the children are not at risk at all, and we absolutely must open the schools.",

Remember that old HBO series and a political loser is a resurrected by streaming service. Raymond Arroyo explains it all in a special edition of \"Thursday Follies.\" But first, \"Portland today, America Tomorrow,\" that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Over the last few days, Leftist radicals in Portland, many of them, Antifa and BLM supporters tried to burn down a federal courthouse with employees inside. They tried to rip down a Columbus statue in Chicago, throwing rocks and bottles at the police officers protecting it. 49 officers there were injured. And in Seattle, just last night, nearly 150 - don't you love calling them peaceful protesters - smashed windows and set multiple fires to businesses, including the storefronts of the very companies that swore their allegiance to Black Lives Matter. Of course, Joe Biden doesn't talk about any of this. After all the people causing the destruction are all going to vote for him.

So to combat often on lockdowns, we need to find useful beneficial therapeutics, the ones that have been around for many years and any new ones. Tonight, we want to present you with another potential breakthrough. An Israeli team and a group of researchers at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center led by Dr. Benjamin tenOever, have discovered a 1970s drug may reduce COVID-19 symptoms to that of a common cold. The cholesterol lowering drug for Fenofibrate is showing promising results after three months of research. Their study may also explain why certain groups are at higher risk when it comes to contracting a serious case of COVID. Joining us now is one of the doctors behind this discovery. Dr. Benjamin tenOever. Doctor, we know there's a long way to go here, but are you fairly hopeful that there may be a path forward with this therapeutic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. BENJAMIN TENOEVER, MOUNT SINAI MICROBIOLOGY",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks for having me. I certainly hope so. So the drug is called Fenofibrate. And you know, it looks really great. But it's really important to remember that we're still testing in cells and dishes. And, there are probably - there's a very large effort across the country to test the 20,000 FDA approved drugs in cells to see what stops this virus. And then there's probably about 25 or so that worked very well in cells. That does not mean that it's going to work and people and that requires, further testing and a variety of different steps. And so Fenofibrate has passed that first test, but it's really important to keep in mind that, it has to still reach the necessary concentrations where the virus actually is replicating in your body."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, Fenofibrate, I finally got the pronunciation, right, doctor. Explain why it's working in in-vitro, what mechanism to the layman out there who are becoming more fascinated about the cellular structure here, why does it work? And what implications does that have for the way this virus could be treated going forward?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TENOEVER",
      "utterance": "Sure. So, so Fenofibrate actually blocked something called triglycerides, but really, it's about lipids or fats. And so your cells are made of fats and fat is an essential part of life. But this particular type of virus that SARS-CoV-2 is, really needs those fats for a variety of reasons, both to get into cells, to amplify itself once it's in cells, and even it attaches fat to even some components of the virus itself. And so when fat content is very high, that's an environment where the virus is really going to thrive. And so in cell culture and cells in a petri dish, if you add something like Fenofibrate, you're really going to reduce the availability of those lipids or those fats, which really restricts the ability of the virus to replicate. And so that might actually be a viable strategy in people, but it has to be at the right concentrations and has to get to the right spot and that's not a foregone conclusion yet."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TENOEVER",
      "utterance": "Yes, probably. It's probably a little bit more complicated than that and that those comorbidities also impact your immune system and your capacity to deal with stresses like viruses. But certainly the high lipid content in the body will be reflected even at the cellular level, which, gives this virus the perfect opportunity to replicate fast and to spread."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. SCOTT ATLAS, HOOVER INSTITUTION, SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Hey, Laura, thanks for having me. Well, I prefer to look at this this way. Actually, I'm cautiously optimistic, because we actually know a lot now. We know the fatality rate is much lower, we know who to protect. we're doubling down on the protection of the high-risk group. We're doing better with patients in the hospitals. I think we have to - we tell the American people here this is not out of control here. We are cautiously optimistic, because we see length of stays in hospital are only one third compared to April. Mortality of people entering the hospital is only one half. We're doing less people need an ICU, less people who are immunizing need a ventilator. We have better drugs now with a much better handling of how these patients should be treated. We have younger patients, lower risk, getting almost all the cases, not the high-risk people. And so the strategy here that has been outlined by the briefings this week is very clear. We know that more relaxation is going to get more cases. By the way, you don't eradicate a virus by locking down. That's just a complete misconception. We go with socializing, we're going to get more cases. We need to protect the vulnerable, double down on that. We need to have -- make sure that hospitals are not overextended. And in fact, most hospitals are not. When you look at the data, which I do 100 times a day, even Texas, Florida, Arizona, I'm cautiously optimistic here because the trends are stable or even coming down. Yes, there are certain hospitals that are isolated hospitals that are extended in capacity. That's going to be one of the rules of the federal government to make sure that they can handle the capacity. But there is absolutely no reason to panic here. We know what's going on here. This is not March or April. This is not some kind of black box of what's going on. Moreover, I just want to go on to one thing, which is that there's a lot of great data coming out about immunity. And it's probably not known to the public, but there's a lot of data that shows people have immunity, even people that didn't get the infection. There's a reason why the original shift with no social distancing only 24 percent of people got infection. And that's probably due to this T cell immunity which is present and is now showing the last three years from papers from Sweden's Karolinska Institute and Singapore, they take blood from people from SARS One, and 17 years later, there is indication that that blood still has an immune response. So I think people should be much more optimistic here."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We've been talking about T cell to herd immunity on this show now for well over six weeks. And there is an enormous amount the administration could do, Scott, to test for T cell immunity, which would give people a lot more confidence, I think, about going on with their lives are not freaking out every time they leave the house, because there are some indications there could be as much as 30 percent in some communities already of that T cell immunity, which you just talked about. And I really think the FDA should move on that. But the big news coming out of today's briefing, Scott, was the president canceling the Jacksonville portion of the RNC convention. And Jim Acosta over at CNN had a very interesting take on it."

    {
      "speaker": "ATLAS",
      "utterance": "Well, the schools is actually not even a controversial issue, in my view, because there are three basic things that are irrefutable here. Number one, it's irrefutable that children have extremely low risk from this disease, much less than seasonal flu. Number two, as the CDC outlined today and is now as clear as a bell, they are serious harms to children from closing schools. I think the president outlined this very well in the briefing. And number three, it's a national priority to educate our children. This is really just not even controversial. To add icing on the cake, we can do it by protecting the few high-risk teachers. Most teachers are not in the high-risk age group, as I've outlined before. Half of them are under 41 and under 82 percent under 55. They are not usually high risk, but we can accommodate that in schools with social distancing, and if they are still afraid, they can use long distance learning. But long distance learning is a proven failure now. And we also know, and the CDC acknowledged it in detail on their website today that children are not frequent spreaders of this infection. So there's really not a big risk here. In fact, the children are not at risk at all, and we absolutely must open the schools."

And if you think about critical race theory, the assumption is that if you're white, you're privileged, and that racism is permanent, that whites have to divest themselves of whiteness. But behind all of that is white superiority that black people are pushing. And so what they are saying is that black people can't learn the same way as other groups, so they have to have this special treatment. And when I went to college, I started in the 70s, I was in graduate school in the 1980s, we were given an equal opportunity. We were admitted to colleges and universities, and we had to do the work. And you had to qualify. You got an opportunity to be there, but once you were there, you had to meet the same standards as everyone else. It was either sink or drown or whatever the expression is, but you had to do the work.
