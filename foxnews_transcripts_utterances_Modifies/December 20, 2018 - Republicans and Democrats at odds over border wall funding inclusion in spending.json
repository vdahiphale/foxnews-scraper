For a number of weeks now House and Senate Democrats and Republicans have worked together to put together an appropriations bill to meet the needs of the American people and now to keep government open. Somehow or other, and I don't know what the answer to the question is, the president of the United States prefers to shut government down, and will resist any opportunity to keep government open. Again, we are completely ready, as we have been for a while, with bipartisan, bicameral legislation to pass a sixth appropriations bill and have a continuing resolution for the seventh bill if we cannot come to terms on that. We've offered that to the president. We've also offered him a continuing resolution with seven bills in it. Yesterday the United States Senate passed legislation overwhelmingly, and I'll yield to the distinguished leader in the Senate to talk about that.  The president is doing everything that he can to shut the government down. You have to ask the question, why? Does he not believe in governance? Does he not care about the American people? Doesn't he know that the economy is uncertain? Hasn't he followed the stock market that he likes to brag about sometimes? There's something wrong with this picture, especially in the holiday season. And so if they make the bill bad enough, they are able to get enough votes on the House side, but for a shameful bill that is unworthy of this House of Representatives and certainly of the American people.

General Mattis is stepping down, and we know he has real disagreements with the president on Syria and on the wall. And now President Trump is throwing a temper tantrum and creating the Trump shutdown of the government.   Last night the Senate passed by voice unanimously a bill proposed by leader McConnell. All Speaker Ryan has to do is put it on the floor of the House, it will get a majority of votes, and the president can sign it and avoid a shutdown. But unfortunately, President Trump was attacked this morning and last night by the hard right, and, fearful, he backed off his commitment to sign this bill.  Republican leaders told us yesterday that he was ready to sign the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously, every Democrat and every Republican, to avoid a government shutdown. The bill contained neither Democratic demands or Republican demands. It said to the American people, we have a way to keep the government open. And Leader Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and myself have done everything we can to avoid a shutdown. But President Trump wants one. He has asked for 25 times, and he said in front of us he'd be proud to shut down the government. It is nothing to be proud of. The bottom line is simple -- the Trump temper tantrum will shut on the government, but it will not get him his wall. The bill that is on the floor of the House everyone knows will not pass the Senate.  Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy have cynically put it on the floor of the House, knowing it can't pass the Senate. Everyone knows it can't pass the Senate. It's a cynical attempt, a cynical attempt to just hurt innocent people, and do just what President Trump wants, even though they probably know it's bad for the country.  So the bottom line is very simple. There's still hope. Leader Pelosi and I have put two proposals on the table -- we have not taken them off -- that would avoid a government shutdown and get a majority of votes in the House and the Senate. Leader McConnell had put on the floor last night a proposal that would avoid shutting down the government. It is a shame that this president, who is plunging the nation into chaos, is throwing another temper tantrum and going to hurt lots of innocent people. The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall.",

It's a beautiful letter about, again, our values as a nation in terms of our national security written by a patriotic American, who was a comfort too many of us as a voice of stability in the Trump administration. So just look at this week. The president taking troops out of Syria without the full consultation with the national security leaders of his own administration. The president taking actions that encourage his secretary of defense to issue a letter of resignation. He's reversing his position about signing a bill. Maybe he thinks if government is shutdown he can golf more comfortably. That's not how it works. Government must work even if you are golfing for two weeks. So there is something very wrong with this picture, and this resignation is one -- we just agreed from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo, that was last Thursday, so it was one week ago.

For a number of weeks now House and Senate Democrats and Republicans have worked together to put together an appropriations bill to meet the needs of the American people and now to keep government open. Somehow or other, and I don't know what the answer to the question is, the president of the United States prefers to shut government down, and will resist any opportunity to keep government open. Again, we are completely ready, as we have been for a while, with bipartisan, bicameral legislation to pass a sixth appropriations bill and have a continuing resolution for the seventh bill if we cannot come to terms on that. We've offered that to the president. We've also offered him a continuing resolution with seven bills in it. Yesterday the United States Senate passed legislation overwhelmingly, and I'll yield to the distinguished leader in the Senate to talk about that. The president is doing everything that he can to shut the government down. You have to ask the question, why? Does he not believe in governance? Does he not care about the American people? Doesn't he know that the economy is uncertain? Hasn't he followed the stock market that he likes to brag about sometimes? There's something wrong with this picture, especially in the holiday season. And so if they make the bill bad enough, they are able to get enough votes on the House side, but for a shameful bill that is unworthy of this House of Representatives and certainly of the American people. With that I yield to the distinguished leader from the Senate."

General Mattis is stepping down, and we know he has real disagreements with the president on Syria and on the wall. And now President Trump is throwing a temper tantrum and creating the Trump shutdown of the government. Last night the Senate passed by voice unanimously a bill proposed by leader McConnell. All Speaker Ryan has to do is put it on the floor of the House, it will get a majority of votes, and the president can sign it and avoid a shutdown. But unfortunately, President Trump was attacked this morning and last night by the hard right, and, fearful, he backed off his commitment to sign this bill. Republican leaders told us yesterday that he was ready to sign the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously, every Democrat and every Republican, to avoid a government shutdown. The bill contained neither Democratic demands or Republican demands. It said to the American people, we have a way to keep the government open. And Leader Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and myself have done everything we can to avoid a shutdown. But President Trump wants one. He has asked for 25 times, and he said in front of us he'd be proud to shut down the government. It is nothing to be proud of. The bottom line is simple -- the Trump temper tantrum will shut on the government, but it will not get him his wall. The bill that is on the floor of the House everyone knows will not pass the Senate. Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy have cynically put it on the floor of the House, knowing it can't pass the Senate. Everyone knows it can't pass the Senate. It's a cynical attempt, a cynical attempt to just hurt innocent people, and do just what President Trump wants, even though they probably know it's bad for the country. So the bottom line is very simple. There's still hope. Leader Pelosi and I have put two proposals on the table -- we have not taken them off -- that would avoid a government shutdown and get a majority of votes in the House and the Senate. Leader McConnell had put on the floor last night a proposal that would avoid shutting down the government. It is a shame that this president, who is plunging the nation into chaos, is throwing another temper tantrum and going to hurt lots of innocent people. The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall."

But whether they will do that or not, your guess is as good as mine. Donald Trump wants a shutdown, and they seem to be so afraid that they are going to along. We'll see."

It's a letter of great patriotism, respect for the president, but also a statement of his values, where he talks about the strength of our nation is intrinsically linked, the strength of the unique and comprehensive system of alliances that we have that he talks about, that we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries with strategic interests that are increasingly in tensions with ours. It's a beautiful letter about, again, our values as a nation in terms of our national security written by a patriotic American, who was a comfort too many of us as a voice of stability in the Trump administration. So just look at this week. The president taking troops out of Syria without the full consultation with the national security leaders of his own administration. The president taking actions that encourage his secretary of defense to issue a letter of resignation. He's reversing his position about signing a bill. Maybe he thinks if government is shutdown he can golf more comfortably. That's not how it works. Government must work even if you are golfing for two weeks. So there is something very wrong with this picture, and this resignation is one -- we just agreed from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo, that was last Thursday, so it was one week ago. Our troops look to Secretary Mattis as a leader, and now he is going to be leaving them. This is very serious for our country. I yield."

We don't want to be fearmongers in terms of our country. This great country can withstand just about anything, but it shouldn't have to. It shouldn't have to.

Read his letter. Have you read his letter? Read his letter and examine the activities that have led up to it and what it means. Because of his leadership, we are safe, yes. We have to pray that we are safe and we have to continue to make sure the American people are assured we're safe. That is the oath of office we take, to protect and defend, and we will.

They have gone from maybe there's some money, maybe it's old money, but there is some money for the wall, to now there will be no money for the wall. And this has put Trump in a very precarious political position, because, on the one hand, both a shutdown and the wall are unpopular with the public at large. But when it comes to his conservative base, if Trump fails to secure money for the wall during this, which may be his last opportunity that means the base might rebel, and that's the difference between a president who is at 43 percent approval and at 37, 36 percent approval."

You are looking at a lot of people affected from different agencies that have not been funded yet. But there will be people who argue that this is not going to be as painful to see, and that they are going to eventually solve on the back end of this before anybody feels the pain."

They will be paid later when the whole thing is resolved. But they won't be paid now when it's due to them. But in terms of the public at large, 75 percent of the public -- of the government has already been funded. And a lot of what is done here does not affect people's everyday lives like the receiving of benefit checks and things like that that will not stop. So it's not as if we've never had a government shutdown before."

When the president of the United States, and I never met Mr. Trump until I met him as president-elect when he called me back for a job interview, when the president of the United States asks you to do something in America, you just do it."

In that resignation letter, A.B., Secretary Mattis writes \"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by more than four decades of immersion in these issues.\" He also writes that the president should have someone who is aligned with his thinking. Clearly a signal that comes after the Syria withdrawal move and ahead of what we now confirm is an Afghanistan withdrawal as well."

I was upset that he quit. Apparently he might have been fired, which makes it even worse. But in a letter he makes sure to draw contrast with what he sees as a need to nurture and protect the liberal order that we spent 70 years investing in that he thinks Trump and other critics of Trump's America First policy is taking a wrecking ball to, and he makes clear that respect for allies, coalition building, all of this is part of our long-term national security. I'm speculating here, but what we learned today about his conversation on Friday, the president's, with president Erdogan of Turkey, that he would announce an assault on the Kurds and then we would leave the Kurds hanging with this announcement within a few days, has to be a huge central focus of this disagreement."

He informed his staff after returning from the White House this afternoon. Mattis met with the president this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. He called his staff together for meeting a little after 5:00. He had handed in his resignation letter. And obviously, Matthew, you can extrapolate why that gets to that point. He had been talked about, rumored about leaving at some point, which is why I asked the question at the Reagan Defense Forum."

      "utterance": "Probably not anyone expected to be in this manner. Mattis, one of the most popular members of Trump's cabinet along with Ambassador Nikki Haley who is also departing at the end of the year -- the word that struck out to me, Bret, was \"alliances.\" And Mattis has had this long held this belief that alliances our force multipliers, that in fact alliances are the instruments of American power. You need to sustain them. They are what increase our deterrent edge. If I think people in Washington are shocked, I think people in foreign capitals are going to be even more shocked and more worrisome about this move. There is this idea that all of these withdrawals, firing Mattis, removing Mattis is going to make the world more a peaceful place. In my view, that's completely wrong. In fact, as America withdraws, as we know, bad actors move in, the chances of war have increased tonight."

It makes it abundantly clear that we are headed toward a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage or alliances, and empower our adversaries. I don't have that much time, Byron, but this is quite a week for this White House."

They should be helping us do that. And he is asking people, what was our goal in Syria? What can we do in Afghanistan that we haven't already done in 17 years? So the president is now pushing back against the national security establishment."
