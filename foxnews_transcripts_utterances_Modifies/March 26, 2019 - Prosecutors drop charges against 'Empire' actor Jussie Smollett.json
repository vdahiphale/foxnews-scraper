Listen, out of everybody at this table, I actually disagree with you slightly on that, this not being a 9/11 or WMD failure from the intelligence committee. I think it is of that level. And I speak as someone -- I've been in the intelligence community since I was like 25 years old, I think 26 years old. And one of the things that you're taught as an analyst when you come in is what were the failures, the analytic failures that happened leading up to 9/11 and WMD and how did we miss all of these? And what I have suspected for a long time with these leaders of the FBI, and the CIA, the DNI, they forgot the basic analytic lessons that you learn as a junior analyst when this -- there were definitely a lot of red flags there. For sure there was red flag because of what the Russians were doing. And it was the Russians that were trying to infiltrate. So they see all of this maligned behavior from the Russians, they see a lot of red flags, and because of a lack of fully looking at the evidence, they jump to analytic conclusions about the president that I think are one of the most damaging things that any of us have ever seen in our lifetime.   Let's not, you know, sugarcoat this. They accused the president of treason without having evidence to back it up. And as a person who has spent my life in the intelligence community, it is so damning to the men and women who faithfully, who are patriots who go and try to do this work every day. And I think the stain that the American public has for the intelligence committee because of these unethical political leaders can't be discounted.",

As many as four Trump officials were illegally surveilled and contacted by the CIA. And then when she lost, they used this as an insurance policy to reverse the election results. Trump caught wind of it, fired Comey and was totally vindicated.

Listen, out of everybody at this table, I actually disagree with you slightly on that, this not being a 9/11 or WMD failure from the intelligence committee. I think it is of that level. And I speak as someone -- I've been in the intelligence community since I was like 25 years old, I think 26 years old. And one of the things that you're taught as an analyst when you come in is what were the failures, the analytic failures that happened leading up to 9/11 and WMD and how did we miss all of these? And what I have suspected for a long time with these leaders of the FBI, and the CIA, the DNI, they forgot the basic analytic lessons that you learn as a junior analyst when this -- there were definitely a lot of red flags there. For sure there was red flag because of what the Russians were doing. And it was the Russians that were trying to infiltrate. So they see all of this maligned behavior from the Russians, they see a lot of red flags, and because of a lack of fully looking at the evidence, they jump to analytic conclusions about the president that I think are one of the most damaging things that any of us have ever seen in our lifetime. Let's not, you know, sugarcoat this. They accused the president of treason without having evidence to back it up. And as a person who has spent my life in the intelligence community, it is so damning to the men and women who faithfully, who are patriots who go and try to do this work every day. And I think the stain that the American public has for the intelligence committee because of these unethical political leaders can't be discounted."

You have to understand that there were a group of people who felt that they were so right that they could do -- they could actually be undercover that they could do sneaky things because they were saving the world. They, in their heads, they were superheroes but they were actually deep state because they were doing the wrong thing, but they didn't think they were doing the wrong thing. And the long-term damage here -- I mean the big story is we -- there's a lot of damage between people and nations because of this. There were people who expected nothing less than war over this or taking out a president who might be taking out, the removing the president, because he might be a Russian agent. That's how far the hallucination got. That's why people when they laugh at the deep state it's because they thought that they were doing right. When you're wearing a black hat, you think you're wearing a white hat. That's essentially what's going on. But I have to -- you know, Jesse's right, the deep state existed.

We're going to close this chapter and we're going to talk about health care. And then there's the Democrats that don't care about the party. They care about their reputations because their reputations are in tatters so now they're just doing damage control and following this down a rabbit hole. The collusion thing is now done but now it's the obstruction, and that's the only thing they can hang their hat on. And it's hard to obstruct a crime that you didn't commit, but they can do whatever they want. I just don't think it's going to work for them at the ballot box."

They'll think the deep state is Barr and Rosenstein, excuse me. Schiff and crew have gone overnight from being the hunter to the prey. So now they're being chased down the hallway by the reporters and asked, are you going to resign? Are you going to do this? And pretty soon I imagine a lot of Democrats are going to say we should really move on and talk about something else. But I don't think that they're going to be completely able to do that partly because someone like a Lindsey Graham says, oh, no, we're going to have a hearing.

And I think -- listen, all of this stuff, the FISA, the unmasking of administration officials, the leaking of classified information, I mean, all of this stuff is fair game because I think -- I did not rejoice when Jim Comey came out and give that press conference against Hillary Clinton. When I watched that live, I thought what in the world is going on here? He's disparaging this woman without charging her, and to do the same to anybody in this report. My understanding from what Judge Napolitano just said in the last hour is that that's actually not the proper way to follow regulation. You shouldn't do that. But I think these things are fair game because the president is right. This shouldn't happen again, not to a Republican president or a Democrat president.

It was all kind of like this underlying saying -- saying we're punishing him even though we can't nail him on something because somebody seriously pulled some strings. Talk about privilege. That's celebrity privilege. I've got to hand it to him. He blew Trump off the news pages. But there's a unanimous sense that he's guilty and he will never be free of it. And the fact that he took this deal is an admission of guilt because he let him keep the money. And then he took -- and the idea of volunteerism is somehow mentioned. That's his community service. And you saw even the lawyer didn't even know what was going on. Why aren't they saying? She said, you know, don't try the two attackers in the press. The two attackers attacked her client.

And the fact that those crimes may now be doubted because of his actions and what he did. For me that was the most compelling part of the press conference because we do know these things are on the rise. And instead of trying to get to the root of the problem, we just want to blame anybody because of their politics and who they support. Why don't we realize that hate and racism and all of these things doesn't matter what political opponent -- political party you support or what your religion is. It comes in all forms.

I call it a bad week for CNN, but it's just another week for CNN. It'd be nice to see some introspection from the media maybe ask themselves how do we fall for this and did we play a role in fooling others. But they can't because there is profit in this narrative, a narrative that so division that could have destroyed a country by branding a President, a Russian spy. They didn't care. They still don't.

You can still report on the Russia collusion investigation, but look around you, don't just look on one side of the story because that's what Fox did. And then we benefited from that. I think what's going to happen now and you saw the ratings last night. The ratings for Fox were astronomical and the ratings for CNN lower than usual and MSNBC really, really soft. There is going to be a hangover, I think you said at the top. People are going to feel deceived. If I were a reviewer, I would feel misled. And you know when you feel like you've put all your eggs in one basket and then it doesn't deliver, you're going to take a little break from TV and you're not going to watch TV for a little while.

So, I had him on today and I wanted to ask him about the SDNY. But then Smollett broke. But what he says in the book and this is what the - take it or not. I'm just going tell you the SDNY people believe that they do great work that no matter who it is that they go after them. I have a feeling though especially with Avenatti lawyers do not like dirty lawyers, right. So, prosecutors are going to make sure that he has to - this guy, he says he's confident he'll be exonerated. I'm confident that he'll be found guilty."

Like most of us, all of us could see a sleazy person a mile away, but not if you're under the spell of confirmation bias. During the Kavanaugh hearing, the media wanted to believe in him because they wanted Kavanaugh to be deemed some kind of a serial rapist, so they overlooked the scumminess of this lawyer. So, Avenatti was able to game the system, game the media because you could see that by feeding the media what they wanted, they were going to overlook everything about him, all the little things the signs were telling you this dude is bad news. I know this dude is bad news but he's telling me what I want to hear. And so, they indulged him and gave him a bigger footprint.

That's Pennsylvania Verizon worker, Maurice German rescuing Princess Momma, a cat that was stranded on a utility pole for 12 hours after calling the fire department, animal rescue and the phone company. The cat's owners asked German for help. He used his truck's hydraulic lift to raise himself up and grab the kitty. And for saving the cat, he was suspended for three weeks without pay. Verizon said, using the hydraulic system near electrical wires violated its policies. Neighbors have created a GoFundMe page for German and it's raised over $3000. Verizon has made a donation to the local animal rescue group. So, good things came of what looked like a very troubled situation."

So, for those of you in the audience who know that I did not throw up or pass out which was really awesome. They're also filming Top Gun 2 out there, which is very cool.
