STEVE HILTON, HOST, \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\": Yes, I think that they are trying to fight back against accusations that they're not taking it seriously and it's all just a hoax and all the rest of it. But I think the truth is both the threat is overstated and the response is completely wrong. It's overstated because it's not really a threat to democracy -- they're using the wrong language. It's not about democracy. It's not about the voting process itself that they're really talking about. They are focusing on social media.

The only way you can defend media performances, or if you get really upset about Donald Trump criticizing the media, if you think that the media are doing a good job. And the fact is very few Americans actually think the media are doing a good job.  A recent poll showed that 72 percent of Americans think that the media deliberately report fake, false, or misleading news. I think the misleading thing is really significant there. It's not the people are just making up facts out of whole cloth, but the bias and the self- aggrandizement, and the idiocy that people see in the media is frustrating them, and the media really need to take a hard look inside. Jim Acosta telling a woman that she needs to say certain words or he's not going to stop yelling at her is not going to improve the relationship between the media and the American people.",

And the media here seems to me insufferably pompous and self-regarding. Of course, it's true that the press are a vital part of democracy, but they are not above everyone else, and they are not above criticism.

And everybody agrees that propaganda is bad, fake news is bad, but then they cut off that word \"fake\" and just say news. And when they do that, it gives their critics so much ammunition.

      "utterance": "Donald Trump did not create distrust of the media. Distrust of the media helped create Donald Trump, and the media really need to get a handle on why so many Americans don't just dislike them but loathe them. The only way you can defend media performances, or if you get really upset about Donald Trump criticizing the media, if you think that the media are doing a good job. And the fact is very few Americans actually think the media are doing a good job. A recent poll showed that 72 percent of Americans think that the media deliberately report fake, false, or misleading news. I think the misleading thing is really significant there. It's not the people are just making up facts out of whole cloth, but the bias and the self- aggrandizement, and the idiocy that people see in the media is frustrating them, and the media really need to take a hard look inside. Jim Acosta telling a woman that she needs to say certain words or he's not going to stop yelling at her is not going to improve the relationship between the media and the American people."

But then you look at the GOP voters and the split there. Leslie, I think we can say effectively the media is not the enemy. You saw the president's parsing of it, it's the fake news, that is the enemy of the people. The outrage button goes to 11 every day, it seems. And then they forget that other things are happening. Your thoughts on all of this?"

      "utterance": "I'm glad you showed that poll because this is one of the things that I am saying, and it actually speaks to what Russia is doing successfully, which is dividing us as a nation further, and along political lines, and we are seeing that her. It's sort of like there are people on the right that think, not this, being Fox, a certain network is bad, those on the right, they think another network is bad based on anything that isn't said that they agree with or that they like. For example, the president likes anybody on any network that says something positive on him, any world leader that says anything positive about him. And I think his followers and many in the GOP are showing that by the results of that poll."

On the one hand you have many in the press who have an incentive to be very oppositional toward the Trump administration, who have an incentive to be sensationalist, to get ratings, and also to also get a sense of heroism against the Trump administration. And on the other hand, you have the Trump administration which clearly understands that its base is extremely distrustful of the media and for many, many years, the conservative base of the Republican Party has viewed the media is basically the epitome of the political and cultural elite in this country. So I don't see this debate or argument ending anytime soon."

      "utterance": "But he is making it be, and he is bullying her on a regular basis in an extremely offensive way. But I want to address the big point, which is when I think of this debate in the context of the very robust back-and-forth between the press and the politicians that I grew up with in the U.K., the whole thing just strikes me as being ridiculous. And the media here seems to me insufferably pompous and self-regarding. Of course, it's true that the press are a vital part of democracy, but they are not above everyone else, and they are not above criticism. Criticizing the free press is not the same as being a threat to the free press. And I think what most people look at all this and need self-pitying winging from the media and think what a bunch of sanctimonious idiots."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It is really important not just to have laws that protect freedom of the press but a culture that supports it, as well. So while it's absolutely true that you can criticize the press, you do want your politicians and political leaders to support the culture surrounding the press. The problem is that the media give way too much ammunition to their critics. Even how we talked about this, Donald Trump has repeatedly said fake news is the enemy of the American people. And everybody agrees that propaganda is bad, fake news is bad, but then they cut off that word \"fake\" and just say news. And when they do that, it gives their critics so much ammunition. We really need to see better behavior from the media if they truly want to hold this administration accountable, and holding this administration accountable is one of the things they should be doing."
