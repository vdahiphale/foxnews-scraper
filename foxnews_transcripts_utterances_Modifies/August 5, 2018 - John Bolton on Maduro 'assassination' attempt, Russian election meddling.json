They're going to will evaluate conditions today but they focused on that principle responsibility and as of now feel pretty confident that Americans are accounted for.  Now, with respect to what happened last afternoon, look, it could be a lot of things from a pretext set up by the Maduro regime itself, or something else. He's made accusations accusing the outgoing president of Columbia responsibility, what he calls the extreme right wing in Venezuela, that means the vast opposition to his authoritarian role and he's blamed unnamed fancers (ph) in the United States.  These are things he has said before and you have to take them for what they are worth. If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we'll take a serious look at it.

The president knew exactly what was going to be said at that press briefing on Thursday. He's the one who directed it be held. It came as the result of a National Security Council meeting we had held the Friday before where the heads of the operating agencies and departments before who attended the press briefing on Thursday and others told the president what it was doing, he felt it was important that the American people hear directly from the people responsible for election security at the federal level, hear what they were up to, at least in a non-classified environment.

The president, President Maduro, speaking at a military event when drones loaded with explosives exploded. You can see security protecting him with ballistic blankets and military -- it was a national guard event at the event in Caracas, begin the stampede. Question, did the U.S. play any role, and what's our reaction to what he was calling an assassination attempt?"
    },

      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I can say unequivocally there is no U.S. government involvement in this at all. Just within the past couple of hours, I have spoken with our charge in Caracas, the head diplomatic official down there. He and his staff were up much of the night making sure that Americans in Venezuela were safe. As of now, we think everybody notice to the embassy is in a secure position. They're going to will evaluate conditions today but they focused on that principle responsibility and as of now feel pretty confident that Americans are accounted for. Now, with respect to what happened last afternoon, look, it could be a lot of things from a pretext set up by the Maduro regime itself, or something else. He's made accusations accusing the outgoing president of Columbia responsibility, what he calls the extreme right wing in Venezuela, that means the vast opposition to his authoritarian role and he's blamed unnamed fancers (ph) in the United States. These are things he has said before and you have to take them for what they are worth. If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we'll take a serious look at it. But in the meantime, I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and the oppression of the Maduro regime in Venezuela."

You know, I got to know Eugene McCarthy, the late Democratic senator, very well. He was a client of mine in Buckley against Valeo. He's an iconoclastic guy. He used to describe the press as a group of birds sitting on a telephone wire. One would fly off and then they'd all fly off. That's what this narrative I think it is all about. The president knew exactly what was going to be said at that press briefing on Thursday. He's the one who directed it be held. It came as the result of a National Security Council meeting we had held the Friday before where the heads of the operating agencies and departments before who attended the press briefing on Thursday and others told the president what it was doing, he felt it was important that the American people hear directly from the people responsible for election security at the federal level, hear what they were up to, at least in a non-classified environment. So, that's why we had the briefing."

That's not the press making that up, that's anybody who looks at it has got to see a difference there."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",

As to that, I don't think there's any evidence publicly but everybody who participated in the press conference Thursday agreed, as has the president on several public occasions that the intelligence community assessment of Russian meddling in 2016 is valid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But one of the most powerful ways that Mr. Trump can try to prevent any meddling in the 2018 election is to stand up in public and call out Vladimir Putin and say knock it off. I want to go back to Helsinki and to the joint summit news conference there."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, as the president said, he misspoke. The subsequent point in the press conference and that he intended to say just that, he had a statement issued the next day that I think made clear where he stood on the issue. And as I say, you can't read any motive into what he did other than his deep concern about Russian election meddling than to put the four operating heads and myself out for that press briefing. The whole point of that was to show what his administration was doing to counter Russian meddling and other broader influence operations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But in Kristin Fisher's piece about the rally last night, he talks about meddling and he said there was a lot of people involved. There was Russia, there was China, there was North Korea. No, there wasn't, it was Russia that was interfering. That's what everybody's been focusing on. That's what you focused on in your briefing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Right. There's no question that Russia was the principal violator in 2016 and that their activity this year puts them in the lead, although as people said, activity so far at least is down from 2016. But it does not exclude the potential for others to meddle and the broader issue that I think FBI Director Christopher Wray talked about in particular of influence efforts that go beyond the specifics of a particular election. I think that's very troubling too and something we need more focus on."

He's been on something of a Twitter tear today and this is one of them. The fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it's true. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American people. They purposely cause great division and distrust. They can also cause war. They are very dangerous and sick. Ambassador, what wars have we started?"

    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the president's view based on the attacks that the media made on him. There've been other administrations that have been highly critical of the press as well. You go back -- I remember John Kennedy cutting off the White House subscription to The New York Times."

There are reports that North Korea is violating the sanctions by ship to ship transfers. They've done it, it's increasing. That China and Russia are stepping up their efforts to ease around the sanctions. At what point does the Trump administration say that Kim is playing us, that he isn't serious about denuclearization and basically call him on this?"
    },
    {

      "utterance": "Yes. Well, that point may well come. As I've said to you and others before, there's nobody in his administration starry eyed about the prospects of North Korea actually denuclearizing. But I think what's going on now is that the president is giving Kim Jong-un on a master class and how to hold a door open for somebody. And if the North Koreans can't figure out how to walk through it, even the president's fiercest critics will not be able to say it's because he didn't open it wide enough. We are going to have to see a performance from the North Koreans. There's no question about it."

That's the central issue for us. There's a lot of interest in inter-Korean negotiations. They are looking at further discussions there. That's important to them. That's not our priority, though. Our priority is North Korean denuclearization. Kim Jong-un promised South Korean President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom on April 27th that he would do it and that he would do it within a year. So, the focus here is getting Kim Jong-un to follow through on what he committed to the president at Singapore."

And to their credit, this administration has imposed tough sanctions already for what happened in 2016. But what we're hoping to do is deter future activity, in essence create a situation where Vladimir Putin has to weigh the cost and the benefits. We're going to show him what the costs are by detailing them ahead and then when he weighs the cost and the benefits of taking similar action in 2018, hopefully, he'll determine the costs are too high compared to the benefits. I can't guarantee that, but I can guarantee if we don't do something, he will interfere again in multiple ways because right now, the costs are too unpredictable and too low."

Now, there probably is going to have to be an addition of a presidential waiver like all sanctions bill have and the like. The DNI will still play a key role. That's the way we crafted it, but I know my -- the partner I'm working with on this, Senator Van Hollen, a Democrat, and I are willing to make reasonable changes to the bill that allows us to pass it and that's probably one of those that we heard a little bit of pushback on.

Obviously, he is annoyed by that investigation continuing to go on because it's about him, and he believes and has said repeatedly and emphatically that he did not collude with the Russians. I'm limited to what I can say because the Senate is still doing our investigation but I am comfortable in saying this, if there was evidence, strong evidence of collusion, I guarantee it would have been leaked by now, but let's wait for the process to play itself out and I think that's what should happen.

And there are plenty of people who are innocent, whose lawyers would tell them do not sit down and answer questions from a prosecutor because there's all sorts of other problems involved with that. That's a decision for the president to make alongside with his attorney. It's my understanding from what I've read in the press that he wants to do it. It's attorneys who have questions about that, but there are plenty of innocent people whose lawyers tell them do not sit down with a prosecutor and answer questions.

What I do believe he will do is a series of unilateral concessions that do not undermine his capabilities in the long term. For example, I think he's more than willing to tear apart facilities that are no longer necessary for old muscles because he's got newer ones that work better. I believe he has undisclosed sites that he thinks he can shield from the world. I believe that he believes that even if he gets rid of some of the thing -- new enrichment capabilities he already has existing weapons and existing enriched capabilities that he can hide from the rest -- from the world. And every single time that he does one of these productions he is engendering goodwill internationally, which is ultimately his goal, to undermine international support for sanctions by arguing, look at all these things I'm doing, the Americans are not reciprocating and undermining sanctions at the U.N. and internationally. That's his goal in my opinion."

We now hear that Russia is doing business with North Korea, that they are bringing thousands of more guest workers into the country or in effect slaves who send money back to the regime.

I think what we need to be very careful about is undermining, for example, any split between us and South Korea. They're going to try to exploit it. I think the Chinese are trying to drag this out. The Chinese would love for this to be a step-by-step process that drags out. I think their biggest concern initially was that we would cut a deal with them directly. I don't know if the president is being played. I think he's hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. The sanctions remained in place. We haven't changed a single sanction on North Korea. I think what they need to be more cautious about is we need to continue to engage our partners around the world so that they are fully aware of what's actually happening in North Korea and what isn't happening, what's real and what isn't real. That's what I'd be very cautious about. I don't have any concerns about anything they've done so far."

Democrats say, one, the benefit is too small, two, it shouldn't come out of retirement payments, and, third, they say that most people take family leave for illnesses, either their own or family members. They don't take it for childbirth. And, in fact, Ivanka Trump, who's a big supporter of paid family leave, said there's no chance this is going to happen in this Congress."

This Congress ends in six months, five months, and we have elections in between. This is a big issue. It's a revolutionary idea and it's going to take time to pass. Now, here's what it does. It's very simple to understand. Number one, it's an option. You don't have to do this. Number two, the benefit is comparable to what you're going to get in the private sector in terms of paid family leave for the birth of a child. And number three, the concept is this, if you choose to take paid family leave, at least six weeks up to 12 weeks, you can take -- you can decide that some of your retirement benefits from your money, and Social Security, you can advance it and take it now instead of later. A portion of it. It's up to you. It's a choice you have. It's an option you have. For the 85 percent of Americans that today have no options at all other than to skip paychecks, how many people can afford to skip one paycheck, not to mention four or five or six after the birth of a child?"

I watched the speech and there was -- I lost track about 18 or 19 times that the president went after the press. And every time he did, that crowd roared its approval. But that crowd represents the hard-core Trump base. This does not help him with his bigger problem. Back to the -- the Fox poll, 46-51 approve. Twenty-eight percent strongly approve.

That case was replaced. The standard is, even the most inflammatory speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it produces immanently unlawful action, right, or direct incitement or is likely to produce imminent harm and -- I mean these -- these are not the standards. Like, we need to correct the people's ignorance here. Fire in a crowded theater is a pseudo-profundity, OK? The First Amendment, without questions, protects this kind of data, lawfully produced. It's got a cognizant government authority. It's directly related to another protected right of the people, which is their Second Amendment. So speech about another amendment is even more protected than the use of like --"

There's going to be a court hearing about this, this week. And I know you're going to -- you're going to be pursuing this. Here you talk about speech that -- that incites or creates the opportunity for illegal action. Here's the problem with putting these blueprints about plastic guns on the Internet. It allows people to create -- to make guns that are untraceable. There's no serial number. It allows them to make guns that are undetectable. They're all plastic. They could get through a metal detector. It also allows people who would be prohibited from having guns, whether it's someone with a history of mental illness, a felon, domestic abuse or even a terrorist, it allows them to make guns. Take a look at -- at -- at Democratic Senator Ed Markey. Here he is."

And I think that's part of like what's inflammatory to -- at least the Democratic establishment. This is also their discovery that it's been legal in this country since its founding to make a gun for yourself. Well, I'm sorry that you just found that out, OK, but you should have -- you should have made a law, right? You're Congress, make a law. Make it illegal to make guns in this country. I'd like to see that."

And, Chris, like this is why I'm not in jail today, right, my printable guns have the amount of metal in it. You know, there are security norms. I respect the norms. Of course, maybe even that type of law ultimately couldn't survive Second Amendment scrutiny. But I'm not here to argue for -- for -- or against our security norms. I'm literally here to argue that what I won in court over five years in the western district of Texas was the right -- and not just singularly, but all Americans have the right to share data for making firearms on the Internet. This is not controversial. The progressive case, the H-bomb nuclear -- nuclear plans, these are all protected by the First Amendment. I'm sorry that some people are just waking up to the idea that the First Amendment protects scientific inquiry that doesn't advantage, what, the gun control movement?"

Well, look, in one sense I released it five years ago. In another sense, I released it July 27th. I can't make a judge read a brief, OK, but these are APA claims. These aren't gun control act claims. These -- these attorneys general have no standing. The judge can't even review the decision that the State Department made. So I'm just sitting here watching all these gun files already online and people arguing about what reality is when we both know that guns are now downloadable and they have been repeatedly demonstrated to be."

What if somebody takes your information, makes a gun and then goes out and kills someone, potentially, God forbid, kills member of your family, would there be -- do you bear any responsibility? Do you feel -- would you feel any remorse?"

But I literally believe in the Second Amendment to the point of that it's all right and it should be expected that there will be social costs for protecting a right like this. Why is the people's right to keep and bear arms on the Bill of Rights? Why is it even protected? Because we know that there are downsides and that there are consequences to allowing free people to own the means of self-defense. I mean of course we should expect and have a mature attitude that bad things can happen."

The government has regulated commercial manufacture of arms and the arms and transfer and interstate commerce, but the government has never regulated the production of firearms that you're allowed to own. An American, can to this day, right now, make a gun and there's no requirement to put a serial number on it.
