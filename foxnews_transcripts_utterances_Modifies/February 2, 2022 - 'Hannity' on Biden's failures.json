We are failing on a spectacular level as you pointed out. How about focusing on that and saving these kids' lives so they have a good future and a good job down the line? Tucker, thank you. All right. Welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, the tide is officially turning. The freedom movement is growing. Farmers are now joining. This is an amazing scene unfolding with truckers in Canada and the U.S. demanding to end every and all mandates. This as a major new study from Johns Hopkins University just determined lockdowns were extremely ineffective. In fact, they were harmful and any future measures should be rejected out of hand. Wait until you hear this report coming up. And big news from the media mob as some are now finally starting to understand the evils of censorship and cancel culture. Now, we're going to call them on their hypocrisy. Oh, you're going to love the hypocrisy. I have a message for Whoopi Goldberg. I have a message tonight for Joe Rogan. I have a message for the truckers in the U.S. and Canada and the prime minister of Canada. But, first, we begin tonight with fake news CNN. In nine years as the network's president, Jeff Zucker transformed CNN from a boring left-of- center news outlet to a still boring, totally, completely, utterly dishonest, lying, anti-Trump, FOX-obsessed arm of the Democratic Party. Now, Zucker's out. Bye-bye. Anyway, in a statement, he claims his resignation is because of a consensual relationship with another executive that he did not properly disclose. Okay, let me be blunt. I'm sorry. I'm not buying that for one second. Now, mark my words, the real story will come out one day and probably sooner than later to me. This statement like so many other things, a fake news CNN, it's total B.S. or total B Schiff, Adam Schiff. Anyway, this statement, like so many other things are fake news CNN, it's just not -- it's not real. Zucker's relationship, okay, the whole world of media knew about this for years. It was not a secret. People from all across multiple networks, they have been talking about it for years. And remember, mean girl Katie Couric wrote all about it in her book published last year. So when Jeff Zucker's personal stenographer Humpty the Dumpty tweeted that CNN was stunned, Humpty was obviously lying. And as a final act of dear deep obedience as Zucker's stenographer, Humpty Dumpty has been spewing pro Zucker propaganda all day. Now, we'll likely know a lot more in the days ahead but his girlfriend at CNN and it should again as it pointed out, it was a consensual relationship between them -- well, she formally served, this is where it gets interesting, as the communications director for -- that's right -- former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo several years ago. Now, it gets more interesting. Andrew's brother, former CNN host Chris Cuomo, is according to numerous sources I have -- I have sources everywhere -- they are preparing a lawsuit related to his own dismissal. And by the way, preservation notices have already been sent. Now, it would appear that the Cuomos know a lot about Jeff Zucker and the unethical practices and the double standards taking place at the so-called facts first network. Now, my best guess is Jeff Zucker -- I bet he's completely in the loop as it relates to Chris and Andrew Cuomo. And to what extent, time will tell. My prediction is, Chris Cuomo is going to get his full contract paid out. They said they fired him for cause. And my other bet is he'll likely get a lot more money before all of this is said and done. But the problem is, look at poor Humpty Dumpty, he seems very, very nervous. Take a look.",

He was fired and there were reports that he wasn't going to get paid the millions of dollars that were going to be on the remainder of his contract. So as a source said to me earlier today, he was trying to burn the place down. He was going to court trying to burn the place down and claiming that he had incriminating information about Zucker and Gollust. So if that's the case, if this is a domino effect that begins with Andrew Cuomo, going down the governor's office, and then Chris Cuomo being fired from CNN and then Jeff Zucker losing his job at CNN, that is a remarkable domino effect, a chain of events.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Now, it's official. Jeff Zucker's stenographer, that guy, Humpty Dumpty, is now in a boat without a rudder. What's Humpty going to do? Humpty, guess what, kissing Jeff Zucker's ass like you've been doing for years it's not going to advance your pathetic failing career anymore. Now, his very generous meal ticket is now gone, and now, Humpty Dumpty may be close behind. Look at this from \"The Daily Mail\", insiders are calling for Humpty -- that's Brian Stelter -- to be fired after failing to report Zucker's, quote, open secret affair. Remember, Stelter is a so-called chief media correspondent for fake news CNN, and let -- you know, he never seems to notice when his dear leader or anyone on his network is doing something wrong. In fact, one source actually just referred to as Jeff Zucker's water boy if you read the piece. You call yourself a journalist, right, Humpty? Pretty pathetic. Now, of course, we wish Humpty Dumpty well. We don't call for firings, but I'd be prepared for one. Now, journalists of fake news CNN, MSDNC, every other left-wing network, we don't call for these people to be fired. We don't call for censorship, I never have. I'm never going to we don't call for boycotts either. I've explained why many times. If you don't like what CNN is putting out there on the channel, don't watch it. Change the channel. Please watch us. It's that simple. In fact, most Americans already on their own have changed the channel because almost nobody watches fake news CNN. I think the ratings are lower now than nine years ago when Zucker took over. Now, their few remaining viewers are probably stuck in an airport if you want to know the truth. That's the great thing about freedom and individualism. And this is important because some of you get mad at me that I don't call for firings and boycotts and cancellations, you get to make the decision based on what's right for you. You don't need to control what your neighbor is watching or what they're eating or what they're celebrating or what they're wearing. You know, when people get mad at me because I don't support cancer culture, boycotts and firings, you know, now you know why. And it's a simple answer, it's one word. It's Mel Gibson in \"Braveheart\" -- freedom. Freedom to decide what to watch. Freedom to listen to what you want to listen to. Freedom to eat what you want, maybe too much. Freedom to eat healthy. Freedom to drink. Freedom to -- you know, you get to decide on for example the vaccine. Take it seriously, do your research is my advice. Talk to your doctor. It could be a matter of life and death. But ultimately, freedom lets you decide that. This brings us now to Whoopi Goldberg. Now, she said the Holocaust was about evil and man's inhumanity to men. Well, on that point, she was right. It's hard for good people to imagine such horrific evil. Six million-plus Jewish people were slaughtered murdered by Hitler and the Nazis. I wrote a whole book \"Deliver Us From Evil\", and also, it was about an evil plan about a master race. On the latter, she was wrong. I am and always will be -- if you're a long time watcher a viewer of this show and listening to my radio program -- there's no stronger ally. I'm one of the biggest allies of Israel and one of their biggest supporters in the country. Whoopi Goldberg rightly apologized. Now, she's facing a widespread backlash. She's got a two-week suspension. So, Whoopi, if you're watching, if you hear about this, my unsolicited advice -- you don't have to listen to me -- whatever you do, don't quit, because I personally believe having known her, she's -- Whoopi's like a peace, love and happiness person. Live and let live. I know because I met her. But I believe her apology is sincere. Now, I might be wrong. Time may prove me wrong. Time will tell, and I bet a lot of money that she will never say anything like this again. So why are so many people out there, you know, unwilling to give a second chance? Why not let the audience of \"The View\" - - it's not me -- to -- why do you let them decide, if they want to watch or not? When you're in the middle of a firestorm, my advice would be, you just got to hold on, be strong, keep moving, and if you want to leave -- leave on your terms and certainly not in two weeks. Never bow down to an angry mob, you said something wrong you apologize now you have an opportunity, hopefully, ABC will bring you back in two weeks to get it right and then get on with your career. Welcome to the world, by the way, that we at FOX and we conservatives on talk radio live every day. That's our world, because tens of millions of dollars are spent trying to get us fired, boycotted and canceled every single day. It's been 33 years of my life living with this, and we have always been consistent about opposing this. Now, unfortunately, many in the media mob, they're only all of a sudden now that it's impacting them, now, they're starting to see the light. Take a look.",

Remember Mika also boycotted Soul Cycle, Equinox because the owner held a fundraiser for Donald Trump. Fake news CNN Don lemon encouraged the Biden White House to stop taking questions from FOX News reporters, people like Peter Doocy. You know, Joe Scarborough blasting Spotify for not doing enough to censor and silence Joe Rogan, all right? Which brings me to Joe Rogan, who I also have a message for. I don't know him personally. Joe, whatever you do, do not back down. No more apologies, you are acting in good faith, you're giving your opinion, you have a show, you told your audience what you did that helped you get over COVID, thank God you're alive. I'm glad it worked. You interviewed the doctor that was at the top of his game and helped create the mRNA technology that led the way to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. You were right to interview him and being inquisitive is a good thing, not a bad thing. And thankfully right now, the only artist pulling their music from Spotify to protest Rogan are a bunch of old washed up former hippies, oh, and Mary Trump, pulling her podcast. I'm sure her dozens of listeners are so upset and disappointed. Now, sadly, those on the left, they don't really believe in free speech. They don't believe in the bill of rights. They want government and big tech to control what you do, what you say, how you think. And in other words, they want to force your compliance, don't let them. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors Joe Concha and Miranda Devine. Joe, we'll give you first crack at this.

And I found that to be so telling. And then when you speak to people there and I was on the network fairly often, basically, what you would be told was that okay everything that you see on the chief media correspondent show on Sunday is basically co-written by Zucker, right, and he would -- and that's why it's so focused on FOX. It's go after the competitor. It's Burger King going after McDonald's. It's Pepsi going after Coke, and that's why the show has become so myopic at this point. But, you know, it's funny with this whole thing with Zucker at this point, because here you have -- you know, the chief media correspondent also saying that, wow, nobody knew about this.

Project Veritas actually had a bootleg recording of a news conference just after our story broke in last October, three weeks before the election, and there's Jeff Zucker telling his people at CNN, we are not following \"The New York Post\" story, just ignore it. That guy put his thumb on the scale at CNN in the most egregious fashion and this wasn't news. He really corrupted CNN and the result was this plummeting of ratings. And so, it's no coincidence that, you know, right at the time when new owners are coming in, it's very convenient to get rid of Jeff Zucker. I'm sure there's a million reasons you could get rid of Jeff Zucker. I mean, the main reason is because he did a terrible job and ran that network into the ground, and I think that your stenographer friend, the mini me of Jeff Zucker, Brian Stelter, I mean, it is amazing how the cancellers will become the cancelled. I'm not sure that he's going to hang on that long at CNN because he lived basically as Jeff Zucker's puppet. And, you also see with Whoopi Goldberg -- again, this is somebody who you're very compassionate and empathetic and good for you for doing that. But I just look at -- Karen Johnson is her real name, and I think to myself, she was at the forefront of calling for Joe Rogan to be turned into an un-person, to be cancelled. And now, she's getting a taste of her own medicine. So let's hope that this humbles her and makes her realize that the left's full-on crusade to crush any opposing views is going to end up crushing them as well.",

We got viciously attacked from all quarters, especially about our discussions about school closures not working, based on what we were observing already in Europe. Well, guess what, this paper shows school closures don't work, business closures don't help, domestic travel bans don't work. Limiting gatherings don't work. Kids under 10 have no increased transmission risk compared to just being at home where they just play with their friends. Governments selfishly compete each other in order to avoid blame. That flip-flopping video is right on target. And here's the deal, people actually respond to a clear and present danger outside their door, they take precautions, regardless of what the government's telling you. The reason I'm running for Senate, Sean, is to fight for people's freedom to claw back what was taken from us. We're barnstorming all across Pennsylvania.

And we'll bring you a full report. I wonder if Joe will talk about the issue of redirecting funds away or what Kamala Harris praising the LAPD for cutting funding. Also tonight, more evidence of how far left indoctrination is taken over America's schools as schools across the country are now implementing something referred to as a BLM week of action, which calls for disruption of Western nuclear family, and it gets worse as parents groups now are coming forward claiming that the BLM weak curriculum even teaches students that everyone gets to pick their own gender as well in addition to other activities that seek to divide students along racial lines.

According to local reports, several tow truck companies are refusing requests to try to tow away members of the blockade as momentum for this freedom convoy is growing. As we have shown you on this program, Canadian truckers, now farmers are taking a stand for freedom, human dignity and autonomy and for liberty, and to make the medical decisions that they believe is best for them and their families. It's pretty inspirational. It's a fight for freedom. It's powerful. Their message, it's pretty simple.

Together, let's keep working to make Canada more inclusive. I haven't seen any of this. If anyone is doing that they are not the majority. Most people are trying to send you a message. I have a message for you, prime minister. You are a disgrace come in terms of being an excuse for a leader, but demonizing hardworking truckers, anyone else who doesn't surrender to your point of view, one-size-fits-all medicine, this is how you lead when you are supposed to be a public service -- a servant. It's the complete embodiment of the failed far left rule, never ending pandemic power grabs and the censorship that the left is now targeting the convoy more directly, as GoFundMe has frozen the page for the truckers, but they have already amassed nearly $10 million because people support them. Instead of lecturing these guys that are pivotal to the supply chain and literally bring everything to every store that every consumer buys and wants and needs and desires, why don't you get your ass out of your office and why don't you go to Ottawa, why don't you sit down with the truckers and listen to them, and start being a public servant instead of a public lecturer. You know, the same people that jumped on COVID grenades every day like the hospital workers, the farmers farmed, the packers packed, the truckers trucked and guest what, they kept states like New York alive. They don't deserve to be treated like second-class citizens. They don't need to be told to fall in line and surrender to your cult of vaccines and one-size- fits-all medicine. Most of them already got COVID because they were working because they were essential workers. You know, nurses and hospital workers, they were diving on COVID grenades every day and they worked in a Petri dish of COVID every day. They were the heroes of the pandemic.

Anyway, this statement, like so many other things are fake news CNN, it's just not -- it's not real. Zucker's relationship, okay, the whole world of media knew about this for years. It was not a secret. People from all across multiple networks, they have been talking about it for years. And remember, mean girl Katie Couric wrote all about it in her book published last year. So when Jeff Zucker's personal stenographer Humpty the Dumpty tweeted that CNN was stunned, Humpty was obviously lying. And as a final act of dear deep obedience as Zucker's stenographer, Humpty Dumpty has been spewing pro Zucker propaganda all day. Now, we'll likely know a lot more in the days ahead but his girlfriend at CNN and it should again as it pointed out, it was a consensual relationship between them -- well, she formally served, this is where it gets interesting, as the communications director for -- that's right -- former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo several years ago. Now, it gets more interesting. Andrew's brother, former CNN host Chris Cuomo, is according to numerous sources I have -- I have sources everywhere -- they are preparing a lawsuit related to his own dismissal. And by the way, preservation notices have already been sent. Now, it would appear that the Cuomos know a lot about Jeff Zucker and the unethical practices and the double standards taking place at the so-called facts first network. Now, my best guess is Jeff Zucker -- I bet he's completely in the loop as it relates to Chris and Andrew Cuomo. And to what extent, time will tell. My prediction is, Chris Cuomo is going to get his full contract paid out. They said they fired him for cause. And my other bet is he'll likely get a lot more money before all of this is said and done. But the problem is, look at poor Humpty Dumpty, he seems very, very nervous. Take a look."

      "utterance": "The Chris Cuomo reference, Cuomo was fired in December and he is not going out quietly. He was fired and there were reports that he wasn't going to get paid the millions of dollars that were going to be on the remainder of his contract. So as a source said to me earlier today, he was trying to burn the place down. He was going to court trying to burn the place down and claiming that he had incriminating information about Zucker and Gollust. So if that's the case, if this is a domino effect that begins with Andrew Cuomo, going down the governor's office, and then Chris Cuomo being fired from CNN and then Jeff Zucker losing his job at CNN, that is a remarkable domino effect, a chain of events."

      "utterance": "Now, it's official. Jeff Zucker's stenographer, that guy, Humpty Dumpty, is now in a boat without a rudder. What's Humpty going to do? Humpty, guess what, kissing Jeff Zucker's ass like you've been doing for years it's not going to advance your pathetic failing career anymore. Now, his very generous meal ticket is now gone, and now, Humpty Dumpty may be close behind. Look at this from \"The Daily Mail\", insiders are calling for Humpty -- that's Brian Stelter -- to be fired after failing to report Zucker's, quote, open secret affair. Remember, Stelter is a so-called chief media correspondent for fake news CNN, and let -- you know, he never seems to notice when his dear leader or anyone on his network is doing something wrong. In fact, one source actually just referred to as Jeff Zucker's water boy if you read the piece. You call yourself a journalist, right, Humpty? Pretty pathetic. Now, of course, we wish Humpty Dumpty well. We don't call for firings, but I'd be prepared for one. Now, journalists of fake news CNN, MSDNC, every other left-wing network, we don't call for these people to be fired. We don't call for censorship, I never have. I'm never going to we don't call for boycotts either. I've explained why many times. If you don't like what CNN is putting out there on the channel, don't watch it. Change the channel. Please watch us. It's that simple. In fact, most Americans already on their own have changed the channel because almost nobody watches fake news CNN. I think the ratings are lower now than nine years ago when Zucker took over. Now, their few remaining viewers are probably stuck in an airport if you want to know the truth. That's the great thing about freedom and individualism. And this is important because some of you get mad at me that I don't call for firings and boycotts and cancellations, you get to make the decision based on what's right for you. You don't need to control what your neighbor is watching or what they're eating or what they're celebrating or what they're wearing. You know, when people get mad at me because I don't support cancer culture, boycotts and firings, you know, now you know why. And it's a simple answer, it's one word. It's Mel Gibson in \"Braveheart\" -- freedom. Freedom to decide what to watch. Freedom to listen to what you want to listen to. Freedom to eat what you want, maybe too much. Freedom to eat healthy. Freedom to drink. Freedom to -- you know, you get to decide on for example the vaccine. Take it seriously, do your research is my advice. Talk to your doctor. It could be a matter of life and death. But ultimately, freedom lets you decide that. This brings us now to Whoopi Goldberg. Now, she said the Holocaust was about evil and man's inhumanity to men. Well, on that point, she was right. It's hard for good people to imagine such horrific evil. Six million-plus Jewish people were slaughtered murdered by Hitler and the Nazis. I wrote a whole book \"Deliver Us From Evil\", and also, it was about an evil plan about a master race. On the latter, she was wrong. I am and always will be -- if you're a long time watcher a viewer of this show and listening to my radio program -- there's no stronger ally. I'm one of the biggest allies of Israel and one of their biggest supporters in the country. Whoopi Goldberg rightly apologized. Now, she's facing a widespread backlash. She's got a two-week suspension. So, Whoopi, if you're watching, if you hear about this, my unsolicited advice -- you don't have to listen to me -- whatever you do, don't quit, because I personally believe having known her, she's -- Whoopi's like a peace, love and happiness person. Live and let live. I know because I met her. But I believe her apology is sincere. Now, I might be wrong. Time may prove me wrong. Time will tell, and I bet a lot of money that she will never say anything like this again. So why are so many people out there, you know, unwilling to give a second chance? Why not let the audience of \"The View\" - - it's not me -- to -- why do you let them decide, if they want to watch or not? When you're in the middle of a firestorm, my advice would be, you just got to hold on, be strong, keep moving, and if you want to leave -- leave on your terms and certainly not in two weeks. Never bow down to an angry mob, you said something wrong you apologize now you have an opportunity, hopefully, ABC will bring you back in two weeks to get it right and then get on with your career. Welcome to the world, by the way, that we at FOX and we conservatives on talk radio live every day. That's our world, because tens of millions of dollars are spent trying to get us fired, boycotted and canceled every single day. It's been 33 years of my life living with this, and we have always been consistent about opposing this. Now, unfortunately, many in the media mob, they're only all of a sudden now that it's impacting them, now, they're starting to see the light. Take a look."

Remember Mika also boycotted Soul Cycle, Equinox because the owner held a fundraiser for Donald Trump. Fake news CNN Don lemon encouraged the Biden White House to stop taking questions from FOX News reporters, people like Peter Doocy. You know, Joe Scarborough blasting Spotify for not doing enough to censor and silence Joe Rogan, all right? Which brings me to Joe Rogan, who I also have a message for. I don't know him personally. Joe, whatever you do, do not back down. No more apologies, you are acting in good faith, you're giving your opinion, you have a show, you told your audience what you did that helped you get over COVID, thank God you're alive. I'm glad it worked. You interviewed the doctor that was at the top of his game and helped create the mRNA technology that led the way to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. You were right to interview him and being inquisitive is a good thing, not a bad thing. And thankfully right now, the only artist pulling their music from Spotify to protest Rogan are a bunch of old washed up former hippies, oh, and Mary Trump, pulling her podcast. I'm sure her dozens of listeners are so upset and disappointed. Now, sadly, those on the left, they don't really believe in free speech. They don't believe in the bill of rights. They want government and big tech to control what you do, what you say, how you think. And in other words, they want to force your compliance, don't let them. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors Joe Concha and Miranda Devine. Joe, we'll give you first crack at this.

Jeff Zucker, when he was president of CNN, I was on one time I can tell you, years ago and I got off the air, and I got an email from him telling me how wrong I was about XYZ, and I was thinking, hey, I wasn't an employee of the network, I was just a guest, and he was saying to me, a guest, and he's the president of a network, what -- why my opinion was wrong. And I found that to be so telling. And then when you speak to people there and I was on the network fairly often, basically, what you would be told was that okay everything that you see on the chief media correspondent show on Sunday is basically co-written by Zucker, right, and he would -- and that's why it's so focused on FOX. It's go after the competitor. It's Burger King going after McDonald's. It's Pepsi going after Coke, and that's why the show has become so myopic at this point. But, you know, it's funny with this whole thing with Zucker at this point, because here you have -- you know, the chief media correspondent also saying that, wow, nobody knew about this. No, I am pretty sure that my mother-in-law knew about that relationship between Zucker and his chief marketing officer who happened to work for Andrew Cuomo, right?"

Emma Joe Morris, our mutual friend, and you did an amazing job exposing to the world Hunter Biden's laptop, but it was censored all over social media by big tech at a moment where it really mattered. You've written \"The Laptop From Hell\", all that's in there. You guys were right. So you've experienced this censorship yourself."

Project Veritas actually had a bootleg recording of a news conference just after our story broke in last October, three weeks before the election, and there's Jeff Zucker telling his people at CNN, we are not following \"The New York Post\" story, just ignore it. That guy put his thumb on the scale at CNN in the most egregious fashion and this wasn't news. He really corrupted CNN and the result was this plummeting of ratings. And so, it's no coincidence that, you know, right at the time when new owners are coming in, it's very convenient to get rid of Jeff Zucker. I'm sure there's a million reasons you could get rid of Jeff Zucker. I mean, the main reason is because he did a terrible job and ran that network into the ground, and I think that your stenographer friend, the mini me of Jeff Zucker, Brian Stelter, I mean, it is amazing how the cancellers will become the cancelled. I'm not sure that he's going to hang on that long at CNN because he lived basically as Jeff Zucker's puppet. And, you also see with Whoopi Goldberg -- again, this is somebody who you're very compassionate and empathetic and good for you for doing that. But I just look at -- Karen Johnson is her real name, and I think to myself, she was at the forefront of calling for Joe Rogan to be turned into an un-person, to be cancelled. And now, she's getting a taste of her own medicine. So let's hope that this humbles her and makes her realize that the left's full-on crusade to crush any opposing views is going to end up crushing them as well."

Well, guess what, this paper shows school closures don't work, business closures don't help, domestic travel bans don't work. Limiting gatherings don't work. Kids under 10 have no increased transmission risk compared to just being at home where they just play with their friends. Governments selfishly compete each other in order to avoid blame.

What counts is having the people to tell me what they feel, what they think is going on in this country, and then raising money. You know, you got to raise money. My opponent is raising a lot of money. There's no doubt I've done well in the fundraising but I got to do even better. So that's why I encourage people to join Team Herschel and I said, guys, I'm not giving up. You know, I love my freedom. I love my guns. I love my kids. You know, kids, they don't want you to go to school. You just talked about it. All this government overreach, we got to stop it. We got to stop it. We got to stop it right now and I've told people the bucks will stop with Herschel Walker because I'm not giving up."

As I've been going around the state, talking to these listening sessions, I found out that a lot of people want those things as well. Right now, people want public safeties on the street. They want to be able to leave their home and know that they can go to the mall without being harmed. They want their kids to have a good education. For my good friend Tim Scott, he said education is an equalizer, and that's 100 percent true. And education is an equalizer and every kid in America deserve the right to have a good education and I want to fight to give them that education."

      "utterance": "Again today, New York City streets were packed with police officers today as the funeral for fallen Officer Wilbert Mora was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Now, Mora was with Officer Jason Rivera. They were both killed last month while responding to a domestic dispute in New York and Harlem. Unfortunately, it's a tragedy that has become all too common all across major Democratic-run cities that refuse to take violent crime seriously. Why don't we prosecute the people that rioted in the summer of 2020? That'd be a good start. Far left Hollywood hypocrites -- well, at least one of them, is standing on the side of the criminals. Actress Susan Sarandon retweeted a message comparing cops at the funeral for the fallen officers to fascist. Disgusting but sadly not surprising. Tomorrow, Biden is slated to meet with New York City Mayor Eric Adams. By the way, since he's been in office, crime is up 38 percent. They're going to discuss crime. And we'll bring you a full report. I wonder if Joe will talk about the issue of redirecting funds away or what Kamala Harris praising the LAPD for cutting funding. Also tonight, more evidence of how far left indoctrination is taken over America's schools as schools across the country are now implementing something referred to as a BLM week of action, which calls for disruption of Western nuclear family, and it gets worse as parents groups now are coming forward claiming that the BLM weak curriculum even teaches students that everyone gets to pick their own gender as well in addition to other activities that seek to divide students along racial lines. Here with reaction, Leo 2.0 Terrell. You know at the end of Tucker's show, we have talked about it before. We know Kim Klacik has talked about it before. You know, you have all these public high schools in Baltimore, we pay -- they get the second highest amount of funding per capita per student than any other country in the industrialized world with the worst results. And now, we're going to let Black Lives Matter, the group that chanted what do we want, dead cops, when do we want it, now, that we're going to have a whole week celebrating them?"

      "utterance": "Well, let me first of all, before I get to Black Lives Matter, I got plenty of that. Let me just mention the comments you made about the officer who lost his life. You know, Joe Biden is coming to New York tomorrow. He should have been in New York today. Him and Jen Psaki should have been in the front row of St. Patrick Cathedral. She wants to know what soft of crime is, she should have been shaking the hands of every officer and asking them. Joe Biden has an obligation, Sean, to identify these soft prosecutors by first and last name. The honeymoon period for Eric Adams is over. Start calling out Alvin Bragg. Start calling out George Gascon. Do that immediately. And Jen Psaki goes, get out of her Eiffel tower and walk down the streets of New York and talk to those officers. With regards to Black Lives Matter, let me be very clear, Black Lives Matter is trying to hijack Black History Month. Who do they represent? Who's the leader of Black Lives Matter? They're trying to destroy the heritage of black history month. Frederick Douglass, Jackie Robinson, Dr. King -- none of these people are part of Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter is an extremist organization that does not represent 99.9 percent of Black Americans. They're trying to take over Black History Month. I say no, and I say to you, you can't find a leader in the black community who would support Black Lives Matter, because they don't represent the community."

Think those issues will come up? You think the media will ask them? That's right, he is not allowed to answer."

You hear Jen Psaki everyday talk about federal funding -- look, local police, law enforcement is a local matter and what Joe Biden won't do, what he cannot do, what he is prohibited from doing is calling out these D.A.s by first and last name. He's being coached to stay away from targeting these prosecutors. Soft on crime, that's why we have these two fallen officers who had memorial services. Joe Biden needs to know that."

A new freedom convoy of truckers is now setting its sights on a convoy here in the U.S., set to depart this month. And the support for truckers, it is growing by the second. Just take a look at your screen as we are now seeing Canadian farmers, the police have barricades, they are writing around in their tractors, joining with the truckers as supporters lined the road. I mean, more people, more money, more food given to these guys, it is inspiring. By the way, all peaceful, really peaceful, not like the phony peaceful riots of 2020. According to local reports, several tow truck companies are refusing requests to try to tow away members of the blockade as momentum for this freedom convoy is growing. As we have shown you on this program, Canadian truckers, now farmers are taking a stand for freedom, human dignity and autonomy and for liberty, and to make the medical decisions that they believe is best for them and their families. It's pretty inspirational. It's a fight for freedom. It's powerful. Their message, it's pretty simple. No more failed mandates, no more hysterical counterproductive, draconian restrictions, Johns Hopkins, and no more needless, divisive attacks against essential workers or anyone else from that matter. Here's one trucker laying out exactly what is at stake in all the support that is pouring out for him and what it means to him."

Together, let's keep working to make Canada more inclusive. I haven't seen any of this. If anyone is doing that they are not the majority. Most people are trying to send you a message. I have a message for you, prime minister. You are a disgrace come in terms of being an excuse for a leader, but demonizing hardworking truckers, anyone else who doesn't surrender to your point of view, one-size-fits-all medicine, this is how you lead when you are supposed to be a public service -- a servant. It's the complete embodiment of the failed far left rule, never ending pandemic power grabs and the censorship that the left is now targeting the convoy more directly, as GoFundMe has frozen the page for the truckers, but they have already amassed nearly $10 million because people support them. Instead of lecturing these guys that are pivotal to the supply chain and literally bring everything to every store that every consumer buys and wants and needs and desires, why don't you get your ass out of your office and why don't you go to Ottawa, why don't you sit down with the truckers and listen to them, and start being a public servant instead of a public lecturer. You know, the same people that jumped on COVID grenades every day like the hospital workers, the farmers farmed, the packers packed, the truckers trucked and guest what, they kept states like New York alive. They don't deserve to be treated like second-class citizens. They don't need to be told to fall in line and surrender to your cult of vaccines and one-size- fits-all medicine. Most of them already got COVID because they were working because they were essential workers. You know, nurses and hospital workers, they were diving on COVID grenades every day and they worked in a Petri dish of COVID every day. They were the heroes of the pandemic. Now you're going to destroy their livelihood? Get your ass out of your house and go visit the truckers and hear them out, and then you should start listening to them, because they make more sense than you do. All right. We've got have to take a break. We'll come back. More HANNITY next."
