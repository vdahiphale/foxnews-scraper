What Joe has said is if I win the nomination, he'll be there for me, and I have said if he wins the nomination, I'll be there for him because we both recognize that we have a president who is a pathological liar, and I say that without any joy in my heart, as somebody who's running a corrupt the administration, somebody apparently who has never read the Constitution of the United States and thinks he's above the law.  So, Biden and I, no matter who wins this thing, will be together in defeating Trump, but now that it is a two-way race, it is important for the voters of this country to ask themselves two questions. Number one, which candidate is stronger in terms of being able to defeat Trump. And number two, what are the differences in a record. Joe has been in Washington for a long time as have I. And my point is when people see the records, Joe voted for the war in Iraq, I opposed the war in Iraq. Joe voted for the Wall Street bailout, I vigorously opposed the Wall Street bailout.  When you go to the Midwest -- we're in Michigan right now. You go to Wisconsin, you got to Pennsylvania, people want to know about your views on trade , because disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs, decimated communities here in Michigan.

You know, when you talk about the future of this country, or the future of the Democratic Party, one might want to look where young people are at. And what young people are saying is that we have got to move aggressively to make sure that health care is a right for all. Young people want to raise that minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. Young people want us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, build the affordable housing that we need.  And, by the way, young people understand that we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. We have three people or more wealth in the bottom half of America. They want changes. They're concerned about climate change. They're concerned about racism and sexism.  So, I think if you look at the general electorate, you look at the future of this country, I think you've got a lot of energy behind this.  Just yesterday, Chris, just yesterday, didn't get a lot of media attention for whatever reason. We have the rally in Grand Park in Chicago. We had 15,000 people out.  So, I'm feeling good about the momentum that we have.

What you just heard, he's the fire of the Freedom Caucus, but he's also a guy who has mocked up government -- remember, they the shutdown in 2013, that was Freedom Caucus, that was Mark Meadows, And he has a distaste for how government actually operates. To contrary, he thinks the government is a problem, and has gone after bureaucrats and government workers. So, it's the exact opposite. I think it's a base play. I think it says to people who are strong Trump partisans, we've got our guy right next to the president, and I think there was fading confidence in Mick Mulvaney, especially after that press conference, when he talked about quid pro quos, and the like, but secondly, I think there was a low density was in charge.

Globally, the outbreak has sent shockwaves from China, where a hospital meant to house the infirm collapsed yesterday, to Italy where 16 million people have now been placed under quarantine.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, that's the right question. Joe Biden is a friend of mine. Joe Biden is a decent guy. What Joe has said is if I win the nomination, he'll be there for me, and I have said if he wins the nomination, I'll be there for him because we both recognize that we have a president who is a pathological liar, and I say that without any joy in my heart, as somebody who's running a corrupt the administration, somebody apparently who has never read the Constitution of the United States and thinks he's above the law.  So, Biden and I, no matter who wins this thing, will be together in defeating Trump, but now that it is a two-way race, it is important for the voters of this country to ask themselves two questions. Number one, which candidate is stronger in terms of being able to defeat Trump. And number two, what are the differences in a record. Joe has been in Washington for a long time as have I. And my point is when people see the records, Joe voted for the war in Iraq, I opposed the war in Iraq. Joe voted for the Wall Street bailout, I vigorously opposed the Wall Street bailout. When you go to the Midwest -- we're in Michigan right now. You go to Wisconsin, you got to Pennsylvania, people want to know about your views on trade , because disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs, decimated communities here in Michigan. I helped lead the oppositions of those trade agreements, Joe voted for them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Well, no, I certainly would not consider dropping out.  You know, Chris, media asks you, is this state or that state life or death? I was asked that at Iowa. I was asked that in New Hampshire. We won California, the largest state in this country. We are winning among Latino voters big-time. We are winning among young people. You know, when you talk about the future of this country, or the future of the Democratic Party, one might want to look where young people are at. And what young people are saying is that we have got to move aggressively to make sure that health care is a right for all. Young people want to raise that minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. Young people want us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, build the affordable housing that we need.  And, by the way, young people understand that we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. We have three people or more wealth in the bottom half of America. They want changes. They're concerned about climate change. They're concerned about racism and sexism. So, I think if you look at the general electorate, you look at the future of this country, I think you've got a lot of energy behind this.  Just yesterday, Chris, just yesterday, didn't get a lot of media attention for whatever reason. We have the rally in Grand Park in Chicago. We had 15,000 people out. So, I'm feeling good about the momentum that we have. I think we're going to do well on Tuesday and I think we're going to beat Biden."

Here's something that you said last fall: I don't think billionaires should exist. First of all, a few billionaires, let's talk about, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, have created more than a million jobs, probably more than a million extra in terms of fallout as it -- as it goes from their companies, and created trillions of dollars of wealth.  Why should they share in the wealth that they create, which is helping not just them, but has helped a lot of Americans?"

Do people like the Walton family, for example, that owns Wal-Mart, they're worth well over $100 billion, when their workers are marking $11 or $12 an hour. No one is denigrating people who have made significant achievements but enough really is enough. Does Mike Bloomberg really need $65 billion? To see his wealth increase by $15 billion in the last --"

And I'll tell you why, when you do that, corporations are not going to be so quick to shutdown in America and move to China, move to Mexico, and to move to other low wage countries. I want working people to say, you know what, I'm in a job, my ideas matter. I'm just not a cog in a machine. And in Vermont, by the way, and in states all over this country, where you have enterprises where workers, do have significant input into what goes on, absenteeism goes down, productivity goes up. Democracy to me means not just voting every four years, having a bit of a say in the job that you're working at."

I also think that Biden has benefited from Bernie Sanders underperforming this cycle, to the extent that he did four years ago. Yes, he is doing better with young voters, but they are a smaller percentage of the voting public right now than they were four years ago. We talk about how Trump benefited from and say Clinton Senate stomach sentiment four years ago, but so did Clinton in the primary. There was a lot of anti-Hillary sentiment going on last time.

This is something that he wanted to do much earlier, but the impeachment process, as it was playing out, really didn't allow him to do that. Now we get someone who is really kind of a story of the Republican Party, in terms of Mark Meadows, someone who is the founder of the Freedom Caucus, a very ideological conservative, someone who, even reportedly was reluctant to go to the convention in 2016, because he didn't know if he wanted to be there supporting Donald Trump. Now, he is someone who is as loyal as you can be and was a fierce advocate for him on this network and others during the impeachment process. Meadows is someone who, I think, is just a signal to conservatives that Trump knows who he is close to, he's going to stick by them, and he's going to make that case to his Republican base going forward, in what he views to be a base election where he has a lot of things that he can say and advocate for, for reasons as to why he should be returned to the White House (ph)."

So, he had a deep appreciation of the government's ability to serve the American people. Mark Meadows is known as of firebrand. What you just heard, he's the fire of the Freedom Caucus, but he's also a guy who has mocked up government -- remember, they the shutdown in 2013, that was Freedom Caucus, that was Mark Meadows, And he has a distaste for how government actually operates. To contrary, he thinks the government is a problem, and has gone after bureaucrats and government workers. So, it's the exact opposite. I think it's a base play. I think it says to people who are strong Trump partisans, we've got our guy right next to the president, and I think there was fading confidence in Mick Mulvaney, especially after that press conference, when he talked about quid pro quos, and the like, but secondly, I think there was a low density was in charge. Well, the president is now after impeachment, calling in and pushing at people who he things aren't disloyal, but calling in terms of loyalists.

I don't think Trump quite views is in that role, I think he sees the chief of staff is another aide, and he's looking for someone who's going to be a fighter for him, particularly in the media and be loyal to him. I think Mark Meadows checks both of those boxes, and he'll do fine."

Those kinds of things. And I think it's particularly important among the most venerable. And that's the thing that the CDC and the State Department are going to be making some recommendations about how people who have underlying conditions, those are the most vulnerable, particularly elderly with underlying conditions.

The CDC has a health alert and the State Department has more of a travel alert. Right now, I'm telling the American people, based on everything that's agreed upon in the task force, that if you are an individual who has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, right now, not wait, you should start to distance yourself from the risk, crowds, getting on a plane, on a long plane trip, and, above all, don't get on a cruise ship. That is a health issue. What the State Department is saying from a logistics standpoint, don't get on a cruise ship because you could come out, have a person on there, then all of a sudden you find yourself not being able to get back and quarantine.

And there, I think, needs to be a real sticking to the talking points that he has, the facts as we know them, and not shifting the two because he's worried, frankly, about what this is going to do to the economy in a way that he, I think, is responding to questions in the media, which are legitimate, about the kind of economic impact this is going to have."

      "utterance": "Well, I think there are alarmists out there, but, you know, the president, I think, has been somewhat partisan, wearing that red hat, calling the government of Washington state, Jay Inslee, a snake and all that. I just don't like it because, like Ben, my preferences, I just want to have trust in government at this critical time. I note that when you get away from media, let's just look at Wall Street, that you get companies like Goldman Sachs downgrading their forecast for the year economically, obviously the stock market has been up-and-down, the uncertainty, producing a great amount of anxiety and fear there. So that's away from media. Clearly people who have skin in the game in terms of money are saying, when you look at Italy, when you look at Greece, what happened in China, were disrupting supply chains, were disrupting travel industry, airplanes, cruise ships and the like. So this is not good. And so I -- you know, it's not what I think, and I don't think it's like the media hype. We've got a stay away from the alarmists. But there's something going on here that's quite serious."

Record growth, low unemployment, records in the stock market, and now, suddenly, all of that is in jeopardy."

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "I think it's something that -- that he has to be worried about, frankly. We're in uncharted territory here. This is not just the flu. It's much more serious than the flu. The mortality rate is higher than the flu. It's not as bad as the SARS virus so far, but it is worse than the flu. And we need to work our way through it. And he needs to find a way to reassure people, without being overly dismissive of the seriousness of this. And it is going to affect the economy. It's going to affect the supply chains. Businesses like certainty. This introduces all kinds of uncertainty. We have spring break travel coming up that's being canceled. Conferences are being canceled. So he's going to have to work through this. What he has going for him, and as we found out with the jobs report on Friday, is that this economy is on pretty good footing right now. If you look at what's going on in Japan and China, the second and third largest economies in the world after ours, they're sort of teetering on recession. And this could push them into it. What we know from our jobs report is that our economy right now is pretty solid, which means we're in a pretty good position to absorb whatever shock we get from us."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And, again, he will have to find a way to reassure people, and not overpromise in terms of how quickly we are going to get past this. I think he needs to let the health professionals do their job and not be out there contradicting them or second-guessing them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Congresswoman Edwards, obviously we have no idea where this is going to be in the fall. I mean maybe the president's right, and like the flu, as we get into warmer weather, it will begin to diminish, maybe not. How legitimate do you think it is for Democrats to go after the president on the administration response to the coronavirus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's legitimate to, you know, to challenge the process and the management of this crisis. And it is a public health crisis. And I think whenever we hear Dr. Fauci and other experts talk about this virus and about what to do and what -- what Americans can do, that it actually is somewhat reassuring. But what we don't get is that kind of reassurance coming directly from the president, because of his contradictions, because, you know, the information that he puts out is just on accurate. I mean he would actually, I think, do better in terms of the public if he just shut up because I don't think people wouldn't necessarily blame the president for something that was out of his control, but if he continues and his administration mismanages the crisis, then I think it's a legitimate point of challenge by anyone who wants to be president saying, I'd manage it better. I mean we saw the impact, for example, that Hurricane Katrina and the response had with President Bush, and I don't think this is, you know, different in that respect. But the president doesn't do himself or the American public any good when he makes assertions that are completely contrary to the scientific evidence."

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, I think we can believe a couple of different things are true here. One is, the panic is overblown. This is not the kind of public health crisis, yet, that people are treating it in the way that they're approaching it in some sections of the media. However, it's very serious. It should result in changes in human behavior for the time being, as we figure out how we have to adjust to live our lives this way. Just to note -- a personal thing here. Bre Paton (ph), who's a former guest on Fox News quite a lot, passed away a little over a year ago, one of our employees, from the flu. And so the flu is very serious. We have a very high level of flu and America right now. And so people should take this seriously. But don't freak out. Don't -- don't panic. Don't -- don't turn into, you know, a -- a, you know, Black Friday mob at the -- at the Costco when you're trying to prepare for this."
