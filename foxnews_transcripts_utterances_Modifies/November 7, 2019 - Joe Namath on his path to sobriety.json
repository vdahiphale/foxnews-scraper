      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Ever notice how as if on cue, all the dumb people on cable news and their Democratic allies in Congress for whom they are actually working, they start hyperventilating about the same thing at pretty much exactly the same time. Pick your topic, pick the day, it's always the same. Only the issue itself changes. Today's issue is the identity of the so-called whistleblower. That's the person who originally filed the complaint about the President's call with the President of Ukraine that set in motion the series of events that are certain to culminate in an official impeachment proceeding.  Now we're being told the one thing that we can't know about this whole process is who that person is, who the whistleblower is. Why can't we know that? Well, abettors on television are telling us we can't know that because the identity of the whistleblower is the one thing standing in the way standing between that person leading a normal life and that person being potentially injured in political violence.  Now, political violence is a concern in this country and as we've said countless times in the show, we are adamantly and totally opposed to it in all cases, in every case. What's so startling, though, is that the people making this claims aren't against political violence, adamantly and in every case, in fact, in many cases, they are for it.  These the people, you'll remember who told you to punch a Nazi. These are the people who applauded when various members of the Trump administration were screamed at and threatened in public places with their families in some cases. We're talking about restaurants or walking down the street. So these people aren't actually concerned about protecting anyone, particularly people with different political views. They're totally fine slandering teenagers who go to Catholic high schools or pizza shops in small towns in Indiana.  When it comes to people they don't agree with like the guy whose life CNN wrecked for making fun of their logo or the Ohio bakery that was nearly destroyed forever by Oberlin College, they'll charge right in there and ruin innocent people's lives. It doesn't bother them at all. But in this one specific case, they're telling you can't know. Why are they telling you that? Whenever they are adamant about something, it ought to be your cue that something is going on here. What are they trying to protect? What don't they want you to know? What are they covering up?  In this specific case, what they don't want you to know is the so-called whistleblower might have been motivated by partisan impulses. This might be someone who disagrees with the President's policies, and maybe that's what this is really about, a policy disagreement.   It's not about standing up heroically for his country, it's about undermining a democratically elected President with whom he disagrees. Now they're swearing that that's not the case. Nancy Pelosi up there telling you, she is praying for this country and nothing makes her sadder than seeing the President impeached. This is terrible for all of us and we just hope it's over soon. And the person who did this did so. The whistleblower did so at great personal risk, and we're just hoping he can get through it. He is just doing the best he can for America. And you know, by the way, maybe that's true. But maybe it's not true. Maybe the whistleblower is just another nasty little partisan, like so many of these people, like virtually everyone you see on cable news, and maybe they're lying to you.   You can't know, and you won't know until you find out who this so-called whistleblower is. That's why they're hiding it. That's what's really going on here. Peter Van Buren has watched things like this for a long time. He is a veteran in the State Department. He is a whistleblower himself. He is also a contributing editor at \"The American Conservative,\" he joins us tonight. So, Peter, thanks so much for joining us.",

That's what's relevant here. Not that his name is this or he lives over here, but what brought him to us. This process is critical.

      "sentences": "I appreciate it. Before the contents of the whistleblower complaint were known publicly, a Democratic congressional staffer contacted the former American Ambassador to Ukraine to discuss with the staffer described as quote \"quite delicate and time sensitive questions.\" This show has obtained exclusively an e-mail from that Democratic staffer for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent by private e-mail to the former American Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.   Now, Yovanovitch as you know, is now a key player in the Democrats' impeachment probe and was recalled from her post in Ukraine by President Trump in May of 2019 following allegations of serious partisanship and political bias.  In the e-mail, the Democratic aide says this, quote, \"I'm writing to see if you would have time to meet up for a chat -- in particular, I'm hoping to discuss some Ukraine-related oversight questions we're exploring. I'd appreciate the chance to ground truth, a few pieces of information with you, some of which are quite delicate/time sensitive and thus, we want to make sure we get them right,\" end quote. Now that e-mail was sent on August 14, that's two days after the whistleblower complaint was filed, and a month before that complaint became public. The whistleblower however went to Schiff's team -- Adam Schiff's team -- before filing the complaint. The question is, did Schiff's office tell other Democrats on Capitol Hill what was in the complaint? In other words, how long did this effort play out in secret before the rest of the country learned of it?   Well we asked the Democratic spokesman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee about this, and here is the response we got, quote, \"The Committee wanted to hear from an Ambassador whose assignment was cut short under unusual circumstances. This staff outreach was part of a months' long effort that culminated in the September 9 launch of an investigation into these events.\" Well, Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York asked Ambassador Yovanovitch directly about the e-mail. Yovanovitch claimed that she never personally responded to it, never responded to the Democratic staffer. In fact, it turns out that she did respond. In fact, she said she, quote, \"looked forward to chatting with you,\" to that staffer, and as Congressman Zeldin pointed out, the Ambassador's original answer, which was dishonest, was given under oath. So maybe she will get hauled into court like Roger Stone and threatened with life in prison. Just kidding. Meanwhile, we have an actual whistleblower here in media world. That whistleblower worked for ABC News and leaked an off air tape of an anchor, Amy Robach talking in very frustrated tones about how her employers at ABC News killed her story on billionaire pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Why did they do that? It'd be interesting to know.   Well, whoever leaked that tape later went to work at CBS, where apparently was a woman, she was located. CBS and ABC got together, they found her and they fired her.  So in other words, those two networks spent a lot of time finding the person who embarrassed them and in no time at all, figuring out who covered up for a pedophile and why. That tells you a lot, doesn't it? Robby Soave is an editor at \"Reason\" magazine and author of the book, \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\" He joins us tonight. Robby, even by the standards of the press for whom I literally have no respect at all, and I couldn't have more contempt for the television networks than I do, and I say that having worked at almost all of them. This seems especially low to me.",

These are not small things. They are big society wide trends, and on some days, they seem intractable. What's causing them? Well, it is complicated, but there is at least one thing that all of these slow moving disasters have in common. They are all, to some extent driven by addiction. Nobody wants to say it out loud, but an awful lot of Americans are not in their right minds a lot of the time. They're hooked on something. You've seen the stats. They're grimly familiar at this point. They tell part of the story. America loses more than 70,000 people every year from drug ODs. The death rate from overdoses has tripled in the last two decades and it is driven by an explosion in opioid abuse. You know all of that. But it's not just fentanyl that's killing Americans. Abuse of more traditional drugs is also rising. For example, the death rate from cocaine overdoses has risen by more than a hundred percent since 2003. And of course, there's alcohol, which is and will always be most likely the most abused drug in the West. Many thousands of Americans will die just this year from the cumulative effects of beer. So why is this happening? And what can we do about it? Well, a lot of people thought about this for a long time. And the truth is, nobody is really sure. What we do know for certain is that people who are determined to get sober have the best chance of getting sober. But in order to break free of addiction, you really have to want it, you have to want it badly. And that raises a deeper question. Do we really want it? Is sobriety still a virtue in America? And by the way, should it be a virtue? Is it worth being sober? We think that's an issue well worth talking about and exploring at some depth. And so over the next several weeks on this show, we plan to do that. We're going to talk to people, some of the well-known people who have fought for sobriety and want it and we're going to ask them a really simple question. Was it worth it? What's your life like now? We begin our series tonight with the conversation with football great, Joe Namath. He is the author of the book \"All The Way: My Life in Four Quarters.\"",

It was an embarrassing moment that occurred after I'd been sober for a number of years, I was challenged originally by my wife when my first daughter was a year and a half old to go get help, and I didn't think I needed help. I figured I could quit, and I didn't quit. So she challenged me again and I promised her that I would stop and this was dealing with alcohol at the time and I became what I learned through Alcoholics Anonymous that I became a dry drunk for 13 and a half years. I didn't have a drink, man, and then I found an excuse. I found that excuse. I learned going through a divorce was an excuse for me. I was taught this lady to go back and drink, and I did that until I had an incident with a young lady that was during a football game, a halftime experience at a Jet game that, man, I didn't even remember. The next day I found out about it and I let a lot of people down including myself there with that kind of behavior. And I did reach out to get help and I went and got an education and I'm so thankful for it today. And you know, Tucker, one of the good things about this -- that I've experienced being an athlete, being out there in the public over the years, I'll go through airports, man; I'll go into the grocery store, people would come up to me, hey, Joe, how are you doing? Pop up. I'd say fine, you know, and then they leaned over and whisper to me. I'm a friend of Bill's. I'd say, hey, you don't have to whisper, you know, come on. We're in together, for real, you know. I want to encourage them. That's a good thing, man. And I do like to help out and encourage people. Throughout my life, people who come up to me and I've learned, you know, good vibes.

That's a sign their schools are failing. They no longer care. California has just changed what it teaches. It doesn't bother with long division anymore. Education is no longer the point. It's about indoctrination. We know that because the state has laid it out there. The state is planning to roll out a new ethnic studies requirement for students. You can imagine what those classes will be like. But again, you don't have to imagine we already know. A model curriculum for the program reads like a handbook from voxx.com's HR Department, the definition of hell. It features topics like coloniality and hegemony, whatever that means. They'll be forced to have courses on their, \"intersectional and ancestral roots,\" end quote. Of course, it will describe capitalism as a form of power and oppression comparable to racism, white supremacy and ableism. Well, many of California students are already taking courses on ethnic studies. A Charter High School in Mondale, for example, require students to write breakup letters from various forms of oppression. Students must persuade leaders about the dehumanizing effects of masculinity, heteronormativity and gas pipelines. That's assuming they can even write a sentence in English, which many can't. The whole thing sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke. This is the public school curriculum in this nation's largest state.

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Ever notice how as if on cue, all the dumb people on cable news and their Democratic allies in Congress for whom they are actually working, they start hyperventilating about the same thing at pretty much exactly the same time. Pick your topic, pick the day, it's always the same. Only the issue itself changes. Today's issue is the identity of the so-called whistleblower. That's the person who originally filed the complaint about the President's call with the President of Ukraine that set in motion the series of events that are certain to culminate in an official impeachment proceeding. Now we're being told the one thing that we can't know about this whole process is who that person is, who the whistleblower is. Why can't we know that? Well, abettors on television are telling us we can't know that because the identity of the whistleblower is the one thing standing in the way standing between that person leading a normal life and that person being potentially injured in political violence. Now, political violence is a concern in this country and as we've said countless times in the show, we are adamantly and totally opposed to it in all cases, in every case. What's so startling, though, is that the people making this claims aren't against political violence, adamantly and in every case, in fact, in many cases, they are for it. These the people, you'll remember who told you to punch a Nazi. These are the people who applauded when various members of the Trump administration were screamed at and threatened in public places with their families in some cases. We're talking about restaurants or walking down the street. So these people aren't actually concerned about protecting anyone, particularly people with different political views. They're totally fine slandering teenagers who go to Catholic high schools or pizza shops in small towns in Indiana. When it comes to people they don't agree with like the guy whose life CNN wrecked for making fun of their logo or the Ohio bakery that was nearly destroyed forever by Oberlin College, they'll charge right in there and ruin innocent people's lives. It doesn't bother them at all. But in this one specific case, they're telling you can't know. Why are they telling you that? Whenever they are adamant about something, it ought to be your cue that something is going on here. What are they trying to protect? What don't they want you to know? What are they covering up? In this specific case, what they don't want you to know is the so-called whistleblower might have been motivated by partisan impulses. This might be someone who disagrees with the President's policies, and maybe that's what this is really about, a policy disagreement. It's not about standing up heroically for his country, it's about undermining a democratically elected President with whom he disagrees. Now they're swearing that that's not the case. Nancy Pelosi up there telling you, she is praying for this country and nothing makes her sadder than seeing the President impeached. This is terrible for all of us and we just hope it's over soon. And the person who did this did so. The whistleblower did so at great personal risk, and we're just hoping he can get through it. He is just doing the best he can for America. And you know, by the way, maybe that's true. But maybe it's not true. Maybe the whistleblower is just another nasty little partisan, like so many of these people, like virtually everyone you see on cable news, and maybe they're lying to you. You can't know, and you won't know until you find out who this so-called whistleblower is. That's why they're hiding it. That's what's really going on here. Peter Van Buren has watched things like this for a long time. He is a veteran in the State Department. He is a whistleblower himself. He is also a contributing editor at \"The American Conservative,\" he joins us tonight. So, Peter, thanks so much for joining us."

He didn't reveal information at personal risk. He didn't give us information that we didn't have. He basically reported corridor gossip. And at this point, his anonymity is in way against the value of knowing his motives and the process that brought him to us. And when you weigh that anonymity against the benefits of exposing that process, he needs to stand up as a patriot and say, here is why I did it, here is how I did it, and put himself where his mouth is."

I think the process is partisan enough that we know what's going to happen in the House and we can predict a pretty good guess of what's going to happen in the Senate. But a year from now, we are going to vote on whether Donald Trump should have a second term and understanding whether this whistleblower is a patriot, or whether he is an agent provocateur, who set up this whole thing, teed it up for the Democrats, is what separates righteousness from a coup, and we need to know more about him and why he came forward and how he came forward so that next November, when we judge righteousness, we can do that with all the information."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN BUREN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. His name is Fred or John or Steve is irrelevant. What is relevant is how did this corridor gossip become a whistleblower's complaint? And how did it thread its way through the bureaucracy to the point where it acted as nitroglycerin to trigger an impeachment? That separates the real from the political and we need to know that. That's what's relevant here. Not that his name is this or he lives over here, but what brought him to us. This process is critical. It lies at the heart of our democracy, we're talking about unseating a President in the middle of a campaign. That is an extremely serious act for our nation. And to go forward on that with someone in the back in the shadows whispering, hey, I heard something."

And even after the amazing work that other whistleblowers have done exposing the N.S.A., exposing what's happened in our wars, I'm afraid that we, as a group generally remain pariahs. Right now, there's a celebrity whistleblower who is taking the attention, but I suspect at some point, the system will configure itself to wonder what his motives were."

Before the contents of the whistleblower complaint were known publicly, a Democratic congressional staffer contacted the former American Ambassador to Ukraine to discuss with the staffer described as quote \"quite delicate and time sensitive questions.\" This show has obtained exclusively an e-mail from that Democratic staffer for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent by private e-mail to the former American Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Now, Yovanovitch as you know, is now a key player in the Democrats' impeachment probe and was recalled from her post in Ukraine by President Trump in May of 2019 following allegations of serious partisanship and political bias. In the e-mail, the Democratic aide says this, quote, \"I'm writing to see if you would have time to meet up for a chat -- in particular, I'm hoping to discuss some Ukraine-related oversight questions we're exploring. I'd appreciate the chance to ground truth, a few pieces of information with you, some of which are quite delicate/time sensitive and thus, we want to make sure we get them right,\" end quote. Now that e-mail was sent on August 14, that's two days after the whistleblower complaint was filed, and a month before that complaint became public. The whistleblower however went to Schiff's team -- Adam Schiff's team -- before filing the complaint. The question is, did Schiff's office tell other Democrats on Capitol Hill what was in the complaint? In other words, how long did this effort play out in secret before the rest of the country learned of it? Well we asked the Democratic spokesman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee about this, and here is the response we got, quote, \"The Committee wanted to hear from an Ambassador whose assignment was cut short under unusual circumstances. This staff outreach was part of a months' long effort that culminated in the September 9 launch of an investigation into these events.\" Well, Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York asked Ambassador Yovanovitch directly about the e-mail. Yovanovitch claimed that she never personally responded to it, never responded to the Democratic staffer. In fact, it turns out that she did respond. In fact, she said she, quote, \"looked forward to chatting with you,\" to that staffer, and as Congressman Zeldin pointed out, the Ambassador's original answer, which was dishonest, was given under oath. So maybe she will get hauled into court like Roger Stone and threatened with life in prison. Just kidding. Meanwhile, we have an actual whistleblower here in media world. That whistleblower worked for ABC News and leaked an off air tape of an anchor, Amy Robach talking in very frustrated tones about how her employers at ABC News killed her story on billionaire pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Why did they do that? It'd be interesting to know. Well, whoever leaked that tape later went to work at CBS, where apparently was a woman, she was located. CBS and ABC got together, they found her and they fired her. So in other words, those two networks spent a lot of time finding the person who embarrassed them and in no time at all, figuring out who covered up for a pedophile and why. That tells you a lot, doesn't it? Robby Soave is an editor at \"Reason\" magazine and author of the book, \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\" He joins us tonight. Robby, even by the standards of the press for whom I literally have no respect at all, and I couldn't have more contempt for the television networks than I do, and I say that having worked at almost all of them. This seems especially low to me."

But ending lawlessness at the border is a bipartisan, overwhelming issue. Standing up to China, defending American manufacturing, standing up against cheating and fraud and abuse is a bipartisan and a powerful issue. Trump is right on both of those. And on wars. I saw recently that veterans opposed -- didn't think military efforts in Iraq were justified by 64 percent. American people think we are too committed in too many endless wars. President Trump is right about that. So I think this represents some change for the Republican establishment. And many of the Democrats are totally opposed to it. But we should be able to put together a majority, we should drive these issues. We could take it to the American people and name names and show who is for what and make them vote.

These are not small things. They are big society wide trends, and on some days, they seem intractable. What's causing them? Well, it is complicated, but there is at least one thing that all of these slow moving disasters have in common. They are all, to some extent driven by addiction. Nobody wants to say it out loud, but an awful lot of Americans are not in their right minds a lot of the time. They're hooked on something. You've seen the stats. They're grimly familiar at this point. They tell part of the story. America loses more than 70,000 people every year from drug ODs. The death rate from overdoses has tripled in the last two decades and it is driven by an explosion in opioid abuse. You know all of that. But it's not just fentanyl that's killing Americans. Abuse of more traditional drugs is also rising. For example, the death rate from cocaine overdoses has risen by more than a hundred percent since 2003. And of course, there's alcohol, which is and will always be most likely the most abused drug in the West. Many thousands of Americans will die just this year from the cumulative effects of beer. So why is this happening? And what can we do about it? Well, a lot of people thought about this for a long time. And the truth is, nobody is really sure. What we do know for certain is that people who are determined to get sober have the best chance of getting sober. But in order to break free of addiction, you really have to want it, you have to want it badly. And that raises a deeper question. Do we really want it? Is sobriety still a virtue in America? And by the way, should it be a virtue? Is it worth being sober? We think that's an issue well worth talking about and exploring at some depth. And so over the next several weeks on this show, we plan to do that. We're going to talk to people, some of the well-known people who have fought for sobriety and want it and we're going to ask them a really simple question. Was it worth it? What's your life like now? We begin our series tonight with the conversation with football great, Joe Namath. He is the author of the book \"All The Way: My Life in Four Quarters.\""

      "utterance": "Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Big time worth it. I've had some experiences throughout my life and had been knocked down a few times, certainly in sports, but the major part of it is knowing that this whole big game of life is a team effort. And having had some struggles, I have reached out and received some education and help from other people and man, I'm around willing to help whomever I can."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAMATH",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I feel different. I feel good about myself in the effort. Because I know, addictions take place throughout our lives or can take place. Many people can be brought to their knees for a variety of reasons. And I think we all can actually, and addictions come in different shapes and forms. Alcohol is one of them, certainly. Opioids is another one. Everyday sugar you can consider that kind of an addiction."

      "speaker": "NAMATH",
      "utterance": "And salt, the kind of foods we eat. Yes, man. So getting an education, getting help is important. And I think I know, we have one instrument, we're the only one that can take care of this body and mind of ours. We need to put the effort in. And we need to recognize the importance of how we take care of ourselves to be able to take care of the ones we love or be a part of this life in a loving way."

      "utterance": "What was the key for you to getting over your addiction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAMATH",
      "utterance": "The key was love for my family. It was an embarrassing moment that occurred after I'd been sober for a number of years, I was challenged originally by my wife when my first daughter was a year and a half old to go get help, and I didn't think I needed help. I figured I could quit, and I didn't quit. So she challenged me again and I promised her that I would stop and this was dealing with alcohol at the time and I became what I learned through Alcoholics Anonymous that I became a dry drunk for 13 and a half years. I didn't have a drink, man, and then I found an excuse. I found that excuse. I learned going through a divorce was an excuse for me. I was taught this lady to go back and drink, and I did that until I had an incident with a young lady that was during a football game, a halftime experience at a Jet game that, man, I didn't even remember. The next day I found out about it and I let a lot of people down including myself there with that kind of behavior. And I did reach out to get help and I went and got an education and I'm so thankful for it today. And you know, Tucker, one of the good things about this -- that I've experienced being an athlete, being out there in the public over the years, I'll go through airports, man; I'll go into the grocery store, people would come up to me, hey, Joe, how are you doing? Pop up. I'd say fine, you know, and then they leaned over and whisper to me. I'm a friend of Bill's. I'd say, hey, you don't have to whisper, you know, come on. We're in together, for real, you know. I want to encourage them. That's a good thing, man. And I do like to help out and encourage people. Throughout my life, people who come up to me and I've learned, you know, good vibes. Good vibes and smile, it's healthy. It's healthy. I want people to treat me, treat my children the way we treat one another and I've been lucky."

    {
      "speaker": "NAMATH",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It is worth it, says Joe Namath. Clear headedness, not easy to get, but it's worth it. That's the first in what we hope will be a long series on sobriety in this country. How to get it and why it's worth having. Up next, students in California Public Schools can't read or write very well, but pretty soon they'll be able to define heteronormative success. We'll tell you after the break."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Only about half of students in the State of California meet English standards, even fewer than that can do math before California's leaders lost their minds, they would have been concerned about this. That's a sign their schools are failing. They no longer care. California has just changed what it teaches. It doesn't bother with long division anymore. Education is no longer the point. It's about indoctrination. We know that because the state has laid it out there. The state is planning to roll out a new ethnic studies requirement for students. You can imagine what those classes will be like. But again, you don't have to imagine we already know. A model curriculum for the program reads like a handbook from voxx.com's HR Department, the definition of hell. It features topics like coloniality and hegemony, whatever that means. They'll be forced to have courses on their, \"intersectional and ancestral roots,\" end quote. Of course, it will describe capitalism as a form of power and oppression comparable to racism, white supremacy and ableism. Well, many of California students are already taking courses on ethnic studies. A Charter High School in Mondale, for example, require students to write breakup letters from various forms of oppression. Students must persuade leaders about the dehumanizing effects of masculinity, heteronormativity and gas pipelines. That's assuming they can even write a sentence in English, which many can't. The whole thing sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke. This is the public school curriculum in this nation's largest state. Heather Mac Donald is the author of the book, \"The Diversity Delusion\" and she joins us tonight. So what exactly does this portend if the largest school system in the United States is teaching this? Where does that put us 10 years from now?"

    {
      "speaker": "HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "It puts us at the bottom of the international arena in terms of education because this is not just California, Tucker, I wish it were so people could move out. This is happening in Iowa, it's happening in Indiana, it's happening in Arizona -- these are red states. We are falling further and further behind our international competitors. Just this week, the National Standards came out, Reading and Math is down across the board. Direct inverse proportion -- the greater the schools get politicized the worst our basic skills decline."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We used to care. I remember liberals used to say I can't believe we are losing to Norway or Taiwan or whatever. They seem to have decided we're not competing anymore. The whole system is racist. Hide under the bed. Facts don't matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, they're obviously more concerned with a phony narrative about America. This is about as they say, in Ethnic Studies, decentering whiteness. Now, let's translate that. What does that mean? It means that every white person by virtue of being white is an oppressor. So a laid off Kentucky coal miner has more power and privilege than Barack Obama or Eric Holder because he is white."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, isn't that racist?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",
      "utterance": "All white people are -- it is the very definition of racism, Tucker. This is a Cold War on the grounds of race. And I think we're at an emergency level now, because this is poison being poured into the body politic. It's going to end every single meritocratic standard. Parents have to start pulling their kids out of school. We cannot give them the cannon fodder for this type of racial division any longer. Homeschool, I would hope that these donors that are pouring multimillion dollars into over endowed colleges. I was just to Yale which is just the height of privilege would instead start creating schools that respect knowledge, that respect our tradition, that are factually based. Any educator who purports to claim that the West and America are the source of the world's depression should on that ground alone be fired because that is proof of complete ignorance -- historical ignorance. It was the West that broke free of tribalism."
