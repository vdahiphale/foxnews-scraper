But first, the news. We're just a few hours at this point away from a potential partial government shutdown. The President says that any further funding of the government must include money for the Border wall that he promised. The House narrowly voted to give him that money just yesterday.  But, so far, the Senate hasn't budged. Many senators are out of town. So, it looks like that may not change. The official Democratic line tonight is that if you want to protect America's borders with a wall, you hate Jesus.",

Vice President, Mike Pence, is still on Capitol Hill, where he's been for several hours now, trying to work out a deal with Democrats. He cast the tie-breaking vote to keep a bill alive that would provide billions in funding for the wall. But the Senate did not take up the bill because they said that there was almost no chance that it would pass. Instead, the Senate has decided to not vote until an agreement has been reached between the President and the leaders of the House and Senate.",

The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, says he's not going to put anything forward that doesn't have the President's support. The House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, said a rumored number of $1.6 billion for a border wall would be inadequate. They still want the full $5 billion. And House leadership doesn't really seem too eager to consider changes made by the skeptical senators either. The Majority Whip, Congressman Steve Scalise, told me Members are feeling good right now because the Border wall bill didn't just squeak through, it easily passed the House. The Vice President is still here though. He's been here almost all day. He brought Jared Kushner and the incoming White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. They've been working on lawmakers on the House side and on the Senate side. But when I told a Republican Senator that the three of them were here, Pence, Kushner, and Mulvaney, the Senator looked at me kind of puzzled and said, \"No, it's Donald and Chuck.\" That's the way out of this, the way they see it.

We put the rat alone in an empty cage where it's got nothing that makes life meaningful for rats. All it's got is the drugs. What would happen if we did this differently?\" So, he built a cage that he called Rat Park, which is basically like heaven for rats. They got loads of friends, they can have loads of sex, they got loads of cheese, they got loads of colored balls, they got everything that makes life meaningful for rats. And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drug water. And, of course, they try both. This is the fascinating thing. In Rat Park, when their deeper needs are met, they don't like the drugs. They hardly ever use them. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them over -- overdose. So, you go from a 100 percent compulsive use and overdose when they don't have the things that make life meaningful to none when they do. What this tells us, and there's loads of human examples, I'm sure we'll get to, is the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. The opposite of addiction is having your deeper needs as a human being met. And it helps us to understand why we're seeing such a rising and catastrophic addiction crisis in the United States at the moment. We've built a society that is not meeting people's deepest needs as human beings.",

We've killed hundreds of thousands of people. And, at the end of all that, we can't even keep drugs out of our prisons, where we pay someone to walk around the perimeter the whole time. We have to stop copying the places that have failed and start copying the places that succeeded. And everywhere that it's succeeded whether it's Switzerland, which has reduced its heroin overdose deaths to virtually nothing, we're having a terrible crisis, I explained in Chasing the Scream how. All the models have been based, all the places that have succeeded have had strategies based on love and compassion.

Good night. And, more than anything, have a very Merry Christmas. See you in the New Year. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A special edition, Inside The Issues, where we take a deeper look at some of the questions America is facing tonight. But first, the news. We're just a few hours at this point away from a potential partial government shutdown. The President says that any further funding of the government must include money for the Border wall that he promised. The House narrowly voted to give him that money just yesterday. But, so far, the Senate hasn't budged. Many senators are out of town. So, it looks like that may not change. The official Democratic line tonight is that if you want to protect America's borders with a wall, you hate Jesus."

So, it is now almost certain that the government will indeed partially shut down at midnight. Now, with that said, behind the scenes, negotiations are still ongoing. Vice President, Mike Pence, is still on Capitol Hill, where he's been for several hours now, trying to work out a deal with Democrats. He cast the tie-breaking vote to keep a bill alive that would provide billions in funding for the wall. But the Senate did not take up the bill because they said that there was almost no chance that it would pass. Instead, the Senate has decided to not vote until an agreement has been reached between the President and the leaders of the House and Senate."

We are willing to continue discussions on those proposals."

They never really supported a wall. They were lying. They were just saying what they thought it took to win, and they did win. This game has been going on for many years. Many Members of Congress, particularly on the Democratic side, say they want a secure border. But when it comes down to voting, they never do a single thing to achieve it.

They've all been told to expect a 24-hour heads-up before voting can possibly start. The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, says he's not going to put anything forward that doesn't have the President's support. The House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, said a rumored number of $1.6 billion for a border wall would be inadequate. They still want the full $5 billion. And House leadership doesn't really seem too eager to consider changes made by the skeptical senators either. The Majority Whip, Congressman Steve Scalise, told me Members are feeling good right now because the Border wall bill didn't just squeak through, it easily passed the House. The Vice President is still here though. He's been here almost all day. He brought Jared Kushner and the incoming White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. They've been working on lawmakers on the House side and on the Senate side. But when I told a Republican Senator that the three of them were here, Pence, Kushner, and Mulvaney, the Senator looked at me kind of puzzled and said, \"No, it's Donald and Chuck.\" That's the way out of this, the way they see it.

They all agree that conflict is better than peace, always and everywhere, but especially in places where it can't possibly help the United State. Troops in Syria, good. Troops on the U.S. border, bad. The lie they tell themselves is that we're in control of the world that it's even possible to control the world. A few troops here, a bombing campaign there, and we can decide the course of global events. But, of course, we can't. The outcome of any conflict can never be known. Unintended consequences are the rule. But our rulers can't admit that because they'd have to admit they're not God. If you're wondering why our ruling class, pushes for war, as fanatically as it does for abortion, that's why. Killing gives them the illusion of control and makes them feel powerful.

By the way, this is the same inner circle that has sabotaged every policy action that -- that President Trump has tried to initiate, has obstructed the American First agenda from day one. So, thank goodness, he's not talking to them. Secondly, he's struck a blow for the American people against the Warfare State. What you just showed on television is what we like to refer to as the Washington Uniparty. These are the people on your famous ship that's sinking right now. These are the individuals, lobbyists, legislators, the retired senior officers, media, these are the individuals that want to cultivate conflict and keep forces mired everywhere but, as you say, leave our Southern border, our borders, our territorial waters effectively open. So, Donald Trump has done a great service because he's brought all of this out into the open. And he needs to remember something.

In 2017, life expectancy in the United States dropped for the third year in a row, and that was driven by a record number of drug ODs and, of course, a surge in suicide, now one of the leading causes of death. It's despair that is killing Americans. But what's driving that? Johann Hari is one of the smartest people we've talked to on this show.

And when it got to the point where I -- I began to research this eight years ago for my book, Chasing the Scream, I was really in a terrible state. I -- I -- I couldn't understand how to help the people I most loved. And so, I ended up going on this big journey all over the world. I wanted to go to the places that had the toughest policies towards addiction, places that had the most compassionate policies towards addiction. And I learned many things. But I think the most important thing I learned is that actually I profoundly misunderstood what addiction actually is that I think actually we're misunderstanding it now in the United States in ways that's -- that's disastrous.

Now, that's not untrue. But it's actually a surprisingly small part of this story. And we know that because of a series of experiments that were done. So, this story we get, we know that the drugs are caused by the chemical hooks. What caused -- drug addiction is caused by the chemical hooks comes from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th Century. They're really simple experiments. Your -- your viewers could try them at home if they feel a little bit sadistic today. You take a rat, you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles. One is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drugged water and almost always kill itself quite quickly, right?

We put the rat alone in an empty cage where it's got nothing that makes life meaningful for rats. All it's got is the drugs. What would happen if we did this differently?\" So, he built a cage that he called Rat Park, which is basically like heaven for rats. They got loads of friends, they can have loads of sex, they got loads of cheese, they got loads of colored balls, they got everything that makes life meaningful for rats. And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drug water. And, of course, they try both. This is the fascinating thing. In Rat Park, when their deeper needs are met, they don't like the drugs. They hardly ever use them. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them over -- overdose. So, you go from a 100 percent compulsive use and overdose when they don't have the things that make life meaningful to none when they do. What this tells us, and there's loads of human examples, I'm sure we'll get to, is the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. The opposite of addiction is having your deeper needs as a human being met. And it helps us to understand why we're seeing such a rising and catastrophic addiction crisis in the United States at the moment. We've built a society that is not meeting people's deepest needs as human beings."

We've killed hundreds of thousands of people. And, at the end of all that, we can't even keep drugs out of our prisons, where we pay someone to walk around the perimeter the whole time. We have to stop copying the places that have failed and start copying the places that succeeded. And everywhere that it's succeeded whether it's Switzerland, which has reduced its heroin overdose deaths to virtually nothing, we're having a terrible crisis, I explained in Chasing the Scream how. All the models have been based, all the places that have succeeded have had strategies based on love and compassion.

      "utterance": "Well we want to end tonight's special with a congratulations to one of our smartest producers and one of our favorite people. Alex Pfeiffer works on this show. He's a reporter here. He breaks a lot of the stories you see, puts together a lot of the segments that make this show, we think, worse -- worth watching. Tonight, Alex Pfeiffer proposed to his girlfriend, Jolie Friedman (ph), who is the kind of person if you had a, you know, a son that age, you want your son to marry her. She's that great. And thankfully, she said yes. We're for marriage on this show and, particularly, for the marriage of Alex Pfeiffer and Jolie Friedman (ph). Congratulations. It's wonderful. That's it for us tonight. Tune in every night 8 P.M., the show this is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Next week is Christmas. I'm taking it off with my family. But I'll be back right after the New Year. The first show, I think, is like the 3rd of January. In the meantime, we've got an hour-long special edition of Final Exam, Christmas Day, 8 P.M. Eastern. Good night. And, more than anything, have a very Merry Christmas. See you in the New Year. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
