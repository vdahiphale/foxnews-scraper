You heard H.R. McMaster say that there were a limited number of people in the Oval Office. Clearly, there were some aides as well who were present. But the fact that the details of this meeting with such a small circle of people could get out was baffling to the White House is also very troubling. However, for us as journalists, and H.R. McMaster statement, he did not say what the nature of the information was that the President shared.   And here's why we get into a little bit of an area that is concerned to some people who have been in this business for a long time. And that is the intelligence business. But this was said to be an intelligence document that was developed by one of our partners, may be a partner in the region, and that the President didn't have, quote, \"ownership of this.\" And while the President can go out there and talk about anything he wants, classified or not. The fact that this might have come from a third country is something that is troubling because it might actually compromised in the hands of the Russians, the sources and methods used by that third country to develop their intelligence -- Kimberly.",

I've been told that a memo was not broadly circulated about the contents of this meeting. But I am also hearing that there were electronic communications regarding this meeting, and that the leak could have happened digitally. And that is someone got a hold of an email and decided to share with somebody else that then shared it to the media. If you look at The Washington Post story and The New York Times also has matching reporting on it now, there are officials who are, U.S. officials who are current and former, who are sources for these stories, so that was it just somebody inside government, somebody who used to be in government but is now in the private sector -- Jesse.",

Was it a code worded document as was reported by The Washington Post. We do not know.

We do know that the communications staff Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Michael Dubke were together in a meeting in the cabinet room with Steve Bannon. And in a couple of moments because we were standing in the hallway not too far away, we heard some raised voices. So, it's likely that that meeting got a little heated at times. We don't know what the content or what the substance of the meeting was. But it sounded like there were points of disagreement that were going on there. And no question, Greg, that this President is not happy with his communications operation as it has been.

You heard H.R. McMaster say that there were a limited number of people in the Oval Office. Clearly, there were some aides as well who were present. But the fact that the details of this meeting with such a small circle of people could get out was baffling to the White House is also very troubling. However, for us as journalists, and H.R.

But this was said to be an intelligence document that was developed by one of our partners, may be a partner in the region, and that the President didn't have, quote, \"ownership of this.\" And while the President can go out there and talk about anything he wants, classified or not. The fact that this might have come from a third country is something that is troubling because it might actually compromised in the hands of the Russians, the sources and methods used by that third country to develop their intelligence -- Kimberly."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "We don't have any independent reporting on that. We can only go by the story that in which this all first came to life and that's in The Washington Post which says that the NSA called the CIA and the NSA, the National Security Agency to tell them that the President had shared this documents, we don't know what the substance of these conversations was and what the reaction was at the CIA and the NSA. I'm sorry, Dana. A little deeper level of understanding of that particular --"

      "speaker": "PERINO",

It's difficult because obviously it's breaking news and something like this would be so classified -- no, White House communications team like, they would never know about it. So now they are having to scramble on a story but that is possibly I guess the story is about the leak."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

You know, laptops have been banned on flights coming into the United States at least in the cabin from the Middle East that has now been expanded to Europe. Russia faces the same threat. So, we are hearing from sources that, you know, why wouldn't the White House share that sort of information with another country that is under the same sort of threat, and in particular, a country with which the President would like to work together to defeat ISIS? So, there may be less there to this actual information than what is being deposited by some news organizations."

Did each individual there have an aide and have they narrowed down the amount of people that were there? Because this is turning into a leak investigation. And can't you go up to one of these aides who I assumed did the leaking, I assume it's not McMaster, I assume it's not Tillerson, it's got to be in aide and say, hand over your Blackberry, let me see your computer, who did you call? Is that happening right now? It seems like that would be the top priority of the Trump White House."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we don't know the exact number of people that were in the meeting. We do know that there were four principles to the President, Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, the National Security Advisor, and Dina Powell who is the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy. And then there will be a number of aides as well. We know that Lavrov and Kislyak were there. We know that there was a photographer who was operating on behalf of the Russian government who was there. He also happened to apparently being a journalist because those photos were published and then the Russians would have had a number of aides as well. You can bet that this White House is actively trying to trace down the source of this leak. I do not know if it's been narrowed down to any particular group of people. I've been told that a memo was not broadly circulated about the contents of this meeting. But I am also hearing that there were electronic communications regarding this meeting, and that the leak could have happened digitally. And that is someone got a hold of an email and decided to share with somebody else that then shared it to the media. If you look at The Washington Post story and The New York Times also has matching reporting on it now, there are officials who are, U.S. officials who are current and former, who are sources for these stories, so that was it just somebody inside government, somebody who used to be in government but is now in the private sector -- Jesse."

Yet, The Washington Post, if this is a false story, was asked by the CIA and the NSA not to publish the name of the town which is very significant where this information came from. Where our partner got the information and shared it with us. And for that to get out, even that to get out is beyond comprehension vote, except in this White House. But, so, why would The Washington Post make this up? Why would the CIA say, say The Washington Post withhold this information, and then post it?"
    },

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Well, it all depends on what type of document and what the intelligence was Bob, that they were talking about. And I think that's what H.R. McMaster is talking about when he says that the story as reported is false. And again, I am told that this is information that was both pertinent to threats against the United States and threats against Russia. And when you are trying to develop an ally on the war on terror and the fight against ISIS, you want to share some information that is relevant and pertinent to them to try to get them on board. But Bob, to your other point, you know, this is information, you know, it comes back to Russia again for this White House. If this was a singular event, you can say okay, fine, so they shared some information. But when you take this in the piece of a larger puzzle, there are some people here at the White House who say, I can't believe it's Russia and it's Russia again -- Bob."

So, he can't say if there is like one sliver of the story that is not right that he can say. The whole story is not right. I am wondering if that holds water in your opinion. Was that a legal -- his way of a legal answer and not a real answer? And I am also curious about Sean Spicer. I'm wondering if he is somewhere doing shots of Jagermeister in a fork made of pillows in the woods."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Well, I could tell you this much, he is not hiding out in the bushes here on the North Lawn. Did it sound like a legal answer or at least a legal statement from H.R. McMaster? Yes, it did. Because again, we do not know what the actual document was. Was it a classified document? Was it a top secret document? Was it a code worded document as was reported by The Washington Post. We do not know. We do not know what part of the reporting is, quote, \"false.\" Now, as to Sean Spicer, he is still in his office right behind me. We do know that the communications staff Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Michael Dubke were together in a meeting in the cabinet room with Steve Bannon. And in a couple of moments because we were standing in the hallway not too far away, we heard some raised voices. So, it's likely that that meeting got a little heated at times. We don't know what the content or what the substance of the meeting was. But it sounded like there were points of disagreement that were going on there. And no question, Greg, that this President is not happy with his communications operation as it has been. I don't know if you saw Sean Spicer during the briefing today, but I have never seen him like that. He barely cracked a smile today. It was kind of flat and forthright and that is not the Sean Spicer that I know."

The big question here, Kimberly is, who is not on the same page? Who thought that it would be appropriate to leak to The Washington Post and now \"The New York Times\" as well? Such sensitive information as to what happened in that meeting a week ago."

I can understand why you don't share that information. But if there are reasons that you have partnerships with third-party intelligence because you can't always be there, but those entities or sources don't necessarily want it to be known that they are helping the United States of America because I could actually either disrupt the source and method or show that a government that shouldn't be helping America is actually helping. So, that is probably the concern. Also, part of the report on The Washington Post says that after the meeting concludes, the NSA contacts the NSA and the CIA. So, immediately I think that takes it out of the White House."

When the NSA documents were released in 2005 and it was not on the front page of the \"New York Times,\" it's still had nothing declassified by the President so we had to say no comment all the time. So, the communicators are in handcuffs.

And this has been building for some time and I'm not talking about President Obama. I'm talking about in our culture, in our pop culture, in our music, we had created this idea that these were the bad guys. This was a win for Trump in a sense that no one had really gone out there and asked the politician and gone after this. And I think for the Democrats, Bob, they should re- examine their stance and learn something from President Trump that in the world of law and order.

Remember how Obama said, you know, GM is alive and bin Laden is dead, we decimate there on the run. I believe this guy. This is the guy that works for the FBI that was doing the interrogations of terrorists at blacks sites. That made me think whatever happened to enhanced interrogation, whatever happened to black sites, because when we were doing that and we were not just zapping people with drones, we were getting so much actionable intelligence.

Is he going to let that happen? He said he wouldn't let that happen again. Well, it happened. Now we have to find out what he's going to do about it. I don't deny that this guy is right about the growth of terror. We know that is not a big new story. And then Al-Qaeda, their general message has been Jihad from the very beginning and the caliphate. And so it is not a terrorist group rather that doesn't align themselves with those. The name had been adopted by some but let's also keep in mind, when he talks about (inaudible) never would have believed it. His followers have tanks in territory. He's talking about ISIS. And ISIS is damn Al-Qaeda. Advisers say they are not part of Al-Qaeda and they are the most powerful organization going. So I think it makes some sense, I think not certainly to a lot more people, but a lot more terrorists (ph).

In a world where all men and women are equal under the law, the law cannot lock in equal outcomes. Sorry, some people work harder and whine less. And some hit both the gym and the books. Kara seems like that type of person: One who wasn't just winning a beauty pageant, but life as well. That just has got to drive social justice warriors nuts. Maybe they can have their own pageant.

Police wasn't working, the system was corrupt, we had a trillion dollar debt, we are not winning wars, this country was losing on trade, the economy wasn't recovering that strongly from the recession. So you can bring in a guy to come over here and flip the table over. And what do you expect when he flipped the table over? I think that's the point. If things were not working, let's try new system."

But sometimes it is not always the best answer. It can be but it's like Wikipedia replaced Britannica as an example. I think from disruption, if you try to do it with government, it's a very messy and public and we all own it. Everyone is super invested and if you are against Trump, all of the disruption makes you extremely uncomfortable. If you are for him, that is amazing and brilliant. So I think we just have to see.

That's why it is so hard. My advice is you might try to do that, to separate it, because I know a lot of people who agree with him but find him exhausting and crazy. He's a tiresome boss because his unpredictability always keeps you like what's he going to do next? Then you find out you kind of agree with him on a lot of things, but you can't support the personality."

With that unpredictability though, there's also a certain stoic nature and fearlessness to be able to stand up to people whether it's Putin or whether it's the president of China to make sure that you can effectuate positive outcomes for U.S. policy. I think it's what's needed at this point in time."
