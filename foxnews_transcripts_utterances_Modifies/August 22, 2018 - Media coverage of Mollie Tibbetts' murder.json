      "sentences": "Right, a girl in Iowa. She's right. And a girl in Iowa murdered pales in importance when compared to tax evasion, because if you talk about Mollie, you can't talk about the things that the media thinks is important. To the press, your sorrow over a young woman's death is got to be political. And that hush money among adults is more harmful to society than a brutal killing.  The media is obsessed with Manafort and Cohen -- victimless, gotcha crimes. But for most Americans, we know a true victim when we see her. It ain't the IRS or Stormy. And so we're smeared for thinking murder matters more than a bad 1040. So maybe we need to help the media find equivalencies. Let me ask you dear media: How many Mollies is a Mike Cohen worth? The answer: As many as it takes to undo an election and the facts be damned. On Sunday, this story took off on Twitter: ICE had nabbed a guy on the way to the hospital with his pregnant wife. It was perfect media fodder, until we later found out the dad was a murder suspect, so mysteriously, that story went away. Or how about the Nazi death camp guard living in Queens? Obama's White House knew about him but ignored it even as the Nazi's Jewish neighbors called him out. Then we had an election and Trump, using ICE, deported him. So without ICE, we'd have at least one Nazi on the loose.  If this is the first time you've heard of these stories, I get it. These days, you stick to the story you want to tell, which is why to some, Mollie Tibbetts is just some girl in Iowa.   To be fair, I want to run this apology from the Fordham Professor Christine Greer who said -- apologized on twitter. It's a non-apology, but let's run it anyway. She said, yesterday, I've said something flippant that was unintended. Mollie Tibbetts was a promising young woman who lost her life. My hope is that her family will find peace and justice. And that her murder is not used to justify a discriminatory immigration policy. Dana, from a public relations perspective, she probably could have stopped that apology when it mattered.",

We can't have sanctuary. And we have to do something where you have to be able to verify the people that are in here. Now, on the other hand, the media does not report these stories honestly. And if you look at this one and the other ones that you've mentioned up there, they're misinforming the audience. They're not informing. I looked at that story about the arrest, about the guy driving his wife. And you had to read six paragraphs down to find out that he was wanted for a homicide beef. Now, that would seem like something that would lead and actually be in the headline, but they don't - - they don't inform their viewers. And they're doing the same thing. Now that it's found out that this person is allegedly here illegally, this has now dropped off the top row of a lot of cable news networks and a lot of newspapers.

They take -- look at this grabbing this woman, taking her to safety and that's what all our great men and women do in uniform every single day. They run into harm's way instead of away from it. And that's why it's so very important when you see a police officer, appreciate what they do and their spouses and their families. There's no ordinary day for a police officer.",

And a girl in Iowa murdered pales in importance when compared to tax evasion, because if you talk about Mollie, you can't talk about the things that the media thinks is important. To the press, your sorrow over a young woman's death is got to be political. And that hush money among adults is more harmful to society than a brutal killing. The media is obsessed with Manafort and Cohen -- victimless, gotcha crimes. But for most Americans, we know a true victim when we see her. It ain't the IRS or Stormy. And so we're smeared for thinking murder matters more than a bad 1040. So maybe we need to help the media find equivalencies. Let me ask you dear media: How many Mollies is a Mike Cohen worth? The answer: As many as it takes to undo an election and the facts be damned."

Obama's White House knew about him but ignored it even as the Nazi's Jewish neighbors called him out. Then we had an election and Trump, using ICE, deported him. So without ICE, we'd have at least one Nazi on the loose. If this is the first time you've heard of these stories, I get it. These days, you stick to the story you want to tell, which is why to some, Mollie Tibbetts is just some girl in Iowa. To be fair, I want to run this apology from the Fordham Professor Christine Greer who said -- apologized on twitter. It's a non-apology, but let's run it anyway. She said, yesterday, I've said something flippant that was unintended. Mollie Tibbetts was a promising young woman who lost her life. My hope is that her family will find peace and justice. And that her murder is not used to justify a discriminatory immigration policy. Dana, from a public relations perspective, she probably could have stopped that apology when it mattered."

Why would her brother, why would Kate Steinle's brother say that? Because what you see is that people use this for their own purpose. And Trump's case, he's using this to distract and to deceive people in terms of the big news of the day, which is about the Michael Cohen plea deal, about Paul Manafort being convicted. I mean, at this point, you have the president's personal lawyer, his campaign chairman, his national security advisor, all convicted felons. And, oh, no, instead, we want to talk about a murder.

There's two levels to the story, I think. One, how many dead people are we going to tolerate in this country without solving the immigration problem? We have to have stricter borders. We can't have sanctuary. And we have to do something where you have to be able to verify the people that are in here. Now, on the other hand, the media does not report these stories honestly. And if you look at this one and the other ones that you've mentioned up there, they're misinforming the audience. They're not informing. I looked at that story about the arrest, about the guy driving his wife. And you had to read six paragraphs down to find out that he was wanted for a homicide beef. Now, that would seem like something that would lead and actually be in the headline, but they don't - - they don't inform their viewers. And they're doing the same thing. Now that it's found out that this person is allegedly here illegally, this has now dropped off the top row of a lot of cable news networks and a lot of newspapers. And it's a shame because the American people need to understand the facts about these things so they can elect politicians who can then solve problems."

That's what the right says. So, here I say, today, and you have one woman who was sadly, tragically killed in Iowa, and you guys want to start talking about immigration."

So, is he thinking about pardoning this man? Oh, because it's politically convenient and he knows Paul Manafort who was his campaign. And then you think, oh, he's out there damning Michael Cohen because he thinks Cohen may have additional facts that could be problematic for this president.

And if you want to encourage Republicans to get out and vote in the midterms, you will keep on this nonsense about impeachment. I saw one Democrat suggest forget impeachment, go for the indictment, even though there's this -- you can't indict a sitting president. Some people think that that is an open question that should be taken to the Supreme Court.

And because of what I said earlier, you know, you cannot link the president back to this. First of all, it has nothing to do with Russia. You've got some guy, Michael Cohen, saying I'd take a bullet for Trump. Then next, he's going after the President of the United States. So he has zero credibility. They would have to have credible, substantial, independent information to corroborate anything Cohen says. I think, like you said, for Mueller to even write an impeachment memo, it's just not there.

And they do win the house, there may be a move to impeach. And to say, you know, we're going to run in 2020 against an impeached incumbent gives the Democrats some, you know, political credibility there. And it's harmful to the president, I think, politically to be impeached. But, you know, it will also, maybe, hurt the economy a little bit and undermine his credibility as the commander-in-chief when he goes abroad. But, I just don't see it happening. Independents don't believe this is a high crime. Republicans, obviously, don't believe this is an impeachable offense. I don't think there's an appetite in the country for this. The story is probably going to fizzle out in a few days.
