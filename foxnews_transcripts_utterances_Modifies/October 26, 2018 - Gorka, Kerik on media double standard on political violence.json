In moments, we're going to tell you what we know about this deranged individual.  Plus, we are now on day four of what is the media's shameful attempt to connect President Trump, Fox News, talk radio, even me, to those horrible actions of a mad man.  And coming up, we're going to take on the left wings smear merchants.  We'll call out their hypocrisy and respond to all of this outright slander.  Now, once again, the left is trying to score cheap political points in the victory by vilifying all Trump supporters. It's beyond disgusting.  And also tonight, we have a very important update on the migrant caravan and we are only 11 days away until the all-important midterm elections. So, stay tuned, buckle up, it is time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

We have carried out a far- reaching federal, state, and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events. These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country. No place.   I have instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense in finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice. We must never allow political violence to take root in America. We cannot let it happen. I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it, and to stop it now.",

      "sentences": "Amen.   And tonight, federal officials, they are continuing their important investigation, but thanks to their hard work, their dedication, their determination, here's what we know about the suspect. His name: Cesar Sayoc. Now, he's a middle aged Florida resident with an extremely long criminal track record, including multiple counts of theft, drug charges, illicit steroid use and much more. He's even charged with making a bomb threat back in 2002 and throughout his life, Sayoc has accumulated dozens of felony and misdemeanor charges, and he reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2012 when he lived with his mother. Now, his van was covered with dozens of bizarre bumper stickers, including many that were derogatory, some threatening to Democrats. His multiple social media accounts were equally odd, very disturbing. As you can see, this is the picture of an irrational man who is deeply, deeply troubled.  Like the president said, we want anybody, anybody responsible for this heinous bomb scare to be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law.  If Sayoc is found guilty, he should go to prison for an extremely long period of time. These actions are deplorable and inexcusable. There is no room for political violence in this country. We solve our problems, like in 11 days, at the ballot box. And as I have said many times, this is a very serious story but over the course of this week, what we have seen, what we have witnessed, in the mainstream media and the left, has been downright disgraceful. Before ever even knowing who was responsible for this heinous act, the media started playing the blame game, rushing to judgment as usual. They put facts last.  They rushed to judgment and they did anything and everything possible to link President Trump and anyone who supports him to this act of terrorism.  Even the graphics on fake news CNN blaming Trump, calling the would-be bomb victim, quote, Trump's targets. Trump's targets, believe it or not, the vitriol was far worse on air.  Now, watch from just the past 24 hours, it should make your heart, well, sink.",

But de Niro is not like the others, right? Why Robert de Niro? Well, one of the things I found rose, October 15th, Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting de Niro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things, in which he said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil. So, that all of a sudden becomes Trump -- Robert de Niro's calling the president a devil and us devil worshipers in effect, you know? It's playing the victim card, but it was top of mind 10 days ago.

We have been warning you, Rand Paul has been warning you, something horrible is going to happen. It doesn't matter if it's left or right. But the left's silence when it's their side has been deafening and worse. And some elected officials actually sent out marching orders to harass, intimidate cabinet officials, elected officials, and candidates. White powder mailed to the president, President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mattis, FBI Director Wray, CIA Director Haspel, that's just three weeks ago. The president's son who was also targeted with a suspicious package, Don Jr.'s ex-wife hospitalized because of that package.  A truck with a Trump bumper sticker, that was set on fire. You have two Republican candidates in Minnesota were punched. One, a woman, another, a man, with severe injuries, he's cold cocked from beyond, six weeks, bad concussion. Republican campaign manager in Nevada that he was assaulted. There were dozens more incidents of vandalism, assault, harassment, including top Republicans stalked in airports, run out of restaurants repeatedly. We've shown you this videotape. Now, while we constantly condemn acts of violence on both sides of the aisle, when something happens to a conservative, Democrats have been missing in action, noticeably silent. We're going to have a lot more on this throughout the show. But first, more big news in the looming crisis at our southern border tonight. The migrant caravan continues to move north, even as we speak.  Defense Secretary Mattis just approved a request to send even more troops to the border. Now at least 800 soldiers have officially being dispatched to bolster to efforts of our border patrol agents. President Trump recently told the migrants and the caravan, said it again tonight, turn back. And now, he is reportedly mulling an executive order to bar entry of all migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, which he has the authority to do. We're going to keep you posted as this situation continues to unfold. But, first, we get back to the top story. Joining us now is FOX News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka and former NYC Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Welcome, both of you. Congrats on your book, \"Why We Fight,\" a bestseller, Dr. Gorka.  Bernie, from day one, you said they catch and you thought between 48 and 72 hours, you were dead on the mark.

What the media has done in every single one of these, and this, of course, is attached to the American left, and some liberals, certainly the Democrat Party, is to use these incredibly important issues against us, to twist them, not report them as they truly exist, and to use them to simply politically, every single thing they see is through the prism of this dynamic of trying to destroy one man because they simply can't stand the fact that they lost an election. Now, for the American people, as we come up to the midterms, and this is why it's gotten more absurd by the moment, is to not be duped when they hear these things. And this is the problem for regular liberals, the regular base, when there is something perhaps that the media needs to address with the federal national government, perhaps the president, no one will take them seriously because they have beclowned themselves in addition to harming everyone across the board, all of these issues are -- you know, they transcend politics. They are nonpartisan. And yet, this is with the media has done, destroying their own industry while at the same time harming every American who cares about violent crime. These are criminals. This guy arrested for the mail bombs, he's a career criminal. They will always find an excuse, as was the man who did the GOP shooting at the baseball diamond. He had a history of domestic violence, assaulting his daughter, his foster daughter. These are people who will find an excuse to exact their violence, has really ultimately nothing to do with politics, and everything to do with violent individuals who, in the midst of 350 million people in this country, it is remarkable that so few people in fact act in this matter as they view it through a political prism.

Walk straight, the Americans will let you in, there's no way that they can stop you. They've been trained on what to say to our asylum through to get to our asylum process. So something had to be done. This is the reason the Guatemalan government under President Morales, this is the reason why the Mexican government right now, why President Trump is being so tough on them and saying look, you need to turn these people around. We are not going to let them into our country this way. There is a process to coming into the country legally and we are not going to allow our border to run over. Period.",

We must never allow political violence to take root in America. We cannot let it happen. I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it, and to stop it now."

      "utterance": "Cesar Sayoc. Now, he's a middle aged Florida resident with an extremely long criminal track record, including multiple counts of theft, drug charges, illicit steroid use and much more. He's even charged with making a bomb threat back in 2002 and throughout his life, Sayoc has accumulated dozens of felony and misdemeanor charges, and he reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2012 when he lived with his mother. Now, his van was covered with dozens of bizarre bumper stickers, including many that were derogatory, some threatening to Democrats. His multiple social media accounts were equally odd, very disturbing. As you can see, this is the picture of an irrational man who is deeply, deeply troubled. Like the president said, we want anybody, anybody responsible for this heinous bomb scare to be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law.  If Sayoc is found guilty, he should go to prison for an extremely long period of time. These actions are deplorable and inexcusable. There is no room for political violence in this country. We solve our problems, like in 11 days, at the ballot box. And as I have said many times, this is a very serious story but over the course of this week, what we have seen, what we have witnessed, in the mainstream media and the left, has been downright disgraceful. Before ever even knowing who was responsible for this heinous act, the media started playing the blame game, rushing to judgment as usual. They put facts last.  They rushed to judgment and they did anything and everything possible to link President Trump and anyone who supports him to this act of terrorism. Even the graphics on fake news CNN blaming Trump, calling the would-be bomb victim, quote, Trump's targets. Trump's targets, believe it or not, the vitriol was far worse on air.  Now, watch from just the past 24 hours, it should make your heart, well, sink."

Well, one of the things I found rose, October 15th, Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting de Niro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things, in which he said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil. So, that all of a sudden becomes Trump -- Robert de Niro's calling the president a devil and us devil worshipers in effect, you know? It's playing the victim card, but it was top of mind 10 days ago.

We have been warning you, Rand Paul has been warning you, something horrible is going to happen. It doesn't matter if it's left or right. But the left's silence when it's their side has been deafening and worse. And some elected officials actually sent out marching orders to harass, intimidate cabinet officials, elected officials, and candidates. White powder mailed to the president, President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mattis, FBI Director Wray, CIA Director Haspel, that's just three weeks ago. The president's son who was also targeted with a suspicious package, Don Jr.'s ex-wife hospitalized because of that package. A truck with a Trump bumper sticker, that was set on fire. You have two Republican candidates in Minnesota were punched. One, a woman, another, a man, with severe injuries, he's cold cocked from beyond, six weeks, bad concussion. Republican campaign manager in Nevada that he was assaulted. There were dozens more incidents of vandalism, assault, harassment, including top Republicans stalked in airports, run out of restaurants repeatedly. We've shown you this videotape. Now, while we constantly condemn acts of violence on both sides of the aisle, when something happens to a conservative, Democrats have been missing in action, noticeably silent. We're going to have a lot more on this throughout the show. But first, more big news in the looming crisis at our southern border tonight. The migrant caravan continues to move north, even as we speak.  Defense Secretary Mattis just approved a request to send even more troops to the border. Now at least 800 soldiers have officially being dispatched to bolster to efforts of our border patrol agents. President Trump recently told the migrants and the caravan, said it again tonight, turn back. And now, he is reportedly mulling an executive order to bar entry of all migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, which he has the authority to do. We're going to keep you posted as this situation continues to unfold. But, first, we get back to the top story. Joining us now is FOX News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka and former NYC Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Welcome, both of you. Congrats on your book, \"Why We Fight,\" a bestseller, Dr. Gorka. Bernie, from day one, you said they catch and you thought between 48 and 72 hours, you were dead on the mark.

There may be material that could be explosive, which is what the FBI director may be talking about. And, keep in mind, Sean, for charging instruments in DOJ, by a U.S. attorney, they want to make sure that the elements are there for a crime for them to charge this guy.

What the media has done in every single one of these, and this, of course, is attached to the American left, and some liberals, certainly the Democrat Party, is to use these incredibly important issues against us, to twist them, not report them as they truly exist, and to use them to simply politically, every single thing they see is through the prism of this dynamic of trying to destroy one man because they simply can't stand the fact that they lost an election. Now, for the American people, as we come up to the midterms, and this is why it's gotten more absurd by the moment, is to not be duped when they hear these things. And this is the problem for regular liberals, the regular base, when there is something perhaps that the media needs to address with the federal national government, perhaps the president, no one will take them seriously because they have beclowned themselves in addition to harming everyone across the board, all of these issues are -- you know, they transcend politics. They are nonpartisan. And yet, this is with the media has done, destroying their own industry while at the same time harming every American who cares about violent crime. These are criminals. This guy arrested for the mail bombs, he's a career criminal. They will always find an excuse, as was the man who did the GOP shooting at the baseball diamond. He had a history of domestic violence, assaulting his daughter, his foster daughter. These are people who will find an excuse to exact their violence, has really ultimately nothing to do with politics, and everything to do with violent individuals who, in the midst of 350 million people in this country, it is remarkable that so few people in fact act in this matter as they view it through a political prism.

And you're not a doctor, you're not a psychologist so how do you know these things? But let me get back to that chyron for a second, Sean, if don't mind. You know, with John King and the chyron is obviously the headline that you see in your screen on the news. One of them was Trump has no plans to bear any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber. That assumes a lot, doesn't it? And we've seen this movie before and what's frustrating for the American people at home that don't trust the media, and many of them don't is that our media doesn't learn from the mistakes.

They feel that they've window to where they can change and create the narrative. And of course, once again, they misunderstand what the American people want. They certainly are disconnected with who we are and how we view this.

Joining us the bestselling author of \"The Russian Hoax\" the number one New York Times bestseller, \"The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\" Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Also, Fox News investigative reporter contributor Sara Carter. She just got back from Guatemala during an exclusive investigation of the caravan. I'm also hearing with the military been set up on the border that their plans too are to create barriers of some kind as quickly as possible in case there is some type of rush on the border. Sara?"

It's very dangerous. It is an enormous problem, but the military is also there to conduct logistics. Remember our resources even though they've grown over the recent years they are limited. Border patrol, ICE is overwhelmed. And with this mass of people coming over it's going to be a potentially big problem. Speaking to sources both in ICE, as well as border patrol over the last few days there's a reason why the president wants to initiate or find a way to kind of halt this asylum process. There's been a big problem with credible fear application where they've been prospecting people through over the last eight years and not even questioning some of the circumstances around their credible fear."

What's interesting to me, Gregg Jarrett is the silence on the left. All Democrats it's been deafening on this. We know they want to eliminate ICE, they want open borders, they don't want the wall built, we know that part, and they want sanctuary cities and states, but their silence is deafening. Let's talk also, legally, though, the president has the authority on every aspect of this--"

You're right, Sean, to point out we don't know who these people are individually. They may have criminal records. Some of them may be armed. So, the president has the absolute legal authority to order troops down there and they are logistical support, as Sara pointed out, the president would be derelict in his duty as constitutional authority if he didn't do this. There the pictures right here going through the fence. There are other pictures that are even more graphic. This is what they are threatening to do to the United States."

Remember, Sean, I was down there interviewing them. These people one, had been lied to, some of them. Others were part of this movement because they had been bust in by groups by leftist groups in Honduras and by people who said look, this is your chance. Walk straight, the Americans will let you in, there's no way that they can stop you. They've been trained on what to say to our asylum through to get to our asylum process. So something had to be done. This is the reason the Guatemalan government under President Morales, this is the reason why the Mexican government right now, why President Trump is being so tough on them and saying look, you need to turn these people around. We are not going to let them into our country this way. There is a process to coming into the country legally and we are not going to allow our border to run over. Period."

Some of these women have already been trampled, some of the children have already been trampled in these rushes, they've been putting the women and children in the front of these line. This is mostly men. So, people are already being hurt, nobody should be supporting this type of organized type of movement.

He's up by two in the latest poll and Ron DeSantis for governor. But I think Marsha Blackburn will win Tennessee, I hope. I don't think Claire McCaskill is going back to the Senate. We caught on tape lying to the people of Missouri about who she really is. We see the same in your adjacent state and Krysten Sinema. I mean it's OK to join the Taliban. I can't imagine the people of Arizona voting for that. Heidi Heitkamp I think is a pickup, a possible pickup in Montana.

I think that the big issue is what you were talking about before is what kind of country we're going to be. The way we respect elections or do we destroy a conservative candidate no holds barred and call that an honorable endeavor. Your pocketbook is an issue, your safe is an issue, but how Kavanaugh is an issue. All I can say is if you really were disgusted by what happened to this fine man destroying at all cost you got a chance to send a signal they will never stop this until they lose.

What we've noticed for the first time in the first 19, 20 months of the Trump presidency. His numbers are starting to move in Nevada. He stayed pretty consistent, 47, 48 percent per approval. He is above 50 percent now. When he jumped and I'm just telling you within the last 30 days you're starting to see Trump movement and that's helping all of us."
