The migrant caravan growing in size by the hour, one Mexican newspaper puts the number at a whopping 14,000 tonight. We're going to get exclusive reaction from the very people who defend our border throughout this hour. Plus, President Trump just wrapped a lively rally, raucous rally, actually, in support of Ted Cruz. We sent our own Raymond Arroyo down to Houston to speak with the attendees, a lot of them lined up outside for hours. You do not want to miss what they say about this traveling band of, well, asylum-seekers. And another story we're following tonight, Senator Cory Booker facing this strange sexual assault allegation, but it comes from an anonymous twitter user who writes this long letter. We examine how believe everyone could seriously backfire on the Democrats. But first, mobile mob highlight Democrats tone deafness as Trump, the closer, electrifies on the stump.  That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  Just as in 2016, there is no politician in America today who has a better read on what the voters want than Donald Trump.",

Also, a train of pack animals. Secondary, a group of vehicles traveling together as in a file. A covered wagon or motor vehicle equipped as traveling living quarters. It doesn't really work, does it, for what we're seeing here. The word caravan colloquially connotes something kind of fun, festive, desirable.

Mexican police were also badly injured. Legitimate seekers of asylum, they must live incredible fear of government repression based on religious, racial or ethnic identity. Home country violence and government corruption, as terrible as they are, and whether it's in Central America or anywhere else, are not sufficient basis for asylum, nor is the desire just to get a better job or live a better life. Less, we, in the United States be willing to welcome in hundreds of millions of people from across the globe, all on the U.S. taxpayer.  So who are these migrants? Well, according to a Mexican newspaper, it's 14,000, the number, up from the initial 1600 just last week. They're mostly working age males. A far smaller number of women and children, usually see them out in front. Many have friends and/or family already in the United States, many of those illegal. Of course, they're impoverished with little to no English speaking skills at all. They're from Honduras, Guatemala, and many from Mexico. Others we don't know where they're from and it's undetermined how many have documents at all. How many have health problems or even criminal records.

And when you see the amount of individuals that are doing at this time, it's nothing else but an invasion by individuals into our country and it needs to stop, and we need to do the right measures to go out there and stop it. When you're talking about the immigration issues and there's laws, what happens is these individuals will step on U.S. soil, they will check the records, and once we (INAUDIBLE) there's nothing of a bad record within the United States. Keep in mind, we can't check the record in the country that they're coming from. What happens is they're giving an immigration date which they don't plan on showing up to because statistics show that less than 2 percent actually show up to these dates.

John Kennedy banned the New York Herald Tribune because he didn't like its Republican editorial policy.

In other words, well, they'd stay in Mexico. On Friday, Mexico began registering hundreds of migrants, but most just burst past the barricades in flagrant violation of the law. Mexican police were also badly injured. Legitimate seekers of asylum, they must live incredible fear of government repression based on religious, racial or ethnic identity. Home country violence and government corruption, as terrible as they are, and whether it's in Central America or anywhere else, are not sufficient basis for asylum, nor is the desire just to get a better job or live a better life. Less, we, in the United States be willing to welcome in hundreds of millions of people from across the globe, all on the U.S. taxpayer. So who are these migrants? Well, according to a Mexican newspaper, it's 14,000, the number, up from the initial 1600 just last week. They're mostly working age males. A far smaller number of women and children, usually see them out in front. Many have friends and/or family already in the United States, many of those illegal. Of course, they're impoverished with little to no English speaking skills at all. They're from Honduras, Guatemala, and many from Mexico. Others we don't know where they're from and it's undetermined how many have documents at all. How many have health problems or even criminal records.

My family, my ancestors are immigrants. These people are trying to enter the United States by force. You've seen the way, the pictures, you've seen the video. When you're kicking down gates to get into a country, when you're entering illegally, when you're trying to avoid inspection and, also, when you're waving the flag of the country that supposedly has you so oppressed, how was that something that's beneficial for the United States? It isn't. These individuals, I've said it before many times, there is a humongous difference between knocking on my front door and/or kicking my front door and forcing entry into my home. And when you see the amount of individuals that are doing at this time, it's nothing else but an invasion by individuals into our country and it needs to stop, and we need to do the right measures to go out there and stop it. When you're talking about the immigration issues and there's laws, what happens is these individuals will step on U.S. soil, they will check the records, and once we (INAUDIBLE) there's nothing of a bad record within the United States. Keep in mind, we can't check the record in the country that they're coming from. What happens is they're giving an immigration date which they don't plan on showing up to because statistics show that less than 2 percent actually show up to these dates. And then they're free to be within the United States with no checks whatsoever. This is a humongous problem. These are not immigrants entering our country. These are individuals that are invading our country and something needs to be done about it."

But the framers and the founders saw the broadsheets -- and by the way, they hated them at the time. They hated the broadsheets. Jefferson and Franklin and Washington all wrote about how they hated the newspapers of the era, the broadsheets and the pamphleteers. But they saw them as a valuable ally of the people against the government. And it worked for basically 200 years. You know, Lincoln imprisoned newspaper editors who criticized his conduct during the civil war. Roosevelt complained about them. John Kennedy banned the New York Herald Tribune because he didn't like its Republican editorial policy. But they were basically fulfilling their constitutional obligation, which was to be against the government.  Now you have a situation where they're align in a far different manner and they're basically arguing against the rule of law and against, you know, for whatever you want to call it, but they're not behaving the way they were constitutionally mandated to do so."

To weigh in on that we're joined by Citizens United president, Fox News contributor, Dave Bossie, coauthor of the best seller, let Trump be Trump, along with former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn.

In fact, it should be taken very seriously and could alter it.  I revised my house number down from 45 to 37 in the last two weeks, and part of that is Democrat 37, Democratic pickups, because most of it is because of this. I think it weakens our chance of taking the senate because it mobilizes and energizes the Trump base. This is their number one issue. This couldn't have been scripted better for Republicans as if they planned it or something. This is -- is something the Democrats should be very concerned about. That said, I think that the Democratic base is very motivated to get out and vote in this election.

I agree, though, and Dave Bossie, with what Chris Hahn said, this is a loser for Democrats.

They really came from all over the United States. But think of that. To get on a plane, to come in for the day just to hear the president. It tells us something about the excitement out there and the energy. And let me tell you, when the president started talking about these border issues, the chants of \"build the wall\" went up, and they were deafening. It was amazing to be in that room, I have to tell you."

You heard some of them at the top in those spots, where they said, wait, I came in legally. I waited. We got sponsors. We had to get people to sponsor us. We needed jobs and a place to live. We went through hearings. We can't just have people crashing the border. For them it's extremely personal, and to hear that this, this sort of breaks against the narrative, totally cuts against the narrative we are hearing in the media that Latinos want open borders or relaxation in those border policies. Quite the opposite I found here. And again, these Latinos were from all over the southwest and the south. They weren't just Texans. But that was the big take away. That and a call for unity, Laura.  They want unity. They want the country to come back together. That was fascinating."

But Dan Patrick has said consistently that not only is he tough, and Greg Abbott, the governor, on immigration and the border, but they get a disproportionate percentage of Hispanic voters because they are growing the economy, the low taxes in Texas, tough on crime, and he said, Laura, this issue works. We can expand the base of the Republican party. I think Dan Patrick is 100 percent right and Trump has demonstrated that. The question is, Raymond, who is beyond Trump? Who was after Trump?"

But please Laura, let's not compare this -- he's accusing Cory Booker, but please, let's not compare this person with Professor Ford, who came out, who spoke. Whatever, he's making an accusation. He's accusing.  I will give them free representation, because I don't believe it. It's a smear campaign."

We are talking about a sitting senator who just a couple of weeks ago in the Kavanaugh context talked about how all accusers should be heard and should be believed. In this case it should be relatively easy to investigate, right? The accuser is saying that this alleged incident happened just a couple of years ago, not 40 years ago like with Kavanaugh.  And there should be witnesses whether or not they can place the two gentlemen together in the same place. We should either be able to verify this or not pretty easily. But by Cory Booker's own standards, this must be investigated."

I felt like they were selling knives it got so ridiculous. I will throw in a set of Tupperware. It was the most ridiculous thing. Our point is I don't like it when people do this kind of stuff. I believe it is a smear. If you're going to make an accusation -- this is a, supposedly a man making an accusation that something happened in a bathroom. If you're going to make that kind of accusation you better put your name to it. Our point is a simple one."

We have major media outlets during Kavanaugh rolling when this anonymous stuff, and you had people like Cory Booker out there tarring Brett Kavanaugh because of the mountain of evidence which ended up being nothing, and the American people are reacting. I've got to get to Avenatti, though, because this kind of relates somewhat because he was out there during Kavanaugh. Avenatti now has been -- has suffered two embarrassing court losses earlier today. One ordered him to pay $4.85 million to a former lawyer who argued he was underpaid, and then shortly after another judge ruled that his staff and he were to be evicted from their offices for not paying rent for four months. Monica, Avenatti characteristically says it's false and fraudulent, and he doesn't owe anything."

In fact, his sector has apprehended 229 Bangladeshi national since the start of fiscal year 2018. Joining us now to discuss is Chief Jason Owens of Laredo sector border patrol. Chief Owens, does the president have it right about our not knowing what type of folks might be trying to infiltrate a mobile mob like this? I hate calling it a caravan, that's too festive.

That's why the men and women that are out there on the border patrol patrolling the border each and every day, putting their life on the line to keep this country and its people safe, need that personnel, technology, and infrastructure.
