Big time Hollywood celebs making a mockery of COVID rules at the Super Bowl, frolicking around the big game maskless without a care in the world while students in the same state are punished and forced to cover up inside and outside of their classrooms. The NFL warning fans beforehand to comply with all L.A. County health and safety protocols. Masks were given out at the big game, but few of the more than 70,000 fans were seen wearing them. Repeat offender, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti once again holding his breath, allegedly, after he got caught maskless yet again in this photo. It all begs the question, when will all Democrats finally give up on mandates that their biggest supporters keep breaking? It doesn't sound like President Biden will be coming around. He says opposing mask mandates isn't about freedom.",

A lot of do as I say, not as I do kind of stuff because you have 70,000 people shoulder to shoulder screaming inside and then you can't have 12 children inside without a mask on? It makes no sense. The only reason kids still have to wear masks is because they don't have lawyers and TV shows. If they did, obviously this wouldn't happen. I have a new thing what I do with masks. I don't carry one out. I don't think anybody here does but when you don't carry one out and you go into a store and then they hassle you and you said, put a mask on, you said, I don't have one, sorry. And they either slink away or they give you a free mask, so then you put the free mask on and then as you leave you just take it off and you drop it in the wastebasket and you walk out.

We talked about the numbers. The number 80 percent more have one dose, 65 percent are two-dosed, 43 percent of people who are eligible to be boosted are boosted. A year ago, I wasn't vaccinated. I think I get fully vaccinated until the beginning of April. So the conversation today versus a year ago is far different. And now politicians and public health experts are really -- not dueling -- as much as trying to reconcile things. I think it would be people. We've said on this show before, Greg, you said it a few weeks ago, that it will eventually be the people who will push the politicians and push our health experts to tell us when and where -- I should say go faster in how they are doing things. Now with kids, my kids -- my kids are now vaccinated, I have a six-year-old and an eight-year-old. I feel far more comfortable going out, being out, being social, knowing that if I do go home, if I somewhere chance transmit something, and my kids are not going to have -- likely not going to be hospitalized. But 12 states, blue states, loosening these mandates and restrictions, I think it's a positive thing and I think everybody should take a victory lap, President Trump and President Biden.",

We're all about freedom. We are also seeing a new kind of virtue signaling here, which is I can do what I please as long as we tell -- I tell the children to mask up. Then I -- that's my job.

Big time Hollywood celebs making a mockery of COVID rules at the Super Bowl, frolicking around the big game maskless without a care in the world while students in the same state are punished and forced to cover up inside and outside of their classrooms. The NFL warning fans beforehand to comply with all L.A. County health and safety protocols. Masks were given out at the big game, but few of the more than 70,000 fans were seen wearing them. Repeat offender, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti once again holding his breath, allegedly, after he got caught maskless yet again in this photo. It all begs the question, when will all Democrats finally give up on mandates that their biggest supporters keep breaking? It doesn't sound like President Biden will be coming around.

A lot of do as I say, not as I do kind of stuff because you have 70,000 people shoulder to shoulder screaming inside and then you can't have 12 children inside without a mask on? It makes no sense. The only reason kids still have to wear masks is because they don't have lawyers and TV shows. If they did, obviously this wouldn't happen. I have a new thing what I do with masks. I don't carry one out. I don't think anybody here does but when you don't carry one out and you go into a store and then they hassle you and you said, put a mask on, you said, I don't have one, sorry. And they either slink away or they give you a free mask, so then you put the free mask on and then as you leave you just take it off and you drop it in the wastebasket and you walk out.

We talked about the numbers. The number 80 percent more have one dose, 65 percent are two-dosed, 43 percent of people who are eligible to be boosted are boosted. A year ago, I wasn't vaccinated. I think I get fully vaccinated until the beginning of April. So the conversation today versus a year ago is far different. And now politicians and public health experts are really -- not dueling -- as much as trying to reconcile things. I think it would be people. We've said on this show before, Greg, you said it a few weeks ago, that it will eventually be the people who will push the politicians and push our health experts to tell us when and where -- I should say go faster in how they are doing things. Now with kids, my kids -- my kids are now vaccinated, I have a six-year-old and an eight-year-old. I feel far more comfortable going out, being out, being social, knowing that if I do go home, if I somewhere chance transmit something, and my kids are not going to have -- likely not going to be hospitalized. But 12 states, blue states, loosening these mandates and restrictions, I think it's a positive thing and I think everybody should take a victory lap, President Trump and President Biden."

You see the president and the media redefining the idea of freedom that in a weird way when so many talks about freedom, for example, the truckers, it is something like a dog whistle for anti-vaxxers or even fascism you should be really -- be very wary of anybody who talks too much about freedom, which is bizarre coming from an American president. We're all about freedom. We are also seeing a new kind of virtue signaling here, which is I can do what I please as long as we tell -- I tell the children to mask up. Then I -- that's my job. That's -- every governor and every mayor in every liberal city has been doing this. It's not famous actresses who have really bad reputations say but I care about climate change so I can still be an absolute jerk.

To frame him as being a Russian operative, a Putin puppet and if you recall, the damage here is unbelievable. We've never seen anything like this and America was torn for four years, we were at each other's throats because Hillary Clinton, her campaign, hired people to try to make a connection between a server in the Trump tower and one in a Russian bank that's connected to Putin. I mean, this is outrageous, and you know, this woman who's always smiling and, you know, is like, you know, I -- Donald Trump is evil and I am the great salvation, the truth is she's been through more criminal -- quasi criminal activities from erasing 33,000 e-mails, that many of them classified, said she never had a classified e-mail on her laptop or her iPhone when she was the secretary of state, and she's got all of these problems and now they're getting to the guts of it.

Her husband has been Me- Tooed and has been fingered to be on Epstein's island and you know the foundation was, you know, that's just a washed-up money laundering operation. This is what happened. She paid people to hack into Trump's computers and frame him for being a Russian traitor! That would be like paying someone to break into Trump tower at 2 o'clock in the morning, plant a bunch of guns and drugs and Russian documents and then call the FBI and say hey guys, I got a tip, why don't you go raid the tower. That's the same thing. And we now know too that this was happening as far back as 2014. The CIA knew crooked was trying to frame him, they briefed Obama that Hillary was going to frame him. They briefed the FBI that this was a frame job so Mueller was just a cleanup operation to tee up the impeachment and it failed. So, it's not -- I think, you know, Greg was being fictitious I think, but when you look about January 6th and then you look at this, what did more damage? I mean, think about how many people's lives were destroyed, how it divided the country, how it made us question our democracy --"

Police arresting the perp, who was hiding under her bed. It turns out he's a career criminal with three open cases against him. A lot to unpack here, Dana. These cases, it's unbelievable. Greg and I were talking about this in the green room, why we are unable to -- this bail reform thing has to stop. This guy should not be on the streets if he is violent, if he's been accused of violent things.

You can't divorce it. I couldn't believe that last week in the State Assembly in New York, they're actually having a debate that bail reform is actually very good. And Eric Adams is pulling what's left of his hair out to try to get them to pay attention. I think the squat is about to cause a lot more problems for Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats. Because if you think about the things that they said that they were going to demand and to get, they haven't gotten any of those voting rights. No, they didn't get anything in the Build Back Better Plan, especially all those climate material -- climate provisions that they wanted. They don't have -- the fact that they don't have to swallow their pride and vote for the infrastructure bill knowing that they were probably not going to end up getting all the other things that they wanted.

Asian, it's always Asian. The murder weapon, not a gun. It's a knife, just like the murder victim in California. How many of these do we need to have before we get to say it's an epidemic. He had been arrested multiple times with 27 counts of criminal mischief. He'd been -- he'd hit somebody on the subway. So, the conclusion is, in order to lock up the perpetrator, you have to let them kill a young Asian woman first. And then they'll go, oh, my God, this is repulsive. There is an anti-Asian movement going on and it's not the murders alone, it's the distinct lack of coverage about it. It's the dog not barking. It's the silence around these crimes. They're making me think there's something to this that's not just about the lone maniac, or else we would be all over this stuff. I want to see -- I want to see an electrified Asian leadership get out there and just get pissed off and do something about this. Because if they don't do -- it's already been treated like a new normal. It's like a weekly occurrence. It's like -- it's because the community isn't amplifying the crime, right? It's like -- it's like, what if they amplified the crime the way George Floyd was amplified, where you just played the video over and over again?

Now that they realize that their power is -- may be pulled back because Americans are fed up with their nonsense, they're going to say, oh, that's not really our cause. Well, you're full of crap and you always have been. Here's the bottom line. The criminals are taking over our cities, and no one is standing up for us. We are all left to defend ourselves and take care of ourselves. I don't want to see any more of the Kyle Rittenhouses, but I'm telling you, there will be more of them. And there will be people who will be attacked, Greg. No one will talk about them. It's like kids wearing masks. They don't vote, so no one really cares.
