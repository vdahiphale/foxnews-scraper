Four-and-a-half-hours away from \"Monday Night Football,\" and it could be one for the books, because at 8:30 p.m. Eastern time, in Glendale, Arizona, the Arizona Cardinals are taking on Jerry Jones' Dallas Cowboys. Jerry Jones, of course, famous for saying he likes his players to respect the flag, not a fan of Colin Kaepernick last kneeling out the national anthem, say to FBN a little more than a week ago, \"It is not the place to do anything than honor the flag and everybody that has given up a little more for it.\"  They will be tested tonight. Jones, of course, has read the riot act that his players all toe the line here. And the line seems to be, no matter what the president of the United States says and whether he agitates you or not, despite other owners locking arms with you, I shall not.  If you do buck this, what happens?  To Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino on the growing pressure to toe the line or buck it. What do you think, bud?",

What we have been reporting on FOX Business all day, it's a column I have done for FoxBusiness.com, is that the demographics of the average football fan is against this. If you look at the demographics, because, remember, this whole controversy started out essentially with Donald Trump attacking in kind of a crude way, I would say, the protests, the knees during -- taking the knee during the anthem.  If you look at the demographic of the average football fan, it's an income of $100,000 a year or less. Race is a part of this, we have to admit, and most football fans, the vast majority, 67 to 70 percent of them are white. Many are in the military. Many are male.   And it is a Donald Trump demographic. It's a demographic that doesn't like what is going on. Jerry Jones smells that, and he knows that this is an issue that the people who are paying the bills, the people that consume the advertising, the people that buy the merchandise, the people that watch the TV, the people that go to the stadiums, for the most part, they object to this.",

She said, listen, the president can manage White House messaging on a variety of topics at the very same time, be that tax reform, health care reform, or in this particular case the national anthem and standing for the flag. In fact, he took to Twitter to say as much in a very simple tweet and it read simply: \"#Standforouranthem\"  Now, of course, that was a reaction to the numerous NFL players who chose to kneel down during national anthem during the games over the weekend in protest, at least in theory now, of the president's previous comments at a rally in Alabama last week in which he suggested, and a little blue language, I should add there, that NFL owners should fire players who disrespect the flag.  But, clearly, there's been plenty of criticism, as you point out, Neil, that as the president sort of drives the news cycle, whether it be by way of Twitter or an off-the-cuff comment, he doesn't have the laser-like focus on the pressing issues facing the White House.  That has been the criticism, be that tax reform or maybe what is going on in Puerto Rico, for example, but that is also a charge that was flatly rejected today by the press secretary.",

And I can also tell you this, Neil, that president will be in constant consultation with Gary Cohn and also with Steve Mnuchin right up until the very moment he delivers his remarks, the idea being that we will get more granular detail on what the White House wants to do vis-a-vis tax reform. You and I have talked about this at length, this idea of getting down to 15 percent corporate tax rate. That still seems a bit ambitious, to be frank with you.

The Independent Journal Review's Erin McPike on that.

And it may be, as Kevin said, that he wants to make big news on Wednesday and come out for something or name some numbers of his own.

And, frankly, Mnuchin also said that they were going to have tax reform done by August. Here we are, the last week of September, and the White House has not laid out in great detail yet what it is that the president will actually push for.

The magnitude of the devastation, and of course, our fiscal crisis put Puerto Rico in a different, an atypical situation.

Engle then retrieved his own registered gun from his vehicle, and held the suspect at gunpoint until police and medics arrived. The suspect, 25-year-old Emanuel Samson, has been released from the hospital and is now in police custody. He faces one murder charge in connection with the death of a 39-year-old Melanie Crow Smith, who was fatally shot in the church parking lot before the gunman allegedly went inside the sanctuary, opening fire and injuring six others.

And, three, the individual who prevented this from being even more worse and chaotic was an individual who legally owned a gun. And he prevented the mass chaos by his legal gun ownership. Thereby, media seemingly don't really care. And it is really unfortunate to me. The individual is a Christian. And I believe that there is an attack on Christianity in this country. I think it has been brewing on for many years. In 2015, there was some data released that said there's about 200, almost 250 incidences on -- religious violence -- violent incidences on places of worship. So, this is something that is missing here, and I think the media should be covering it. And thank God for FOX News, which seems to be the only media organization that really is covering that.",

But, in this scenario, when you have an individual who was -- we do not know all the facts of the investigation yet, but, obvious, there must be something wrong with you -- and this is my personal view -- to go into a church, a place of worship, and start shooting people. This is something that we all must pay attention to, because at this particular point in time, violence is ramping up all over in places of worship. I believe that there is elected officials that are targeting Christianity. I will use an example, Rahm Emanuel, when he went after Chick-fil-A, and he told that they would not open up -- he wouldn't allow another Chick-fil-A restaurant to be opened up in the city of Chicago because of their religious beliefs.

Jerry Jones, of course, famous for saying he likes his players to respect the flag, not a fan of Colin Kaepernick last kneeling out the national anthem, say to FBN a little more than a week ago, \"It is not the place to do anything than honor the flag and everybody that has given up a little more for it.\" They will be tested tonight. Jones, of course, has read the riot act that his players all toe the line here. And the line seems to be, no matter what the president of the United States says and whether he agitates you or not, despite other owners locking arms with you, I shall not.

What we have been reporting on FOX Business all day, it's a column I have done for FoxBusiness.com, is that the demographics of the average football fan is against this. If you look at the demographics, because, remember, this whole controversy started out essentially with Donald Trump attacking in kind of a crude way, I would say, the protests, the knees during -- taking the knee during the anthem. If you look at the demographic of the average football fan, it's an income of $100,000 a year or less. Race is a part of this, we have to admit, and most football fans, the vast majority, 67 to 70 percent of them are white. Many are in the military. Many are male. And it is a Donald Trump demographic. It's a demographic that doesn't like what is going on. Jerry Jones smells that, and he knows that this is an issue that the people who are paying the bills, the people that consume the advertising, the people that buy the merchandise, the people that watch the TV, the people that go to the stadiums, for the most part, they object to this."

But I talk to a lot of businesspeople that are involved in business with the NFL in the sports marketing side, and they tell me, despite what the owners are doing, and the owners are doing it primarily to keep sort of order and harmony in the locker room. But they are doing is playing with fire. It is marketing 101. You thumb your nose at your customer, the customer usually rebels. And you could see that in the ratings.

But, clearly, there's been plenty of criticism, as you point out, Neil, that as the president sort of drives the news cycle, whether it be by way of Twitter or an off-the-cuff comment, he doesn't have the laser-like focus on the pressing issues facing the White House. That has been the criticism, be that tax reform or maybe what is going on in Puerto Rico, for example, but that is also a charge that was flatly rejected today by the press secretary."

Most notably, he will be talking about numbers and real tax reform, and the White House will tell you, look, there's plenty of time to drill down on that. And I can also tell you this, Neil, that president will be in constant consultation with Gary Cohn and also with Steve Mnuchin right up until the very moment he delivers his remarks, the idea being that we will get more granular detail on what the White House wants to do vis-a-vis tax reform. You and I have talked about this at length, this idea of getting down to 15 percent corporate tax rate. That still seems a bit ambitious, to be frank with you. But they want to make it lower, obviously, to be more competitive on an international basis and we will see what happens as we learn more on Wednesday. So, is it more or is it too much? The White House would say it is just right -- Neil."

Then there is the question of whether this obsession with going after the NFL, whether that appeals to the president's base or not, and addresses, as Charlie Gasparino pointed out, the base that watches football games, whether that hurts any chance that president can get Democratic support for those tax cuts. The Independent Journal Review's Erin McPike on that. Erin, what you think of that, that this might have, whatever you say about the legitimacy of the president's remarks, whether they're accurate or justified, they didn't win him Democratic votes on those tax cuts. Maybe they weren't going to materialize anyway, but what you think?"

      "utterance": "Well, look, Neil, even if he does drive turnout in Alabama and get the outcome that he wants tomorrow night, it doesn't change anything about what is going on, on the floor of the Senate. And I do think right now it is possible that he is letting Republicans on Capitol Hill go through the machinations of what they want this tax reform or tax cut bill to look like. Obviously, we're hearing a number of things about what Bob Corker and Pat Toomey are trying to work out. And it may be, as Kevin said, that he wants to make big news on Wednesday and come out for something or name some numbers of his own. But it doesn't make sense why he wouldn't talk about it a little bit over the weekend and change what he was saying over the weekend about the NFL."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And therein lies the rub for the president, because among Republicans, there's a great deal of division as to how far to go with those tax cuts. Is it your feeling that the president is going to come out big, in other words, big tax cuts across the board, a very low corporate tax starting at 15 percent, not 20 percent, maybe go up in negotiations, but he wants big? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCPIKE",
      "utterance": "Neil, I think as we have talked about a number of times, I actually think that the president has been all over the map on this. He has been firm that he wants to drop the corporate tax rate, but he has also said that he would like to see taxes go up on the wealthiest Americans. I think his messaging has been pretty faulty. And, frankly, Mnuchin also said that they were going to have tax reform done by August. Here we are, the last week of September, and the White House has not laid out in great detail yet what it is that the president will actually push for. And, instead, they have really punted this to Capitol Hill. So, I do not have a good feeling about where the president is going on this. And I am hopeful that we will hear something from him on Wednesday, and maybe that is what this big Wednesday event is all about."

      "speaker": "MCPIKE",

And then of course it fell apart at the end. But I think that this White House recognizes too that there is where they could find some momentum."

Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, the Senate leader, was noncommittal, we're told, on this issue of ever bringing it up for a vote. That might have something to do with the fact that the vote might not be there. John McCain has already come out against it. Rand Paul can't be moved for it. We're told that Ted Cruz is a likely no vote, Cruz saying that himself, as things stand. He had telegraphed that his colleague Mike Lee of Utah would also be a likely no. Those are more votes than you need to kill this thing in the United States Senate. Mitch McConnell must be reading the writing on the wall to not necessarily he's canceling the vote, but noncommittal on having that vote. We will keep you posted. Meanwhile, keeping you posted on the hurricane and fallout that will not go away for the island of Puerto Rico, right now threatening about 70,000 in the path of a dam that could burst. Right now, the recovery efforts are going slow, but they are going. The island's Governor Ricardo Rossello, joining us right now.

But I have made a call up, up to a congressman and congresswoman to take the fact that we do not want to have a humanitarian crisis in the United States. And that is what could happen here in Puerto Rico if we do not take action. Puerto Ricans are U.S. -- proud U.S. citizens. We helped, as we have spoken in the past, other U.S. citizens that were in harm's way when Irma came through. We gave them shelter. We gave them food, a pass back home. The magnitude of this hurricane has been devastating. Having two Category 5 hurricanes pass through Puerto Rico is unprecedented anywhere else. The magnitude of the devastation, and of course, our fiscal crisis put Puerto Rico in a different, an atypical situation. And what we are asking is for Congress to act quickly, decisively, so that we can calculate the magnitude of the damage and that those damages are -- the ones that are given us, resources, to the people of Puerto Rico, number two, that we can get some flexibility, Neil, because as a government right now, we're going to need some flexibility with the money that comes in, so that we can attenuate some of the unforeseen circumstances that may occur, public health emergencies, collapse of decaying infrastructure, and so forth. And, lastly, lines of financing that Puerto Rico currently doesn't have because of its fiscal oversight board position. So, things have changed. And we want to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the United States. We want to prevent millions of Puerto Ricans flocking to the United States, causing a demographic nightmare, both for Puerto Rico."

And if the conditions are inhospitable, if people are -- you're essentially going to have a lot of Puerto Ricans moving out of harm's way, making sure they can have a path forward. But, of course, that presents a problem for the United States, and a significant problem for Puerto Rico. So, my caution is, let's take action. Let's focus on the solution. I think there is a path forward. But it needs to recognize that what is going on here, Neil, it's nothing short of a major catastrophe. It has longstanding limitations. But if used appropriately, my commitment is that we will normalize the situation, that we will start rebuilding, and that we will rebuild stronger than ever, smarter than ever."

They feel and obviously Kim Jong-un feels that he was humiliated on the world stage when the president called him Rocket Man and all that other stuff, and then agitated further when we upped the ante by these reconnaissance planes in areas that they had not been in quite some time, ignoring the fact that they have been fairly provocative over these last few decades.

Three previous presidents have kicked the can down the road and left Donald Trump with a soup sandwich now that he has to deal with. So, ultimately, he has to decide, will we accept a nuclear-armed North Korea, or will we do what previous presidents said, but didn't follow through on, is we will ensure that there is not a nuclear-armed North Korea? That is the question at this point. I am concerned."

The question is, do you want to live for the next 30 years under the threat of an EMP coming from North Korea? They are going to have that capability very soon, and they're also going to have the capability really to take down almost anybody within the Pacific Rim with a nuclear weapon. So, that is the question that we have to ask ourselves. I'm glad Donald Trump is handling this the way he is, and I hope that we can avoid war. But I fear it."

You are still going to have radiation on some of those islands like the Caroline Islands or the Solomons or somewhere. And that, as far as I'm concerned, is a red line. That is an act of war."

And they would have to get Jewish senators out of town for services. So, really, about the 28th is the deadline here. At the end of the day here, Neil, it is about the math. There are three Republican no's, John McCain of Arizona, Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is holding a press conference right now. And Ted Cruz of Texas. A senior aide to him indicates that, as of right now, he is a no. If you have 52 Republican senators, that takes you down to 49, using this special process, which expires on the 30th, that eliminates filibusters. They need to at least get 50, so Vice President Pence could break the tie.

You saw the crowds there chanting, Paul Krugman from The New York Times and others saying that this bill is cool beyond belief. The fact is, even under this bill, the federal government will be spending far more on health care for the poor and middle class by 2026 than they are today. The numbers still keep going up.

They are paying their insurance premiums out of their own pocket. And those premiums have gotten so big, it is like paying a mortgage. They are going to drop insurance next year. You are going to see something brand-new, Neil, the rise of a new uninsured class, the middle class. And it is very unfortunate, because also, in addition to taming premiums, this bill would have very sensibly protected people with preexisting conditions. Right now, under Obamacare, the entire cost of paying for some half-a-million people who have very serious illnesses is put on the shoulder of people in the individual market. They're paying exorbitant premiums and not getting anybody back. All the money..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

People are crediting one of the ushers at the church, a 22-year-old young man, as being really the hero in preventing things from getting much more out of hand than they already were. His name is Robert Caleb Engle. He is being very modest about his role in stopping the shooting. He has been released from the hospital. But while he was undergoing treatment in the hospital, he released a statement saying -- quote -- \"I do not want to be labeled a hero. The real heroes are the police, first-responders, and medical staff and doctors who have helped me and everyone affected.\" During his scuffle with the suspect, Engle was pistol-whipped. But police say the suspect injured himself with his own gun when that gun discharged in the scuffle, either by accident or purpose. Engle then retrieved his own registered gun from his vehicle, and held the suspect at gunpoint until police and medics arrived. The suspect, 25-year-old Emanuel Samson, has been released from the hospital and is now in police custody. He faces one murder charge in connection with the death of a 39-year-old Melanie Crow Smith, who was fatally shot in the church parking lot before the gunman allegedly went inside the sanctuary, opening fire and injuring six others. Authorities say make more charges are pending. Church members say the subject was no stranger, that he had attended service at this particular church in the past, but had not been there recently. A man who lives across the street from the church describes the congregation as racially diverse and welcoming."

    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "So, there's three key elements that play out in my mind when it comes to the story. One, this was not an individual shooting in a black church. Two, there was no Trump tie-in. As you know, the media loves to fantasize about everything with regards to Trump, and that is what get them more clicks, and that would get them more exposure. And, three, the individual who prevented this from being even more worse and chaotic was an individual who legally owned a gun. And he prevented the mass chaos by his legal gun ownership. Thereby, media seemingly don't really care. And it is really unfortunate to me. The individual is a Christian. And I believe that there is an attack on Christianity in this country. I think it has been brewing on for many years. In 2015, there was some data released that said there's about 200, almost 250 incidences on -- religious violence -- violent incidences on places of worship. So, this is something that is missing here, and I think the media should be covering it. And thank God for FOX News, which seems to be the only media organization that really is covering that."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think if there was more people that were killed, I think there would be a bit more coverage. But, again, these tie-ins seem to be all-important to the media, whereas, if there's some violence that takes place in a Trump rally, you are going to see it front page everywhere. But, in this scenario, when you have an individual who was -- we do not know all the facts of the investigation yet, but, obvious, there must be something wrong with you -- and this is my personal view -- to go into a church, a place of worship, and start shooting people. This is something that we all must pay attention to, because at this particular point in time, violence is ramping up all over in places of worship. I believe that there is elected officials that are targeting Christianity. I will use an example, Rahm Emanuel, when he went after Chick-fil-A, and he told that they would not open up -- he wouldn't allow another Chick-fil-A restaurant to be opened up in the city of Chicago because of their religious beliefs. I think this is something is that has become very troubling and dangerous and fostered an environment -- or has fostered an environment where people feel comfortable doing these kind of things."

      "utterance": "Well, you reminded me, remember with Sandy five years ago, that wasn't even hurricane. It was a nor'easter and the surge and all that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "They call it a superstorm because it's a hybrid of a hurricane and a nor'easter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "But, yes, it was the storm surge and the flooding that caused so much devastation. But, listen, we can survive these weather phenomenon if we know what to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What is behind this weather phenomenon? I talk a lot of climatologists who said, see, it's global warming, climate change, but it has been a relatively subdued 12 years."

      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "Right."

      "utterance": "So, what is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "We have had a hurricane drought. This is very much like 2004-2005, where the conditions in the atmosphere have become favorable for hurricane development."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. What decides that? Is that a cyclical thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "There's a whole bunch. Definitely is cyclical. If you look back to the '30, the '40s, the '60s, certainly 2004, 2005, it usually comes after a period of very quiet time. And the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center said that conditions are favorable for hurricanes. You can have many hurricanes in the Atlantic, but it just takes one to make it a bad year. And, unfortunately, we have had a record-setting year with not one, but four major hurricanes that have been caused disaster, obviously."

    },

    },

      "speaker": "DEAN",

    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "But a period of quiet right now, and then we will have to watch as we get into the fall months. But I also want to point out, the flash flood book, all the proceeds that I make from this book will go to Hurricane Harvey relief in Texas..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Wow. Good for you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "... and my good friends at Team Rubicon, who get our veterans out with first-responders and help in disaster areas. So, all of my proceeds from the flash flood book will help flash flood victims in Texas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You are amazing. Are your kids your audience for this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, definitely. I start off with my kids, and they give me suggestions. And then I have people like you read it and tell me what your thoughts are, the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I didn't understand the weather analogies you were making. How you feeling, by the way, the M.S. and everything else?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "I'm feeling good. I know a lot of people -- you are very open with your multiple sclerosis diagnosis. When I was diagnosed..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Only when I can milk it for sympathy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "Taking out the garbage, that kind of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "But, listen, a lot of people do not realize this. Neil was the first person that I went to when I was diagnosed back in 2005. And I thank every moment that you have given me hope and your expertise..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you're on fire, young lady. I told you to quit, remember? And you didn't. All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "utterance": "No, you didn't. You told me to persevere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And you did, and then some."
    },
    {

      "utterance": "No, Kilmeade. No."

      "utterance": "Oh, wow, this is going to get interesting tonight. We are getting a report now from The Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Dallas Cowboys players do indeed plan an anthem protest of their own over President Trump's remarks. So, Jerry Jones, the owner in the past, has criticized Colin Kaepernick and others for sitting out or kneeling down during the national anthem, wasn't a big fan of that. Of course, a lot has changed over the past year. What Jerry Jones does in reaction -- or does in reaction to that tonight could be very interesting. \"The Five,\" yes, it's back, now.
