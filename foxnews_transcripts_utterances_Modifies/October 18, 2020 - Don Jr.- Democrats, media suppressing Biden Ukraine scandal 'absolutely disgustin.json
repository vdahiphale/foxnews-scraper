      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. A potential massive cover-up by the FBI revealed. Why has the FBI been sitting on information about payouts to Hunter Biden from Ukraine for a year?  Today, Senator Ron Johnson demands answers by this Thursday in a new letter to the sitting FBI Director Christopher Wray and another letter sent this morning. Senator Johnson is here with breaking news on the Biden payouts and the national security concerns that come with it.  Plus: conspirators of the cover-up, from the FBI leadership to the media.  The subpoenas have gone out to Twitter and Facebook CEOs after social media moves to hide the Biden story from the American public. Will they testify in the next two weeks? And how will the GOP insure a fair election? GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Congressman Devin Nunes on where they see election interference and what they plan to do about it.  Plus: Donald Trump Jr. calling out the hypocrisy. Why he's recruiting an election army to guarantee a fair and safe election, as more ballot mistakes and claims of fraud emerge? Also, reports Google is helping to flip the Senate to a Democrat majority.  Senator Kelly Loeffler joining us on the race to defend her Senate seat in Georgia, where Trump and Biden are running neck and neck.   This all happening ahead of the final election face-off this Thursday night, with the final presidential debate now 16 days away from Election Day. All that and a lot more as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But, first, Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings have concluded, moving her one step closer to the high bench.   Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham presided over the process and outlined what comes next when he joined us last week.",

But Blue Star Strategies is a Democrat-led lobbying firm that represented Burisma, and -- in the United States, trying to get the United States to look favorably on this very corrupt oil company and its corrupt owner.  And so what -- we subpoenaed them for all their records having to do with Burisma and their actions with the federal government. We reached out to them after we heard about these and asked them, did you fully comply? And then, on October 15, we saw an e-mail that should have been responsive to our subpoena that we did not receive. And this e-mail describes a December 2, 2015, conference call hosted by the White House to discuss Vice President Biden's upcoming trip to Ukraine.   Now, what's important about that, that would have been the trip, we believe, where Vice President Biden made -- basically laid down the ultimatum, you either fire Shokin, or you are not going to get $1 billion loan guarantee. And so this should have been responsive. We should have gotten this. And we're trying to then verify, is that a valid e-mail? Is that correct? We should have gotten it. But, right now, we're just trying to validate, is that a true and genuine e-mail that came out of -- off of Hunter Biden's computer?  Because then it helps validate the fact that it is, in fact, Hunter Biden's computer or data downloaded from Hunter Biden's computer.",

And you, in fact, have this e-mail that reads this: \"This morning, the White House hosted a conference call regarding the vice president's upcoming trip to Ukraine. Attached is a memo from the Blue Star Strategies team with the minutes of that call, which outlined the trip's agenda and addressed several questions regarding U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\" You have this note, and you weren't given it before. Why has the FBI been sitting on all of this for a year? Take us back to December of 2019. This is when the FBI was given this information, apparently from Hunter Biden's laptop. A month later, there was a Senate trial trying to impeach President Trump over Ukraine.   If the FBI was in possession of these e-mails from Hunter Biden's computer indicating all of these payouts, why did they not make this public as President Trump was being impeached in the Senate about Ukraine?",

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "sentences": "Of course, that's the $64 question. Now, again, public reports, people talking to the whistle-blower -- we have spoken with him as well. Seems like he got this sooner than December 2019 and tried to turn it over to the FBI. I think, initially, they weren't particularly interested in it.  But, at some point in time, they became interested in it, and actually issued a grand jury subpoena, which they served on him in December, and that's when the FBI would have taken custody of this computer that's purported to be Hunter Biden's.  Now, I think it's pretty odd that -- quite honestly, that the Biden campaign, all they have really done to repute or deny any of this is to say that the meeting that one of these e-mails revealed that Vice President Biden had with the number three in control of Burisma never showed up on his official calendar. Well, there's all kinds of meetings that didn't show up on his official calendar. This wouldn't surprise me if this one didn't.  Now, the first thing we did after we got contacted by the whistle-blower the day after we issued our report on Ukraine was, we contact the FBI and determine, is this story true? Is -- can you verify any of this? And it took them a couple days to basically give us no information. So I just sent another letter yesterday, because the FBI has a duty to inform us. If they believe this is maybe Russia disinformation, they should give us a defensive briefing. They should tell us about that.   If, for example, they also believe that what information this whistle- blower gave us is fraudulent, that would also be a crime, and the FBI should tell us that. So we're trying to suss out of the FBI, what do they know and when did they know it?  But the larger question really is, if they had this information, and these are genuine e-mails, and it would probably reveal all kinds of things that would have been very relevant to the impeachment case, why did they sit on it? Are they covering up just because Hunter Biden might be engaged in things that also maybe should have been investigated and possibly prosecuted? Do we have two systems of justice, one for Democrats, one for Republicans, one for the well-connected, vs. one for the rest of the Americans? I think that's really probably the larger issue here at play.",

Archer Devon (sic), oddly enough, his -- his jury conviction was overturned by a judge who just happens to be married to one of the members of the -- Mueller's special counsel team that was the lead prosecutor in the Paul Manafort trial. So there's some amazing connections here. But, again, what we're finding is, we're finding more and more validation that these e-mails are true. So you got some -- one of the recipients on that e-mail chain has told FOX News that, yes, that's a true e-mail.  Now, these other e-mails that Breitbart is breaking from Bevan Cooney, is the co-conspirator, the man who is in jail right now, that's a totally separate e-mail server, totally separate e-mails that also are starting to paint a picture of the corruption, the vast web of connections in -- that Hunter Biden, his firms, Devon Archer were involved in.

I said that our report can't -- or raised far more questions than it answered. This requires detailed investigations on the part of the Justice Department, on the part of the FBI, on the part of the media. And that's not occurring. So, why is this being covered up?

Are they repeating the same bad behavior as before? And it is out in the public right now that China is trying to influence our election. That's what the FBI tells us.

Just so your viewers understand, the American public desires free speech. So the federal government created a liability protection for tech companies to have a platform like Facebook and Twitter for liability protection where they cannot be sued, so they just let information out. People are able to say what they want. But now we're watching that big tech is using this and censoring individuals. Even they are censoring the federal government, they are censoring newspapers, they are censoring Americans, based upon what they believe. They want to influence you for what you can think and what you can say. So, it is time now that we scrap Section 230, and we start over. And in the Republican Judiciary Committee, we have a great bill to start out with, Jim Jordan as the ranking member. A number of members have already co- sponsored. That is where we should start, because, as you remember, Maria, when I was majority leader, we brought in big tech. They would tell us one thing, but we have found they have continued to do another.

We have to go back to 2015. This was -- it was the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media who originally talked about all of this Burisma information and all of this corruption in Ukraine. Then you fast-forward in the time when after the Mueller probe completely implodes, Mueller embarrasses himself on TV, after $40 million. They can't find any Trump with pee tapes and Moscow prostitutes or any money going into the Trump campaign. That all dies. Then, right at the time when Ukraine hoax starts happening, when Trump is on the phone, saying, hey, we hear you have a corruption problem, then this gentleman comes forward from Delaware and says, hey, I think I have evidence that is relevant to this investigation. How important would it have been for us, that we're investigating this, and going through these bogus impeachment hearings, for us to know that, in fact, there were e-mails that had Hunter Biden not only tied to Ukrainian companies, but to Moscow oligarchs? And to the leader's point, I think the China problem is even worse. It looked like there's millions of dollars that involved with China and the Bidens. This was all relevant information, that the FBI was given that information specifically because of the impeachment of Trump, the way that our investigators understand it. So why would the FBI not get that immediately to the Congress? I think that's a question that they have to answer. And the faster they answer it, the better. If I were these agents that were involved in this, I'd separate myself from the D.C. swamp creatures. I don't know what chain -- what that chain of command and where that information went up the chain of command. But the American people deserve a right to know it.

We're two weeks out from an election, and they're pretending like this is a nonissue. I mean, we understand all and full well why the Chinese gave Hunter Biden $1.5 billion. And it wasn't because of his investment prowess, Maria. He had never done any real investing before. They don't just do that, unless they know they can buy you, unless they know you're compromised.

And the fact this has been out there for three days, and no one is denying the efficacy of the e-mails, no one is denying that they are actually real, no one is doing that, and, more importantly, very few, one person in the media asked Joe Biden if it was real.

Why you sent him this letter, and what specifically you're looking for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I will try and keep this simple. But Blue Star Strategies is a Democrat-led lobbying firm that represented Burisma, and -- in the United States, trying to get the United States to look favorably on this very corrupt oil company and its corrupt owner. And so what -- we subpoenaed them for all their records having to do with Burisma and their actions with the federal government. We reached out to them after we heard about these and asked them, did you fully comply? And then, on October 15, we saw an e-mail that should have been responsive to our subpoena that we did not receive. And this e-mail describes a December 2, 2015, conference call hosted by the White House to discuss Vice President Biden's upcoming trip to Ukraine. Now, what's important about that, that would have been the trip, we believe, where Vice President Biden made -- basically laid down the ultimatum, you either fire Shokin, or you are not going to get $1 billion loan guarantee. And so this should have been responsive. We should have gotten this. And we're trying to then verify, is that a valid e-mail? Is that correct? We should have gotten it. But, right now, we're just trying to validate, is that a true and genuine e-mail that came out of -- off of Hunter Biden's computer? Because then it helps validate the fact that it is, in fact, Hunter Biden's computer or data downloaded from Hunter Biden's computer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, just to be clear, the Biden campaign says, well, there was no meeting that ever took place. It wasn't on the schedule."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And you, in fact, have this e-mail that reads this",
      "utterance": "\"This morning, the White House hosted a conference call regarding the vice president's upcoming trip to Ukraine. Attached is a memo from the Blue Star Strategies team with the minutes of that call, which outlined the trip's agenda and addressed several questions regarding U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\" You have this note, and you weren't given it before. Why has the FBI been sitting on all of this for a year? Take us back to December of 2019. This is when the FBI was given this information, apparently from Hunter Biden's laptop. A month later, there was a Senate trial trying to impeach President Trump over Ukraine. If the FBI was in possession of these e-mails from Hunter Biden's computer indicating all of these payouts, why did they not make this public as President Trump was being impeached in the Senate about Ukraine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Of course, that's the $64 question. Now, again, public reports, people talking to the whistle-blower -- we have spoken with him as well. Seems like he got this sooner than December 2019 and tried to turn it over to the FBI. I think, initially, they weren't particularly interested in it. But, at some point in time, they became interested in it, and actually issued a grand jury subpoena, which they served on him in December, and that's when the FBI would have taken custody of this computer that's purported to be Hunter Biden's. Now, I think it's pretty odd that -- quite honestly, that the Biden campaign, all they have really done to repute or deny any of this is to say that the meeting that one of these e-mails revealed that Vice President Biden had with the number three in control of Burisma never showed up on his official calendar. Well, there's all kinds of meetings that didn't show up on his official calendar. This wouldn't surprise me if this one didn't. Now, the first thing we did after we got contacted by the whistle-blower the day after we issued our report on Ukraine was, we contact the FBI and determine, is this story true? Is -- can you verify any of this? And it took them a couple days to basically give us no information. So I just sent another letter yesterday, because the FBI has a duty to inform us. If they believe this is maybe Russia disinformation, they should give us a defensive briefing. They should tell us about that. If, for example, they also believe that what information this whistle- blower gave us is fraudulent, that would also be a crime, and the FBI should tell us that. So we're trying to suss out of the FBI, what do they know and when did they know it? But the larger question really is, if they had this information, and these are genuine e-mails, and it would probably reveal all kinds of things that would have been very relevant to the impeachment case, why did they sit on it? Are they covering up just because Hunter Biden might be engaged in things that also maybe should have been investigated and possibly prosecuted? Do we have two systems of justice, one for Democrats, one for Republicans, one for the well-connected, vs. one for the rest of the Americans? I think that's really probably the larger issue here at play."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Now, there's one e-mail that FOX News has been able to verify. In that e-mail, it indicates that we're going to hold some money or something aside, 10 percent for the big guy. Who is the big guy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, people, of course, are assuming that is Vice President Biden. And, of course, there's a completely different computer now with different e-mails. This is the computer from one of Devon Archer's co-conspirator in this Indian -- or this tribal bond fraud. This man, together with Devon Archer, was convicted. He's sitting in jail. Archer Devon (sic), oddly enough, his -- his jury conviction was overturned by a judge who just happens to be married to one of the members of the -- Mueller's special counsel team that was the lead prosecutor in the Paul Manafort trial. So there's some amazing connections here. But, again, what we're finding is, we're finding more and more validation that these e-mails are true. So you got some -- one of the recipients on that e-mail chain has told FOX News that, yes, that's a true e-mail. Now, these other e-mails that Breitbart is breaking from Bevan Cooney, is the co-conspirator, the man who is in jail right now, that's a totally separate e-mail server, totally separate e-mails that also are starting to paint a picture of the corruption, the vast web of connections in -- that Hunter Biden, his firms, Devon Archer were involved in. This requires serious investigation. And the fact that the mainstream media is suppressing this information from the American public is a scandal, in and of itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, that is one of the most important parts of this scandal, the fact that the mainstream media and social media are hiding information from the American public about payments to a major presidential candidate's son. And they're hiding that 16 days before the election. I agree with you. Senator, I want you to connect the dots for us in terms of national security risks. That's why you started this investigation in the first place, to check for any national security threats. Are there national security threats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, remember, everybody just find the -- the investigation, the false allegations against the Trump campaign was, can you imagine the national security threat, the threat of blackmail against a sitting president, if these connections are true? Well, take whatever is alleged that was proven false against President Trump and multiply that by orders of magnitude of just what we have scratched the surface in terms of uncovering of this vast web of connections with Chinese nationals, ties to the China -- the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army. I said that our report can't -- or raised far more questions than it answered. This requires detailed investigations on the part of the Justice Department, on the part of the FBI, on the part of the media. And that's not occurring. So, why is this being covered up? Why is this not being talked about? This is a major news story, because, if you have all this -- these vast webs, all these connections, this could be used as blackmail against a potential Biden presidency far in excess of anything that was ever alleged against Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Now, Senator, real quick, what is going to be coming out in the coming weeks? We understand here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" there is more to come. And there is further analysis of the subpoena's handwriting. And it suggests that the subpoena was served by an FBI agent whose name is Joshua Wilson. And over the last five years, he has been working on child pornography issues. Connect the dots. If an FBI agent is working on child pornography issues for five years, why is he subpoenaing the laptop of Hunter Biden? Is there a connection here? Should this suggest that there's a child pornography issue here on that laptop?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you just made the connection. Again, this is what the FBI, I think, has to come clean about. This isn't a standard investigation where, if the FBI doesn't indict somebody, that everything remains confidential. This is something that, as we were talking about, relates to national security. And if there's criminal activity involved that could be tied to Hunter Biden or his business associates, or even possibly tied back to other members of the Biden family -- and, as some of these e-mails indicate that Joe Biden was fully aware of this. He was taking his 10 percent cut or requiring 50 percent from his family members' salary. This needs to be known before Americans go to the polls."

Our report uncovered so many troubling connections, so many things that need to be investigated, that I really think we're just scratching the surface. And, yes, I have heard all kinds of things that I think will probably be revealed over the next few days. There's a treasure trove of e-mails and video and pictures in not only the purported computer of Hunter Biden, but now we have got the co-conspirator, Bevan Cooney, that also is starting to reveal information. I guess we're probably going to just find new and more information every day over the next couple of weeks."

And, in fact, there are some similarities here, Maria. If you remember, we had -- the whole (AUDIO GAP) was all over Europe looking for Moscow prostitutes, money that was supposedly moving from Moscow or Ukraine into the Trump campaign or the Trump orbit. We looked for that for the last four years. It ends up that that story that ended up in the Clinton dossier that they fed into the FBI was true, except it was a fantasy based off of the Biden family. So, there are prostitutes. There are -- there is Moscow money. I don't know if there's pee tapes or not, but it involves the Bidens.

We are just now finding out four years later that the CIA did know that Hillary Clinton was making up the Russian idea with President Trump, that Brennan actually briefed President Obama, that they sent a memo to the FBI to Comey and Peter Strzok, and never told anybody in Congress or the American public. Now we find right before the eve of an election that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, money could be involved here, all the speculations of things we have heard before. And, Maria, it comes down to one simple question. The American public deserves the right to know. And Joe Biden has a responsibility to answer these questions, which he's avoiding. Before this election takes place, these questions need to be answered before the American public, because is the FBI -- did they have this computer? Did they know of this again? Are they repeating the same bad behavior as before? And it is out in the public right now that China is trying to influence our election. That's what the FBI tells us. The most sophisticated country, the one that has the -- one of the largest economies coming after us, and they have a directive of what they want to do.

Just so your viewers understand, the American public desires free speech. So the federal government created a liability protection for tech companies to have a platform like Facebook and Twitter for liability protection where they cannot be sued, so they just let information out. People are able to say what they want. But now we're watching that big tech is using this and censoring individuals. Even they are censoring the federal government, they are censoring newspapers, they are censoring Americans, based upon what they believe. They want to influence you for what you can think and what you can say. So, it is time now that we scrap Section 230, and we start over. And in the Republican Judiciary Committee, we have a great bill to start out with, Jim Jordan as the ranking member. A number of members have already co- sponsored. That is where we should start, because, as you remember, Maria, when I was majority leader, we brought in big tech. They would tell us one thing, but we have found they have continued to do another. Just as China's trying to influence our election, we now find that Twitter and Facebook are doing the exact same thing. And they should be ashamed. And the American public is outraged about this."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that's the big issue here. The folks that came forward -- and my investigative team has actually been looking at this also. And I want to commend Senator Johnson and Senator Grassley, because they have been drug through the mud last year looking into this by the mainstream media, while the media has ignored it. We have to go back to 2015. This was -- it was the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media who originally talked about all of this Burisma information and all of this corruption in Ukraine. Then you fast-forward in the time when after the Mueller probe completely implodes, Mueller embarrasses himself on TV, after $40 million. They can't find any Trump with pee tapes and Moscow prostitutes or any money going into the Trump campaign. That all dies. Then, right at the time when Ukraine hoax starts happening, when Trump is on the phone, saying, hey, we hear you have a corruption problem, then this gentleman comes forward from Delaware and says, hey, I think I have evidence that is relevant to this investigation. How important would it have been for us, that we're investigating this, and going through these bogus impeachment hearings, for us to know that, in fact, there were e-mails that had Hunter Biden not only tied to Ukrainian companies, but to Moscow oligarchs? And to the leader's point, I think the China problem is even worse. It looked like there's millions of dollars that involved with China and the Bidens. This was all relevant information, that the FBI was given that information specifically because of the impeachment of Trump, the way that our investigators understand it. So why would the FBI not get that immediately to the Congress? I think that's a question that they have to answer. And the faster they answer it, the better. If I were these agents that were involved in this, I'd separate myself from the D.C. swamp creatures. I don't know what chain -- what that chain of command and where that information went up the chain of command. But the American people deserve a right to know it. And those agents should come forward and tell us who they gave this information to back in 2019 during the heat of the impeachment."

We mentioned earlier with Senator Johnson that the FBI agent who served the subpoena was actually looking at child pornography. And I also mentioned this $3.5 million payout to Hunter Biden from the former mayor of Moscow. That seems to have gone away. You have got social media just suppressing this news."

The way I look at this, Maria, if the shoe was on the other foot, so, for example, if Ivanka Trump had got a $3.5 million payment from a Russian oligarch, there would be a massive investigation. If there turned up that Donald Trump's laptop with all sorts of e-mails tying that money to a pay-for-play scheme, essentially what we have been investigating the Trump campaign for and President Trump for the last four years, the question right now by the fake news media and the social media companies would be this. It would be, when is Trump resigning? If not, is he going to be impeached before the election? And when is Pence taking over? And, in fact, that would happen for any governor, any U.S. congressman, any senator. And, in fact, Maria I know your family had a pizza business. If your family's pizza business got a $3.5 million (AUDIO GAP) guarantee you, you would be investigated, because they would say, well, how on earth did Maria Bartiromo send $3.5 million of pizzas to Moscow?"

Do you think this is resonating on the American voter out there? I mean, you see somebody like a Kim Klacik in Baltimore having been successful, raising some $6 million. She's outraising her opponent. Does she have a shot? How do you feel about the upcoming race, Congressman?"

But, Maria, you have to understand, we have twice as many women running as Republican in this cycle than we did last year, 95, two years ago. You look at Nicole Malliotakis in New York, or you look at Stephanie Bice in Oklahoma City, Nancy Mace in Charleston, South Carolina, Young Kim, Michelle Steel out in California. The real question that all the voters are asking in al these districts is, how much is it going to cost us if Joe Biden wins the election and the Democrats keep Congress? Because they know their taxes are going to go up on the very first day. We don't know if they are going to pack the court. We know they are going to try to change election law. We know they are making life harder, that we're ever going to be able to get out of this. But, on the Republican side, they have a Commitment to America, that they have a cure for COVID, that they can rebuild our economy with 10 million new jobs, and they will keep our streets safe."

There's 16 days until the November 3 election, but the election has already started. More than 22 million Americans have already cast ballots. For those who have not voted, there will be one more chance to watch the candidates go head to head on key issues at the final presidential debate in Nashville this Thursday night. Donald Trump Jr. is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization. He is the author of the new book \"Liberal Privilege.\" He joins us fresh off of the campaign trail. Don, good morning to you. It is good to see you. Your reaction to all of this going into this debate coming up, and the media suppressing so much negative information about the Biden family?"

And that -- you can include social media with that. Everything that they hoped and prayed I was doing, that they made me testify for 30 hours for, that they said that I had committed treason doing, Hunter Biden was actually doing, with knowledge of Joe Biden, because you notice, that in all of the sort of non-denial denials, the one thing they are not saying is that Joe Biden didn't take these meetings and Joe Biden didn't have this knowledge."

Like, oh -- oh, well in that case. And the media, oh, they love it. Oh, it's not official. I mean, is anyone this stupid? I mean, this is absolutely disgusting. Then you have the FBI sitting on the laptop for a year-and-a-half. They are saying it was hacked. They are doing their -- you know, the go-to plan, which is, oh, Russian disinformation. The second it's anything bad about the Bidens, they start that, with full help of the FBI and the CIA. There's no proof of that whatsoever, just like there was no proof that it was the Russians when it was Donald Trump. But that didn't stop them from running with it for four years. Then you add in the social media suppression of that, and you understand what's going on. The swamp, social media, mainstream media, they want Biden to win, even though it's likely that Biden is probably the most compromised person in the history of American politics. We're two weeks out from an election, and they're pretending like this is a nonissue. I mean, we understand all and full well why the Chinese gave Hunter Biden $1.5 billion. And it wasn't because of his investment prowess, Maria. He had never done any real investing before. They don't just do that, unless they know they can buy you, unless they know you're compromised. And the Bidens are compromised. And the fact this has been out there for three days, and no one is denying the efficacy of the e-mails, no one is denying that they are actually real, no one is doing that, and, more importantly, very few, one person in the media asked Joe Biden if it was real. He attacked them. And then everyone in the media went and attacked the reporter, defending Joe Biden, the same media that was outraged that, when Donald Trump said the Russia hoax was fake news, which it was, they went, outraged that this is an attack on the free press, yadda, yadda, yadda. They have no problem when the Biden camp does it, and they destroy one of their own. And let's not kid ourselves. The New York Post is a 200-year-old paper. The New York Post has been around and is one of the largest papers in America."

This is the stuff that makes Watergate look like kindergarten. And then you combine that with the Obama administration and the Biden administration working with the highest level of the FBI and the CIA to knowingly peddle the disinformation campaign gathered from what they knew was a former Soviet asset and probably still a Russian asset. I mean, this is disgusting. If this was going on in a Third World country, we'd be outraged. It's happening here, and everyone pretending as though it's not.

This is the choice at the national level. Look, President Trump has lifted all Americans up through his successful economic agenda. He has strengthened our military. He's restrengthened us around the world, stood with our men and women in law enforcement. So, it's a clear choice. And we are turning out. We have great momentum across the state for President Trump. I have been going around the state hearing from Georgians and in my race. I'm the leading Republican in my race because, it's a clear choice between the swamp and the radical left.
