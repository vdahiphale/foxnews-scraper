Besides my book on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, that's fine. We had a good run.  What's missing is the media mob fixated on Florida and COVID. What changed? Florida COVID cases went way down. Florida kicked its summer surge. Good news, less sick citizens. Extra, extra. Read all about it. But the national news won't run it. The media mob won't tell you the rest of the Florida story because it had a happy ending.  See, if the plotline changes and goes against the narrative, the press skips to the next act. And the next act is this: If you're unmasked or unvaxxed, you're a deadly weapon.",

They'll add them up and make their case. And if history is a guide, the government will deem gun violence a public health threat, and use its emergency powers to limit your Second Amendment rights.  Judges have to hold the line against this coming power grab. The propaganda for the grab has been mounting. The masses have been deluded by it. Military style, semi-automatic assault weapon, otherwise known as just a rifle.   Well, the F.B.I. released its 2020 Crime Report, massive rise in homicides. But let's go deeper. What's the murder method? In a country of over 300 million people, last year just 454 murders were committed by rifle. Some lever action, pump action, some, I guess, AR-15s, but more murderers use their fists and their feet. And almost four times, more people died from knives than so-called assault rifles. A fake phrase by the way, the AR and AR-15 actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, the brand. So here's the point. Over 8,000 homicides last year involved handguns. These are the self-defense weapons of choice in America, especially among inner city gangs who are responsible for a big chunk of the body count. Revolvers, Glocks -- very easy to conceal.  So, why doesn't the left harp on handguns if that's the firearm doing all the damage? Something to think about and discuss on another show.  You'll never find fairness on the left. Look all you want, you'll go cross- eyed. A great example: Crazy California released the man who tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan, John Hinckley, Jr. was a freak who tried to impress actress, Jodie Foster, by killing the President. Reagan barely survived. The bullet stopped an inch from his heart. But the would-be assassin has been paroled. He was living in Virginia, but the public lost track of him. He could be anywhere.   In less than a year, he'll be released from all court supervision. Nobody monitoring his meds, travels, or communications. So shoot a President in the heart and years later, you're a free man. The system says you're not crazy. You're no threat.  But if you question the election or the C.D.C., I'm sorry, sir, you're going to have to come with me.  America feels like Bruce Willis in \"12 Monkeys.\"",

John Nolte at Breitbart has a great piece. \"Despite massive news events, bottom falls out of CNN's quarterly ratings.\" Not a single CNN program averaged over a million viewers, not a single CNN program.   CNN's highest rated show \"Cuomo Primetime\" came in a humiliating 23rd place. Tucker, \"The Five,\" \"Hannity,\" one, two, three.  Nolte writes: \"We all know what's happening here. On top of the hideous behavior of deviants like Chris Cuomo and CNN legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, on top of the credible sexual assault claim against Don Lemon, CNN LOL is dealing with a massive credibility crisis. Over and over CNN LOL has been exposed as a fake news outlet that trolls and lies and deliberately spread conspiracy theories. The end result is that during a world changing news quarter, practically no one tunes into CNN LOL because no one trusts CNN LOL -- not even leftists.\" We reported last week Chris Cuomo was accused of grabbing a producer's butt at an ABC party in front of her husband and copped to it in writing. The highest rated anchor on CNN embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, that's news, but the mob spiked it.  ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and of course CNN all ignored the story. This is why corporate media is dying. They don't cover the news, they cover it up. The networks did the same thing with John Durham, not a peep from ABC, CBS, and NBC after Crooked Hillary's lawyer got indicted for lying to the F.B.I. concocting the Trump-Russia hoax.  Breaking news alerts anytime a Trump associate was charged in the witch hunt, but dead silence when Clinton's lawyer is charged for starting the witch hunt. Again, the press just turns the page when the plot thickens, and it is thickening.  Durham just slapped Clinton's dirty dossier law firm with more subpoenas.  The F.B.I. exposed again this week for odious corruption. The I.G. report found the Bureau systematically lied and tricked the FISA Court for years into getting warrants to spy on American citizens. They faked evidence, hid evidence, abused our privacy, and the media again hiding this sleaze from the country. Jim Comey signed off on all of it. But the most corrupt F.B.I. Chief since Hoover skedaddled with a Fed book deal and just basked in the glow of left- wing worship. That's the retirement package when you run the resistance.  They're throwing it in our faces now. POLITICO just confirmed Hunter Biden's laptop was legit, and that's how you rig a vote. Run the October surprise a year after the election. So Biden lied, the family was in business with the Chinese communists and they were holding 10 for the big guy. Don't hold your breath for a prosecution. In Arizona, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 11,000 votes. An audit in Maricopa County done by an outside firm found 57,000 questionable ballots just in that one county. The media wasn't interested in this, and the audit wasn't as thorough as it could have been because Arizona officials wouldn't fully cooperate and some evidence was removed and destroyed.  So, there's a dangerous pattern in the United States. Politicians, prosecutors and the press are abusing their power to wage political warfare against innocent people. And even when the abuse is exposed, the press runs cover for the conspiracy.  We're picking it apart, but we need more honest Americans on the inside run for office, be a reporter. I'd tell you to be a lawyer, but this country does not need any more lawyers, just the right ones in the right places. So, get it right -- or be a judge. We can't win the battle from the outside. You know what you need to do. Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  All right, your thoughts on Watters' Words, Senator?",

They were terrible at it, they were lefty, but they did say our objective is to be balanced. When Trump became President, their partisan rage just ruptured, and they are not only today partisan propagandists, they are the left-wing of the Democratic Party. Their mission every day is push the Democratic Party left, so it is, cover up every story they don't want covered and amplify every story they want and they don't pretend at all. You know, you point out CNN covering up Chris Cuomo and the serious sexual assault and harassment allegation. It is simply not news, it doesn't exist. I keep waiting for CNN to hire Al Franken as their next evening host since apparently, you have to be a sexual predator to be on the air on CNN. I mean, it is -- it's a mockery.

And she described, how -- you know, Panama is right at the juncture between South America and North America. She described how in the last year, they have seen over 80,000 Haitian illegal aliens crossing north from South America through Panama, on the way to come to the United States, and these are Haitians who evacuated years ago and came to South America, and were living happily there. And then word got out that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in charge, and it is open borders. It's open season. If you make it to the United States, you get to stay. Over 80,000 Haitians coming through Panama. You know what the Foreign Minister told me. She said, I've called the White House repeatedly. The Biden White House won't return my calls.  She said, I call the State Department. The State Department, only once would they talk to her, they blow her off. You know, Panama's Foreign Minister hosted an organization -- hosted a meeting of the Foreign Ministers, of I think, 11 countries in Central and South America to discuss this immigration crisis. And obviously, they wanted the United States there, because the United States is where everyone is going in this crisis. The Biden administration refused to send the Secretary of State, they sent a lower level individual.

The F.B.I. is also now in possession of at least two phones, Brian's regular phone and a burner phone purchased the day he went missing. Brian Laundrie's mother originally made reservations for two people at the Soto Park campground in Florida between September 1st and 3rd, but then changed those reservations on August 31st to a reservation for three people the weekend of September 6th to the 8th. The Pinellas County Sheriff turned over surveillance video from that family camp out to the F.B.I., and it is being analyzed. And someone came forward this week who believes they had an encounter with Brian at a bar in Montana a day before Gabby was last seen alive. Apparently, Brian was mad at the world and cursed out \"Stupid southerners and Republicans\" while drinking alone at the bar. Dog, the Bounty Hunter has also joined the search this week. While searching in a remote island in Florida, Dog found a Monster Energy can with no signs of rust, sandals in a fire pit, but nothing conclusive to confirm where Laundrie is. But Dog believes he is close to tracking him down. Joining me now for more on the search is former F.B.I. Special Agent John McVeigh. John just on the Monster Energy Drink, that's not Brian's. He is a hippie. He's already on the record as refusing a Poland Spring water bottle because it was made of plastic. He doesn't strike me as the Monster Energy Drink guy.

We sent WATTERS' WORLD producers to the garment district here in the city to see what's going on for themselves, and within the first 10 minutes, they encountered a junkie reeking of urine sitting by piles of trash and needles. They saw another guy shooting up over and over again while crowds of people just walk by. Kids, elderly couples. Our producers saw drugged out zombies just walking around falling down, high as hell. Now, it's a disgrace that we've allowed the greatest city in the country to deteriorate like this. We have a budget here over $100 billion and we want our citizens to get help. We want them to get clean and off the streets. So, where is the money going? Politicians just steal it and buy votes with it and then just let the citizens rot. And this isn't just in New York City, it's happening in blue cities all across the country. Open air drug markets in Chicago, LA, Denver, Philly, Seattle, San Francisco -- it's everywhere.

Churches were shuttered, interstate travel restricted. Voting was altered. Prisons emptied. These emergency powers fundamentally changed America just because of a threat to public health. A virus so threatening that the survival rate was 99 percent. Now, that we have the vax, the threat is gone, but the emergency powers linger. Follow along here because this is where the danger lies."

They'll add them up and make their case. And if history is a guide, the government will deem gun violence a public health threat, and use its emergency powers to limit your Second Amendment rights. Judges have to hold the line against this coming power grab. The propaganda for the grab has been mounting. The masses have been deluded by it. Military style, semi-automatic assault weapon, otherwise known as just a rifle. Well, the F.B.I. released its 2020 Crime Report, massive rise in homicides. But let's go deeper. What's the murder method? In a country of over 300 million people, last year just 454 murders were committed by rifle. Some lever action, pump action, some, I guess, AR-15s, but more murderers use their fists and their feet. And almost four times, more people died from knives than so-called assault rifles. A fake phrase by the way, the AR and AR-15 actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, the brand. So here's the point. Over 8,000 homicides last year involved handguns. These are the self-defense weapons of choice in America, especially among inner city gangs who are responsible for a big chunk of the body count. Revolvers, Glocks -- very easy to conceal. So, why doesn't the left harp on handguns if that's the firearm doing all the damage? Something to think about and discuss on another show."

On top of the hideous behavior of deviants like Chris Cuomo and CNN legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, on top of the credible sexual assault claim against Don Lemon, CNN LOL is dealing with a massive credibility crisis. Over and over CNN LOL has been exposed as a fake news outlet that trolls and lies and deliberately spread conspiracy theories. The end result is that during a world changing news quarter, practically no one tunes into CNN LOL because no one trusts CNN LOL -- not even leftists.\" We reported last week Chris Cuomo was accused of grabbing a producer's butt at an ABC party in front of her husband and copped to it in writing. The highest rated anchor on CNN embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, that's news, but the mob spiked it. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and of course CNN all ignored the story. This is why corporate media is dying. They don't cover the news, they cover it up. The networks did the same thing with John Durham, not a peep from ABC, CBS, and NBC after Crooked Hillary's lawyer got indicted for lying to the F.B.I. concocting the Trump-Russia hoax. Breaking news alerts anytime a Trump associate was charged in the witch hunt, but dead silence when Clinton's lawyer is charged for starting the witch hunt. Again, the press just turns the page when the plot thickens, and it is thickening. Durham just slapped Clinton's dirty dossier law firm with more subpoenas. The F.B.I. exposed again this week for odious corruption. The I.G. report found the Bureau systematically lied and tricked the FISA Court for years into getting warrants to spy on American citizens. They faked evidence, hid evidence, abused our privacy, and the media again hiding this sleaze from the country. Jim Comey signed off on all of it. But the most corrupt F.B.I. Chief since Hoover skedaddled with a Fed book deal and just basked in the glow of left- wing worship. That's the retirement package when you run the resistance. They're throwing it in our faces now. POLITICO just confirmed Hunter Biden's laptop was legit, and that's how you rig a vote. Run the October surprise a year after the election. So Biden lied, the family was in business with the Chinese communists and they were holding 10 for the big guy. Don't hold your breath for a prosecution. In Arizona, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 11,000 votes. An audit in Maricopa County done by an outside firm found 57,000 questionable ballots just in that one county. The media wasn't interested in this, and the audit wasn't as thorough as it could have been because Arizona officials wouldn't fully cooperate and some evidence was removed and destroyed. So, there's a dangerous pattern in the United States. Politicians, prosecutors and the press are abusing their power to wage political warfare against innocent people. And even when the abuse is exposed, the press runs cover for the conspiracy. We're picking it apart, but we need more honest Americans on the inside run for office, be a reporter. I'd tell you to be a lawyer, but this country does not need any more lawyers, just the right ones in the right places. So, get it right -- or be a judge. We can't win the battle from the outside.

And today has made it -- you know, five years ago, I used to go on CNN quite a bit five years ago. Five years ago, they at least wanted to be journalists. They held that out as an objective. They were terrible at it, they were lefty, but they did say our objective is to be balanced. When Trump became President, their partisan rage just ruptured, and they are not only today partisan propagandists, they are the left-wing of the Democratic Party. Their mission every day is push the Democratic Party left, so it is, cover up every story they don't want covered and amplify every story they want and they don't pretend at all. You know, you point out CNN covering up Chris Cuomo and the serious sexual assault and harassment allegation. It is simply not news, it doesn't exist. I keep waiting for CNN to hire Al Franken as their next evening host since apparently, you have to be a sexual predator to be on the air on CNN. I mean, it is -- it's a mockery. And there's a reason nobody watches them anymore. I mean, people don't like being lied to and it has enormous consequences. You take something like the border, the border is an absolute tragedy, it is a disaster. If you watch FOX News, and I love FOX, I'm on FOX every week. If you watch Fox News, you know the disaster that's happening at the border. If you watch CNN, if you watch MSNBC, what border disaster? There is nothing happening at the border. Gosh, you know, Kamala Harris tells us the border is secure, it must be fine.

It's a pattern, we've seen it. And now, we're getting more warnings, up to potentially 400,000 migrants coming from South America through Panama, Central America, and on through Mexico, and the Biden administration says, you know what, we're going to go soft now. We're going to really get rid of remain-in-Mexico and we're really not going to deport. Is this a serious response, Senator?"

She was in the United States to be up at the United Nations. She came down to my office to meet with me afterwards. And she described, how -- you know, Panama is right at the juncture between South America and North America. She described how in the last year, they have seen over 80,000 Haitian illegal aliens crossing north from South America through Panama, on the way to come to the United States, and these are Haitians who evacuated years ago and came to South America, and were living happily there. And then word got out that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in charge, and it is open borders. It's open season. If you make it to the United States, you get to stay. Over 80,000 Haitians coming through Panama. You know what the Foreign Minister told me. She said, I've called the White House repeatedly. The Biden White House won't return my calls. She said, I call the State Department. The State Department, only once would they talk to her, they blow her off. You know, Panama's Foreign Minister hosted an organization -- hosted a meeting of the Foreign Ministers, of I think, 11 countries in Central and South America to discuss this immigration crisis. And obviously, they wanted the United States there, because the United States is where everyone is going in this crisis. The Biden administration refused to send the Secretary of State, they sent a lower level individual. So you had 11 Foreign Ministers from country -- from countries that are impacted by this illegal immigration and the Biden administration wouldn't even show up because they don't give a damn about the thousands and hundreds of thousands, even millions of people being hurt by their open border policy."

He lied about over the horizon strike capabilities. He lied about rescuing Afghan partners. He lied when he said he'd stay until all Americans were evacuated, and even asked the Afghan President to lie for him. These aren't little embellishments about crowd size.

They typically give administrative punishments when people step out of line. The fact that they're throwing you in the brig, I think makes them a political prisoner.

If you look at what he said, there wasn't a single politically controversial statement there. He was there to be recognized by the President of the United States, to be celebrated by the crowd.

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "A WATTERS' WORLD investigation. Cities turning into opium dens. New York City now topping that list. Disturbing new photos show homeless people shooting up and dealing drugs just out in the open in the heart of Manhattan. They aren't even trying to hide it, just lining up needles and injecting themselves with heroin and many other narcotics. We sent WATTERS' WORLD producers to the garment district here in the city to see what's going on for themselves, and within the first 10 minutes, they encountered a junkie reeking of urine sitting by piles of trash and needles. They saw another guy shooting up over and over again while crowds of people just walk by. Kids, elderly couples. Our producers saw drugged out zombies just walking around falling down, high as hell. Now, it's a disgrace that we've allowed the greatest city in the country to deteriorate like this. We have a budget here over $100 billion and we want our citizens to get help. We want them to get clean and off the streets. So, where is the money going? Politicians just steal it and buy votes with it and then just let the citizens rot. And this isn't just in New York City, it's happening in blue cities all across the country. Open air drug markets in Chicago, LA, Denver, Philly, Seattle, San Francisco -- it's everywhere. And politicians are always saying they want to help, but they never do. It's unsafe -- and we've had enough. Joining me now for reaction, former heroin addicts, Croix Paquette and honesty Liller. All right, Honesty, let me start with you. How did you become addicted to heroin in the first place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HONESTY LILLER, CEO, MCSHIN FOUNDATION",
      "utterance": "Sure. So, I started using drugs when I was 12 years old, and from there, it progressed to heroin when I was 17. It was just people that I was hanging out with were doing heroin and I just decided to use it. And the first time I did it, I fell in love. My body and my brain fell in love and I did it for about nine more years after that until I was 26, I came to the McShin Foundation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, you have now gotten clean, thank God, and we applaud you for doing that. Was there any help from the government for you, when you were doing that nine-year stretch when you were hooked? Were people coming up to you on the streets? Was there any outrage? Because this is such a rich country, you'd expect all these billions of dollars floating around to get to someone who needs help like you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LILLER",
      "utterance": "Not while I was trying heroin and when I was doing heroin, those nine years. No, my mom knew the McShin Foundation and they took me in the same day that I needed help. It's a local nonprofit that I'm now the CEO of. So no, I never really gotten any government help all of those years."

And, you know, probably almost a decade of heroin use and you know, it just -- you know, it leads a person like me to be feeling hopeless and you know, that was the bottom, you know where I reached out for help."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, when you hit rock bottom, what was rock bottom like? Because for many people, rock bottom is jail, is prison when you're hauled off the streets and put in a place where you can't have access or you don't have anything and you're locked up. Was that rock bottom for you?"

      "speaker": "PAQUETTE",
      "utterance": "You know, actually having been incarcerated a few times, you know, if I want it -- you know, if I want to use, I'm going to use. I've used inside facilities. Rock bottom for me was the day that I realized, you know, I didn't know how to live and I wanted to die."

In just a few words, all of the help that we say is going out to people to get them clean, what is the most important thing in your opinion?"

You know, it's not just -- it's not just the addicts and the alcoholics that are affected. There are families all across the country that are being affected by, you know, by this opioid epidemic."
