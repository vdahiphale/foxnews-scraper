There's no consequences, there's no deal, there's nothing concrete. He said Putin is innocent, just some criminals in Russia did it, we'll see if he can stop it, he calls it a constructive summit.   So, then the reporter says, what makes you think that Vladimir Putin is actually going to stop doing this? And Joe Biden says because Vladimir cares about world opinion. Vladimir cares that other people in the world think about him and he wouldn't want to hurt his popularity and the rest of the world. I'm thinking to myself that's actually Biden. Biden cares about what the Russians think about us, what the Chinese think about it and what the Europeans think. And so, he is not America first because he doesn't want to be the bad guy even if being the bad guy is good for America. He wants to be loved more than respected and that's the key to the Biden doctrine. Then the reporter says, I think it was Doocy, did you ask Vlad for help about getting to the bottom of the China virus? And Biden says no. No, I didn't really do that. And again, China is really concerned about world opinion and their image in the world is really taking a beating, like China is going to say yes, it came from the lab just to boost their popularity.  He doesn't get it.  Next reporter, Mr. President, you are saying the hacks came from inside Russia but Vlad is saying no, they didn't. Actually, hacks come from America. So how is this a constructive conversation? And Biden snaps at the reporter, loses his cool, wags his finger in her face and at this point he knows he screws up. No discipline, and he has to go clean it up on the tarmac before he gets back on the jet.",

He was like a teenager yelling I did my homework, you know, to the parents, meanwhile Putin is kind of like a relaxed, alert iguana basking on a river rock. It felt as totally odd. And then this is, it's not entirely Joe's, President Biden's fault. Putin is like how they describe high school in dazed and confused. Here's an analogy. I get older, they stay the same age. Putin has been there being Putin for five presidents. So, every semester America has to repeat the same class, right? But he gets a new guy every four to eight years so there is a no real incentive for him to develop a long relationship, that was also the same with China as well.

But I think he basically said to him, we know you did it, you're going to say you didn't do it. And when he -- how he reacted to that in the meeting I don't know. But I thought, again, he reset the relationship with Russia, laid out very clearly, we are two adults and here's what you can expect from me going forward and what you can expect from the United States.  There will be detractors, and Jesse, I don't necessarily agree with all the things you said but I understand some of the frustration that some may have with how this might have gone and we are looking for big deliverables. The big deliverable for me was that he went to the G7 and NATO reunited us there, and then went to Putin, it's like I'm speaking on behalf of the world here. You're not going to have the reign, the free reign you had over the last several years, you've gone through five presidents, you may go to two more, but I'll tell you this. Your big challenge, Putin, is that you want to be relevant and you are no longer relevant. We are going to organize our national security strategy over the next 10 years around how to beat China in a new cold war.

So on that front, Russia is the J.V. team when it comes to human rights abuses compared to China, so if Biden when and if he ever meets Xi Jinping he needs to step up and not let murderous tyrant or tyrants tell us what's right and wrong and say hey, Uyghurs, two million people in concentration camps and go through the list.

We were treating, the CDC, was treating this as another SARS outbreak, which is you treat SARS in a different way than you treat coronavirus. So, a White House or administration, if they don't have clear information you are going to maybe treat the wrong problem.

When you work for the corporate media you can't cut against the narrative. The narrative was this can't come from a lab because they have so much money over there invested in Beijing. Time Warner, AT&T, Comcast, they are not going to send a team of investigators over to the Wuhan lab and start poking around, there's too much at stake, the Chinese will just take away their license and their deals and their contracts and it's over.

There's no consequences, there's no deal, there's nothing concrete. He said Putin is innocent, just some criminals in Russia did it, we'll see if he can stop it, he calls it a constructive summit. So, then the reporter says, what makes you think that Vladimir Putin is actually going to stop doing this? And Joe Biden says because Vladimir cares about world opinion. Vladimir cares that other people in the world think about him and he wouldn't want to hurt his popularity and the rest of the world. I'm thinking to myself that's actually Biden. Biden cares about what the Russians think about us, what the Chinese think about it and what the Europeans think. And so, he is not America first because he doesn't want to be the bad guy even if being the bad guy is good for America. He wants to be loved more than respected and that's the key to the Biden doctrine. Then the reporter says, I think it was Doocy, did you ask Vlad for help about getting to the bottom of the China virus? And Biden says no. No, I didn't really do that. And again, China is really concerned about world opinion and their image in the world is really taking a beating, like China is going to say yes, it came from the lab just to boost their popularity. He doesn't get it. Next reporter, Mr. President, you are saying the hacks came from inside Russia but Vlad is saying no, they didn't. Actually, hacks come from America. So how is this a constructive conversation? And Biden snaps at the reporter, loses his cool, wags his finger in her face and at this point he knows he screws up. No discipline, and he has to go clean it up on the tarmac before he gets back on the jet."

So great job, shades. Not only did Putin have the energy, he went home with the energy. Biden seem way more defensive. He was like a teenager yelling I did my homework, you know, to the parents, meanwhile Putin is kind of like a relaxed, alert iguana basking on a river rock. It felt as totally odd. And then this is, it's not entirely Joe's, President Biden's fault. Putin is like how they describe high school in dazed and confused. Here's an analogy. I get older, they stay the same age. Putin has been there being Putin for five presidents. So, every semester America has to repeat the same class, right? But he gets a new guy every four to eight years so there is a no real incentive for him to develop a long relationship, that was also the same with China as well.

I think it was two adults who don't like or trust one another, I think it was our president making clear to him, I found it a little odd saying these are off limits and I think the second question is what's on limits. But I think he basically said to him, we know you did it, you're going to say you didn't do it. And when he -- how he reacted to that in the meeting I don't know. But I thought, again, he reset the relationship with Russia, laid out very clearly, we are two adults and here's what you can expect from me going forward and what you can expect from the United States. There will be detractors, and Jesse, I don't necessarily agree with all the things you said but I understand some of the frustration that some may have with how this might have gone and we are looking for big deliverables. The big deliverable for me was that he went to the G7 and NATO reunited us there, and then went to Putin, it's like I'm speaking on behalf of the world here. You're not going to have the reign, the free reign you had over the last several years, you've gone through five presidents, you may go to two more, but I'll tell you this. Your big challenge, Putin, is that you want to be relevant and you are no longer relevant. We are going to organize our national security strategy over the next 10 years around how to beat China in a new cold war. You are old news, you are bad news and if you do more we will retaliate, that's what I heard."

I mean, he got us handed to him quite frankly. So on that front, Russia is the J.V. team when it comes to human rights abuses compared to China, so if Biden when and if he ever meets Xi Jinping he needs to step up and not let murderous tyrant or tyrants tell us what's right and wrong and say hey, Uyghurs, two million people in concentration camps and go through the list.

So, I think that he was -- when he said that the people that breach the capitol killed an officer, I think he was being harder on Trump than he would've been on Putin which is pretty divisive for the grand unifier.

And to Dr. Redfield's point, one of the big problems early on is that because China wasn't open about what was going on there. We were treating, the CDC, was treating this as another SARS outbreak, which is you treat SARS in a different way than you treat coronavirus. So, a White House or administration, if they don't have clear information you are going to maybe treat the wrong problem.

And the lab says, bold, this is edgy, he went there. He didn't go there. The guy is retired. The only reason he makes a joke like this is because he doesn't work for the corporate media. When you work for the corporate media you can't cut against the narrative. The narrative was this can't come from a lab because they have so much money over there invested in Beijing. Time Warner, AT&T, Comcast, they are not going to send a team of investigators over to the Wuhan lab and start poking around, there's too much at stake, the Chinese will just take away their license and their deals and their contracts and it's over. So, you can't even say something that's obvious if that is -- it goes against the profit margin. Look, they did it with Smollett.
