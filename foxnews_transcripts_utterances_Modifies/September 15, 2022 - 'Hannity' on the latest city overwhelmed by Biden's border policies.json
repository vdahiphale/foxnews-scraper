We begin tonight in Martha's Vineyard which is descending tonight into chaos. For years, this ultra wealthy liberal enclave featured signs like this all over the town. Look closely, it reads, quote, we stand with immigrants and refugees. All are welcome here. So, yesterday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent 50 illegal immigrants on chartered planes to Massachusetts so they could take advantage of the inclusive environment that they claim is Martha's Vineyard and what they have to offer. But as it turns out -- well, the elite residents there are not actually all that inclusive. They are not all that welcoming. And they don't really stand with the immigrants and refugees and now they want them gone. Take a look.",

In this particular case, they're all, let's see, pro- immigrant and sanctuary cities, but not their city. They have to move from here to somewhere else. They can't be here. Only 50 people. Remember, Arizona, Texas, they're dealing with millions. They don't have space for 50 migrants, not in any of the beautiful homes in Edgartown, not in any of the palatial beachfront of states starting the island, not even where Obama has a seven bedroom, eight bathroom, seven thousand square feet thirty-acre vacation home, probably sitting empty as we speak. What? No guests allowed? No illegal -- why don't we build on of the 12 acres a tent city for illegal immigrants? They have dozens -- they have 30 acres, that's a lot of acreage. Now, keep in mind, nearly 80 percent of the island's residents are hardcore Democrats. They voted for Obama. They voted for Biden. They support open borders. They support sanctuary cities and states. And yet, just 50 migrants later, and the entire island has now entered into a full-blown state of panic -- racism, according to their definition, and xenophobia. And, of course, they're blaming Republicans and Ron DeSantis for their inner rage. They can't handle that they were exposed. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Joe Biden has been flying illegal immigrants in the dark at night to every state in the country. One local state rep tweeted, quote, Republicans who call themselves Christians have been plotting for some time to use human lives as political pawns. It is evil. It is inhumane. Who knew Martha's Vineyard was such an inhumane place to be? And meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom is calling for the DOJ now to arrest Governor Ron DeSantis for kidnapping. Governor, I know you're not particularly bright, but if you want to go down this road, let's -- we'll play and your sanctuary state is not abiding by federal law. Joe Biden and his sanctuary policies for the U.S., that's not abiding by the law of the land. You're both aiding and abetting law breaking, and you're both involved in human trafficking. So if Merrick Garland has not -- did not weaponize the DOJ, both of you would probably be arrested, and by the way, with good cause. Now keep in mind, for more than a year, the Biden administration has been flying thousands and thousands of migrants all over the country. You know, those secret 2:00 a.m. flights, regional airports in the dark a night, dozens of states. This includes 70 late night flights from the border to Florida, oh, so that inhumane treatment happened to Ron DeSantis in his state. The administration is now clearly attempting to quietly resettle the roughly 3 million, I repeat, 3 million illegal immigrants who have poured across our southern border since Joe Biden's inauguration. In July alone, nearly 200,000 illegal immigrants entered Texas, Arizona, California illegally. And remember these are the people who are apprehended by border patrol. So we have no idea how many more may have entered the country undetected. By the way, we're also getting people on terror watch lists that are being caught and some are getting by. That is not good for the country security. But we do know that while the spoiled liberal virtue signaling residents of Martha's Vineyard are freaking out over 50 illegal immigrants, border towns and states are in an actual state of crisis. They have had to deal with millions of illegal immigrants, not 50. And tonight, the city of El Paso is totally and completely overwhelmed with around a thousand illegal immigrants now sleeping on the streets, no access to toilets, showers, clean clothes. The city's congressman called it apocalyptic according to the left. What you're seeing here is totally fine but, what, sending 50 migrants to Martha's vineyard is evil and inhumane, and we can't take a few of the acres of Barack Obama has and turn it into a tent city? Now, tonight, Bill Melugin is reporting that even the Democrats in charge of El Paso just to prove a two million dollar contract to bus these migrants out of town for the next months, including to New York City, another sanctuary city. So let's be clear. When the Democrats of El Paso or Governor Abbott or the governor of Arizona or the governor of Florida bus migrants to -- let's say, oh, that's right -- Kamala -- Kamala's D.C. mansion or the White House or New York or Chicago or Martha's Vineyard, they're trying to draw attention to what they have had to deal with and that is Joe Biden's policy of not enforcing the law of the land, aiding and abetting law breaking and actually giving preferential treatment to illegal immigrants. It's a dire crisis. Some people are dying because they are coming here and by the way, it's made worse by the Democrats far away from the border. They're more than happy then ignore and lecture the rest of the country. In fact, not only is the White House refusing to address Biden's border crisis, they're not even willing to admit there's a problem. Take a look.",

She also knows that her boss Joe Biden not going to do anything about it except light of the American people because both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't seem to care about the suffering on either side of the border. And just last week, Kamala said our border is secure. That's an outright lie. They don't seem to care about the human smuggling, the drug smuggling, the fentanyl or the opioid crisis, and according to them, securing the border and finishing the wall is racist. So here we are with the crisis that is spiraling out of control and they're in full complete denial and they're aiding and abetting in the law breaking. Here with a full investigative report from El Paso tonight, our own FOX News contributor Sara Carter is with us. Sara, I hear it's a mess down there.",

      "sentences": "Oh, it sure is, Sean. You know as the sun setting here in El Paso, we're at a bus terminal that's kind of nestled in between all the tall buildings here. You can see behind me, hundreds of people that have been dropped off here by border patrol daily. So it's a rotating factor. Every single day, more and more people, illegal immigrants are brought here, dropped off and released. They have nowhere to go. I spent the day talking to them. They have no place to go, no shelter, they don't know what to do. Many of them who have family here are trying to collect dollars to buy bus tickets to go see their family in Miami or go to New York City. I hear a lot of people that want to go to New York, a lot of people that want to go to Chicago. Some people are going to Utah. Some are going to Indiana. And what's worse, Sean, is when you hear the stories. Many of the young women, there's actually some children in here right now, there weren't any children earlier in the day, now there's more little children under 10 years old. But many of the women that I spoke to talked about these harrowing trips, you know, through Panama, through the very dangerous Darien gap, where they said many people would lose their lives either from dehydration, either being killed, children starving to death. Some people took four months to get here. Others took maybe more than a month. And just to put this into perspective, Sean, how bad the situation is here, the El Paso police department which has been incredible, I've been talking to officers throughout the day, they've increased their presence here to protect the people, to protect the migrants, to protect the citizens. And while we were here interviewing migrants, the police on an undercover operation, plainclothed police officers gave chase. It was a massive foot chase here right here at this bus terminal. There was apparently a suspect with narcotics which is what we were told. They were running with the narcotics and they were yelling at the migrants, you know, get that guy to stop, get him to stop. And sure enough, the Venezuelans, mostly Venezuelans here with us tonight, were able to stop this man with narcotics who was running from the police. They tripped him into the street, they held him down, they pinned him down. So imagine the chaos for the people that live here, right? And now imagine what happens tonight in the darkness of night when all of these people are left to sleep on the streets and wonder, you know, where are they going to get a meal from next? You know, are they going to find a place to sleep? And they've been granted temporary protective status by the Biden administration. So I can tell you this, everybody I talked to said that the border is wide open. It didn't matter if they were from Cuba, Sean, Venezuela, if they were coming from El Salvador, Honduras, if they were coming from China. The people that I spoke to here said people from all over the world made this journey with them. It wasn't just Central America. It wasn't just South America. It was people from the Middle East, people from China, people from the African continent. So this is a very serious situation. It's a dire situation and for many of the people here, it was a tragic situation on their journey to America -- Sean.",

Now, perhaps, no one in the Senate has played a bigger role in perpetuating the border crisis than Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto. Now she voted in favor of stimulus checks for illegal immigrants. She voted to fund all sanctuary cities. She voted to end Title 42 which allowed the federal government to quickly deport illegal immigrants during COVID. And now, Senator Cortez-Masto could be the deciding vote to confirm now Biden's radical FCC nominee who once called FOX News, quote, dangerous to our democracy and also supports the insane defund the police movement. Here with more on that is her Republican opponent who's making great strides has shown up with a slight lead in the polls recently, Adam Laxalt is with us. This is a winnable race.

But instead, she can continues to stand with him and to see the left lose their mind over the Martha's Vineyard planes. I went to the border and the people are dying on the border now. That's the humanitarian crisis of the trip. And for them to act like they're going to try to go after human trafficking charges for Governor DeSantis, when human trafficking by these cartels is an all-time high, people like Catherine Cortez-Masto are not standing up for women that are being human trafficked. Instead, they're lying on commercials, Sean. We certainly need help in my race at AdamLaxalt.com, I could tell you that.

Also developing tonight, Judge Reinhart unsealed the additional portions of that Trump Mar-a-Lago affidavit, but still, major unanswered questions remain, like why did the judge sign off on a search that was so broad? Why did that happen? FBI agents took everything. Remember, they took Donald Trump's medical records, his private records, attorney-client privilege records, estimated to be over 500 pages, tax records that they had no right to take, passports they had no right to take. They pretty much took everything. They rifled through Barron Trump's room and Melania Trump's closet. The warrant was so broad they could and did take anything that they wanted, but the FBI's abuse of power didn't stop there, because now these explosive filings with John Durham, we were just talking about John Solomon, revealed that yes, your FBI in fact did pay for Russian disinformation and they paid the number one sub source of that dirty Russian dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for, disseminated to a compliant media to smear Donald Trump before the election and then was used to spy on them as a candidate and as a president. They knew directly from that source that the dossier was completely false, bar talk, never meant to be taken seriously. People like Jim Comey continue to sign off using that dossier to get FISA warrants anyway. And this is now without question the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history that the media will ignore. And while the Biden DOJ continues to target Donald Trump and his allies, the FBI is being exposed sadly as weaponizing disinformation to illegally spy on Donald Trump. Where's Merrick Garland here?

You're assuming that there's no executive privilege. You're assuming the alleged classified documents are indeed classified when Trump says they were declassified.

And the judge you know also once again in her order this evening sort of spanked Merrick Garland, saying, you're your own worst enemy. Instead of seizing documents you claim you want, you took everything under the roof. You took things with no evidentiary value that are not only covered by attorney-client privilege, you took personal possessions, tax and accounting and medical records and clothing, and newspaper articles, photographs, and you won't give them back. And so, you know, I think this judge really smells something fishy going on with Merrick Garland and the DOJ because his arguments make no sense. You know, he claims we have no time for a special master, everything's urgent here, well, then why are you appealing to the 11th Circuit which will only prolong the process.

According to these findings, looking at this, there are more federal bureaucrats that are armed and armed heavily that there are members of the entire United States Marine Corps. Now, that includes thousands and thousands of armed bureaucrats in agencies like the IRS for example. This year alone, the IRS spent on $700,000 in ammunition. Why do they need ammunition? They're not a military branch of the government. They're not a police force in the government. And from 2015 through 2019, the Health and Human Services Department spent $14 million on guns, ammo, military equipment. The veterans, the V.A. spent over $11 million. The IRS nearly $9 million. NASA spent over $350,000. And according to Schweizer's findings, civilian agencies in the federal government spent a whopping $1.5 billion on guns, ammo, military equipment between 2006 and `14. And this is the same people that want to take away your Second Amendment rights. Anyway, here to explain more, he is the president of the Government Accountability Institute and an investigative reporter Peter Schweizer. Can you explain why agencies within our government that have no police authority, military authority, why they would need to spend one dime on weapons?",

An organization called Open the Books ran the data, looked at the numbers, and the numbers you just cited come from the federal government itself. So what you're seeing is an expanding role for these government agencies as it relates to not only their ability to use firearms, but they are also being given arrest capabilities, and I think that's a dangerous trend especially when you look at an agency like the IRS or the EPA, where all kinds of things can and do go wrong when these confrontations take place.",

There was a dispute about whether somebody was violating the Clean Water Act. The EPA showed up with eight agents with flak jackets heavily armed. You know, what should be happening in these circumstances is the EPA should be showing up and local law enforcement will be happy to be there with them. Local law enforcement often knows who these people are. They know the situation. And you also with local law enforcement, you have an independent arbitrator who if something you know bad happens, you've now got an independent party explaining what happened. If the federal government shows up basically with the specialists and with the armed agents, you're relying on one government agency to tell you the truth, and unfortunately, that's not happening as much in America anymore.

So this is the problem and, Sean, when we see all these polls that show people distrust the government, what Washington wants to say and convince us is we just trust the government because there's all this anti-government rhetoric. No, the reason people distrust the government is precisely because of things like this. The EPA should not have armed agents. The IRS should not have armed agents.

We begin tonight in Martha's Vineyard which is descending tonight into chaos. For years, this ultra wealthy liberal enclave featured signs like this all over the town. Look closely, it reads, quote, we stand with immigrants and refugees. All are welcome here. So, yesterday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent 50 illegal immigrants on chartered planes to Massachusetts so they could take advantage of the inclusive environment that they claim is Martha's Vineyard and what they have to offer. But as it turns out -- well, the elite residents there are not actually all that inclusive. They are not all that welcoming. And they don't really stand with the immigrants and refugees and now they want them gone. Take a look."

We cannot -- we don't have the services to take care of immigrants, and we certainly don't have housing. We're in a housing crisis as we are on this island. And so, we don't -- we can't house everyone here that lives here and works here. We don't have housing for 50 more people."

In this particular case, they're all, let's see, pro- immigrant and sanctuary cities, but not their city. They have to move from here to somewhere else. They can't be here. Only 50 people. Remember, Arizona, Texas, they're dealing with millions. They don't have space for 50 migrants, not in any of the beautiful homes in Edgartown, not in any of the palatial beachfront of states starting the island, not even where Obama has a seven bedroom, eight bathroom, seven thousand square feet thirty-acre vacation home, probably sitting empty as we speak. What? No guests allowed? No illegal -- why don't we build on of the 12 acres a tent city for illegal immigrants? They have dozens -- they have 30 acres, that's a lot of acreage. Now, keep in mind, nearly 80 percent of the island's residents are hardcore Democrats. They voted for Obama. They voted for Biden. They support open borders. They support sanctuary cities and states. And yet, just 50 migrants later, and the entire island has now entered into a full-blown state of panic -- racism, according to their definition, and xenophobia. And, of course, they're blaming Republicans and Ron DeSantis for their inner rage. They can't handle that they were exposed. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Joe Biden has been flying illegal immigrants in the dark at night to every state in the country. One local state rep tweeted, quote, Republicans who call themselves Christians have been plotting for some time to use human lives as political pawns. It is evil. It is inhumane. Who knew Martha's Vineyard was such an inhumane place to be? And meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom is calling for the DOJ now to arrest Governor Ron DeSantis for kidnapping. Governor, I know you're not particularly bright, but if you want to go down this road, let's -- we'll play and your sanctuary state is not abiding by federal law. Joe Biden and his sanctuary policies for the U.S., that's not abiding by the law of the land. You're both aiding and abetting law breaking, and you're both involved in human trafficking. So if Merrick Garland has not -- did not weaponize the DOJ, both of you would probably be arrested, and by the way, with good cause. Now keep in mind, for more than a year, the Biden administration has been flying thousands and thousands of migrants all over the country. You know, those secret 2:00 a.m. flights, regional airports in the dark a night, dozens of states. This includes 70 late night flights from the border to Florida, oh, so that inhumane treatment happened to Ron DeSantis in his state. The administration is now clearly attempting to quietly resettle the roughly 3 million, I repeat, 3 million illegal immigrants who have poured across our southern border since Joe Biden's inauguration. In July alone, nearly 200,000 illegal immigrants entered Texas, Arizona, California illegally. And remember these are the people who are apprehended by border patrol. So we have no idea how many more may have entered the country undetected. By the way, we're also getting people on terror watch lists that are being caught and some are getting by. That is not good for the country security. But we do know that while the spoiled liberal virtue signaling residents of Martha's Vineyard are freaking out over 50 illegal immigrants, border towns and states are in an actual state of crisis. They have had to deal with millions of illegal immigrants, not 50. And tonight, the city of El Paso is totally and completely overwhelmed with around a thousand illegal immigrants now sleeping on the streets, no access to toilets, showers, clean clothes. The city's congressman called it apocalyptic according to the left. What you're seeing here is totally fine but, what, sending 50 migrants to Martha's vineyard is evil and inhumane, and we can't take a few of the acres of Barack Obama has and turn it into a tent city? Now, tonight, Bill Melugin is reporting that even the Democrats in charge of El Paso just to prove a two million dollar contract to bus these migrants out of town for the next months, including to New York City, another sanctuary city. So let's be clear. When the Democrats of El Paso or Governor Abbott or the governor of Arizona or the governor of Florida bus migrants to -- let's say, oh, that's right -- Kamala -- Kamala's D.C. mansion or the White House or New York or Chicago or Martha's Vineyard, they're trying to draw attention to what they have had to deal with and that is Joe Biden's policy of not enforcing the law of the land, aiding and abetting law breaking and actually giving preferential treatment to illegal immigrants. It's a dire crisis. Some people are dying because they are coming here and by the way, it's made worse by the Democrats far away from the border. They're more than happy then ignore and lecture the rest of the country. In fact, not only is the White House refusing to address Biden's border crisis, they're not even willing to admit there's a problem. Take a look."

She also knows that her boss Joe Biden not going to do anything about it except light of the American people because both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't seem to care about the suffering on either side of the border. And just last week, Kamala said our border is secure. That's an outright lie. They don't seem to care about the human smuggling, the drug smuggling, the fentanyl or the opioid crisis, and according to them, securing the border and finishing the wall is racist. So here we are with the crisis that is spiraling out of control and they're in full complete denial and they're aiding and abetting in the law breaking. Here with a full investigative report from El Paso tonight, our own FOX News contributor Sara Carter is with us. Sara, I hear it's a mess down there."

    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Oh, it sure is, Sean. You know as the sun setting here in El Paso, we're at a bus terminal that's kind of nestled in between all the tall buildings here. You can see behind me, hundreds of people that have been dropped off here by border patrol daily. So it's a rotating factor. Every single day, more and more people, illegal immigrants are brought here, dropped off and released. They have nowhere to go. I spent the day talking to them. They have no place to go, no shelter, they don't know what to do. Many of them who have family here are trying to collect dollars to buy bus tickets to go see their family in Miami or go to New York City. I hear a lot of people that want to go to New York, a lot of people that want to go to Chicago. Some people are going to Utah. Some are going to Indiana. And what's worse, Sean, is when you hear the stories. Many of the young women, there's actually some children in here right now, there weren't any children earlier in the day, now there's more little children under 10 years old. But many of the women that I spoke to talked about these harrowing trips, you know, through Panama, through the very dangerous Darien gap, where they said many people would lose their lives either from dehydration, either being killed, children starving to death. Some people took four months to get here. Others took maybe more than a month. And just to put this into perspective, Sean, how bad the situation is here, the El Paso police department which has been incredible, I've been talking to officers throughout the day, they've increased their presence here to protect the people, to protect the migrants, to protect the citizens. And while we were here interviewing migrants, the police on an undercover operation, plainclothed police officers gave chase. It was a massive foot chase here right here at this bus terminal. There was apparently a suspect with narcotics which is what we were told. They were running with the narcotics and they were yelling at the migrants, you know, get that guy to stop, get him to stop. And sure enough, the Venezuelans, mostly Venezuelans here with us tonight, were able to stop this man with narcotics who was running from the police. They tripped him into the street, they held him down, they pinned him down. So imagine the chaos for the people that live here, right? And now imagine what happens tonight in the darkness of night when all of these people are left to sleep on the streets and wonder, you know, where are they going to get a meal from next? You know, are they going to find a place to sleep? And they've been granted temporary protective status by the Biden administration. So I can tell you this, everybody I talked to said that the border is wide open. It didn't matter if they were from Cuba, Sean, Venezuela, if they were coming from El Salvador, Honduras, if they were coming from China. The people that I spoke to here said people from all over the world made this journey with them. It wasn't just Central America. It wasn't just South America. It was people from the Middle East, people from China, people from the African continent. So this is a very serious situation. It's a dire situation and for many of the people here, it was a tragic situation on their journey to America -- Sean."

Now, perhaps, no one in the Senate has played a bigger role in perpetuating the border crisis than Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto. Now she voted in favor of stimulus checks for illegal immigrants. She voted to fund all sanctuary cities. She voted to end Title 42 which allowed the federal government to quickly deport illegal immigrants during COVID. And now, Senator Cortez-Masto could be the deciding vote to confirm now Biden's radical FCC nominee who once called FOX News, quote, dangerous to our democracy and also supports the insane defund the police movement. Here with more on that is her Republican opponent who's making great strides has shown up with a slight lead in the polls recently, Adam Laxalt is with us. This is a winnable race. This would be a pickup for Republicans. You are now in the lead but it's still very close. Let's talk about first the borders which Nevada has to deal with on a pretty high level."

If she would stand up to Joe Biden, then we could actually get a secure border. She has that much power in this swing state. But instead, she can continues to stand with him and to see the left lose their mind over the Martha's Vineyard planes. I went to the border and the people are dying on the border now. That's the humanitarian crisis of the trip. And for them to act like they're going to try to go after human trafficking charges for Governor DeSantis, when human trafficking by these cartels is an all-time high, people like Catherine Cortez-Masto are not standing up for women that are being human trafficked. Instead, they're lying on commercials, Sean. We certainly need help in my race at AdamLaxalt.com, I could tell you that.

Have we gotten any response yet?"

      "speaker": "LAXALT",

If Catherine Cortez-Masto actually did what she claims to voters and stood against her president said this nominee is too extreme for this appointment, she could actually get this nominee knocked out. The Fraternal Order of Police have said this is the most anti-police nominee in the Biden era and Masto pretends like she supports cops, Of course, the Fraternal Order of Police are standing with me and law enforcement in my state because they know I'll be with them when they actually need them. She'll be there in rhetoric. But it is important to point, in this area with this nominee, with the massive Inflation Reduction Act, with our border, she is the deciding vote that could have gone against Biden and actually started saving our country."

This is like the greatest political jujitsu move ever. He got a state of Texas already this year have had to deal with 1.1 million illegal immigrants. You send 50 to Martha's Vineyard, oh, they can't -- we can't accept that 50 people. Look what happened in Washington, D.C. They asked for $50 million.

Also developing tonight, Judge Reinhart unsealed the additional portions of that Trump Mar-a-Lago affidavit, but still, major unanswered questions remain, like why did the judge sign off on a search that was so broad? Why did that happen? FBI agents took everything. Remember, they took Donald Trump's medical records, his private records, attorney-client privilege records, estimated to be over 500 pages, tax records that they had no right to take, passports they had no right to take. They pretty much took everything. They rifled through Barron Trump's room and Melania Trump's closet. The warrant was so broad they could and did take anything that they wanted, but the FBI's abuse of power didn't stop there, because now these explosive filings with John Durham, we were just talking about John Solomon, revealed that yes, your FBI in fact did pay for Russian disinformation and they paid the number one sub source of that dirty Russian dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for, disseminated to a compliant media to smear Donald Trump before the election and then was used to spy on them as a candidate and as a president. They knew directly from that source that the dossier was completely false, bar talk, never meant to be taken seriously. People like Jim Comey continue to sign off using that dossier to get FISA warrants anyway. And this is now without question the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history that the media will ignore. And while the Biden DOJ continues to target Donald Trump and his allies, the FBI is being exposed sadly as weaponizing disinformation to illegally spy on Donald Trump. Where's Merrick Garland here?

      "utterance": "Yeah, the almighty imperious Merrick Garland seems to think he's judge and jury, still wearing a black robe elevated above everybody else, and the judge in diplomatic terms spanked him and said, look, you're arguing assumptions and you haven't given the other individual here Donald Trump an opportunity to make a counter-argument. You're assuming that there's no executive privilege. You're assuming the alleged classified documents are indeed classified when Trump says they were declassified. And so, the judge said it's not up to you. These are issues of law and fact that are to be litigated and we're first going to have an independent neutral individual go through all of these documents and then will it litigate things like classified and executive privilege. And the judge you know also once again in her order this evening sort of spanked Merrick Garland, saying, you're your own worst enemy. Instead of seizing documents you claim you want, you took everything under the roof. You took things with no evidentiary value that are not only covered by attorney-client privilege, you took personal possessions, tax and accounting and medical records and clothing, and newspaper articles, photographs, and you won't give them back. And so, you know, I think this judge really smells something fishy going on with Merrick Garland and the DOJ because his arguments make no sense. You know, he claims we have no time for a special master, everything's urgent here, well, then why are you appealing to the 11th Circuit which will only prolong the process. Why are you so vigorously opposed to a special master, somebody who's neutral and independent that would reassure Americans that the process is fair and objective? And so, the judge I think made the right decision and called out Merrick Garland."

We appreciate it. All right. Now, another major investigation tonight, Peter Schweizer at it again, into what he is calling the militarization of our government. According to these findings, looking at this, there are more federal bureaucrats that are armed and armed heavily that there are members of the entire United States Marine Corps. Now, that includes thousands and thousands of armed bureaucrats in agencies like the IRS for example. This year alone, the IRS spent on $700,000 in ammunition. Why do they need ammunition? They're not a military branch of the government. They're not a police force in the government. And from 2015 through 2019, the Health and Human Services Department spent $14 million on guns, ammo, military equipment. The veterans, the V.A. spent over $11 million. The IRS nearly $9 million. NASA spent over $350,000. And according to Schweizer's findings, civilian agencies in the federal government spent a whopping $1.5 billion on guns, ammo, military equipment between 2006 and `14. And this is the same people that want to take away your Second Amendment rights. Anyway, here to explain more, he is the president of the Government Accountability Institute and an investigative reporter Peter Schweizer. Can you explain why agencies within our government that have no police authority, military authority, why they would need to spend one dime on weapons?"

      "speaker": "PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "It's a great question, Sean. I don't know the answer to it. But it's happening and it's happening with all these government agencies that you wouldn't think would need it. And what's happening here, Sean, is we see on the one hand this sort of defund the police movement but at the same time, we see the arming of bureaucrats. And the numbers are quite clear. An organization called Open the Books ran the data, looked at the numbers, and the numbers you just cited come from the federal government itself. So what you're seeing is an expanding role for these government agencies as it relates to not only their ability to use firearms, but they are also being given arrest capabilities, and I think that's a dangerous trend especially when you look at an agency like the IRS or the EPA, where all kinds of things can and do go wrong when these confrontations take place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, let me go through them all. I mean, we're talking about -- you know, a large number of agencies here, not only the IRS, I mentioned the V.A., Department of Veteran Affairs, Executive Office of the President, the EOP, Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services. Now, I can understand if there are instances where maybe they need security, we have people for that that are paid to be in that role. They would be required to have those weapons, not other people in the agencies. That makes no sense to me at all whatsoever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "You're right, Sean. And the other thing that's happening is increasingly these agencies are using force or showing power, that is showing guns to ordinary Americans. There was an incident a few years ago in a town in Alaska, a town called Chicken, Nebraska, there's full-time residents there. There was a dispute about whether somebody was violating the Clean Water Act. The EPA showed up with eight agents with flak jackets heavily armed. You know, what should be happening in these circumstances is the EPA should be showing up and local law enforcement will be happy to be there with them. Local law enforcement often knows who these people are. They know the situation. And you also with local law enforcement, you have an independent arbitrator who if something you know bad happens, you've now got an independent party explaining what happened. If the federal government shows up basically with the specialists and with the armed agents, you're relying on one government agency to tell you the truth, and unfortunately, that's not happening as much in America anymore. So this is not just about waste and you know misuse of government funds. This is about civil liberties and of how disputes and conflicts with the government are going to be handled, and this is certainly not the way to do it."

      "utterance": "\"The Washington Examiner\" in June of 2021 reported on EPA armed agents, 12 armed agents that had little EPA badges on and everything, did a raid -- were doing raids on car shops. Why would the EPA armed be going into a car shop with their guns drawn? What, there's too many emissions coming out of the facility or what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, you're very close, Sean. The claim was that certain auto shops were violating the Clean Air Act. Rather than you know a couple of bureaucrats showing up to run tests, maybe you have the sheriff there if you think the guy is going to be hostile, they showed up at one shop with 12 armed agents. And, of course guess what, no violations of the Clean Air Act were found. So this is the problem and, Sean, when we see all these polls that show people distrust the government, what Washington wants to say and convince us is we just trust the government because there's all this anti-government rhetoric. No, the reason people distrust the government is precisely because of things like this. The EPA should not have armed agents. The IRS should not have armed agents. And by the way, there are government audits that show these agencies are not good at training these agents because that's not what they're designed to do. So let's leave it for law enforcement and let's not keep arming federal bureaucrats. It's a very dangerous route for us to go."

When we come back, all right, Gavin Newsom, not the brightest guy in the world, is now asking the Department of Justice, which in fact has been weaponized, to consider kidnapping charges against Governor Ron DeSantis and Governor Greg Abbott for moving migrants out of their states. Well, if he does that, he'd have to include himself and Joe Biden in the warrant because they're just as guilty. We'll check in with Leo 2.0 Terrell, Larry Elder, they're next, as we continue."

So ask yourself, why aren't these liberal enclaves in sanctuary states like California, cities like New York and Massachusetts, and D.C., why aren't they more welcoming of these migrants that they say they're so welcoming of? They're getting just a tiny glimpse of what border states and communities are suffering from day after day because of Joe Biden's open borders plan, his unwillingness to enforce the law of the land.

You know, Ronald Reagan used to say if they won't see the lights, you got to make them feel the heat. Bravo to Governor Abbott, bravo to Governor DeSantis, for bringing this problem to their doorstep. All the fentanyl coming across the borders you've been talking about all day, all the costs, the expense, the drugs, the pressure on the borders, the educational expenses, the medical expenses. If illegal aliens turned residents turned citizens would vote Republican, we wouldn't be having this conversation. The border will be shut tighter than the clamps behind. It's all for votes and it's outrageous. Until independents and sane Democrats realize the level of the problem, we're going to keep having this problem.
