That -- the whole thing capitulated and Mexico cooperated. He won this round in a highly visual manner. Now, the new media angle is this wasn't a story until Trump needed one, right? Nobody ever knew about this caravan. Well, you're absolutely right. You figured out how Trump works. He takes a story that the media ignores and then he makes it his story.

Perhaps, President Obama was worried because of the drug war and the escalating violence and homicides on the border. This isn't the first president who's done that. You wouldn't know that by the hysterical reaction on the left. But, anytime you're going to spend a bunch of money like this, you better have a point to it, because when President Bush sent 6,000 National Guard troops, it cost about half a billion dollars. And it's a lot of money. And it's money that we don't have.   I also understand it's a way of the president looking like he's doing something because, right now, congress is not going to give him money for the wall. You know, they may give him a little bit of seed money. $1.5 billion really isn't that much. And so, this is the only other thing he can do to show that he's doing something. We also have to ask, what kind of a hellhole is Honduras? That's number one. What is going on in that country that people are leaving in droves and taking a very perilous journey through Mexico? The other question is what is Mexico's immigration policy? And is the president putting pressure on them to do their work for that leg of the journey?",

It is a little terrifying that, you know, you talk about collusion, which as we get deeper and deeper into this investigation, that seems like a flimsier reach. But, it appears as though you have the director of the CIA meeting with the senate minority leader who then goes to the FBI director imploring him to at least start an investigation into something that, at this point, if you take those facts, seems kind of manufactured. If it's not manufactured, if there is substance there, then if we can't see it, and we should be able to see it, we absolutely should, as Americans, have that level of transparency. If we can't see it -- Kimberly's right, our elected officials and the ones who have that highest level clearance should be able to go into those secure facilities and read that information.",

He had already been elected Senate majority whip. I guess he was in the minority. So -- but the whip. And then secondly he was the frontrunner for the '72 nomination in the Democratic Party. So there was a lot going on here. But I must say I'm reminded that when there was a book going on about Ronald Reagan and Alzheimer's and the like, all then the right came out, and they were defensive and said this is not true. We don't want this book out, et cetera. Now you have a book about the Kennedys, and it's the left wing that's saying, \"Oh, we don't want this.\" Bob Shrum and all the other Kennedy acolytes are saying, what do we need this.

The Baltimore Orioles invited him to Orioles Park at Camden Yards to talk with coaches and players, even got his own jersey. By the way, if you doubt that a one-armed baseball player can make it to the majors, think about this. Remember, Yankee pitcher Jim Abbott. He played ten seasons.

That -- the whole thing capitulated and Mexico cooperated. He won this round in a highly visual manner. Now, the new media angle is this wasn't a story until Trump needed one, right? Nobody ever knew about this caravan. Well, you're absolutely right. You figured out how Trump works. He takes a story that the media ignores and then he makes it his story. Especially -- like, look at Kate Steinle. This is like -- he takes something that is very visual that people understand, and he makes it a national story. Much like what Fox News does.

You know, maybe President Bush was worried that there were terrorists who are going to pour over the border. Perhaps, President Obama was worried because of the drug war and the escalating violence and homicides on the border. This isn't the first president who's done that. You wouldn't know that by the hysterical reaction on the left. But, anytime you're going to spend a bunch of money like this, you better have a point to it, because when President Bush sent 6,000 National Guard troops, it cost about half a billion dollars. And it's a lot of money. And it's money that we don't have. I also understand it's a way of the president looking like he's doing something because, right now, congress is not going to give him money for the wall. You know, they may give him a little bit of seed money. $1.5 billion really isn't that much. And so, this is the only other thing he can do to show that he's doing something. We also have to ask, what kind of a hellhole is Honduras? That's number one. What is going on in that country that people are leaving in droves and taking a very perilous journey through Mexico? The other question is what is Mexico's immigration policy? And is the president putting pressure on them to do their work for that leg of the journey?"

What you're seeing, what you saw with that caravan, was the old school meeting the new school. The old school, hardline, no B.S., send in the army Trump, goes up against -- to the social justice grievance culture that's been around for years, which speaks of amnesty and speaks of sanctuary cities. And, to quote Juan, guess what, he walked all over them. Trump walked all over it. He won. He stood his ground. You know -- I will never use the phrase Reaganesque, but it reminds me of Reagan.

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Look, the documents that we're under subpoena have been in place since August of last year. This is a two-page document. It is not some big massive file. It is a two page document that the intelligence committee wants to see. They were told they could see it. Trey Gowdy went over to see it. Then they redacted a bunch. Then, they went through these arguments. Trey Gowdy went back over after they agreed to, you know, unveil it. Again, this one paragraph is redacted. And it begs the question why, because it is the genesis of this investigation. It is the document you're supposed to fill out to start this. The part about John Brennan is really kind of mysterious, because here is John Brennan, he's the head of the CIA, he then goes and talks to Harry Reid, less than 48 hours, of the allegation in the book, less than 48 hours, Harry Reid then sends a letter to the FBI demanding that they go and do this investigation. So, what is Brennan's role? You've got Brennan, you've got the FBI director, you've got, you know, the CIA is involved here. It really does beg the question why. And I think it's very legitimate for the oversight of the intelligence operations and the FBI to say how did you start this? What's sort of vetting? And, Trey Gowdy is exactly right. They should be able to see that."

We shouldn't have this kind of secrecy, especially as it relates to this. We need to know. And they have the right to be able to see it. So, why isn't it happening?

      "utterance": "Yeah, fresh attacking they're already spying, so chances are they've already know. But, it's really shocking to think that this entire investigation was launched because George Papadopoulos was drunk. You know, if you had a special counsel that was launched every time someone was hammered in D.C., and was going on and on about some internal conspiracy theory, the government would have gone broke decades ago. It is a little terrifying that, you know, you talk about collusion, which as we get deeper and deeper into this investigation, that seems like a flimsier reach. But, it appears as though you have the director of the CIA meeting with the senate minority leader who then goes to the FBI director imploring him to at least start an investigation into something that, at this point, if you take those facts, seems kind of manufactured. If it's not manufactured, if there is substance there, then if we can't see it, and we should be able to see it, we absolutely should, as Americans, have that level of transparency. If we can't see it -- Kimberly's right, our elected officials and the ones who have that highest level clearance should be able to go into those secure facilities and read that information."

You can throw the tarmac incident or calling an investigation a matter. These are all the same people with this, like, kind of like, irrational fear that something awful was going to happen. However, we have to settle this, perhaps with a penalty kick, because right now this Nunes thing is counter programming -- it's counter programming to the collusion, right? They throw up the collusion, then Nunes does this. But, the bottomline is, to Kennedy's point is, there's this much evidence in April 2018 of collusion as there was in January 2017. And watching the media trying to create a Watergate out of this is like watching a chimp do a crossword puzzle. It's not going to happen. So let it go. You're boring the hell out if us.

And after this, she said she could never vote for him. So that was telling to me. So I'm interested because I don't know the story, and it is a politically intriguing story, because it looks to me like much of the reason that they didn't go within the ten hours that you mentioned, Jason, is that they were trying to create a cover-up to save his political career. He had already been elected Senate majority whip. I guess he was in the minority. So -- but the whip. And then secondly he was the frontrunner for the '72 nomination in the Democratic Party. So there was a lot going on here. But I must say I'm reminded that when there was a book going on about Ronald Reagan and Alzheimer's and the like, all then the right came out, and they were defensive and said this is not true. We don't want this book out, et cetera. Now you have a book about the Kennedys, and it's the left wing that's saying, \"Oh, we don't want this.\" Bob Shrum and all the other Kennedy acolytes are saying, what do we need this. What's this about? This is not true. I'd like to know the truth. I hope it's a good movie. I hope it's more than just left versus right warfare."

We're at a point with all of this, where it's beyond trying to see another person's point of view. Things that are happening in our country are so bad, and it comes from Trump. So I don't care about Roseanne. They want that thing, fine. We have real issues in this country.\" Greg, can you translate? What exactly is Robert de Niro saying?

He just wants his opinion heard so you can ignore the old, simpering gasbag that he's become or find him entertaining, which I do. But remember, he also advocated at one point physical violence. So the two things he's doing, advocating some kind of violence at some point and eliminating words, means there's no step between anger and violence. Like he doesn't want to have that step, which is a little bit interesting."

And, you know, for half of that time almost, President Obama was, of course, the commander in chief. And, you know, a lot of working-class people in this country were not helped.
