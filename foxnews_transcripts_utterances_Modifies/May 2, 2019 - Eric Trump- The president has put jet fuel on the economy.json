      "sentences": "All right. Buckle up, welcome to “Hannity,” thank you for being with us. We have multiple major developments to bring you, including proof that Comey's deep state cabal spied on the Trump campaign. We have tonight breaking news, an admission from Ukrainian embassy -- in fact, the DNC did try to collude with their government during the 2016 election. We actually have evidence.  We are going to show you how the Democratic Party is unraveling right before your eyes, lawmakers, presidential candidates alike literally melting down because they are Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion fantasy -- it's over. Anything from here on is just noise, nothing more, noise.  The witch hunt is done. Mueller has gone home. No collusion, no obstruction.  They lost, they lied, they conspired, they send out conspiracy theories and hoaxes. And now, the boomerang of justice is in full motion. We start tonight, a breaking report from \"The New York Times\" which might have actually gotten something straight for a change, amazing, they even said wow, the dossier might actually be Russian disinformation to influence the 2016 election, the one Hillary played for. But according to the paper, their news tonight, deep state spying against the Trump campaign did occur, a little late, but in a big way.  The headline reads, quote: FBI sent investigator posing as assistant to meet with Trump aide in 2016. The article details a London meeting between a female FBI investigator working undercover, a Cambridge professor, and a foreign policy expert named Stefan Halper. Here, we've talked a lot about this. And Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, he spent two weeks in jail. The meet-up was supposed to be a foreign policy strategy session. The undercover investigator, well, set up the meeting. Halper was working as a secret FBI informant, and the pair both worked in unison to spy on Papadopoulos to set the Trump campaign up.  Quote: the conversation at a London bar in September 2016 took a strange turn when the woman sitting across from George Papadopoulos asked a direct question: was the Trump campaign working with Russia?   Keep in mind, Halper was also set up, multiple meetings with Trump campaign aide Carter Page, and Sam Clovis, and who is being wiretapped. Another way they spied on the Trump campaign by the FBI after the FBI director, Comey, and others obtained that FISA warrant using Hillary Clinton's opposition research, what \"The New York Times\" now suggesting could be Russian disinformation, the phony, unverified dossier, the dirty, Russian dossier. Wow, it is all beginning to come into focus, as I have been predicting. None of these spying sessions yielded any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, because there was no collusion. But without a doubt, spying, the attorney general's right, did occur, in the height of a presidential election under the Biden-Obama administration watch, against an opposition party candidate, who knew, what, when? We will get those answers eventually.   Tonight, Democrats -- they are pretty detached from reality. Anything from here on in, it is noise. They can't handle -- they couldn't handle the election loss, they can handle no collusion, no obstruction. But it's over. But watch them anyway.",

They are protecting us every day, the 99 percent, thank God for the premiere law enforcement agency in the entire world, the FBI, the 99 percent.  Tonight, though, we know the deep state aggressively spied on the Trump campaign during and after the election. That is the biggest abuse of power. That's what we've got to solve, and if we don't get to the bottom of it, we lose the country.  No sign that the Clinton campaign faced any similar scrutiny, even though, as it turns out, well, there was a massive amount of evidence that Clinton and the DNC more than once -- pay close attention -- trying to collude with foreign governments. Don't take it from me, just look at what the Ukrainian embassy confirmed to \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, who will join us with a minute. Bombshell new report from him details the government of Ukraine is accusing a DNC contractor named Alexandra Chalupa of attempting to collude with their government, saying that she, quote, sought information from the Ukrainian government on Paul Manafort's dealings inside the country in the hopes of forcing the issue before Congress.  According to the ambassador's office, Chalupa also, quote, tried to arrange for the Ukrainian president to comment on Manafort's Russian ties on a U.S. visit during the 2016 campaign. Evidence, this comes after Ukrainian court found that high ranking officials inside its government sought to help Hillary Clinton win the election, an admission from Bruce Ohr that a Ukrainian lawmaker was feeding phony, anti-Trump dirt to Fusion GPS, the firm that, well, yes, Bruce Ohr's wife Nellie worked for, the firm responsible for the bought and paid for, Russian lies to influence the 2016 election.   It might have been Russian disinformation according to \"The New York Times,\" and we're gong to have more in my monologue in a moment. Joining us first now to break down the shocking new developments, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. John, let me just remind people, there is another aspect of this. We played the tape.

And the truth of the matter is where -- the evidence did not pan out, the story that the Democrats built on Russia to accuse President Trump of colluding with them did not pan out. It turned out there was no collusion. In Ukraine, you see clear evidence now that Democratic figures starting with the Obama White House and now a Democratic National Committee contractor were asking for Ukraine's help in building the story about Paul Manafort and trying to tar Donald Trump with it. And the ambassador is very clear about what happened. She came in, she had this plan to get this information and she would break it in Congress and then try to get Donald Trump disqualified in the election in the fall, so they have an October surprise plan, so to speak, or maybe September surprise.  But the ambassador says it's clearly happened in one of his deputies told me Ukraine actually went and gathered all of the evidence to see what they had on Donald Trump. The ambassador said ultimately they chose not to give it to this woman because they knew what she was asking was unlawful intervention in the U.S. election. But pretty extraordinary that the party that gave us the Russia collusion narrative, the full story, was colluding itself with the Ukrainian -- or trying to collude with the Ukrainian government.",

No \"I believers\", but if they can bludgeon Kavanaugh, it matters.

That email was sent two weeks before the Ukrainians illegally leaked the Manafort documents in Ukraine, which sent the beginnings -- really the origins of a lot of this false Russian narrative.

Yes, abuse of power within the upper ranks of the FBI and DOJ will be looked into. This counterintelligence, quote, \"narrative,\" how did it all happen? We will get to the bottom of it. Hillary's, yes, how did she get a rigged investigation? That too is now being looked at. Nadler apparently doesn't believe his fellow Democrats have the intellectual capacity, though, to question the attorney general of the United States. House Oversight, it belongs to House members, not their staff, not unelected, not unaccountable attorneys. Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia said it best, saying, quote, over the 206-year history of this committee, staff have never questioned witnesses in an oversight hearing. Never, not once. So to say that Chairman Nadler's demands are unprecedented would be an understatement. Well said, Congressman. Now, Democrats -- they are becoming noticeably unhinged even more, and it is not a pretty picture. This is sort of like election night 2016 on super steroids and human growth hormone. Today, Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen tried to sent a political message to Barr by chomping down on some fried chicken in the middle of a committee hearing. I'm not making -- that happens to be my favorite, by the way. Other Democrats took a more predictable approach, demanded Barr be impeached for misrepresenting the Mueller report and his initial letter, even though Mueller admitted that Barr summary was not in any way -- nothing was inaccurate, nothing was illegal. I'm sorry, misleading. Nothing.  And Barr was under no legal obligation to release any portion of the Mueller report, and still the hysteria ensued. As a matter of fact, it was the Democrats after the independent counsel law -- people like Nadler didn't even want the Starr report released, which was mandated. There were 11 separate felonies in the Starr report that they said Clinton committed. Yes, very different story. Editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" they don't agree. They wrote this: This trashing of Bill Barr shows how frustrated and angry Democrats continue to be that the special counsel came up empty in his Russia collusion probe. \"The Journal' called Barr a real attorney general that is getting smeared for refusing to duck and cover like Loretta Lynch, writing, Lynch, quote, failed as Obama's last attorney general to make a prosecutorial judgment about Hillary Clinton's misuse of classified information. Ms. Lynch cowered before the bullying of then FBI Director Comey, who absolved Mrs. Clinton of all wrongdoing. And this brings us full circle right back to Hillary Clinton, from Ukrainian collusion with evidence to the dirty dossier, collusion might as well be Clinton's middle name at this point. All people must be held accountable, including Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, even Strzok and Page say she made every decision. It was rigged from the get-go. What did crazy Uncle Joe know? Nellie Ohr, Chris Steele, so many other, but not the rank-and-file FBI, not the rank-and-file intelligence people. Investigations we now know investigations are underway and we know criminal investigations are underway, and we know indictments will be coming. Senator Graham will reportedly now ask the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, to officially investigate FISA abuse, fraud, before the judges he appoints. Inspector General Horowitz is conducting and finishing his FISA investigation. John Huber is finishing his investigation into leaks and other matters. Bill Barr is officially investigating all of the deep states buying at all related matters. And in the days, weeks, and months ahead, we must get this right, it's not a matter of, OK, we were ahead of the curve, we got it right, our ensemble team, we dug down and dug for the truth.  Government must never be allowed, the few, to use the powerful tools of intelligence we give them to protect us against their own law-abiding citizens, and undo an election because they didn't like the results. We live in a constitutional republic that upholds the rights of its citizens, or we have no country. We better get it right. We better hold those guilty accountable. We got to stop the rampant abuse of power and make sure it never happens again.

In fact, it was just the opposite. And, Sean, I want to talk about what happened today. You know, Attorney General Barr did the right thing. He doesn't need to sit in front of, you know, the Judiciary Committee and be questioned by people that are not part of that committee, that are just the attorneys for the committee. I think he sent a direct message when he said, look, I even gave -- he gave the report with even less redactions, and they refused, they refused to look at it. So what the public saw, he turned over the report to them. Even with less redaction, and they refused to look at it. That should tell you something about how the Democrats are operating here. This is a game, this is gaslighting, and Barr is not going to stand for it. What is important is what you said, this should never happen again in the United States of America. We need to understand how much of our intelligence apparatus, as well as our federal law enforcement, was weaponized to go after a political opponent, and we need to know that they didn't abuse this beyond what we saw.

And so time and again, the media is not just reporting on these things, they are integrally involved in some of the worst acts that lead us to this moment.

We are going to show you how the Democratic Party is unraveling right before your eyes, lawmakers, presidential candidates alike literally melting down because they are Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion fantasy -- it's over. Anything from here on is just noise, nothing more, noise. The witch hunt is done. Mueller has gone home. No collusion, no obstruction. They lost, they lied, they conspired, they send out conspiracy theories and hoaxes. And now, the boomerang of justice is in full motion. We start tonight, a breaking report from \"The New York Times\" which might have actually gotten something straight for a change, amazing, they even said wow, the dossier might actually be Russian disinformation to influence the 2016 election, the one Hillary played for.

And Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, he spent two weeks in jail. The meet-up was supposed to be a foreign policy strategy session. The undercover investigator, well, set up the meeting. Halper was working as a secret FBI informant, and the pair both worked in unison to spy on Papadopoulos to set the Trump campaign up."

Another way they spied on the Trump campaign by the FBI after the FBI director, Comey, and others obtained that FISA warrant using Hillary Clinton's opposition research, what \"The New York Times\" now suggesting could be Russian disinformation, the phony, unverified dossier, the dirty, Russian dossier. Wow, it is all beginning to come into focus, as I have been predicting. None of these spying sessions yielded any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, because there was no collusion. But without a doubt, spying, the attorney general's right, did occur, in the height of a presidential election under the Biden-Obama administration watch, against an opposition party candidate, who knew, what, when? We will get those answers eventually. Tonight, Democrats -- they are pretty detached from reality. Anything from here on in, it is noise.

No sign that the Clinton campaign faced any similar scrutiny, even though, as it turns out, well, there was a massive amount of evidence that Clinton and the DNC more than once -- pay close attention -- trying to collude with foreign governments. Don't take it from me, just look at what the Ukrainian embassy confirmed to \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, who will join us with a minute. Bombshell new report from him details the government of Ukraine is accusing a DNC contractor named Alexandra Chalupa of attempting to collude with their government, saying that she, quote, sought information from the Ukrainian government on Paul Manafort's dealings inside the country in the hopes of forcing the issue before Congress. According to the ambassador's office, Chalupa also, quote, tried to arrange for the Ukrainian president to comment on Manafort's Russian ties on a U.S. visit during the 2016 campaign. Evidence, this comes after Ukrainian court found that high ranking officials inside its government sought to help Hillary Clinton win the election, an admission from Bruce Ohr that a Ukrainian lawmaker was feeding phony, anti-Trump dirt to Fusion GPS, the firm that, well, yes, Bruce Ohr's wife Nellie worked for, the firm responsible for the bought and paid for, Russian lies to influence the 2016 election. It might have been Russian disinformation according to \"The New York Times,\" and we're gong to have more in my monologue in a moment.

And the truth of the matter is where -- the evidence did not pan out, the story that the Democrats built on Russia to accuse President Trump of colluding with them did not pan out. It turned out there was no collusion. In Ukraine, you see clear evidence now that Democratic figures starting with the Obama White House and now a Democratic National Committee contractor were asking for Ukraine's help in building the story about Paul Manafort and trying to tar Donald Trump with it. And the ambassador is very clear about what happened. She came in, she had this plan to get this information and she would break it in Congress and then try to get Donald Trump disqualified in the election in the fall, so they have an October surprise plan, so to speak, or maybe September surprise. But the ambassador says it's clearly happened in one of his deputies told me Ukraine actually went and gathered all of the evidence to see what they had on Donald Trump. The ambassador said ultimately they chose not to give it to this woman because they knew what she was asking was unlawful intervention in the U.S. election.

That email was sent two weeks before the Ukrainians illegally leaked the Manafort documents in Ukraine, which sent the beginnings -- really the origins of a lot of this false Russian narrative.

      "utterance": "Let me summarize: Mueller is finished, the investigation, the charges, the lies are all over. But the FISA abuse will be looked into. Yes, abuse of power within the upper ranks of the FBI and DOJ will be looked into. This counterintelligence, quote, \"narrative,\" how did it all happen? We will get to the bottom of it. Hillary's, yes, how did she get a rigged investigation? That too is now being looked at. Nadler apparently doesn't believe his fellow Democrats have the intellectual capacity, though, to question the attorney general of the United States. House Oversight, it belongs to House members, not their staff, not unelected, not unaccountable attorneys. Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia said it best, saying, quote, over the 206-year history of this committee, staff have never questioned witnesses in an oversight hearing. Never, not once. So to say that Chairman Nadler's demands are unprecedented would be an understatement. Well said, Congressman. Now, Democrats -- they are becoming noticeably unhinged even more, and it is not a pretty picture. This is sort of like election night 2016 on super steroids and human growth hormone. Today, Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen tried to sent a political message to Barr by chomping down on some fried chicken in the middle of a committee hearing. I'm not making -- that happens to be my favorite, by the way. Other Democrats took a more predictable approach, demanded Barr be impeached for misrepresenting the Mueller report and his initial letter, even though Mueller admitted that Barr summary was not in any way -- nothing was inaccurate, nothing was illegal. I'm sorry, misleading. Nothing. And Barr was under no legal obligation to release any portion of the Mueller report, and still the hysteria ensued. As a matter of fact, it was the Democrats after the independent counsel law -- people like Nadler didn't even want the Starr report released, which was mandated. There were 11 separate felonies in the Starr report that they said Clinton committed. Yes, very different story. Editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" they don't agree. They wrote this: This trashing of Bill Barr shows how frustrated and angry Democrats continue to be that the special counsel came up empty in his Russia collusion probe. \"The Journal' called Barr a real attorney general that is getting smeared for refusing to duck and cover like Loretta Lynch, writing, Lynch, quote, failed as Obama's last attorney general to make a prosecutorial judgment about Hillary Clinton's misuse of classified information. Ms. Lynch cowered before the bullying of then FBI Director Comey, who absolved Mrs. Clinton of all wrongdoing. And this brings us full circle right back to Hillary Clinton, from Ukrainian collusion with evidence to the dirty dossier, collusion might as well be Clinton's middle name at this point. All people must be held accountable, including Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, even Strzok and Page say she made every decision. It was rigged from the get-go. What did crazy Uncle Joe know? Nellie Ohr, Chris Steele, so many other, but not the rank-and-file FBI, not the rank-and-file intelligence people. Investigations we now know investigations are underway and we know criminal investigations are underway, and we know indictments will be coming. Senator Graham will reportedly now ask the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, to officially investigate FISA abuse, fraud, before the judges he appoints. Inspector General Horowitz is conducting and finishing his FISA investigation. John Huber is finishing his investigation into leaks and other matters. Bill Barr is officially investigating all of the deep states buying at all related matters. And in the days, weeks, and months ahead, we must get this right, it's not a matter of, OK, we were ahead of the curve, we got it right, our ensemble team, we dug down and dug for the truth. Government must never be allowed, the few, to use the powerful tools of intelligence we give them to protect us against their own law-abiding citizens, and undo an election because they didn't like the results. We live in a constitutional republic that upholds the rights of its citizens, or we have no country. We better get it right. We better hold those guilty accountable. We got to stop the rampant abuse of power and make sure it never happens again. Here now, author of the number one bestseller \"The Russian Hoax,\" Gregg Jarrett, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, John Solomon remains. Let's go to you -- I look at, Sara Carter, the statement of Bill Barr, the definitive moment, the big headline, and interestingly, I read a lot every day. I didn't see the understanding of what actually happened yesterday anywhere, except \"The Wall Street Journal.\""

It was, you know, this is part of this disinformation campaign, and they are targeting Barr now because they didn't get what they wanted, which was actually, they didn't get anything from Robert Mueller that show there was collusion. In fact, it was just the opposite. And, Sean, I want to talk about what happened today. You know, Attorney General Barr did the right thing. He doesn't need to sit in front of, you know, the Judiciary Committee and be questioned by people that are not part of that committee, that are just the attorneys for the committee. I think he sent a direct message when he said, look, I even gave -- he gave the report with even less redactions, and they refused, they refused to look at it. So what the public saw, he turned over the report to them. Even with less redaction, and they refused to look at it. That should tell you something about how the Democrats are operating here. This is a game, this is gaslighting, and Barr is not going to stand for it. What is important is what you said, this should never happen again in the United States of America. We need to understand how much of our intelligence apparatus, as well as our federal law enforcement, was weaponized to go after a political opponent, and we need to know that they didn't abuse this beyond what we saw.

Second, the bribes. You will remember Inspector General Michael Horowitz alluded to the fact that a report is coming about the media giving illegal gifts and sporting and concert tickets to people in the FBI to get information to try to frame the narrative about this terrible series of acts that were going on. And then finally, the feedback loop that existed between Robert Mueller's team and the media, I mean, my goodness, Mueller sites the media 138 times, twice as many times in his \"Obstruction of Justice\" law school essay than in the facts detailing the lack of collusion or criminal conspiracy with Russia. And so time and again, the media is not just reporting on these things, they are integrally involved in some of the worst acts that lead us to this moment.

Did he set a trap to get attempted obstruction by the President because he didn't share--"

I think that if these people -- look, if the Alec Baldwins of the world looked at the evidence as it exists, listen to what Attorney General Barr said, they are absolutely - they are blanking themselves out. They're putting their fingers in their ears. They don't want to hear the truth and it has caused the schism that allows a person like Alec Baldwin to be so scornful of hardworking people."

Every day, those people, every day people, the flyover people, the smelly Walmart people, they are the great Americans."

      "utterance": "Yes. And you know what else makes America great, Sean? Liberty, like tangible liberty and freedom, I mean the freedom to do with your economic resources, the fruits of your labor, to make choices for your kid's education, to pick where you go to the doctor -- actual, touchable, feel-able freedom and liberty makes America great. And the irony is the Donald Trump presidency has done more to enhance that than any presidency we have seen since Ronald Reagan. You have more of your money through tax cuts, more of your freedom back through judicial restraint and good judge appointments, regulatory red tape reform, he is a supporter of school choice based on who he has appointed to these positions. Is Alec Baldwin insane? And by the way, one of the great clips of all time is him trying to do your job on talk radio and having to read like a cookbook because he couldn't put together four or five sentences on the radio and callers wouldn't call in. So, Alec, they want to put down a little bit."

      "utterance": "Yes, a judge was all set to rule today on whether a special prosecutor, Sean, should investigate the Jussie Smollett case, but then the women who petitioned for a special counsel, former appellate court judge Sheila O'Brien abruptly asked the judge to recuse himself because his son works for the Cook County State's Attorney and the judge unhappily agreed to consider it. Sheila O'Brien thinks Smollett got special treatment, but State's Attorney Kim Foxx argues that a special prosecutor might interfere with the investigation now underway by the Cook County Inspector General. So Foxx is now against a special prosecutor. But back in March, she wrote an op-ed saying she was in favor of it. Foxx is also trying to prevent the release of original files from her office. She was not in court today, Sean."
