So that's why you look at a couple companies down the road, Johnson & Johnson had some more promising vaccine and that it doesn't have to be stored as cold, it can be stored longer and you only, at this point it's possible you could only need one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but they are a few months behind the rest of them.

I mean, if you ask the left -- not the left because the left are actually closer to the centrists than the never-Trumpers, if you ask the never- Trumps who's worse, Iran in the 1950s or Trump in 2017, they would say Trump 2017.

President Trump knew from day one that the only way for this nation to get out of this pandemic, and he did call it the China virus in that press -- in that speech, was to, as fast as possible to get a vaccine under development, and that's part of what Operation Warp Speed has done, is dedicating billions of dollars to the development of those vaccines, but also securing that the manufacturing and the supplies of those very vaccines, that was he's talking about with Pfizer. So, you got four they are in stage three trials. Pfizer, Moderna is right on deck as well, along with AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. And he also, rightfully so, took a shot at Governor Cuomo."

So, we won't be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so and that pains me to say that. So, the governor, Governor Cuomo will have to let us know when he is ready for it."

But Governor Cuomo, he has to do his own safety review of the vaccine because, we can't trust Donald Trump's FDA, which is ludicrous and shows a complete lack of knowledge about the way that vaccine trials happen with independents safety review board. But also, he said recently that he and other governors will potentially stop the vaccine distribution before it does damage. So, he killed thousands of elderly people because of his nursing home order, so he's trying to up the total of the number of people that he kills. He is an ego with a haircut that could potentially kill you. That's who the governor is."

We still don't obviously have a vaccine for AIDS. There are other diseases that we could -- we could tackle with this and I think you can't -- I don't think you can underplay this.

But we do know that people with less occupational freedom have higher stress levels, we are seeing this in suicide rates so we have to -- we can't just stare at one variable, which is deaths. We have to look at all the variables from zero to 25. I believe we have had a total, in age, we've had a total of 500 deaths. So, we -- meanwhile, I guess like 65 and over it's about 180,000, 150,000, somewhere around there.

And that's one of the issues, the supply chain because for these first two vaccines that will be ready, you know, of course we've heard so much about the Pfizer vaccine, it has to be stored at 94 degrees below zero and there aren't trucks that cold, and there aren't freezers that cold even in major cities with big hospitals. So that's why you look at a couple companies down the road, Johnson & Johnson had some more promising vaccine and that it doesn't have to be stored as cold, it can be stored longer and you only, at this point it's possible you could only need one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but they are a few months behind the rest of them. But I may wait for that one."

And if we can get the FDA out of the way and, you know, really impose some of the right to try stuff that the president pushed so hard, you could see a groundbreaking new horizon in medicine with therapies that can be ready, faster especially if people with, you know, right to try conditions, if they're willing to take them.

We're talking about a nation that is right now, Thursday we had 150,000 new cases, the highest since the pandemic began. We had 66,000 people in hospitals, a record number. More than 1,000 dead, eight of the last 12 days since the start of this month. So, when we come to thinking about how we deal with this, his focus is on we're never going to have a lockdown not in this administration. We don't know what's to come again. Not acknowledging that he lost the election. But the reality is that Joe Biden has said that he is listening to Dr. Fauci who says he doesn't think that a lockdown is necessary at this moment. We had a press conference today from the man who is leading Joe Biden's task force, he said we don't need a lockdown right now.

I mean, when you have Joe Biden's future, whatever, chief of staff saying that everything is fixed and you can't be calling people crazy for being suspicious of this election when people for four years said that Trump was an existential threat to the world. If he is an existential threat, then you are going to do everything you can to undermine it. By the way, America has done regime changes for less. I mean, if you ask the left -- not the left because the left are actually closer to the centrists than the never-Trumpers, if you ask the never- Trumps who's worse, Iran in the 1950s or Trump in 2017, they would say Trump 2017. So, they actually have a reason, a reason to fix an election. And everybody, everybody has reason to be suspicious of this. And to marginalize people who don't buy this, that's part of the game, to make you feel stupid for believing this is not for it. And by the way, Obama is also saying the reason Trump won in 2016 was because of racism. Yes, millions of Americans who voted for Obama also voted for Trump and that's because they are racist? I -- you know, people always thought that he didn't like America. No, he just didn't like Americans."

And you know, he'll get the briefing books. I'm very, very confident in that. But I'm also confident, and the thing that frustrates me is, if Democrats are willing to sign a pledge and say that we will never contest an election again, we will never contest a close election again because it's so childish, then I think I will put a lot of people's minds at ease. I don't think they're going to because if you lose a close election you were going to contest the results in one way or another.

Is she trying to keep up in like a minivan in the back? Does she have a weapon? What happens if a brawl breaks out? Is she's supposed to sit there and watch it. Is she's supposed to help the police officer? This practically doesn't make any sense. So, I just feel like you're going to hear a lot about AOC.
