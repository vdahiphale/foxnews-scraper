With that, and we are now into day four of this recount as the election goes on tonight.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And in the Sunshine State, the ever-narrowing spread in this race for Senate is now down to 0.16 percent.  Today, former Governor Jeb Bush who hired the Broward County Supervisor Brenda Snipes, now says, \"There is no question that Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians' confidence in electoral process. Supervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts,\" says Jeb Bush.  Now, Snipes was caught adding nearly two dozen invalid ballots to his stack of valid ballots. Correspondent Doug McKelway has the backstory on all this for us from Tallahassee tonight. Hi, Doug.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Martha. Brenda Snipes was handpicked by Republican Governor Jeb Bush back in 2003 to replace another supervisor of elections who was deemed incompetent. But critics say, Snipes is just no better.  In her first year on the job, she falsely accused the U.S. postal service of losing 58,000 absentee ballots, later admitting that only 6,000 were missing. Then, the Saturday before the election, her staff dropped off 2,400 absentee ballots for mailing at the post office after mail cares had left for the day. In a 2016 Democratic primary race, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's opponent, Tim Canova asked for an inspection of ballots, but Snipes had destroyed them prematurely. Failing to preserve them for the 22 months required by state law.  And in that same primary, a medical marijuana issue was missing from some of the ballots. Also, some election results were posted on the election supervisor's web site, while the polls were still open, yet another violation of state law.   As for the lawsuits that the Scott campaign has filed against her, here's what she said about those this afternoon.",

It's just that they are not spotlighted like we are.\" And there is a lot of truth to that, but the problem is in Florida, things are so closely divided between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, basically, split right down the middle at 50/50 that each ballot cast takes on added significance. Each irregularity becomes tremendously magnified. Take, for example, this video which was shot today and posted on Facebook by Richard Denapoli. It shows a Broward County provisional ballot box sitting in an employee entrance of the Avis Rental Car Center at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.  It turns out that box contained only equipment, no ballots. But when asked why the box was there today, Brenda Snipes says, she didn't even know about it. Later, clarifying that she was told about it and that police were sent to investigate.   Still, that it end of itself does not engender a lot of confidence. And these kinds of irregularities, people are asking and questioning why they only happened in Broward and in Palm Beach counties and not to that extent in the 65 other counties of the state of Florida.

Now, my goal is that we follow the law. And what we've seen is, you know, in the supervisor election in Broward and Palm Beach County, both of them, the courts have said, they haven't followed the law. We know Brenda Snipes in mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots. We know they have let party officials in. The courts have said, follow the law.  So, what I'm trying to do is get them to do what we -- what we expect. The laws are set up there to prevent fraud, and for whatever reason, they don't want to do it. And let's all remember, 93,000 votes came in after election night. At this point though, I've won.

This is Veterans Day weekend, which means that it's a good time for every American to connect with a veteran. Maybe say thanks for your service. But I would actually encourage you to say something else. Tell a veteran, never forget. When you say never forget to a veteran you are implying that, and as an American you are in it with them. Not separated by some imaginary barrier between civilians and veterans, but connected together as grateful, fellow Americans. Who will never forget the sacrifices made by veterans past and present. And never forget those we lost on 9/11. Heroes like Pete's father. So I will just say, Pete, never forget.",

With that, and we are now into day four of this recount as the election goes on tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And in the Sunshine State, the ever-narrowing spread in this race for Senate is now down to 0.16 percent. Today, former Governor Jeb Bush who hired the Broward County Supervisor Brenda Snipes, now says, \"There is no question that Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians' confidence in electoral process. Supervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts,\" says Jeb Bush. Now, Snipes was caught adding nearly two dozen invalid ballots to his stack of valid ballots. Correspondent Doug McKelway has the backstory on all this for us from Tallahassee tonight. Hi, Doug."

      "speaker": "DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Brenda Snipes was handpicked by Republican Governor Jeb Bush back in 2003 to replace another supervisor of elections who was deemed incompetent. But critics say, Snipes is just no better. In her first year on the job, she falsely accused the U.S. postal service of losing 58,000 absentee ballots, later admitting that only 6,000 were missing. Then, the Saturday before the election, her staff dropped off 2,400 absentee ballots for mailing at the post office after mail cares had left for the day. In a 2016 Democratic primary race, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's opponent, Tim Canova asked for an inspection of ballots, but Snipes had destroyed them prematurely. Failing to preserve them for the 22 months required by state law. And in that same primary, a medical marijuana issue was missing from some of the ballots. Also, some election results were posted on the election supervisor's web site, while the polls were still open, yet another violation of state law. As for the lawsuits that the Scott campaign has filed against her, here's what she said about those this afternoon."

      "speaker": "BRENDA SNIPES, ELECTIONS SUPERVISOR, BROWARD COUNTY",
      "utterance": "I think the lawsuits as they are written certainly cast aspersions on my character, and I've worked here for about 13 years, and I have to say this is the first time that this office or I have been under such attacks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCKELWAY",
      "utterance": "Snipes also told the Miami Herald just last week, and I quote, \"Other places have the same problems. It's just that they are not spotlighted like we are.\" And there is a lot of truth to that, but the problem is in Florida, things are so closely divided between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, basically, split right down the middle at 50/50 that each ballot cast takes on added significance. Each irregularity becomes tremendously magnified. Take, for example, this video which was shot today and posted on Facebook by Richard Denapoli. It shows a Broward County provisional ballot box sitting in an employee entrance of the Avis Rental Car Center at the Fort Lauderdale Airport. It turns out that box contained only equipment, no ballots. But when asked why the box was there today, Brenda Snipes says, she didn't even know about it. Later, clarifying that she was told about it and that police were sent to investigate. Still, that it end of itself does not engender a lot of confidence. And these kinds of irregularities, people are asking and questioning why they only happened in Broward and in Palm Beach counties and not to that extent in the 65 other counties of the state of Florida. Martha, back to you."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "SEN. BILL NELSON, D-FLA., SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "He's using his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process. He is throwing around words like voter fraud without any proof. He's filed lawsuits to try to stop votes from being counted and to impound voting machines. Scott cannot oversee this process in a fair and impartial way. And thus, he should remove himself from any role in the recount process."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. RICK SCOTT R-FLA., SENATORIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "It's pretty consistent for Bill Nelson. He is always confused. The governor does not -- is not responsible for recounts. We have separately elected supervisor elections in each County. They do the recounts, and then, the numbers are sent to the Secretary of State's office for tabulate -- you know, just to put out the statewide numbers. The governor is not involved. Now, my goal is that we follow the law. And what we've seen is, you know, in the supervisor election in Broward and Palm Beach County, both of them, the courts have said, they haven't followed the law. We know Brenda Snipes in mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots. We know they have let party officials in. The courts have said, follow the law.  So, what I'm trying to do is get them to do what we -- what we expect. The laws are set up there to prevent fraud, and for whatever reason, they don't want to do it. And let's all remember, 93,000 votes came in after election night. At this point though, I've won. I won on Saturday. There is no recount that's ever overturned when somebody has a 12,000 vote lead. So, I'm headed to Washington tomorrow to start the process of becoming the next year Senator."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. But we all know that there's a lot of absentee, a lot of mail-in ballot. In fact, the numbers grow dramatically with every election. So, could that account for these 92,000 ballots that they just came in late, and they were sent in on time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, 65 other counties figure out how to do it right.  All right, these two counties couldn't. We don't know. We've been asking the questions. We still to this day, we don't know. My goal is to make sure that this is done properly, that's why I've asked the FDLE to come in, and do an investigation. The attorney general are demanded that happened. I've asked the sheriff's to be vigilant. We want to make sure we have a free and fair election. But we're of over 12,000 votes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, you -- all right, 12,000 votes is corrected at this point.  You lost a court decision today to impound -- you wanted to impound the vote counting machines when they're not in the actual process of the recount. Did you want them physically removed and put somewhere? What did you mean by that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "No, the goal -- the goal is to -- is to make sure that we have law enforcement that's watching the ballots, and watching the machines all the time just to make sure there's (INAUDIBLE), right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, it's happened in Broward. We're still not finished in Palm Beach County. So, I think -- I think there's going to -- there's a hearing tonight. But it's been done there. You know, Martha, one thing people have said to me off for the last few days, they said -- they said -- they said, Rick, you know, keep your chin up, you're going to win. This is -- this adversity will pass. When I tell people's I think about my dad, my adopted father who did four combat jumps in Second World War, that's adversity. I think about my mom living in public housing as a single mom struggling to take care of children, put food on the table, take care of a son that has significant disease, that's adversity. That's what I want to work on. That's what I did in this state, help those families, that's what I'm going to do in D.C."

And you know, and that we've watched this number get -- you know, in a lot smaller so far by the day, and you just point it's 0.16 percent right now between the two of you, 12,000 votes. Are you confident that this is going to go your way when all of these votes are counted in these very blue counties of Broward and Palm Beach?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So you -- you're confident at this point. Let me ask you about the rules, with the 30-minute rule that it's supposed to all be done by afterwards. So, that, that was not adhered to. So, what's the penalty for that in Florida?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "We1l, it's a violation law so they can be -- you know, fine for that violation. And I think, what's going to happen is the next legislature is going to have to go back and say, we've passed all these laws to make sure people comply so there's no fraud. If there's not tough enough penalties, we're going to have to increase the penalties to make sure this happened. Every other County but these two counties could do it. Well, why these two counties can't do it? I have no earthly idea. But we're going to figure out -- we're going to get to the bottom of it."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, what we know is -- what we know is here's Bill Nelson's lawyer -- you know, complained when -- you know, the canvassing board said a non-citizen, they were going to throughout a non-citizen vote, saying they should be able to vote in this election. So, it's something you -- we have to continue to be monitor. Every supervisor elections responsibility is to make sure that non-citizens don't vote. And so --"

But there's a lot of issues. I put out a very specific plan, a 10-point plan to make Washington work similar to what we've done in Florida where we've turned this economy around. We won the best economies in the world now. The great education system, and a 47-year lower in a crime rate. I'm going to try to do the exact, same types of things in D.C."

Axios reporting today that Democrats are readying a subpoena cannon, kind of like the one that shoots t-shirts into crowds at the games, boom, boom, boom all around, there's one for everybody. And the list when you look at it, I mean it really covers pretty much everything and everyone in President Trump's life. Look at this list. There's 85 things on here. It covers almost everything since day one and Jared Kushner is up there, I don't know, three or four times in the list and it goes on and on. So as I said, it's comprehensive shall we say.

      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the Democrats have two goals. One is to preoccupy him, the President, and the other is to run shadow investigations of what Bob Mueller is investigating because whereas Mueller must keep secret, matters he presents to the grand jury, the Democrats will be able to pick and choose what they want to leak and what they want to announce.  What is the goal of this? To wreck the presidency, to drive him crazy.  I've been talking to Democrats all weekend. They believe that they have a mandate from their base to attack the President to investigate rather than legislate. You and I were together when you and Bret Baier on election night were interrogating Ed Rendell. A brilliant guy, a former governor of Pennsylvania, a mayor of Philadelphia, chairman the Democratic National Committee. He said it's a no-brainer. If they want to win in 2020, they have to legislate, not investigate. We're getting the opposite today."

And so, I do think -- there was a poll I think last week conducted about all of the people that they are being talked about running for the Democratic nomination and the number one spot was none of the above. That's not a knock-on other people running, it's just that there are so many people running that the number -- that the number two person was Joe Biden. Anybody, any major party figure at this point can be guaranteed to get 30, 35, 40 percent of that vote and that's -- that could be very dangerous."

Her candidates didn't succeed and that puts her in a bad spot."

But in some polls now, Elizabeth Warren is number one among Democrats in terms of who they like. And also, it's interesting, and I think given what we know about Donald Trump, that you would have a woman. So it's possible that people like Kamala Harris, not only Amy Klobuchar, the senator, but also Elizabeth Warren. And I think there are lots of people who see her standing up for sort of kitchen table issues with regard to financial communities, too big to fail, health care, those are issues that work so well for Democrats this year in the midterms."

We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other. This is Veterans Day weekend, which means that it's a good time for every American to connect with a veteran. Maybe say thanks for your service. But I would actually encourage you to say something else. Tell a veteran, never forget. When you say never forget to a veteran you are implying that, and as an American you are in it with them. Not separated by some imaginary barrier between civilians and veterans, but connected together as grateful, fellow Americans. Who will never forget the sacrifices made by veterans past and present. And never forget those we lost on 9/11. Heroes like Pete's father. So I will just say, Pete, never forget."

      "utterance": "Pretty well. You know, my take on it was that they genuinely didn't really mean it the way it came out. I think they were sincerely apologetic and wanted to make it right. They really wanted to do it that weekend because it was Veterans Day and because it was an opportunity to send a message about veterans and unity. What we can actually still agree on as Americans. And so, I think it was really good."

I feel like we live in this society where everything is, you know, a viable offense, and there's nothing that fall short of that and you can't say you are sorry and be sincere. So now you're going to D.C. and I do want to ask you a couple of quick questions about what you plan to do there. I know one of the things you want to do you said is to make more people young Republicans. How do you plan to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not easy. It's not easy. But I think it starts by explaining our values and may be different ways, ways that aren't necessary sloganeering or talking points but explaining what we mean by a limited government, OK. Where do you want your problem solved? You want it solved by a local representative who you can go down the street and knock on their door or do you really want problems solved by a federal bureaucrat in Washington. We have to explain what we mean by things like limited government, by responsible government, sustainable government, can we really afford all the things we are talking about doing or spending on? You know, the answer is no, we can't. And my generation should take a special interest in that because we are the one who's going to be paying that debt down. We have to wake up and look at the hard problems, and the increasing debt, the entitlement reform issues and all of these things because it falls on our generation's shoulders."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, maybe you and Pete Davidson should do a college tour. It will be really interesting to hear both of you because I think on college campuses, there is just sort of one point of view and that's one of the problems. So then you know, you graduate a lot of people who are all thinking exactly the same thing and i just makes it difficult for people to have, you know, an understanding of what each side is all about. You know, in terms of veterans, you say, you are really proud to be part of 15 veterans who are going to be members of Congress when you get there on January. What's your message in terms of service and the way the nation needs to approach it and to be better to our veterans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say the good thing about veterans in Congress is that when we look at each other on different sides of the aisle, we can at least assume that we started in life serving before politics, right? So, there is an element of trust there. What can we do for veterans. You know, let's start with never forget, right, let's start with being a team, let's start with knowing that we are all on the same side and we never forget each other's sacrifices and never forget why veterans do what they are doing, why our current active duty service members are still doing what they are doing, we can trace this back to attacks like 9/11."

And it was on their backs, as you can see. They were careful not to let the 400- pound 150-foot flag ever touch the ground. They unfrilled it ceremoniously just before dawn. It was a surprise tribute to the Taylor family and they join me now. Major Taylor's wife Jennie and his parents Steven and Tammy, welcome to all of you on this Veterans Day. First off, we thank you so much for your service and for the enormous, enormous sacrifice that all of you have made and are making. Jennie, let me start with you. What goes through your mind when you look at that beautiful flag waving down over your home of North Ogden?"

      "speaker": "TAYLOR",

When they said I might have an opportunity to share a few thoughts after watching the dignified transfer, because the flight was delayed. I had a couple of extra hours in the middle of the night in my room in Dover and I just sat down with my laptop to think and collect my thoughts and think what would Brent want to say, what message would he want to share. As a conversation he and I had had for 15 years this love of country and a desire to serve was nothing new, it didn't start in January with his deployment to Afghanistan. His love for the country certainly didn't start when he met me. I always say long before I knew and I love Brent Taylor I already loved America too. So that was one thing we had in common and still share and hope to pass on to our children, and family, friends, and a great, great legacy."

How did you do that for them, and what made you do that from the start?"

      "speaker": "TAMMY TAYLOR, BRENT TAYLOR'S MOTHER",

I just love history in particular our American history, I am always proud of our country, and our heroes, you know, they gave us the freedoms we do. And so, I just shared that naturally with our children. A lot of times we would go to museums or whatever just to talk about that and if I found a great story about a hero, I would share that with them just so that they were learning these great principles of standing up for what's right and being strong and courageous. So that's what we intended to do, is to help them to be good people in the matter what they were doing. Somehow, they really listened and became, you know, American heroes, really. All signing up, so."

Yes, there's some setbacks or has been some setbacks. But he's just always upbeat. I think he's been that way his whole life and it's just in his makeup, so that was very touching to read those words and I've read them several times to end."

So, I'm in shock. I can't think of another word. I think we are still in kind of shock to have heard that and think someone there -- it had to have been someone there that close that could -- that could get to him and penetrate him in that state. But I know he loves the Afghan people. He frequently spoke of the men he served with and show he would spend as much time with as he could. He had his official advisory jobs that he do and the task, whatever they were, I don't know because he can't give me details. But he would often speak of what they would do in their off hours. They would have, you know, they throw him a birthday party in July, or they would get together and celebrate Columbus Day with the Spanish, or watch the World Cup with the Spanish when Spain was playing. They played basketball, or you know, there are different hikes and things, and just talk of the great love that he had for these people. He was not just there on assignment because he had to be here, because he's obligated to be. He loves the NATO allies he served with, the Americans he served with, and he loves the Afghan people. He truly does."

Brent and I made every decision together regarding his service to our country, his service to our city and our community and the different services he did. And I do in the back of my mind wonder that these poor children have kind of just gotten drag along, they're too young to have been in on these decisions. But Brent has left a huge legacy. There are many people who know him, who loved him, who have stories about him, his own Facebook page for his duties as mayor is a wealth of resources of his Facebook live videos. His posts, his sentiments, he's got journals, he's got books that he has read and mark in the margins. There is no shortage of his own words and teaching to share with our children and we will just have to make sure, especially for the little Caroline, she has one a week. My first thought was she will never know her father. And I think I was very quickly corrected in my mind. Yes, she will. She absolutely well."

You know, hopefully we'll have to be able to put them into a nice video of some kind that we can just watch together sometimes and when the kids are over here visiting or whatever, so that we can just share memories with them."
