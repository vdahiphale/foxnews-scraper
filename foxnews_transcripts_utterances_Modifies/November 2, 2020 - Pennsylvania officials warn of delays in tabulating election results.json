You are looking at a country right now that's going to be getting a lot of  attention over the next few hours, Traverse City, Michigan, where the  president will be rallying soon, in Pittsburgh, where the former vice  president will be speaking soon, in Miami, where we understand now the polls are tightening rapidly.  And keep in mind, in Florida, so many have already voted, that count is going to be confusing to read. And in New York City, where a lot of shop  stores are boarding up, on fears of escalated violence or at least   disturbances, no matter who wins and even if we do not know tomorrow night. Let's get the latest read right now from John Roberts, who's following all this closely, traveling with the president of the United States.   Hey, John.",

President Trump just completed his final rally in Pennsylvania for the 2020   campaign, talking for about an hour and 15 minutes, despite the fact that the wind is blowing here at 20, sometimes 25 miles an hour. And, with the  ambient temperature, it puts the windchill well down into the 20s. But there was a big raucous crowd here today to wish the president well.  The president hopes that they will all get out and vote, because  Pennsylvania traditionally is, particularly this area where the president is, the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area, a late-voting area.  We saw all those almost 100 million early and mail-in ballots being cast.   But, here in Pennsylvania, they'd like to take the measure of the candidate all the way to the end and then cast their vote. The president appealing to people here in Pennsylvania from the standpoint  of his support for fracking and the oil industry. Of course, Joe Biden  famously at the end of that last debate said that he would like to wean the country off of fossil fuels and end the oil industry.   Here's what the president said about that today:",

And as he wraps up his campaign in the very  same city where he started it all in August of last year, he's hitting that final point, that message, again and again, including in Ohio today, a state no Republican has won the presidency without, where Biden began his tour. Biden's now on his second of three stops in Pennsylvania, as the rest of his team barnstorms the four corners of the state. The final message is intended to reach a broad coalition.  But Biden's echoing remarks from his very first rally here in Pittsburgh in 2019, when he said Donald Trump duped the white working-class voters who propelled him to the presidency by abandoning them with policies favoring the wealthy. Biden called himself a union man and took a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying these voters didn't believe that she understood them. And, meanwhile, the campaign revealed their contingency plan if President  Trump declares an early victory or appeals a Supreme Court decision allowing absentee ballots to be counted three days after the election in this state, showing what they see as Biden's many paths to 270 and explaining vote-counting in different states.

In fact, there was a record conducted on Thursday alone  in cases, more than 3,500 new cases here. That's a 24-hour record. But I think it's also important to point out that, for context, there has also been a surge in testing here in the Buckeye State. As I show you some pictures, let me take you inside the numbers, Neil, again, to give you that perspective, so you can see, yes, there is a surge in new cases, but there's also a surge in new testing. Here in Ohio, they have been incredibly aggressive. More than 55,000 taste  -- tests, that is, were conducted on the 30th of October alone. More than 55,000 were conducted on the 29th of October alone. Compare that to just 31,000 tests conducted on the 26th of October or 17,000-plus on the 7th of September. So, clearly, there is this surge in testing. And it continues to be part of an aggressive public posture by these state lawmakers here.

So, there's some potential here for some serious unrest. And it's putting a lot of sort of pressure on us, the news media, to get this thing right. Now, it's important to remember that it's not up to the media to call an election and to declare the results final. It's up to the states and the election administrators themselves.

It started about two hours ago outside a synagogue in the center of Vienna, the capital of Austria, around 8:00 p.m. local time. The chief Jewish leader of the area says that the synagogue itself is now closed up and safe. He's not sure if that itself was the target. But what we can see from social media videos is a quite extreme exchange of gunfire going on. And the police are now reporting that at least one person has been dead and one person has been injured. But there are reports that say as many as seven people may be dead and that the manhunt is still ongoing. Armed police have fanned out around the city. And it does appear to be a manhunt on for whoever is still left. Police are urging everyone to stay away, stay indoors, stay off public transport, while they try to get this under control. As I said, it's a very fluid situation, and we don't know exactly whether this is ongoing or not. But there's a major police operation in the city of Vienna right in the center at the moment. One person certainly is dead and perhaps one more. And they are now calling this a terrorist incident. As you say, it comes during a period of heightened tension in Europe.

That's one. I'm not endorsing it. I'm just saying it's out there. The other one, -- and I'm hearing this a lot, particularly as we get really close to, as we get closer to tomorrow -- is the notion that, Neil, that it all comes down to Pennsylvania, that Michigan, Wisconsin, that probably goes to Biden, Trump picks up everything he picked up last time, Florida, North Carolina, maybe adds Nevada, he keeps Arizona, but it all comes down to Pennsylvania. And if that's the case, well, then it's going to be a couple days. It could be a couple days. And that's where the market volatility gets really interesting. And that's where stocks could trade off dramatically. And I think that's a -- that's a real issue here. And Wall Street is definitely game-planning that. If you talk to anybody at a major trading desk, be it a hedge fund or a major bank, that's what their traders are going to be looking for, whether this is elongated, whether Pennsylvania comes in late, because Pennsylvania is likely -- unlikely to know. And if it's hinging on them, markets hate uncertainty, and it will trade off. So that's the election scenario that people are worried about in terms of volatility. Obviously, if we all know what's happening, if it's done, if it's an early night, well, then you don't have to worry about it too much the next day. Markets today are up. I just -- it's hard to say like why the markets are up today. I mean, it could have been some bounce-back from last week. We had a horrible week last week. But that's a scenario, this whole thing about Pennsylvania, I keep hearing a lot, and because polls are tightening. There's no doubt about that. And it could come down to that one state. And, if it does, wow, it's going to be an interesting couple days -- Neil, back to you.",

For example, Colorado, Arizona, they're a little bit favored by the Democrats right now. The Republicans, they could flip a state like Alabama. But you have got Maine, you have got Iowa, you have got North Carolina. These are very, very competitive races. And, in fact, let's start in North Carolina, because I know that that's one of your favorite ones. You have got Republican Thom Tillis. He is the incumbent. You have got Cal Cunningham. They have both had their issues, right? Thom Tillis had COVID- 19. He was sidelined. And Cunningham had that extramarital affair. But they have both been working hard on the campaign trail. Actually, it's the costliest U.S. Senate race in history, $250 million. One of the recent polls that we're watching shows that Cunningham is in the lead by three points, at least for right now. We're also watching South Carolina, because incumbent Lindsey Graham, some folks are saying that he is not necessarily a slam dunk to win here. He's shown some malleability. And Harrison is attacking him, as a matter of fact, for being an attack dog for President Trump. One of the -- a little bit older poll that we're watching right now shows them neck and neck. The numbers are really wide across the board. But this one could be quite contentious as well. Finally, I have got my eye on Arizona. You have got the incumbent, Martha McSally, and you have got the Democratic nominee here, Mike -- Mark Kelly - - pardon me. They both have really interesting backgrounds. He is a former astronaut. She's a former Air Force combat pilot. And you can look at this poll here from NBC News and Marist. And, as a matter of fact, Mr. Kelly has the lead by six points here.

And they were so wrong in 2016 that I question the polls. I will tell you, I was with the president in Arizona. We had 20,000 people at an airport. Senator Lee and I did several surrogate rallies for him also. There's incredible enthusiasm. It's just hard to believe that that's all discounted, and that the polls are right and he's being swamped in Arizona, when you see that degree of enthusiasm. So, I don't know. It's just hard to believe that -- I mean, even former President Obama had like 25 people in a car listening to him, you know? So, I just don't know how these polls can be correct.

So, the president saying 75, 80 percent reduction in mortality is absolutely true. So, people obsessing over numbers really are missing the boat here. What's happening is, younger people, by and large, are getting infected, by and large, not dying, largely not being hospitalized. And we are gaining on immunity. Nobody wants to go that way.

It's doing what it wants to do, largely or irregardless of man's behavior. In the end, until we get a vaccine, it's not any politician's fault, Trump's fault or Cuomo's fault or anybody. The virus is insidious, and it's going to do what it's going to do. But we shouldn't cripple or kill the economy, because the lockdown has not lessened the rate of infection.",

And, with the ambient temperature, it puts the windchill well down into the 20s. But there was a big raucous crowd here today to wish the president well. The president hopes that they will all get out and vote, because Pennsylvania traditionally is, particularly this area where the president is, the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area, a late-voting area. We saw all those almost 100 million early and mail-in ballots being cast. But, here in Pennsylvania, they'd like to take the measure of the candidate all the way to the end and then cast their vote. The president appealing to people here in Pennsylvania from the standpoint of his support for fracking and the oil industry. Of course, Joe Biden famously at the end of that last debate said that he would like to wean the country off of fossil fuels and end the oil industry."

His campaign message is geared toward working-class Americans. And as he wraps up his campaign in the very same city where he started it all in August of last year, he's hitting that final point, that message, again and again, including in Ohio today, a state no Republican has won the presidency without, where Biden began his tour. Biden's now on his second of three stops in Pennsylvania, as the rest of his team barnstorms the four corners of the state. The final message is intended to reach a broad coalition. But Biden's echoing remarks from his very first rally here in Pittsburgh in 2019, when he said Donald Trump duped the white working-class voters who propelled him to the presidency by abandoning them with policies favoring the wealthy. Biden called himself a union man and took a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying these voters didn't believe that she understood them. And, meanwhile, the campaign revealed their contingency plan if President Trump declares an early victory or appeals a Supreme Court decision allowing absentee ballots to be counted three days after the election in this state, showing what they see as Biden's many paths to 270 and explaining vote-counting in different states. They said there's no basis for Trump to claim a victory on election night."

In fact, there was a record conducted on Thursday alone in cases, more than 3,500 new cases here. That's a 24-hour record. But I think it's also important to point out that, for context, there has also been a surge in testing here in the Buckeye State. As I show you some pictures, let me take you inside the numbers, Neil, again, to give you that perspective, so you can see, yes, there is a surge in new cases, but there's also a surge in new testing. Here in Ohio, they have been incredibly aggressive. More than 55,000 taste -- tests, that is, were conducted on the 30th of October alone. More than 55,000 were conducted on the 29th of October alone. Compare that to just 31,000 tests conducted on the 26th of October or 17,000-plus on the 7th of September. So, clearly, there is this surge in testing. And it continues to be part of an aggressive public posture by these state lawmakers here.

There was a bit of a dust-up yesterday, as you might recall, when there were hints that the president would declare himself a victor tomorrow night if the polls were looking good. His campaign manager said that was not really what the president meant. But what would be the reaction, per this Axios article that created a -- quite a bit of stir, if the president were to pounce on early results coming in, which day of could look good for the president, since it necessarily, by nature, wouldn't include all of the 93-94 million ballots already cast. Let's go to Reid Wilson, The Hill national correspondent. Reid, good to have you. What do you think of that? How -- what would be the impact of either candidate?

If a bunch of Trump fans think that he has won, and then he starts losing votes and losing states as more and more ballots are counted through the night or even into the next couple days, then we can see some serious unrest, and the same thing if former Vice President Biden is seen as leading, and then ends up watching his lead slip away. So, there's some potential here for some serious unrest. And it's putting a lot of sort of pressure on us, the news media, to get this thing right. Now, it's important to remember that it's not up to the media to call an election and to declare the results final. It's up to the states and the election administrators themselves. But, I mean, I know a lot of your colleagues and a lot of mine, we're feeling the pressure these days."

I know, in Pennsylvania, it's problematic because some of them could go on as long as three days after the election to fully count. And other states, like Florida, I believe, do it day of.

Before I get to our next story, which concerns a scary event overseas, I do want to bring your attention to the corner of Wall and Broad today. We had a comeback for the Dow of better than 423 points. Do not necessarily overread into this, just like we shouldn't have read last week and overreading what was the worst week for the markets certainly going back to March and near the height of the pandemic. This was a bit of a comeback rally here. It did not, and I stress, did not include technology stocks. They were taking it on the chin again today. Many of them have entered correction territory. More on that in a minute. But now I want to bring you up to date on a development in Vienna that Austrian police are already calling an apparent terror attack that was focused, we are told, at a Jewish house of worship. We know of a number injured. We're just going with the scant details we have, but it's obviously put Vienna on high alert and elsewhere in the greater European community. Benjamin Hall has more now from London. Benjamin, what can you tell us?"

But what we do know, according to the interior minister, who spoke about 10 or 15 minutes ago on air, this is a terrorist incident and there are a number of people involved. It started about two hours ago outside a synagogue in the center of Vienna, the capital of Austria, around 8:00 p.m. local time. The chief Jewish leader of the area says that the synagogue itself is now closed up and safe. He's not sure if that itself was the target. But what we can see from social media videos is a quite extreme exchange of gunfire going on. And the police are now reporting that at least one person has been dead and one person has been injured. But there are reports that say as many as seven people may be dead and that the manhunt is still ongoing. Armed police have fanned out around the city. And it does appear to be a manhunt on for whoever is still left. Police are urging everyone to stay away, stay indoors, stay off public transport, while they try to get this under control. As I said, it's a very fluid situation, and we don't know exactly whether this is ongoing or not. But there's a major police operation in the city of Vienna right in the center at the moment. One person certainly is dead and perhaps one more. And they are now calling this a terrorist incident. As you say, it comes during a period of heightened tension in Europe. We have had a number of attacks in France over the last few weeks. And so this certainly is something that people are taking very seriously. And we will bring you all the details as we get them -- Neil."

Now, seven counties in Pennsylvania say they won't count mail-in ballots until the morning after Election Day. The state's overwhelming majority of ballots will be counted by Friday.

That's one. I'm not endorsing it. I'm just saying it's out there. The other one, -- and I'm hearing this a lot, particularly as we get really close to, as we get closer to tomorrow -- is the notion that, Neil, that it all comes down to Pennsylvania, that Michigan, Wisconsin, that probably goes to Biden, Trump picks up everything he picked up last time, Florida, North Carolina, maybe adds Nevada, he keeps Arizona, but it all comes down to Pennsylvania. And if that's the case, well, then it's going to be a couple days. It could be a couple days. And that's where the market volatility gets really interesting. And that's where stocks could trade off dramatically. And I think that's a -- that's a real issue here. And Wall Street is definitely game-planning that. If you talk to anybody at a major trading desk, be it a hedge fund or a major bank, that's what their traders are going to be looking for, whether this is elongated, whether Pennsylvania comes in late, because Pennsylvania is likely -- unlikely to know. And if it's hinging on them, markets hate uncertainty, and it will trade off. So that's the election scenario that people are worried about in terms of volatility. Obviously, if we all know what's happening, if it's done, if it's an early night, well, then you don't have to worry about it too much the next day. Markets today are up. I just -- it's hard to say like why the markets are up today. I mean, it could have been some bounce-back from last week. We had a horrible week last week. But that's a scenario, this whole thing about Pennsylvania, I keep hearing a lot, and because polls are tightening. There's no doubt about that. And it could come down to that one state.

And there's also fencing outside of that perimeter around a number of businesses. Restaurants, banks, office buildings have all boarded up here in D.C. Police across the country have canceled their days off and vacation for officers, in expectation of possible unrest. In Beverly Hills, they're talking about shutting down Rodeo Drive to not only vehicular traffic, but also to any pedestrians, trying to prevent that repeat of June looting that they saw.

And that's the most basic thing we need to know is, do we have a fair and free election, and have we counted all of the votes? So, I think the most important thing to urge all Americans is patience.

I don't -- I don't know that that's going to be the case. I think we could have a situation where some of the early states indicate a trend, but it still depends on a final vote count in all of those key states that represent the electoral -- the key electoral votes.

I have tremendous confidence in the states and their election systems to do an accurate count. And I think, ultimately, we will come to a winner.

But these Senate races are really important too, that balance of power that you mentioned, 53 seats Republican right now, 47 seats for the Democrats. A lot of different things could happen. For example, Colorado, Arizona, they're a little bit favored by the Democrats right now. The Republicans, they could flip a state like Alabama. But you have got Maine, you have got Iowa, you have got North Carolina. These are very, very competitive races. And, in fact, let's start in North Carolina, because I know that that's one of your favorite ones. You have got Republican Thom Tillis. He is the incumbent. You have got Cal Cunningham. They have both had their issues, right? Thom Tillis had COVID- 19. He was sidelined. And Cunningham had that extramarital affair. But they have both been working hard on the campaign trail. Actually, it's the costliest U.S. Senate race in history, $250 million. One of the recent polls that we're watching shows that Cunningham is in the lead by three points, at least for right now. We're also watching South Carolina, because incumbent Lindsey Graham, some folks are saying that he is not necessarily a slam dunk to win here. He's shown some malleability. And Harrison is attacking him, as a matter of fact, for being an attack dog for President Trump. One of the -- a little bit older poll that we're watching right now shows them neck and neck. The numbers are really wide across the board. But this one could be quite contentious as well. Finally, I have got my eye on Arizona. You have got the incumbent, Martha McSally, and you have got the Democratic nominee here, Mike -- Mark Kelly - - pardon me. They both have really interesting backgrounds. He is a former astronaut. She's a former Air Force combat pilot. And you can look at this poll here from NBC News and Marist. And, as a matter of fact, Mr. Kelly has the lead by six points here. Remember, this one is John McCain's seat. That's what they're vying for -- Neil, back to you."

      "utterance": "You know, they talk about the shy voter. And there's probably some of that. And I think it may be overstating. But I think what there really is, is, there's the working voter. If you're working, you don't have time to be taking polls. So, I think the polls tend to emphasize non-workers and people who are willing to sit and chitchat on the phone. I think busy people, working people, may skew more towards the Republican side, and may not have time to do this polling. So, I think it's difficult. And they were so wrong in 2016 that I question the polls. I will tell you, I was with the president in Arizona. We had 20,000 people at an airport. Senator Lee and I did several surrogate rallies for him also. There's incredible enthusiasm. It's just hard to believe that that's all discounted, and that the polls are right and he's being swamped in Arizona, when you see that degree of enthusiasm. So, I don't know. It's just hard to believe that -- I mean, even former President Obama had like 25 people in a car listening to him, you know? So, I just don't know how these polls can be correct. We will see how it turns out when we start counting the election. And I hope that the election count will be accurate, and hope we don't have sort of -- remember the LBJ routine. LBJ in 1948 was so mad, he turned in his illegal votes at midnight and said, oh, we're going to win, and he's having his scotch. And then he loses by a couple hundred votes. And he comes back in 1952. And he says, never again. We're never turning our boxes of votes in until everybody else has turned in their illegal votes. We're going to be the last one to turn in their illegal votes."

      "utterance": "Yes, I don't know whether that was just political lore. But I do know Democrats' counter to what you were saying about the small rallies, that's by design, that they're trying to play it safe in the pandemic. And they actually think, Senator, that the president's crowded rallies, two-thirds of Americans polled on the subject don't think it's safe. Now, it might be perfectly safe. You're the doctor. But I'm just wondering that it might not affect at all the Biden vote. In fact, whatever strategy he is using, again, if you buy these polls -- and you're quite right to question them -- many do -- it could be working perfectly for them."

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes, a huge mistake. And here's what the media is missing on the Johns Hopkins data. Spain has twice as many cases, but half as many deaths. That comes out to about a 75 percent reduction in deaths. It's been the same throughout any of the countries. In the U.S., when we had the spike in the summer, we're now well past the month of the spike in August, and the lag time for death being accounted for still shows twice as many infections, half as many deaths. So, the president saying 75, 80 percent reduction in mortality is absolutely true. So, people obsessing over numbers really are missing the boat here. What's happening is, younger people, by and large, are getting infected, by and large, not dying, largely not being hospitalized. And we are gaining on immunity. Nobody wants to go that way. It's not by choice. We'd rather have a vaccine. But, until we have a vaccine, really, we should not be lamenting and gnashing our teeth that people get infected, and the death rate is plummeting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But more cases are appearing, and more positive cases, at that, than we were seeing. And in at least 30 states, Senator, they're seeing an uptick in hospitalizations. So, I'm just..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes, but that -- what that shows is -- but that also shows that the masks and the lockdown and the mitigation aren't working. So, we have twice as many infections, and we're doing twice as much. Everybody's being shamed into wearing a mask. Everybody's being told, you're infecting people and you're going to kill your grandmother and all this jazz. But guess what? The infections are going through the roof. The mask mandates in Europe, when they instituted the mask mandates, the infections went through the roof. Now, that didn't cause it. It just shows that these mitigating strategies really aren't working. The lockdowns aren't working. And I think The Wall Street Journal had it the best when it said, this virus is insidious. It's doing what it wants to do, largely or irregardless of man's behavior. In the end, until we get a vaccine, it's not any politician's fault, Trump's fault or Cuomo's fault or anybody. The virus is insidious, and it's going to do what it's going to do. But we shouldn't cripple or kill the economy, because the lockdown has not lessened the rate of infection."

All right, we have a lot more coming up on this, including the president no doubt eager to talk about these pandemic statistics he said are way overblown, that we are making progress, and, to the senator's point just now, that it's a media fixation that will disappear after Election Day. As he travels to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to pound just that, we will look at those remarks and the significance of them."

What do you say to that?"

      "speaker": "TRUMKA",

The jobs he promised us were coming back never came back. We have got fewer mining jobs, fewer manufacturing jobs, and fewer construction jobs, no infrastructure bill. He took overtime away from a couple of million people. Most importantly, his appointments have done nothing but attack the process of collective bargaining and make workers weaker. The problem with wages in this country, our corporations are too strong and workers are too weak. And his entire administration has done nothing but weaken the voice of workers. You can't say you support workers and we're doing better when our wages went down. Just last quarter, Neil, $637 billion reduction in disposable income. That's not doing quite well for us."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMKA",

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMKA",
      "utterance": "Wait a second. Wait a second. I was talking about the tax bill, Neil. He helped accelerate and reward people for taking jobs offshore. Now, let's talk about NAFTA. I give the president credit for taking it off -- on. But the bill that he brought back, the one that he said was his bill, was terrible. It was unenforceable, and it was NAFTA-lite. We forced him, the working people of this country, along with Nancy Pelosi, actually forced him to renegotiate that bill. It's much better now, but the one he brought back, unfortunately, was weak and unenforceable, wasn't very good at all, would have cost us more jobs, Neil."
