Now, four months after the FBI raided his apartment and took all of his devices, a 69-year-old resident who wasn't even at the Capitol on January 6, is still suffering. He's still not gotten his devices back. He's been shunned by his community and has even suffered two strokes. You're going to hear his harrowing story tonight.  But first, Kamala can't and won't. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".  Today, Vice President Harris traveled to Texas to check the border box and play a game of make believe.",

      "sentences": "Progress? Lies and more lies. Number one, she and Biden were not handed a tough situation on the border. They created a disaster on the border. They did. Thanks to Trump's remain in Mexico policy, and, of course, aggressive interior enforcement. Illegal border crossings were driven way down under Trump.  And number two, by progress she means a total abdication, because most Americans define progress at the border as a reduction in the number of illegal crossers. But for Biden and Harris, I guess it's kind of right. Progress means an increase in crossings, regardless of the harm and cost to the American people.   Now, this is - I like to call these open borders collusion at the highest levels of our government. The Biden administration is committing an ongoing crime against our basic sovereignty, a conspiracy to undermine the rule of law, and their refusal to do what works to stem the flow of humanity into America. Now, this fiscal year alone, Border Patrol has intercepted nearly 1 million migrant crossers at our southern border. We don't even know how many of them have been released either into the interior part of the country. But you know that number has to be staggering. If Harris were a serious person who actually put America's interest first, she would have traveled to where the action is in the Rio Grande Valley. But of course, that would have been too embarrassing and revealing, because there the border arrests stand at a whopping 271,000 and counting this fiscal year. So of course, Kamala Harris decided to skip that region, and instead visit El Paso, which has 2.5 times fewer border arrests, and just for good measure, a Democrat mayor.   Now, everything I saw today was border theater, from beginning to end. There's nothing serious about enforcement, and she was always in search of mythic \"root causes\".",

It's a distraction from the real story. Because while she embarrassed herself in El Paso, the Biden DHS is moving full steam ahead on dismantling our border protections and immigration system. Just days ago, they notified Congress that they were going to release tens of thousands of illegals into the interior of the country, who were previously denied entry under the remain in Mexico program. So we're going to pluck them out of Mexico, bring them back and release them. Isn't that nice? That's not all. Just today Biden's team is furiously trying to figure out how to rescind the Trump era policy that allows for the immediate rejection of illegal border crossers due to COVID, because they care so much about COVID.

Thus, not only will the middle class and all Americans, frankly, be hit with a higher cost of living because of inflation now, but you can also expect wages to stagnate as well. All because Biden bowed to the business lobby in the far left, of course, and they are fine with having a glut of workers because a glut of workers in the United States keeps wages flat. Certainly, keeps them from rising. So once again, we see the ugly truth about today's Democrats. Although Kamala Harris was put in charge of the border issue, she not only can't do it, because she's in way over her head, she won't do it. Because shutting down illegal border crossers means putting America first. And why should they ever want to put a systematically racist country first? That doesn't make any sense.  They don't think it's their responsibility to try to lift your standard of living, or ensure your schools are functional, or to make sure your streets are safe. Because if they did, they would do whatever it took to secure that southern border. And instead, their goal is to fundamentally transform our nation and its culture. So those borders, you bet, keep them wide open.  They're only going to care about the border, about enforcement, when they see that their actions, or in this case, inaction, has really cost them votes. And very soon, it will be time to make them pay. And that's the \"Angle\". All right. Here now, Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick; and Richard Guerra, a rancher from Del Rio, Texas, where we were a few years back. Dan, let me start with you.

Because Trump had the border really under control in the last year of his presidency.  The policies he put in place, like returning people to Mexico really worked. And they talked about a broken system to date, and they broke it. They broke it. And it's purposefully that they broke it. To hear her talk about, we have to be concerned about the children and the families and their suffering.

We don't have any idea in the middle of a pandemic, whether they've been vaccinated, probably not, or whether they're active carriers. 5,000 border and customs patrol officers have been infected. They were diverse at LSI. And they came from all over the world.  This is just one group of Spanish speaking people. It's not diverse like Ellis Island. And they came with the expectation, Laura, to assimilate rapidly, to integrate, to intermarry. That's not the message we're giving these immigrants that are coming illegally. We're telling them that they were part of a tribal identity. It's what's happening in America. And they came in - and people forget about Ellis Island, it was measured. I know that some years, days, they might have 5000 or 6000. But over that 36- year-period, there was about 12 million people who arrived here. We're getting up to 2 million, so we're getting six to seven times more per year across the southern border than we did through Ellis Island. Every element of that comparison is just factually wrong.

Secondly, the question about why would the Military suddenly embrace what is essentially leftist cultural dogma, not something we're accustomed to seeing the Military do over the last seven or eight decades to put that mildly, is I think, a really interesting question. And if you look more at what the Military posture is under the Biden administration, they very much want to initiate a new war on terror, one that's aimed domestically. And their identified enemy are not ISIS, or Al-Qaeda, or Russia, or China or anything like that. They say the greatest threat to national security are domestic extremists, and specifically white supremacists. So by embracing this kind of doctrine that says that white supremacy is pervasive throughout the society, what that general is really doing is justifying this domestic war on terror as all of these journalists applaud him for doing so.

It can lead to a lot of abuses and it's very hard to end it once it begins. Now, we're talking about doing exactly the same thing, but this time directed inward at the - our own citizenry. And there are very few things more dangerous as you say than empowering the government to wage a domestic war against its own citizenry without extremely restrictive constraints on who they're targeting. And all they're saying is, we're going after extremists and not just extremists, but white extremists, in particular. And the other really disturbing part is General Barry McCaffrey, who is a four-star general who now works at NBC News, came on and said your colleague Tucker Carlson, other people at FOX News including yourself who criticized General Milley ought to be fired immediately, as though now it's off limits to even critique military officials, I suppose in the name of democracy.

Now, four months after the FBI raided his apartment and took all of his devices, a 69-year-old resident who wasn't even at the Capitol on January 6, is still suffering. He's still not gotten his devices back. He's been shunned by his community and has even suffered two strokes. You're going to hear his harrowing story tonight. But first, Kamala can't and won't. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Today, Vice President Harris traveled to Texas to check the border box and play a game of make believe."

      "utterance": "It is important to be clear, it is working to build a fair and a functional and a humane immigration system. We feel very strongly about that. And as you know, we inherited a tough situation. And in five months, we've made progress. But there's still much more work to be done, but we've made progress."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Progress? Lies and more lies. Number one, she and Biden were not handed a tough situation on the border. They created a disaster on the border. They did. Thanks to Trump's remain in Mexico policy, and, of course, aggressive interior enforcement. Illegal border crossings were driven way down under Trump. And number two, by progress she means a total abdication, because most Americans define progress at the border as a reduction in the number of illegal crossers. But for Biden and Harris, I guess it's kind of right. Progress means an increase in crossings, regardless of the harm and cost to the American people. Now, this is - I like to call these open borders collusion at the highest levels of our government. The Biden administration is committing an ongoing crime against our basic sovereignty, a conspiracy to undermine the rule of law, and their refusal to do what works to stem the flow of humanity into America. Now, this fiscal year alone, Border Patrol has intercepted nearly 1 million migrant crossers at our southern border. We don't even know how many of them have been released either into the interior part of the country. But you know that number has to be staggering. If Harris were a serious person who actually put America's interest first, she would have traveled to where the action is in the Rio Grande Valley. But of course, that would have been too embarrassing and revealing, because there the border arrests stand at a whopping 271,000 and counting this fiscal year. So of course, Kamala Harris decided to skip that region, and instead visit El Paso, which has 2.5 times fewer border arrests, and just for good measure, a Democrat mayor. Now, everything I saw today was border theater, from beginning to end. There's nothing serious about enforcement, and she was always in search of mythic \"root causes\"."

      "utterance": "If her dissembling weren't so infuriating, it would be absolutely hilarious, because with so much time having passed, the Vice President's border (inaudible) is kind of just a sideshow at this point. It's a distraction from the real story. Because while she embarrassed herself in El Paso, the Biden DHS is moving full steam ahead on dismantling our border protections and immigration system. Just days ago, they notified Congress that they were going to release tens of thousands of illegals into the interior of the country, who were previously denied entry under the remain in Mexico program. So we're going to pluck them out of Mexico, bring them back and release them. Isn't that nice? That's not all. Just today Biden's team is furiously trying to figure out how to rescind the Trump era policy that allows for the immediate rejection of illegal border crossers due to COVID, because they care so much about COVID. This outrage aligns perfectly with something Harris said today about what our obligations are as a country."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "She was talking there about the region, Central America and Mexico. So apparently, our responsibility is to other countries. Thus, not only will the middle class and all Americans, frankly, be hit with a higher cost of living because of inflation now, but you can also expect wages to stagnate as well. All because Biden bowed to the business lobby in the far left, of course, and they are fine with having a glut of workers because a glut of workers in the United States keeps wages flat. Certainly, keeps them from rising. So once again, we see the ugly truth about today's Democrats. Although Kamala Harris was put in charge of the border issue, she not only can't do it, because she's in way over her head, she won't do it. Because shutting down illegal border crossers means putting America first. And why should they ever want to put a systematically racist country first? That doesn't make any sense. They don't think it's their responsibility to try to lift your standard of living, or ensure your schools are functional, or to make sure your streets are safe. Because if they did, they would do whatever it took to secure that southern border. And instead, their goal is to fundamentally transform our nation and its culture. So those borders, you bet, keep them wide open. They're only going to care about the border, about enforcement, when they see that their actions, or in this case, inaction, has really cost them votes. And very soon, it will be time to make them pay. And that's the \"Angle\". All right. Here now, Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick; and Richard Guerra, a rancher from Del Rio, Texas, where we were a few years back. Dan, let me start with you. Now, Harris spent the majority of her time at the airport, didn't even travel to the border. Your response to today's border theater."

I realized that the Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas has changed his title and didn't tell us the secretary of root causes, because that's all they talked about today. And the true root cause of the nearly 1 million people that we've apprehended so far and the millions more than have crossed over that we haven't caught, the root cause of the border problem is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Because Trump had the border really under control in the last year of his presidency. The policies he put in place, like returning people to Mexico really worked. And they talked about a broken system to date, and they broke it. They broke it. And it's purposefully that they broke it. To hear her talk about, we have to be concerned about the children and the families and their suffering. How about American children and American families and the suffering here of anyone killed by someone here illegally? This was disgraceful. It was almost a joke, except it's so serious."

They want to take over this country on the backs of these people that are crossing the border to turn them into Democrat voters. That's what it's about. It's all about power. They don't care about children of America, families of America, Police officers in America, victims of crime in America, those who are taking fentanyl and dying from it, or hooked on drugs. They don't care about Americans, and they don't care about these people crossing the border who end up in cantinas, in prostitution, or massage parlors, or sex trafficking, or if they're working for a job, they're taking cash under the table, sending a third of it back to the cartels. The cartels are sitting there thinking the Biden-Harris administration are good for business, because the cartels are in the business of smuggling people into America. This is disgraceful. And this is why we have to build a wall in Texas, Laura.

They were authenticated. They were people who gave them health checks. People come in across the Rio Grande, especially at El Paso in the state of Texas. They're coming for the most part illegally. We don't have any idea in the middle of a pandemic, whether they've been vaccinated, probably not, or whether they're active carriers. 5,000 border and customs patrol officers have been infected. They were diverse at LSI. And they came from all over the world. This is just one group of Spanish speaking people. It's not diverse like Ellis Island. And they came with the expectation, Laura, to assimilate rapidly, to integrate, to intermarry. That's not the message we're giving these immigrants that are coming illegally. We're telling them that they were part of a tribal identity. It's what's happening in America. And they came in - and people forget about Ellis Island, it was measured. I know that some years, days, they might have 5000 or 6000. But over that 36- year-period, there was about 12 million people who arrived here. We're getting up to 2 million, so we're getting six to seven times more per year across the southern border than we did through Ellis Island. Every element of that comparison is just factually wrong.

If you open the borders, all of Central America and Mexico would come, because for all the criticism of America, we're a constitutional state with individual liberty and we kind of allow people to be prosperous, secure and happy in a way that's impossible in their homeland. So they would all come. And yet that's the big disconnect, isn't it? The left says this is a terrible country, and then they can't explain why everybody wants to come to a racist country.

He raised morale with weekly street dances for essential workers. On top of that, he was awarded a Police commendation for saving a woman from being mugged. You get the point? He was a pillar and a beloved leader of his own community. But all of that changed after he attended Trump's January 6 rally in DC. Though Joseph never attended the Capitol that day, never entered the Capitol, he was in his hotel when the breach occurred. The FBI raided his home any way in February. Now, agents handcuffed him, detained him for four hours as they ransacked his apartment and confiscated his belongings, which he still has not gotten back. Now, that's not all. Joseph's neighbors now see him as a domestic terrorist to be shunned. It's not only ruined his life, but his health as well. Joseph Bolanos joins me now. Joseph. I mean-- JOSEPH BOLANOS, ATTENDED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S JAN 6 SPEECH: Hi, Laura."

And I called him on Monday, got his voicemail and never heard back from him. About Feb - excuse me, January - February 4, I was staying at my mother's as my mother is presently in a rehab. She's got dementia, she's 94 years old. And at 6 o'clock the door was - someone was banging on the door and I answered and it was 4 - 3 males, 1 female, claiming to be detectives or JTTF. I let them in. And basically they asked me if I was part of BLM, Proud Boys, Antifa. I said, no. Not at all. I said, I was there, but I wasn't there when the breach happened, and I don't condone any criminality or violence. So I showed them a video, which was a composite of three videos. They said, can you make us a copy? I said, sure. When you're innocent, you really cooperate, which is I think was my biggest mistake. Yes. And so I made them the thumb drive. And they said, thank you very much. I hope your mother feels better and they left. That week, Thursday, I was sleeping on the couch. And 6 o'clock in the morning, I hear, Boom, boom, boom, \"FBI, open the door. Open the door, or we'll knock it down.\" Something to that effect. And one was pointing an assault rifle at my head about four feet away. And I was sitting there confused and they said, please step outside. I stepped outside. They handcuffed me. I said, what is this about? And they said, search warrant. They never produced one, they never showed it. Nothing. So I had only my (inaudible).

      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST",

It's exactly what we want the Military not to do. Secondly, the question about why would the Military suddenly embrace what is essentially leftist cultural dogma, not something we're accustomed to seeing the Military do over the last seven or eight decades to put that mildly, is I think, a really interesting question. And if you look more at what the Military posture is under the Biden administration, they very much want to initiate a new war on terror, one that's aimed domestically. And their identified enemy are not ISIS, or Al-Qaeda, or Russia, or China or anything like that. They say the greatest threat to national security are domestic extremists, and specifically white supremacists. So by embracing this kind of doctrine that says that white supremacy is pervasive throughout the society, what that general is really doing is justifying this domestic war on terror as all of these journalists applaud him for doing so. It's really quite an amazing spectacle."

When they use such a broad term, that's frankly, meaningless, the word extremism. What does that mean? Extreme to whom? On what basis? What are their objective metrics for determining extremism? And you see these MSNBC hosts kind of like, \"Oh, this is so great\". Like they are like the Bobby soxers of 2021 with Milley.

I think a lot of people who cheered for the war and terror in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 came to understand that when you vest immense power in the hands of the government in the name of fighting a war that's very amorphous against terrorism. It can lead to a lot of abuses and it's very hard to end it once it begins. Now, we're talking about doing exactly the same thing, but this time directed inward at the - our own citizenry. And there are very few things more dangerous as you say than empowering the government to wage a domestic war against its own citizenry without extremely restrictive constraints on who they're targeting. And all they're saying is, we're going after extremists and not just extremists, but white extremists, in particular. And the other really disturbing part is General Barry McCaffrey, who is a four-star general who now works at NBC News, came on and said your colleague Tucker Carlson, other people at FOX News including yourself who criticized General Milley ought to be fired immediately, as though now it's off limits to even critique military officials, I suppose in the name of democracy. But these people who have babbled about fascism for five years are now cheering generals demanding that journalists be fired for the crime of criticizing generals when they intervene in our politics.

It's like saying we owe a lot to those the Native American chiefs, like those Kansas City Chiefs. No, one are a group of tribal leaders, the other is a football team. As for the Latinx, or as you say \"Latinx,\" this is even more concerning. First off, I don't know any Hispanics in my family or anywhere else that use Latinx. They just don't. A Pew survey showed only three percent of mostly young people even entertain that term. I personally don't think it's even that high.

Remember, products made in USA, we try to have nothing made in China. We are doing our best on that front. So again, just go to LauraIngraham.com and pick of your great gear. OK, do it today, tonight, tomorrow. That's all the time we have tonight. Do not forget to set your DVR for every weeknight at 10:00 p.m. eastern so you never miss us. And luck you, Greg Gutfeld takes it all from here. Remember, Freedom Matters. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
