It's good for Americans to be able to see where his income has come from in the last ten years. It's obviously not something you have to do but it's nice if people do that. It is interesting already to look through these tax returns and see that there was a fairly low charitable giving. And also I don't think he paid extra on his federal taxes. He thinks people who are millionaires should be taxed at a higher rate. He does not need the federal government to enforce that in order to be able to do it. You are allowed to voluntarily contribute more and I don't think -- I mean I'll have to look through this with a more careful eye but I don't think he did that.",

And that is a product of two things it seems to me -- Bret.  One of them is that the Republican party, having gotten a tax cut across the finish line and into law seemed to believe that the tax cut would sell itself to people once it started receiving benefits. Democrats, in the meantime, started claiming that nobody really got much of a tax cut, that it all went to the 1 percent, and so on as you've heard people like Bernie Sanders say and many others. That isn't quite true.  But you have to wonder, Bret -- where these brigades of fact-checkers were when the Democrats were making all these false claims. We now know that about -- a least 65 percent of the American populace got a tax cut. Not nearly that many think they did.
