But I think that Sally Field strategy for President Biden, not going to work. All right? You know, it's not this - it's not -- we've come to the conclusion that less is more with Joe. Wildly popular when he was chained to the rusted Peloton bike, or Soloflex -- got to get my analogies straight -- in the basement. And then when he came out of the basement, the numbers dropped. So, you don't actually want to push him out. Here's a better path for Joe if it's not too late. Stand up to the woke. Stir your party away from the progressive abyss, and once and for all burn your race card. Because every time you play the race card, you may forget about it, but we all remember it. Right? I mean, he doesn't remember the things he says about this person and that person. But in this case, we do remember. The idea of him getting out of D.C. to make everybody feel good, I mean, it's just going to be like a back rub bus tour, or is it going to be like a --is it going to be like boxcar Biden with magic fingers on a train? It's just -- all it's going to do is it's just going to remind you that the guy that was before him wasn't so bad. Biden has been a real boom for Trump. Because we all got a four year -- we are getting a break to look back and go wow, the orange Godzilla. Yes, he did a lot of good stuff. You he did all right. He got -- he was able to quell like North Korea. We had those Middle East peace accords. We had a vaccine. We have an explosive economy before COVID. He was the first me -- excuse me, I spit. He is the first guy to really go off on China. And then everybody had to catch up with him. So, you know, so we had this break. It's really benefit -- benefited Trump, but it's also the Republican Party. Right? They are like, they are suddenly the popular kid at the party, and they haven't done anything yet. So, my advice to them is don't get cocky. And instead of doing politics, think about the people. The issues are there. You got -- you got crime! You got inflation! You got food prices, you got schools, you got freedom. I mean, stop playing politics, Republicans, help the people. Then they win. That's my advice.",

Clinton lost in '94, the crime bill and crime itself hurt him in many ways. So, the crime, and to your point, Gillian, the economy, meaning inflation and the supply chain and the border. And I thought I was glad to hear the president the other day in his remarks in his press conference say that he's going to be president now and not try to be a committee chairman in the Senate or a majority leader. Leave that to the legislative branch. And finally, Mr. President, it's best to be like a great cornerback or like Ted Lasso who say you forget that last play. Forget what happened over those last few months and move forward. Find ways to solve problems. Don't just do the same thing. I'm pleased to see him get into the country. He should have been in Ohio today with the intel chief as they announce that $20 billion investment to build semiconductor chips in America.

And so, the Democrats can't be seen like agreeing with us, because that would be betrayal. So, they would rather pick a stupid stance, you know, like bailing out looters, right? Or no cash bail than actually common sense, because the common sense is aligned other people. So, they kind of despise us more than they despise the thugs, so that's why the thugs are out there. Newsom should repeal a bunch of those laws that allow people to shoplift like $900 worth of crap. That would be a start, instead of this symbolic -- this symbolic virtue signaling that he does outside. This is not a practical solution what he is doing. This is for us to do segments, and it worked.",

Some of our rank and file around defunding, and some of our rank and file around some of this cash bail reform. I would hope that every D.A., and every police chief, and a lot of Democratic police chiefs and a lot of Democratic mayors including Eric Adams who I would argue is probably to the right of President Biden on some of these issues. And perhaps, some of the mainstream talk in my party around what to do and how to prosecute crime. But one thing is clear. No Black American, no Democrat that I socialize with and I am one, wants -- wants high crime rates, wants high homicide rates, or wants to have to clean debris off of railroads. I would hope that mayors around the country and many of them are in Washington today -- the president spoke with them. I would imagine that many of them probably asked this president to help with bail reform, help us with the mental health initiative, help us to ensure that those of us who have public transit systems that we're able to prosecute, arrest, and make safe havens there on subway platforms all across the -- across the country. I didn't mean to jump start this conversation in the last segment, but I'm glad that the district attorney of New York met with business leaders today, and I'm glad they expressed very clearly to him that without a public transit system, without a safe one and we've all commented on this, New York won't be New York.

She is the -- she is the best thing about this administration. I mean, just compare to how she was speaking to the vice president, right? It's like, there is just no -- there is no competition. But I think that Sally Field strategy for President Biden, not going to work. All right? You know, it's not this - it's not -- we've come to the conclusion that less is more with Joe. Wildly popular when he was chained to the rusted Peloton bike, or Soloflex -- got to get my analogies straight -- in the basement. And then when he came out of the basement, the numbers dropped. So, you don't actually want to push him out. Here's a better path for Joe if it's not too late. Stand up to the woke. Stir your party away from the progressive abyss, and once and for all burn your race card. Because every time you play the race card, you may forget about it, but we all remember it. Right? I mean, he doesn't remember the things he says about this person and that person. But in this case, we do remember. The idea of him getting out of D.C. to make everybody feel good, I mean, it's just going to be like a back rub bus tour, or is it going to be like a --is it going to be like boxcar Biden with magic fingers on a train? It's just -- all it's going to do is it's just going to remind you that the guy that was before him wasn't so bad. Biden has been a real boom for Trump. Because we all got a four year -- we are getting a break to look back and go wow, the orange Godzilla. Yes, he did a lot of good stuff. You he did all right. He got -- he was able to quell like North Korea. We had those Middle East peace accords. We had a vaccine. We have an explosive economy before COVID. He was the first me -- excuse me, I spit. He is the first guy to really go off on China. And then everybody had to catch up with him. So, you know, so we had this break. It's really benefit -- benefited Trump, but it's also the Republican Party. Right? They are like, they are suddenly the popular kid at the party, and they haven't done anything yet. So, my advice to them is don't get cocky. And instead of doing politics, think about the people. The issues are there. You got -- you got crime! You got inflation! You got food prices, you got schools, you got freedom. I mean, stop playing politics, Republicans, help the people. Then they win. That's my advice."

But Obama was at 42 when Obamacare passed, he came back and won. Trump was at 39 and he didn't come back and win, and Carter found himself in the '40s and he didn't come back and win. I think you have to look back if I were President Biden, you look back at those teams and you figure out what did to do. And this is where -- this is where Greg was right.

Clinton lost in '94, the crime bill and crime itself hurt him in many ways. So, the crime, and to your point, Gillian, the economy, meaning inflation and the supply chain and the border. And I thought I was glad to hear the president the other day in his remarks in his press conference say that he's going to be president now and not try to be a committee chairman in the Senate or a majority leader. Leave that to the legislative branch. And finally, Mr. President, it's best to be like a great cornerback or like Ted Lasso who say you forget that last play. Forget what happened over those last few months and move forward. Find ways to solve problems. Don't just do the same thing. I'm pleased to see him get into the country. He should have been in Ohio today with the intel chief as they announce that $20 billion investment to build semiconductor chips in America. We ought to identify other cities that can be innovation hubs as well. That's what I would do if I were in that White House, and I think the president is trying as hard to do that."

So why did it take so long for Democrats to prioritize crime when it was -- when Americans were suffering for almost two years? Why did they choose to chase the voting bill, or climate -- their climate agenda? It's simple. Because you can't chase a problem that everyone knows you caused. Right? It's like saying crime is out of control, as a progressive Democrat, everybody looks at you and go, well, it's not on you. So, they have to avoid it, also, their -- who they consider adversaries, which should be people like us on Fox or Republicans, this is a really key issue for them. And so, the Democrats can't be seen like agreeing with us, because that would be betrayal. So, they would rather pick a stupid stance, you know, like bailing out looters, right? Or no cash bail than actually common sense, because the common sense is aligned other people. So, they kind of despise us more than they despise the thugs, so that's why the thugs are out there. Newsom should repeal a bunch of those laws that allow people to shoplift like $900 worth of crap. That would be a start, instead of this symbolic -- this symbolic virtue signaling that he does outside. This is not a practical solution what he is doing.

I do think Greg is right too, in the extent when he says that the Democrats have not come out strong enough. Some of our rank and file around defunding, and some of our rank and file around some of this cash bail reform. I would hope that every D.A., and every police chief, and a lot of Democratic police chiefs and a lot of Democratic mayors including Eric Adams who I would argue is probably to the right of President Biden on some of these issues. And perhaps, some of the mainstream talk in my party around what to do and how to prosecute crime. But one thing is clear. No Black American, no Democrat that I socialize with and I am one, wants -- wants high crime rates, wants high homicide rates, or wants to have to clean debris off of railroads. I would hope that mayors around the country and many of them are in Washington today -- the president spoke with them. I would imagine that many of them probably asked this president to help with bail reform, help us with the mental health initiative, help us to ensure that those of us who have public transit systems that we're able to prosecute, arrest, and make safe havens there on subway platforms all across the -- across the country. I didn't mean to jump start this conversation in the last segment, but I'm glad that the district attorney of New York met with business leaders today, and I'm glad they expressed very clearly to him that without a public transit system, without a safe one and we've all commented on this, New York won't be New York. Our economy can't thrive. So, I hope Democrats and Republicans -- those who have been wrong, get right, and those who have been right all along, continue to amplify your voice."

I'm just going to accept it. All right? So, I don't think their intentions are pure, obviously. It's very suspicious that Pelosi, Newsom, and Biden on the same day, are laser focused on crime. That tells me this. That tells me a polling memo went out that the Democrats saw, looked at, and said holy cow, we are all going to lose our seats. Now, a crime is not when someone steals your car or takes your wallet. A crime is when someone steals the Democrats' seat in Congress. That's what they care about. Same thing happened after the 2020 summer riots. Remember? They didn't give a damn all summer until the polling memo went out in August, and Don Lemon said, guys, you guys are going to get crushed. You know, bad polls are like smelling salts. It wakes the Democratic Party up. You know, that -- that is the real issue. Now also, did you notice how Gavin Newsom didn't really care about the criminals or the crime itself? He cares about the image of the crime. He cares about how it looks on television.

That's the crux of this problem. There's not going to be a path forward for any of this because these are intractable problems. A quick note about what Sunny Hostin said. She said that the infrastructure bill was geared towards white -- excuse me now I'm starting to spit and drool like Greg. This happens when you're on television with him. She said that this was -- the infrastructure bill was geared towards white moderates. It was not geared towards white people at all, really. And the President said this over and over again. This was a bill that was pouring more public funding into bridges, and roads, and tunnels, trains, buses, expanding internet access. It was a bill that was aimed at minority communities in America. She's flatly wrong on that."

I think when you build bridges, they don't just -- they don't have a Black lane or a White lane, and you determine how many Blacks went across the bridge versus anyone else. We were too quick to racialized everything. I get -- I'm sickened by any party, any individual, or any group that thinks they're going to advance themselves by always invoking race. It's the wrong thing to do. I think it's fair to ask --"

      "utterance": "Well, anyone that said it is wrong. Right, anyone that said it is wrong. So, my point is this. If 16 Republican senators voted for voting rights in the past, I don't think it's unfair to ask them what made you not want to vote for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. They probably have been -- may have reasons that I may understand or may not understand. I don't think you racialize this thing so quickly. When you do, all we do is reduce ourselves to these kinds of silly, unproductive conversations, when in fact, we are passing voting rights laws in states around the country after an election when more people voted in the history of the country and no court found any widespread fraud. Now, when they say there are other reasons, and I happen to think some of the reasons that have been raised by some Republican especially around voter ID, I think we should have voter ID. But for the life of me, I don't understand any state that would give oversight authority to a partisan legislature versus a secretary of state. We've not had those kinds of problems. Republicans should know, Democrats will be in charge sometimes. And Democrats, you know, Republicans will be in charge. We just need fair elections. And I thought we had one in 2020."

So, they're mad, they didn't get their way. And then they're using -- casting aspersions and calling people racist because they didn't get what they wanted on the filibuster."

The whole -- the whole end result of woke ism is that it blends everything. It shaves down any kind of individuality that a human being might have in favor of what is best to describe them. So, you're no longer an individual, you belong to a certain type of group. And now they're doing this -- even like, candy. You know, this, this is the -- this is the diabetic starter kit, you know, is being affected by this. And that's what -- you know, what Dagen has brought up. It's like corporations, what they're trying to do is they're trying to keep you from criticizing them about the real big things that they do, like make kids fat increase risk for diabetes by doing the easy stuff first, like, oh, let's make our candies more inclusive. I support what Kat Timpf said. If you really support inclusivity for M&Ms, why are you eating them? How gross is that?

A friend of mine and a friend of this show and a friend to Fox and a friend to everybody who works here, Meat Loaf passed away yesterday at the age of 74. You know him from Rocky Horror and Fight Club and bat out -- Bat Out of hell. But what you don't know is how genuinely nice and authentic this person was. Meatloaf would look you in the eye and he would talk to you. And it was like you've known him for years. I spent a long conversation with him where he explained to me, I Do Anything for Love,(But I Won't Do That) what that was, and how I -- how I had missed that. I did not understand what that thing was that he wouldn't do. It was the best conversation. He was the sweetest guy. And you just go out, listen to his music. Remember Meat Loaf today. Great guy."
