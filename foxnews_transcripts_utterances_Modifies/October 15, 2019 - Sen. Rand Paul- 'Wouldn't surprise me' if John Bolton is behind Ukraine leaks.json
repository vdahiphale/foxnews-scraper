He's not going to hold back. He promises. Also on their first day back from break, the house GOP is ready to fight back against a sham of an impeachment probe - it's about time. They are going to target Adam Schiff. Congressman Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin, Steve Scalise all here and they will reveal their plan. Don't miss it.  Plus, one mother fights for her daughter's right to compete against other girls in track and field. A warning about what the left pushes for trans- athletes will do to women's and girl's sport? And I will have my list response to LeBron James' comments on China a little later in this show.  But first, unmasked and unanswered, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Well, Joe Biden has spent weeks deflecting the flood of questions about his son's shady business deals in Ukraine and China.",

According to author Peter Schweizer, Hunter sat on BHR's board since 2013. So either Robach didn't know that fact or she chose to omit any reference to it.  The question should have been is it true that ten days after you and your dad returned from a trip in China in late 2013, your firm secured that exact amount in financing from China's state owned bank? And if diamonds are a girl's best friend, Hunter Biden seems to like them plenty too. A Chinese businessman Yeh Yaming gave Hunter a huge diamond ones and asked them to represent someone later convicted in a bribery scheme. Hunter negotiated for a gas company involved in that very same scheme. But ABC did not ask about the precious stone payment either. Why bother?

All the things he went through. I was on the board of Amtrak. What qualifies you? Isn't the next obvious question, what qualified you to sit on the board of Amtrak? I went to Georgetown University. I took Amtrak every single weekend for a four week period of time back and forth to D.C. That does not qualify me to sit on the board of Amtrak. The obvious answer is because his father was Vice President and he was cashing in on that no different than he was cashing in on the Ukraine, no different from he was cashing in on China and a whole lot of other things.

We find out that interesting edit that was done in this interview that \"The Washington Examiner\" is writing about tonight right at that critical point where she asked him, what about your experience in the Ukraine? You can hear someone off camera apparently saying, sorry, so that's being talked about tonight. That's conservative media. The rest of the media seemed to be just be letting it go?",

It's because before this became an issue about Trump, before they decided that they were going to make this entirely about Donald Trump and Ukraine, they were the ones writing the stories about the Bidens being problems with Hunter Biden and the enormous conflict of interest. You put up a screenshot earlier of a piece that was done Adam that actually quoted Former Vice President Biden aides saying how much worry they had about the way he was writing on the Vice President's coattails and getting access. So they knew all this. But now as with everything because they want this now to be entirely story about Donald Trump they completely change their tune and everything is a false allegation, nothing to see here, nothing was bad. They understood the conflict and now they are closing their eyes to it.",

In fact, that was just saving our country and then turns around and says that what Donald Trump did somehow rises to the level of an impeachable offense.

Reporting shows he did however manage to secure that amount for another investment firm of which he owns a nice chunk. And that's how much Biden reportedly raised for the company BHR Investments. According to author Peter Schweizer, Hunter sat on BHR's board since 2013. So either Robach didn't know that fact or she chose to omit any reference to it. The question should have been is it true that ten days after you and your dad returned from a trip in China in late 2013, your firm secured that exact amount in financing from China's state owned bank? And if diamonds are a girl's best friend, Hunter Biden seems to like them plenty too. A Chinese businessman Yeh Yaming gave Hunter a huge diamond ones and asked them to represent someone later convicted in a bribery scheme. Hunter negotiated for a gas company involved in that very same scheme. But ABC did not ask about the precious stone payment either. Why bother?

Bloomberg reporting an aide to Biden said that any candidate who calls themselves a Democrat and repeats what the aides said were discredited lies about Biden and his son would be making a profound statement about themselves. Well, look, none of this is going to go away anytime soon and it's obviously terrible for candidate Biden. The swamping us of the Biden just reminds folks why they elected Trump in the first place to drain the swamp. And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now is Eric Trump, the President's son and Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization.

I will never do it to the Obama kids, I've never done it to the Bush kids, and I wouldn't do it to the Chelsea. The problem is this is rampant corruption. I mean, think about though the one question, what qualifies you to sit on the board of Ukrainian gas company, you have no knowledge, you don't speak the language, you had no dishonorable duties? All the things he went through. I was on the board of Amtrak. What qualifies you? Isn't the next obvious question, what qualified you to sit on the board of Amtrak? I went to Georgetown University. I took Amtrak every single weekend for a four week period of time back and forth to D.C. That does not qualify me to sit on the board of Amtrak. The obvious answer is because his father was Vice President and he was cashing in on that no different than he was cashing in on the Ukraine, no different from he was cashing in on China and a whole lot of other things. There is rampant corruption, and it sucks and it shouldn't have been and it's disgusting and quite frankly it is disqualifying."

As someone who worked at a big law firm, I'm not qualified to work on an investment fund or raise a billion and a half dollars from China to be deposited in that fund.

I don't think there will ever be, Laura, a President who has sacrificed so much of his wealth, made so many personal sacrifices. My father got into politics to drain the swamp, to stop this nonsense from happening, exactly what you see here because it's rampant. He made so many sacrifices including putting a ton of his own money in it and losing an absolute fortune because of it. All these guys are cashing in on it.

It's because before this became an issue about Trump, before they decided that they were going to make this entirely about Donald Trump and Ukraine, they were the ones writing the stories about the Bidens being problems with Hunter Biden and the enormous conflict of interest. You put up a screenshot earlier of a piece that was done Adam that actually quoted Former Vice President Biden aides saying how much worry they had about the way he was writing on the Vice President's coattails and getting access.

For him, it is a few 360-degree war on the Hollywood entertainment, Academia Foundations, the use of quid pro quo swamped creature type culture and it's a 24/7 war for him.

How can you look at Americans and say - it was okay that Hillary Clinton's campaign funneled this information to the FBI from Russia, which was used as part of surveillance warrants of this investigation - that was all good? In fact, that was just saving our country and then turns around and says that what Donald Trump did somehow rises to the level of an impeachable offense.

Joining me now, Rand Paul, Republican Senator from Kentucky and author of the fantastic, go out and get it, new book, \"The Case Against Socialism.\" Your kids need to read it, college kids, high school kids, adults who toy with this liberalism idea and socialism idea. Senator Paul, we'll get to your book. You have long opposed this perpetual interventionist policy in the Middle East, long before yours truly woke up and smelled the coffee.

It's dangerous and it distorts Title IX which is a law that protects all students on the basis of sex.\" Are you all trying to discriminate against people on the basis of sex, or do you want a sense of fairness on the playing field, or in this case, on the track?"

      "utterance": "And Cheryl, what's her mindset. It's got to be tough for her. I remember being a high school athlete. I miss it. I miss those fall afternoons on the hockey field or spring on the softball diamond. These are just the best times to be an athlete and a female athlete especially, there's a lot of opportunities. But it must be tough for your daughter given the politically correct push on this particular issue. How is she doing?"

      "utterance": "This is insanity. If this is where feminism takes us, and gender politics takes us, it's not feminism. It's gender politics. All feminists across the country should think about it again, because this will destroy girls sports eventually. Thank you, ladies, for being here tonight. And stay tuned. We have final thoughts on this wild night in the Last Bite, next."
