Maybe that's why their ratings are in freefall, all of their viewers are getting killed. But now with Trump gone, they can no longer use racism to defend liberal cities descending into violent madness. Those corroded cities are still getting worse. And it's been months since Trump left.   Which tells you it was never his fault to begin with. He was just their excuse. And they laughed about the riots because they knew the violence might scare voters into supporting Biden. They're like a mobster saying to a shopkeeper, better do what I said. I hate to see anything happened to your storefront window. It's funny. They aren't even talking about violent white supremacists anymore.  I guess they realize the only white mobs were liberal arts majors tearing a Portland whose jealousies is green is their hair. The meeting never bothered the question that big lie. But now it's collapsing faster than a human pyramid with Joy Behar on top. But maybe we can focus on the real terrorists who stormed the Capitol. Yes. After Dems bailed out looters they just sentenced the granny to over 100 hours of community service for standing around the Capitol. So, instead of playing with the grandkids, she's picking up trash on the freeway. That's justice, Democrats style. So let's review the root causes of all bad things according to the Democrats, it's one, racism then racism then racism. When in fact the root cause is them, them and them. Crime is rising, people are dying. And what's the cause? Liberal policies the spikes and violence are only in cities run by liberals.  If that's not cause and effect. What the hell is? The Dems reject law enforcement in any actual prison time, lefty prosecutors decriminalized crime, especially property crime, They threw a bail and called it reform so repeat offenders could repeat even more racking up more arrests than Kat on a bender. They grew increasingly more brazen and more violent, even in daylight, daring the demoralized police to do something but they couldn't because they knew that Democratic leaders would let them twist in the wind. So now you're left with a befuddled president who gets all his crime solutions from reruns of Murder, She Wrote. And a defined far left contingent consumed by the desire to dismantle the world's greatest country, Biden is such a mess. He even suggested cities could use the leftover COVID money to hire more cops after allowing local governments to defund the cops. Yes. Maybe we can give the leftover masks to the criminals while they're at it.  It's good for robbing banks. So we got problems. The problems are solvable unless we continue to elect idiot Democrats. The Dems treat the American people like their groupies. You'll always be there for them when they need you. But when they no longer need you, they don't care whether you live or die because there will always be more groupies as long as they can evade the gunfire.",

But so much of our discourse is focusing on blaming people for other, you know, for problems rather than looking for solutions. Because when this first started, you know, having this reckoning last summer, polls were showing that most Americans agreed that they wanted to change things about policing. But most Americans, including 81 percent of black Americans wanted the same level or more police in their neighborhoods. There was so much agreement and how do we end up here, it's because there's no room for any nuance at all in these discussions. It's just about political partisanship, and trying to blame other people and the amount of imagination that it must have taken to try to blame this on Republicans. There's a lot of wasted energy that could have been trying to solve this problem because it's serious and it's a matter of life or death. Thank you.",

And here's a calm experience empathetic president and here's the first lady who is driven, tireless, effortlessly popular but also someone who reminds us of ourselves.\" It's true. I too think of myself as a doctor without ever going to med school.  The cover line was pure corn syrup, a First Lady for all of us, but we got our hands on a few that they actually passed on. Dr. Jill Biden, Ron DeSantis wants to destroy America. Dr. Jill Biden, every president has a woman behind them, reminding them that their president.

Like making eye contact and putting on pants. They also say that a lack of purpose can be a breeding ground for so called social unrest, also known as rioting, setting things on fire and blocking traffic and carrying cardboard signs painted with platitudes they saw on the Internet, or as experts call it: living in Seattle.

Towson University held a virtual talk earlier this month called the anti-racist pedagogy symposium, alternative title suggestion: hard pounding. They argued that proper English grammar is racist and perpetuates whiteness. In other words, the things that unite us, divide us. One speaker claimed that by enforcing standards that marginalizes black language, going so far as to equate the written word with violence saying, \"Anti-blackness that is used to diminish black language of black students in classrooms is not separate from the rampant and deliberate anti-black racism and violence inflicted upon black people in society.\" So, now all words are as racist as the N-word, apparently. Another speaker said, \"The repeated references to correct grammar and standard language reinforced master narratives of English only is white.\" Of course, they said this using correct grammar, racist. Meanwhile, a federal judge in the Bronx or Borough of New York City, Emily has thrown out the case of a known drug gang member involved in a shooting because the grand jury wasn't diverse enough. This is nuts. So, what does that mean for other cases in which the juries could be seen as not diverse in retrospect? Are we going to apply new standards to past cases? This could open quite a Pandora's box, or is it a can of worms? Either way, if you lie down with the dogs, you're going to wake up with fleas, or in my case, some very odd looking puppies.

Maybe that's why their ratings are in freefall, all of their viewers are getting killed. But now with Trump gone, they can no longer use racism to defend liberal cities descending into violent madness. Those corroded cities are still getting worse. And it's been months since Trump left. Which tells you it was never his fault to begin with. He was just their excuse. And they laughed about the riots because they knew the violence might scare voters into supporting Biden. They're like a mobster saying to a shopkeeper, better do what I said. I hate to see anything happened to your storefront window. It's funny. They aren't even talking about violent white supremacists anymore. I guess they realize the only white mobs were liberal arts majors tearing a Portland whose jealousies is green is their hair. The meeting never bothered the question that big lie. But now it's collapsing faster than a human pyramid with Joy Behar on top. But maybe we can focus on the real terrorists who stormed the Capitol. Yes. After Dems bailed out looters they just sentenced the granny to over 100 hours of community service for standing around the Capitol. So, instead of playing with the grandkids, she's picking up trash on the freeway. That's justice, Democrats style. So let's review the root causes of all bad things according to the Democrats, it's one, racism then racism then racism. When in fact the root cause is them, them and them. Crime is rising, people are dying. And what's the cause? Liberal policies the spikes and violence are only in cities run by liberals. If that's not cause and effect. What the hell is? The Dems reject law enforcement in any actual prison time, lefty prosecutors decriminalized crime, especially property crime, They threw a bail and called it reform so repeat offenders could repeat even more racking up more arrests than Kat on a bender. They grew increasingly more brazen and more violent, even in daylight, daring the demoralized police to do something but they couldn't because they knew that Democratic leaders would let them twist in the wind. So now you're left with a befuddled president who gets all his crime solutions from reruns of Murder, She Wrote. And a defined far left contingent consumed by the desire to dismantle the world's greatest country, Biden is such a mess. He even suggested cities could use the leftover COVID money to hire more cops after allowing local governments to defund the cops. Yes. Maybe we can give the leftover masks to the criminals while they're at it. It's good for robbing banks. So we got problems. The problems are solvable unless we continue to elect idiot Democrats. The Dems treat the American people like their groupies. You'll always be there for them when they need you. But when they no longer need you, they don't care whether you live or die because there will always be more groupies as long as they can evade the gunfire."

But so much of our discourse is focusing on blaming people for other, you know, for problems rather than looking for solutions. Because when this first started, you know, having this reckoning last summer, polls were showing that most Americans agreed that they wanted to change things about policing. But most Americans, including 81 percent of black Americans wanted the same level or more police in their neighborhoods. There was so much agreement and how do we end up here, it's because there's no room for any nuance at all in these discussions. It's just about political partisanship, and trying to blame other people and the amount of imagination that it must have taken to try to blame this on Republicans. There's a lot of wasted energy that could have been trying to solve this problem because it's serious and it's a matter of life or death. Thank you."

Yet they still complained when I tried to harvest their organs. Apparently, most of the increase in doing nothing came from joblessness as there was actually an increase in school attendance as campuses started to reopening, proving doing nothing is no longer just for people with English degrees.

Towson University held a virtual talk earlier this month called the anti-racist pedagogy symposium, alternative title suggestion: hard pounding. They argued that proper English grammar is racist and perpetuates whiteness. In other words, the things that unite us, divide us. One speaker claimed that by enforcing standards that marginalizes black language, going so far as to equate the written word with violence saying, \"Anti-blackness that is used to diminish black language of black students in classrooms is not separate from the rampant and deliberate anti-black racism and violence inflicted upon black people in society.\" So, now all words are as racist as the N-word, apparently. Another speaker said, \"The repeated references to correct grammar and standard language reinforced master narratives of English only is white.\" Of course, they said this using correct grammar, racist. Meanwhile, a federal judge in the Bronx or Borough of New York City, Emily has thrown out the case of a known drug gang member involved in a shooting because the grand jury wasn't diverse enough. This is nuts. So, what does that mean for other cases in which the juries could be seen as not diverse in retrospect? Are we going to apply new standards to past cases? This could open quite a Pandora's box, or is it a can of worms? Either way, if you lie down with the dogs, you're going to wake up with fleas, or in my case, some very odd looking puppies.

It beats their other invention chopping your head off. They saw the jaw locking device, and they believe the jaw blocking device allows wearers to open their mouth just 1/16 of an inch, so you can eat solid foods.

And we've champion this body positive world which makes you feel good inside, you know, emotionally, but it's harming your body, and it's bad. Like all of these kinder, gentler initiatives are harming society. There's a study out there that says 40 percent of elementary school kids are obese and they're not doing anything about it because they don't know they're obese.
