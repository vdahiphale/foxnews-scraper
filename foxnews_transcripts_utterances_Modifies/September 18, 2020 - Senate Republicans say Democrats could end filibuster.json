First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 5 in New York as the Trump administration opens an investigation into racial bias at Princeton University. The Education Department says the school's recent acknowledgement of racism on campus amounts to a shocking and serious admission of discrimination.  Fox 19 in Cincinnati as Customs and border Protection officers seized a shipment containing 29 pounds of cocaine. The drug was concealed in 11 pouches, labeled as shelf-stable emergency food rations. Officers say the cocaine has a street value of $952,000. And this is a live look at Chicago from our affiliate, Fox 32, sunny night there. One of the big stories there today, a rally in support of nurses and essential workers ties up traffic in the Loop near Millennium Park. Chicago police say about 100 people gathered around 8:00 a.m. for the protest. That's key traffic time. Nurses at the University Illinois Hospital have been on strike since the weekend.

The sheriff, meantime, of Los Angeles County, says the investigation into an ambush attack on two of his deputies is progressing well.

Last night, we heard a snippet in a piece from a high school principal in Minneapolis, about some of the intense challenges she and her students face right now. Remember, Minneapolis City Council made an effort to defund or dismantle the police department there, after George Floyd's death. And just this week, some of those same council members were complaining about increased crime on the streets. Plus, you have the COVID restrictions that are very tight there. This evening, we want to hear more from that perspective. More from North High School's principal, Mauri Melander Friestleben.",

      "sentences": "So, we have elementary principals, we have middle school principals, we have high school principals. All from Minneapolis public schools going all the way down. You know why, right? You know why we're here is because we lost a student last night. We lost a Minneapolis public school student last night who attended Patrick Henry High School, he was not two weeks into his senior year when he was shot and killed right here in this space.  And I know for me, I am so absolutely 100 percent over it. For those of you that do not know what is happening in the city of Minneapolis, let me help you understand. So, we literally are in a city right now that is completely and entirely out of control. I just -- I have to absolutely just say it the way I feel it. It feels out of control. It feels like when I walk into a classroom where the teacher has given up. And all of you guys know the way that classroom feels, right? You know that you'll get that teacher where maybe those one or two naughty kids that won't listen, the teacher just says, fine, they just shrug their shoulders and they sit down behind their desk and they put their feet up, and they say, I'll collect this check, do what you need to do, and the whole class goes rogue. That's how it feels to me right now. That's how the city of Minneapolis feels to me right now. Nothing is making any sense. Everything feels topsy-turvy. I understand completely that I am speaking not just as myself, but as the North Community High School principal. And guess what, I am speaking as the North Community High School principal. I have kids that so badly and so deeply want to be in school. They want to play their sports, they want to get in the weight room, they want to work out, and because of COVID, guess what? They can't do anything. We're kicking them out of the school, we're kicking them out of the weight room. They can't practice, they can't work out. All of these things because of COVID. But just down the street, they see people doing whatever they want. They see tents up, they see hundreds of people just not social distancing, and their law enforcement drives right past it. We're seeing out in the open, whole parking lots that are being taken over. Whole blocks that are being taken over.  People who have -- who have substance abuse problems, chemical dependency issues, all of these other things, and they are just allowed to be, however, they want to be. But my kids can't work out, it doesn't make any sense, and the kids know it doesn't make any sense. This absolutely, we have -- we have an opportunity in Minneapolis to try something different to do something new. And that's to say that we are not going to be held hostage by the voices of a few. You overhear law enforcement in our city right now, and they feel like, well, the city council doesn't want us, or, well, you know, the people don't want to switch people. Who? Which people is it? Show me where they're at, OK? So, are you talking about the few, some of them that don't even live here? Are you talking about the people that, that, that don't have to worry about their children coming to a store like this that live in a different part of the city? Is that who you're talking about? Because the people, who I'm around, need and want good law enforcement. The people who are in my community need and want good law enforcement. And, and, and, and have the maturity to be able to say that we need good law enforcement to need and want us. What I'm seeing in my community is that there's not even patrolling anymore. I can see outright laws getting broken, traffic laws, people driving right through red lights. Speeding, going 60, 70 miles an hour. We got kids on skateboards that are getting hit by cars and nothing, no -- what is law enforcement? It's enforcing the law.  There is no law enforcement, there is a reaction. So, we're all here. So, you've got about 50 to 60 Minneapolis public school principals that are out here, and, and, and, and will hold space.",

The president enjoys a 42 percent approval rating, which is hard to win reelection as an incumbent at that rate at this moment in a campaign less than six weeks, or almost six weeks before a campaign. Unfortunately, and I hope I'm wrong, but 200,000 Americans will likely be the number who have died from corona after this weekend, and over 15 million Americans are jobless. I think the enthusiasm rate that we often look to in these campaigns may not be there as evident as they've been in previous campaigns, largely because the country is ailing and hurting. For the good news for President Trump, it appears that white working-class Americans, particularly men, are consolidating around him in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania. Will that be enough? That's the question. I can tell you, as someone who lost a Senate race 14 years ago, and I had a very enthusiastic minority with me, it's much better to win with an unenthusiastic majority than to lose with an enthusiastic minority.",

And there are people already here lined up, and obviously a lot of concern about, are they wearing masks, are they not. They're very close together. But when he goes different places, he packs the outside spaces, and some inside spaces. The Trump campaign is seeing movement, but are they seeing enough as they look at these battleground states? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": No. No, not enough. I think the Democrats are really doing a good job of targeting the president on coronavirus, which is the weakest part of his campaign platform, and it may be what causes him to lose, if he does lose. I'm not convinced he is going to lose in November, but this will be the main reason. I think Democrats have done an effective job -- I'm not saying they've done a truthful job, but they've been effective at claiming the president is responsible for all of the coronavirus deaths -- most if not all of them. We heard the vice president say today that he was responsible for all of the deaths. Most Democrats say that's not the case, but he should have acted sooner and more strongly to try to defeat the virus and taken it more seriously, and then we'd have far fewer deaths. So Democrats have done a good job with that. That's a big problem for him, and of course, in the key battleground states, which are all that matters when it comes to the Electoral College, winning those particular states. But as for the campaign issue, these rallies, they energize voters, they energize the base, they energize the president as he moves along in the campaign. So they're really important. And I think it does make Biden look a little bit out of touch and sort of hiding in his basement kind of feeling when he's not out there more and engaging with crowds of people cheering for him. That's a big part of the campaign, seeing the crowds, and seeing these big rallies. And if the president is willing to do it even during a pandemic, it forces Biden to really reconsider stepping up his game, too.",

The judge says, envelopes post marked by the eve of the third of November the election are eligible even if they show up days later. Michigan voters have already registered and requested about 2.3 million absentee ballots. Michigan law requires them to be received by the time the polls close on Election Day. Meantime, an Ohio judge is temporarily blocking the Republican secretary of state's order, limiting counties to one ballot drop box. Both the state and the Republican Party have appealed.

      "utterance": "So, we have elementary principals, we have middle school principals, we have high school principals. All from Minneapolis public schools going all the way down. You know why, right? You know why we're here is because we lost a student last night. We lost a Minneapolis public school student last night who attended Patrick Henry High School, he was not two weeks into his senior year when he was shot and killed right here in this space. And I know for me, I am so absolutely 100 percent over it. For those of you that do not know what is happening in the city of Minneapolis, let me help you understand. So, we literally are in a city right now that is completely and entirely out of control. I just -- I have to absolutely just say it the way I feel it. It feels out of control. It feels like when I walk into a classroom where the teacher has given up. And all of you guys know the way that classroom feels, right? You know that you'll get that teacher where maybe those one or two naughty kids that won't listen, the teacher just says, fine, they just shrug their shoulders and they sit down behind their desk and they put their feet up, and they say, I'll collect this check, do what you need to do, and the whole class goes rogue. That's how it feels to me right now. That's how the city of Minneapolis feels to me right now. Nothing is making any sense. Everything feels topsy-turvy. I understand completely that I am speaking not just as myself, but as the North Community High School principal. And guess what, I am speaking as the North Community High School principal. I have kids that so badly and so deeply want to be in school. They want to play their sports, they want to get in the weight room, they want to work out, and because of COVID, guess what? They can't do anything. We're kicking them out of the school, we're kicking them out of the weight room. They can't practice, they can't work out. All of these things because of COVID. But just down the street, they see people doing whatever they want. They see tents up, they see hundreds of people just not social distancing, and their law enforcement drives right past it. We're seeing out in the open, whole parking lots that are being taken over. Whole blocks that are being taken over. People who have -- who have substance abuse problems, chemical dependency issues, all of these other things, and they are just allowed to be, however, they want to be. But my kids can't work out, it doesn't make any sense, and the kids know it doesn't make any sense. This absolutely, we have -- we have an opportunity in Minneapolis to try something different to do something new. And that's to say that we are not going to be held hostage by the voices of a few. You overhear law enforcement in our city right now, and they feel like, well, the city council doesn't want us, or, well, you know, the people don't want to switch people. Who? Which people is it? Show me where they're at, OK? So, are you talking about the few, some of them that don't even live here? Are you talking about the people that, that, that don't have to worry about their children coming to a store like this that live in a different part of the city? Is that who you're talking about? Because the people, who I'm around, need and want good law enforcement. The people who are in my community need and want good law enforcement. And, and, and, and have the maturity to be able to say that we need good law enforcement to need and want us. What I'm seeing in my community is that there's not even patrolling anymore. I can see outright laws getting broken, traffic laws, people driving right through red lights. Speeding, going 60, 70 miles an hour. We got kids on skateboards that are getting hit by cars and nothing, no -- what is law enforcement? It's enforcing the law. There is no law enforcement, there is a reaction. So, we're all here.

And this is a problem going into the debate for Donald Trump who has been constantly mocking him for his being slow Joe and his mental capacity. If Joe Biden strings together a few coherent sentences in the debates, all of a sudden he wins because the bar has been set so low. So yesterday was soft on Biden, but it also shows how if he just puts together a few sentences he comes out OK."

      "utterance": "Yes, meantime, Harold, \"The New York Times\" writes \"Does Biden need a higher gear? Some Democrats think so. As Mr. Trump barrels ahead with crowded, risky rallies, some Democrats in battleground states are growing increasingly anxious about the trade-offs Mr. Biden has made with some polls tightening since the beginning of the summer. They're warning him that virtual events may not be enough to excite voters and urging him to intensify in-person outreach. I saw that on the ground in Pennsylvania around his hometown of Scranton where Democratic leaders were coming up to me and saying, listen, we're asking the campaign to get out here, but they haven't yet. They may have to."

      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "First, thanks for having me on. I'd say a couple things -- 29 percent of the country thinks we're moving in the right direction. The president enjoys a 42 percent approval rating, which is hard to win reelection as an incumbent at that rate at this moment in a campaign less than six weeks, or almost six weeks before a campaign. Unfortunately, and I hope I'm wrong, but 200,000 Americans will likely be the number who have died from corona after this weekend, and over 15 million Americans are jobless. I think the enthusiasm rate that we often look to in these campaigns may not be there as evident as they've been in previous campaigns, largely because the country is ailing and hurting. For the good news for President Trump, it appears that white working-class Americans, particularly men, are consolidating around him in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania. Will that be enough? That's the question. I can tell you, as someone who lost a Senate race 14 years ago, and I had a very enthusiastic minority with me, it's much better to win with an unenthusiastic majority than to lose with an enthusiastic minority."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "These rallies do, Susan, show enthusiasm, and you look like at Bemidji, Minnesota, where the president will arrive. And there are people already here lined up, and obviously a lot of concern about, are they wearing masks, are they not. They're very close together. But when he goes different places, he packs the outside spaces, and some inside spaces. The Trump campaign is seeing movement, but are they seeing enough as they look at these battleground states? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": No. No, not enough. I think the Democrats are really doing a good job of targeting the president on coronavirus, which is the weakest part of his campaign platform, and it may be what causes him to lose, if he does lose. I'm not convinced he is going to lose in November, but this will be the main reason. I think Democrats have done an effective job -- I'm not saying they've done a truthful job, but they've been effective at claiming the president is responsible for all of the coronavirus deaths -- most if not all of them. We heard the vice president say today that he was responsible for all of the deaths. Most Democrats say that's not the case, but he should have acted sooner and more strongly to try to defeat the virus and taken it more seriously, and then we'd have far fewer deaths. So Democrats have done a good job with that. That's a big problem for him, and of course, in the key battleground states, which are all that matters when it comes to the Electoral College, winning those particular states. But as for the campaign issue, these rallies, they energize voters, they energize the base, they energize the president as he moves along in the campaign. So they're really important. And I think it does make Biden look a little bit out of touch and sort of hiding in his basement kind of feeling when he's not out there more and engaging with crowds of people cheering for him. That's a big part of the campaign, seeing the crowds, and seeing these big rallies. And if the president is willing to do it even during a pandemic, it forces Biden to really reconsider stepping up his game, too."

I think it's good for the colleges, it's good for the fans, and most of all, it's good for the players. And my loser of the week is Nancy Pelosi because she immediately rejected a brand new proposal by 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans in the House that offer as compromise between these sticking points between the Republicans and Democrats on this very much desired next round of federal coronavirus aid.
