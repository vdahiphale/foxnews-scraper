      "sentences": "Yes, you smell. But it's also Fox News' 25th anniversary. It's a milestone, but it's probably a bigger achievement than anyone in this industry would care to admit. Because it includes destroying the legacy media. So why in hell would they celebrate the thing that killed them? I don't blame them. While we celebrate our 25th, what can CNN celebrate? Another month without a Jeffrey Toobin zoom call? Congrats. When Fox News debuted, it was roundly mocked, but within months, the mockery stopped, the critics saw Fox rise to the top and beat the pants off them, which was easy with Toobin. So, how did this happen? First, it was necessary, it had to happen. The mainstream news not only refused to serve most Americans. They felt they didn't have to. They control the narrative and you had little choice but to take it. They abused your trust. They lied to you. They thought you were stupid. They shared the same brain. So the industry devolved into a corrupt insular machine out to stoke the vision to make money. Then Fox came along. We were different. We knew this monolithic media was derelict in its duty, so Fox provided the balance that was missing. It did so fearlessly, knowing that it would paint targets on all of our backs. But its popularity grew and why? Because we're people. We weren't perfect. We were human. You could relate to us. It wasn't a network, it was a relationship. You can get mad at us and turn us off, but you also knew we had your best interests at heart. So you stuck with us through all the great stuff and the not so great stuff. Fox didn't speak down to you like the pompous gas bags at other networks. We spoke directly to you. We assumed you were as smart as us, if not, smarter. We didn't see family or religion as a joke. We celebrated the American idea. We relished providing a voice for the unheard. As employees at Fox, we thanked Fox for keeping us employed. Here is my first appearance on Fox \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" I was quite a handsome guy, I have to say. And there is Jesse. I had great sideburns, Jesse, those eyebrows. And then there was Dana.

And I can state that as a fact because we care so passionately about what we do. Greg, we were talking in the green room about a fake news article that we saw that -- fake outrage! A performance art. No! We actually care about what's going on in the country. And maybe we are outraged at something we see because that just doesn't sit well with us because we know it doesn't sit well with the rest of the country.

And a new member of Congress, I came on this network often. I came on in with Bill O'Reilly. I came on with Hannity. I came on with others around the network. And I often wanted to be able to reach constituents of mine that might have watched the other networks. Look, I listen to Fox and now that I'm on Fox, I clearly listen to it even when I'm not on. And some members of my party don't like what happened here. I don't always agree with the things that we talk about, but sometimes I do. But you have to listen to understand when you do.

And unfortunately, there was the delta variant and so a little more caution was warranted, but they were feeling it. They were excited about it. Then in the middle of the Afghanistan debacle is when they came out with the vaccine mandates for businesses with 100 employees or more. And there were lots of follow-up questions that people had, but he wouldn't take any questions. SO then people continued to like wonder how did this happen. Now, just a year ago, a year and a month -- so 13 months ago, both President Biden and Kamala Harris as candidates said \"if the vaccine is produced and approved under President Trump, I would not trust it. I would not take it.\" Of course, they were being ridiculous them. They were lying. They did trust the vaccine. They just wanted to hurt President Trump.

Not a perfect analogy, but I think that Trump is going to have a very -- I would say Trump is going to have a really easy way to compare his run from 2016 to 2020 to Biden's when you compare these variables whether it's inflation or crime numbers, COVID deaths, weaponizing of the FBI. At this rate, I don't see Biden running in 2024. I see him being Trump's campaign manager because he is providing him with so much stuff. But to your point, the media refuses to apply the same standards to Biden that they did to Trump. And for that reason, what they do is if you come to them with this information, they just turn it on to January 6th. Oh, it's - - we got to talk about January 6th.

They wrote it like they it. They want chaos, anarchy. And it will never be changed in New York.",

      "utterance": "Yes, you smell. But it's also Fox News' 25th anniversary. It's a milestone, but it's probably a bigger achievement than anyone in this industry would care to admit. Because it includes destroying the legacy media. So why in hell would they celebrate the thing that killed them? I don't blame them. While we celebrate our 25th, what can CNN celebrate? Another month without a Jeffrey Toobin zoom call? Congrats. When Fox News debuted, it was roundly mocked, but within months, the mockery stopped, the critics saw Fox rise to the top and beat the pants off them, which was easy with Toobin. So, how did this happen? First, it was necessary, it had to happen. The mainstream news not only refused to serve most Americans. They felt they didn't have to. They control the narrative and you had little choice but to take it. They abused your trust. They lied to you. They thought you were stupid. They shared the same brain. So the industry devolved into a corrupt insular machine out to stoke the vision to make money. Then Fox came along. We were different. We knew this monolithic media was derelict in its duty, so Fox provided the balance that was missing. It did so fearlessly, knowing that it would paint targets on all of our backs. But its popularity grew and why? Because we're people. We weren't perfect. We were human. You could relate to us. It wasn't a network, it was a relationship. You can get mad at us and turn us off, but you also knew we had your best interests at heart. So you stuck with us through all the great stuff and the not so great stuff. Fox didn't speak down to you like the pompous gas bags at other networks. We spoke directly to you. We assumed you were as smart as us, if not, smarter. We didn't see family or religion as a joke. We celebrated the American idea. We relished providing a voice for the unheard. As employees at Fox, we thanked Fox for keeping us employed. Here is my first appearance on Fox \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" I was quite a handsome guy, I have to say. And there is Jesse. I had great sideburns, Jesse, those eyebrows. And then there was Dana.

We come on here because we care about the country and we care about the people of the country. And I like to think that I speak for the people of the country and give the people of the country a voice that they didn't have before. So when you see an audience member approach you, they treat us like family. And that connection is so strong, none other broadcast professionals have the connection that we have with the audience. And I can state that as a fact because we care so passionately about what we do. Greg, we were talking in the green room about a fake news article that we saw that -- fake outrage! A performance art. No! We actually care about what's going on in the country. And maybe we are outraged at something we see because that just doesn't sit well with us because we know it doesn't sit well with the rest of the country. But we are also laughing and joking and it doesn't always have to be about outrage. We're not doing this for money or ratings.

And the truth is, thank goodness for Fox that we are allowed to say what we want. We are who we are. We have distinctive personalities. And I agree with you.

However, when the networks started, I just got elected to Congress. And your viewpoints are right. We live in a big diverse sprawling democracy, sometimes a brawling democracy. And I think the cornerstone of our strength as a nation is that we have to be willing to not only listen to but accept dissent political point of views, different political point of views. And a new member of Congress, I came on this network often. I came on in with Bill O'Reilly. I came on with Hannity. I came on with others around the network. And I often wanted to be able to reach constituents of mine that might have watched the other networks. Look, I listen to Fox and now that I'm on Fox, I clearly listen to it even when I'm not on. And some members of my party don't like what happened here. I don't always agree with the things that we talk about, but sometimes I do. But you have to listen to understand when you do. And you also have to listen I think as you think about crafting arguments, strengthening your own arguments, but even more so agreeing when someone is right. And I think we could all benefit from that. And when I think of Fox, that's what I think of. When I congratulate Mr. Murdoch and Lachlan and the entire organization on 25 years of enormous success, they figured out their marketplace and hopefully there's another 25 to 50 years of success as well."

Remember, he ran on \"I will crush the virus.\" And then they had that premature celebration on the Fourth of July. And unfortunately, there was the delta variant and so a little more caution was warranted, but they were feeling it. They were excited about it. Then in the middle of the Afghanistan debacle is when they came out with the vaccine mandates for businesses with 100 employees or more. And there were lots of follow-up questions that people had, but he wouldn't take any questions. SO then people continued to like wonder how did this happen. Now, just a year ago, a year and a month -- so 13 months ago, both President Biden and Kamala Harris as candidates said \"if the vaccine is produced and approved under President Trump, I would not trust it. I would not take it.\" Of course, they were being ridiculous them. They were lying. They did trust the vaccine. They just wanted to hurt President Trump. So then they get into office and then they think, well, now, we really need people to take the vaccine and please just wipe away your memory of anything that we said before. The other thing that's interesting is, did you guys notice? Remember with the daily death tracker?"

When you hear what he's saying it's like it's the patriotic thing to do. I wonder how many of these pro-vax people would be pro-draft because a draft is taking control of your body and so are vax mandates. So I just find it -- it's kind of very consistent. Not a perfect analogy, but I think that Trump is going to have a very -- I would say Trump is going to have a really easy way to compare his run from 2016 to 2020 to Biden's when you compare these variables whether it's inflation or crime numbers, COVID deaths, weaponizing of the FBI. At this rate, I don't see Biden running in 2024. I see him being Trump's campaign manager because he is providing him with so much stuff. But to your point, the media refuses to apply the same standards to Biden that they did to Trump. And for that reason, what they do is if you come to them with this information, they just turn it on to January 6th. Oh, it's - - we got to talk about January 6th.

And Rashida Tlaib now saying, you know, the only reason I'm wearing a mask now is because I've got a Republican tracking me over here. And, you know, Gavin Newsom and everyone else just totally going against the message that Biden is trying to give. But you see, it's not even Biden's message. He's lost all credibility. America doesn't believe in him anymore and his numbers are so in the tank right now. I mean, how could you possibly follow him and say, okay, he's absolutely right.

I listen to the people in the freedom argument about this and you and I are vaccinated. And I've asked this question privately, but I wonder, the people whom are defending those who are exercising their freedom for not getting the vaccine, were those people also defending Colin Kaepernick when he knelt when the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was sung? I didn't necessarily. I thought it was the wrong thing, but if we're going to be consistent about freedom, we should all think about these arguments. Two, 97 percent of people at United Airlines are now vaccinated. Do you know why? Because Scott Kirby, the CEO, was the first, if not, one of the first CEO to say you have to be vaccinated to come to work. So 97 percent are vaccinated. Three, if you really believe this -- that this disease or virus or whatever came from China and was man-made, you know how you can get the Chinese back? Stay alive. Get vaccinated. Let -- take the politics out of it, minus the politics out of it. Democrats were wrong perhaps in a big way and I think Vice President Harris if -- had her best -- said it completely wrong, which she said I wouldn't take the vaccine. You can assign the worst motive and say that she meant it because it was Donald Trump. She was wrong. That doesn't mean that any red-blooded American who believes in the country, who wants the economy to reopen, who wants schools to reopen, who wants to get back at China, let's get vaccinated."

Some of the -- if you just peek under the hood of some of these poll numbers is on this military, his numbers handling terrible as commander in chief, his competency.

The woman seen shoving a person into an oncoming subway train in New York City was probably out on bail stemming from assault charges in July. The suspect is now charged with attentive murder. Now, Jesse, I'll start with you. The idea of bail reform last year, two years ago in New York was to help nonviolent offenders who were first-time offenders if they did not have the money to make bail to have an opportunity to not serve more in jail than they would if they got convicted of a crime. This is absurd but we are dealing with here. Is there a distinction that should be made between the nonviolent first- time offenders and violent offenders?"

It was designed so that very poor people, if they committed a nonviolent offense weren't saddled with debt, and could come out of jail and fight the charge. But it's not like that. Now, it's just a revolving door for criminals. And it might have been well- intentioned, but it backfired. The same way people are coming around, the Democrats, to fund the police was stupid. They are coming around the bail reform as stupid. This is what we need to do in this country. We need to look at policy results instead of policy intentions. If you are intentional and you want to make everyone be perfect, OK, give it all year. If it blows up and causes crime in a year, switch it back. Why do we have to dig in ideologically on dumb laws that create more crime just so we could pat ourselves on the back by the left? Just switch the bill. Fix it. You are already getting people hurt."
