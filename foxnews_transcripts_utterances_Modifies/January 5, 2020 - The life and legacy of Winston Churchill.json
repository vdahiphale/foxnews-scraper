And I think our audience has a general understanding of Churchill, what a great man he is.  But I'm not sure that we have really a full understanding of the man's character, his history and why he is considered such a great man.  And you've written a book, \"Churchill: Walking with Destiny.\" Now, this is, you told me the 1,010th biography of Churchill, yours being the 10th -- 1,010th.  Why is your book different?",

      "sentences": "Well, I was very fortunate that in the last six to seven years, there's been an absolute avalanche of new sources that have come out about Winston Churchill. You wouldn't have thought so considering there are a thousand and nine biographies before mine.  That Her Majesty the Queen allowed me to be the first Churchill biographer to use her father's diaries.  And King George VI who have met Winston Churchill, every Tuesday of the Second World War, was trusted by his Prime Minister with all of the great secrets of the Second World War.  The Ultra secrets and about the decrypts, the nuclear secrets, which countries were going to be invaded, which ministers and generals were going to be hired and fired and so on.   And the King wrote everything down in his diary.  So I've been able to use that which no other Churchill biographer has before.  On top of that, at Churchill College, Cambridge, where his archives are.  There have been 41 sets of papers that have been deposited there and including the diaries of his children, and so on. So there's been a possibility to actually get into the mind of the man that way as well. I myself discovered the verbatim accounts of the War Cabinet, the Second World War Cabinet, and so we now know what each individual minister said during the War Cabinets, which no one has known before.   And then finally, the diaries of Ivan Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador, during the Second World War, have been made available over the last five years in Moscow.  And so that was fascinating, too, because he saw a lot of Churchill, of course, at the period of the Nazi Soviet Pact just before the outbreak of the war. So really, it's this extraordinary avalanche of new sources that made me decide to want to write this book.",

I think that he showed different qualities of leadership that we desperately need.  He was somebody with a tremendous sense of foresight. He spotted the First World War and the Second World War before they broke out and warned the world about what to do.  He wasn't listened to, but nonetheless, he got that right. And then after the Second World War, with Soviet imperialism and the danger that Stalin posed to Eastern Europe, he too in his great Iron Curtain speech in Fulton, Missouri was able to delineate that as a great danger.  And then he showed tremendous moral courage, moral and physical courage, but particularly moral courage.  He never deviated because of what opinion polls said.  He went out and said what he believed and he stuck to it.  And that's something I think that is not just for the 1930s, that's for all time, a great leadership quality. He was tremendously eloquent.  He was very, very good on his feet, of course, but also in his set piece speeches, he could move the hearts of millions.  These are things that all leaders should be able to learn from, I think, and not just military leaders, I think it's right the way across the board, not just political leaders, I mean, business leaders and everybody I think has got something that they can learn from Winston Churchill.",

And if it had come off, it would have been one of the great strategic genius moves in the history of warfare.  But in the implementation of it, on the 18th of March 1915, the Allies lost six ships, and then they doubled down on the disaster by invading the Gallipoli Peninsula to the west of the straits, and over the next eight months, we lost 147,000 killed and wounded.   And this was not fairly really, but it was primarily Churchill's mistake and Churchill stuck with it.  And he was lambasted for it and people shouted, what about the Dardanelles at him -- right the way into the 1930s.",

And again, and again, I come up with this powerful sense that he was driven by a sense of destiny.  He believed from the age of -- when he was a 16- year-old school boy, he told his best friend, that there will be great upheavals and terrible struggles in our lives, and I shall be called upon to save England and save London.",

And so he had an early warning system when it came to Hitler and the Nazis that was not vouchsafed to many of the other people in British politics and the upper classes at the time, many of whom were anti-Semitic. The second thing was that he was a historian, and he was able to place the strategic threat posed by Hitler in the long panoply, the long continuum of British Foreign Policy and all of the other threats that we've had since the Spanish Armada.  And the last thing was that he had come up close and personal against fanaticism in his life on the Northwest Frontier and in the Sudan, Islamic fundamentalist, religious fanaticism in this case, but he could see the same tropes in the Nazis, and the political fanaticism of the Nazis in a way that the other Prime Ministers in the 1930s simply were unable to do.",

And I think our audience has a general understanding of Churchill, what a great man he is.  But I'm not sure that we have really a full understanding of the man's character, his history and why he is considered such a great man.  And you've written a book, \"Churchill: Walking with Destiny.\" Now, this is, you told me the 1,010th biography of Churchill, yours being the 10th -- 1,010th.  Why is your book different?"

You wouldn't have thought so considering there are a thousand and nine biographies before mine.  That Her Majesty the Queen allowed me to be the first Churchill biographer to use her father's diaries. And King George VI who have met Winston Churchill, every Tuesday of the Second World War, was trusted by his Prime Minister with all of the great secrets of the Second World War.  The Ultra secrets and about the decrypts, the nuclear secrets, which countries were going to be invaded, which ministers and generals were going to be hired and fired and so on. And the King wrote everything down in his diary.  So I've been able to use that which no other Churchill biographer has before.  On top of that, at Churchill College, Cambridge, where his archives are.  There have been 41 sets of papers that have been deposited there and including the diaries of his children, and so on. So there's been a possibility to actually get into the mind of the man that way as well. I myself discovered the verbatim accounts of the War Cabinet, the Second World War Cabinet, and so we now know what each individual minister said during the War Cabinets, which no one has known before. And then finally, the diaries of Ivan Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador, during the Second World War, have been made available over the last five years in Moscow.  And so that was fascinating, too, because he saw a lot of Churchill, of course, at the period of the Nazi Soviet Pact just before the outbreak of the war. So really, it's this extraordinary avalanche of new sources that made me decide to want to write this book."

I think that he showed different qualities of leadership that we desperately need.  He was somebody with a tremendous sense of foresight. He spotted the First World War and the Second World War before they broke out and warned the world about what to do.  He wasn't listened to, but nonetheless, he got that right. And then after the Second World War, with Soviet imperialism and the danger that Stalin posed to Eastern Europe, he too in his great Iron Curtain speech in Fulton, Missouri was able to delineate that as a great danger. And then he showed tremendous moral courage, moral and physical courage, but particularly moral courage.  He never deviated because of what opinion polls said.  He went out and said what he believed and he stuck to it.  And that's something I think that is not just for the 1930s, that's for all time, a great leadership quality. He was tremendously eloquent.  He was very, very good on his feet, of course, but also in his set piece speeches, he could move the hearts of millions. These are things that all leaders should be able to learn from, I think, and not just military leaders, I think it's right the way across the board, not just political leaders, I mean, business leaders and everybody I think has got something that they can learn from Winston Churchill."

And if it had come off, it would have been one of the great strategic genius moves in the history of warfare.  But in the implementation of it, on the 18th of March 1915, the Allies lost six ships, and then they doubled down on the disaster by invading the Gallipoli Peninsula to the west of the straits, and over the next eight months, we lost 147,000 killed and wounded. And this was not fairly really, but it was primarily Churchill's mistake and Churchill stuck with it.  And he was lambasted for it and people shouted, what about the Dardanelles at him -- right the way into the 1930s."

Churchill said of his becoming Prime Minister that day, I felt as if I were walking with destiny, and that all my past life have been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial. And so what I tried to do in the book is to investigate that, to unpack it, to look at the extent to which Churchill's previous jobs as being in charge of the Royal Navy or being Home Secretary or Chancellor of the Exchequer, actually did prepare him for this hour and trial of 1940. And again, and again, I come up with this powerful sense that he was driven by a sense of destiny.  He believed from the age of -- when he was a 16- year-old school boy, he told his best friend, that there will be great upheavals and terrible struggles in our lives, and I shall be called upon to save England and save London."

And so his -- there was a strategic element as well as an emotional element.  He was somebody who believed in the legacy of the English- speaking peoples for the rest of the world, in the way in which our joint literature and culture and values believe in democracy and so on, was something that the rest of the world could benefit from. And he believed that when we were together, he coined the phrase special relationship, in fact, when that special relationship worked, then it was good not just for both countries, but for the whole of the rest of the world, too."

But no, he was not an alcoholic, and neither actually interestingly was he a depressive.  Lots of people say that he had Black Dog depression, but he himself only used that expression once in his whole life at a time when Edwardian matrons used it to explain their ill-tempered children.

And I think it's for three reasons that they were able -- that Churchill was able to see Hitler the Nazis of what they really were.  The first was he was a Philo-Semite.  He liked Jews.  He had grown up with Jews.  He had all his life, he had gone on holiday with Jews and he knew the contribution that they've made to Western civilization. And so he had an early warning system when it came to Hitler and the Nazis that was not vouchsafed to many of the other people in British politics and the upper classes at the time, many of whom were anti-Semitic. The second thing was that he was a historian, and he was able to place the strategic threat posed by Hitler in the long panoply, the long continuum of British Foreign Policy and all of the other threats that we've had since the Spanish Armada. And the last thing was that he had come up close and personal against fanaticism in his life on the Northwest Frontier and in the Sudan, Islamic fundamentalist, religious fanaticism in this case, but he could see the same tropes in the Nazis, and the political fanaticism of the Nazis in a way that the other Prime Ministers in the 1930s simply were unable to do."

And we had this extraordinarily powerful naval base in Singapore, on the southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula.  And we all thought that that was going to be able to hold out because it was so strong. Well, it didn't work out.  It was of course the guns, the big guns were pointing out to sea, but the Japanese were coming through the jungle to the north from the land wood side and we had very few defenses there.  And that was largely down to Churchill."

And very often, although in wartime, people will put up with any number of defeats, if you're able as a war leader to promise ultimate victory, even if it doesn't seem to be near, if it can be logically explained why it's going to happen, then people will put up with terrible, terrible privations."

Stalin, who, of course, was one of the most evil men in history, nonetheless, was a very effective war leader, but not because he was an orator.  He was actually quite useless at rhetoric and oratory. Charisma is a very difficult concept for me because Hitler who is always thought of as charismatic, actually, when you delve down into it, it was largely because he had Leni Riefenstahl do his films and Albert Speer do his rallies and Josef Gerbils do his propaganda.  He himself was profoundly an unimpressive figure personally. And so, so I don't think that necessarily this artificially recreated charisma is an important aspect.  One that is though is the idea of foresight.  If people think that your leader is looking one step ahead, or two or three steps ahead, that is very important. With Margaret Thatcher, it was a large number of these things.  But it was also a moral conviction."

And after his one hour nap, he believed that that effectively gave him two days. Hitler was lazy.  He is the one person actually who just doesn't fit into the overall concept of busy and hardworking leaders. George Marshall, who I write about in this new book, would work 16 to 17 hours a day.  President Eisenhower, not just when he was Supreme Allied Commander, but up to that point as well.  He was an incredibly hard worker.

And he was a great believer in the special relationship, as we mentioned earlier, which he thought would be damaged if Britain got into an economic structure with Europe.

As we may mentioned earlier about the press, you know, he was never really given a fully fair hearing until he became Prime Minister. So on that level, no, but I can't help thinking that so long as good people still go into politics, and I'm very worried about this actually, in my country, because most good people don't.

Fortunately, he is down to 16 percent in the polls when it comes to his popularity, but he's a very, very unpleasant figure.  Only six weeks after the IRA attempted -- the dissident republican group in Ireland attempted to blow up Margaret Thatcher and did actually succeed in killing seven people in Blackpool in 1984, only six weeks later, Jeremy Corbyn invited the IRA to the House of Commons.

And in those diaries, it became very clear that Churchill was tremendously frustrated with the Roosevelt administration at the very slow pace at which America got into the Second World War because he saw the Second World War as a great struggle between good and evil between the forces of Western civilization and democracy on one side, and the most evil regime ever to besmirch human history on the other. He couldn't understand why the Roosevelt administration was not moving faster towards bellicosity."

And then finally, when it was almost too late, he was proved right."

Particularly, its strength, and that is the great leaders in its history, the great things that have been done in its history and like the focus on all the warts and all the imperfections.
