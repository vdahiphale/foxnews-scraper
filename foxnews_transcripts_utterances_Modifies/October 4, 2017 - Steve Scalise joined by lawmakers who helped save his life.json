And there were three cameras that trained on the hallway so that Stephen Paddock could see when the police were closing in. As you mentioned earlier, Martha, the first person to close in was a security guard for the Mandalay Bay named Jesus Campos. Fox News has learned that he said the stairwell was actually blocked; he had to use the elevators. And when he got to the room, he knew the gunman was firing. He fired on him; hit him once in the leg.   It is unclear if that security guard was armed at the time, but it's also unclear if that might have been the precise moment where Stephen Paddock killed himself because the police officers arrived about 10 minutes after the shooting all began, and when they arrived, they said the shooting suddenly stopped. After the security guard got there, the SWAT team arrived, and they waited one hour to go in that room because at that point it was no longer an active shooter situation, it was a standoff. They waited an hour, they went inside the room, and that's when they found 64- year-old, Stephen Paddock, had put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Martha.",

My sources tell me that they've reviewed the information on that -- on those videos and there are things that do layout, some understanding of his motivation and his motives. So, you know, I've been told also they're holding back at least one portion of it based on some of the investigative leads they want to follow. And that's why -- that's the justification I'm being told for the delay in releasing this. But the bottom line, you know, my belief is based on what I've been told.

But I'm not even sure at that point because we're dealing with somebody who clearly was psychopathic, who was willing to engage in mass murder.  It may not be a situation where it makes sense even when we have more information to anybody, how anyone could go about this. And given his social media imprint online, given the footprint that he may have left behind, that will probably be useful in determining his mindset, but we don't know how much he was really putting online, to begin with.

And yes, when you're talking about a psychopath, somebody who's a malignant narcissist -- I mean, I'm sure you've had a lot of psychiatrists on the show or on the network in recent days, looking at how you would diagnose that after the fact.

And I also think anyone who's cooperating with the police, I give them a great deal of credit.

It comes after she spent more than five and a half hours, almost six hours meeting with the FBI in their Los Angeles offices today. We have no idea what the focus of questions was but the attorney came out and he said that Marilou Danley had no idea about the shooting, that her heart goes out to the victims. And I want you to listen to what the attorney that she said about her boyfriend Stephen Paddock, watch."

    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "And we have just learned that Stephen Paddock actually requested the exact two-room suite at the Mandalay Bay where he broke open two windows and from different positions, fired down upon the concert crowd. And there were three cameras that trained on the hallway so that Stephen Paddock could see when the police were closing in. As you mentioned earlier, Martha, the first person to close in was a security guard for the Mandalay Bay named Jesus Campos. Fox News has learned that he said the stairwell was actually blocked; he had to use the elevators. And when he got to the room, he knew the gunman was firing. He fired on him; hit him once in the leg. It is unclear if that security guard was armed at the time, but it's also unclear if that might have been the precise moment where Stephen Paddock killed himself because the police officers arrived about 10 minutes after the shooting all began, and when they arrived, they said the shooting suddenly stopped. After the security guard got there, the SWAT team arrived, and they waited one hour to go in that room because at that point it was no longer an active shooter situation, it was a standoff. They waited an hour, they went inside the room, and that's when they found 64- year-old, Stephen Paddock, had put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Martha."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAFFER",
      "utterance": "He did an amazing job. And look, the indications are that his intervention, his going to the room may well have done two things: first off, give the police an exact location to go after, that's critically important in this case. And secondly, he may well have been the trigger that allowed for the gunman, for this guy to essentially take the coward's way out and commit suicide, which, again, may have well-saved lives. So, this is all good news. My concern, still, is following up on what we talked about last night, Martha, regarding the very thing that Trace just talked about, the video equipment. My sources tell me that they've reviewed the information on that -- on those videos and there are things that do layout, some understanding of his motivation and his motives. So, you know, I've been told also they're holding back at least one portion of it based on some of the investigative leads they want to follow. And that's why -- that's the justification I'm being told for the delay in releasing this. But the bottom line, you know, my belief is based on what I've been told. There's a great deal that more information available to law enforcement, at least at this point, regarding the motivation. I think we should all find out about that very soon."

      "utterance": "That's what I've been told. That's what I've been told. I've been told that there's a political angle of this, the people are concerned about. There is one legal law enforcement issue, according to my source. But you know, essentially, you saw already the political leaking -- there's been leaking of certain information regarding the guns. But notice, nobody leaked the video. So, this is where there's some concern behind the scenes about why certain things are coming out at certain times."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUCK SEXTON, FORMER OFFICER, CIA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that to the point that just made, we can't really know much more than has already been said about, where the motivate stands, which is that it's going to be a work in progress to figure this out. We may have one bit of information that comes out the next few days that finally points us in a definitive direction. But I'm not even sure at that point because we're dealing with somebody who clearly was psychopathic, who was willing to engage in mass murder. It may not be a situation where it makes sense even when we have more information to anybody, how anyone could go about this. And given his social media imprint online, given the footprint that he may have left behind, that will probably be useful in determining his mindset, but we don't know how much he was really putting online, to begin with. So, there's a lot that law enforcement is going to be combing through right now, and they're putting together a puzzle, they don't even know where all-- what all the pieces are supposed to be, never mind how they're supposed to fit together in the end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, based on what you know so far, you see him more as a psychopath, which is a word that the FBI used for his father who was a fugitive and a bank robber, than a terrorist -- and when I say terrorist, I mean someone who sought to terrorize people perhaps for some sort of political reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. There's nothing that we can point to right now that would seem like a clear political agenda. So, that's why the term terrorism, I think, has not been used here and I think that that's correct approach so far. That could change very rapidly. This could, in fact, have been a terrorist attack. But that would be depending upon a definitive motive coming out of all of this. And yes, when you're talking about a psychopath, somebody who's a malignant narcissist -- I mean, I'm sure you've had a lot of psychiatrists on the show or on the network in recent days, looking at how you would diagnose that after the fact. But even that is not a perfect science, and I think that that's my inclination is that we'll find this was a deeply disturbed individual who was hiding it. I don't think his girlfriend knew much about or anything about his mindset. And I think he was hiding it from people and I think that he snapped."

Did she see the arsenal that he amassing, the explosive, all of this, at the home that they were in and at his other homes? So, up next, an expert on female extremism looks at this relationship from what we know so far and sheds some light on it. Also, tonight, more on President Trump's huge day in Las Vegas. On the ground, speaking with people, Bill Bennett will join me and will give us his take on how the president is handling this tragedy for America. Plus, for the first time since the June shooting of House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, the congressman reunites with three of his heroes for an exclusive story that is coming up. Their thoughts on that day and if it's changed anything for these men when it comes to gun control."

Fox News has learned that Marilou Danley was located overseas using sophisticated law enforcement tools that tracked her movements for several days once her relationship with Stephen Paddock was confirmed. Danley flew back to the United States last night and voluntarily agreed to the FBI interview today in Los Angeles. The lawyer said Danley's last minute trip to the Philippines was Paddock's idea. He had found a cheap ticket and then he wired a hundred thousand dollars to her. Taking together his client thought, Paddock was breaking up with her and the cash was meant to soften the blow."

Yes, they can't stop declaring responsibility, and it's kind of pathetic because you look at the story of the individual's life, and you see that Stephen Paddock was a drinker, they've even tried to justify his drinking.

I do a lot of research and I've talked to you on your show about the stuff that I'm doing on their encrypted acts. And we see them trying to take credit, but the fact remains as if this is the wrong individual to be a soldier of the caliphate. But also, they provided no evidence. There's no last will and testament. They keep saying it's coming, it's coming. But the fact is that, you know, if they hadn't made this bogus claim, we wouldn't be talking about ISIS at all. And it's the equivalent of what they call in psychology: \"the fear of missing out.\" They want to be part of the conversation. And if they repeat it enough, they think that they will get some credit. And we see in some areas Breitbart or Infowars, some of the conspiracy theories, they want to believe that it's ISIS, but I personally don't think so. And I also think anyone who's cooperating with the police, I give them a great deal of credit. She's got to be under an enormous amount of pressure, and, you know, getting hate mail, people thinking that she's done something that, you know, whether she's done it or not. We have to let this play out and see what the FBI says."

Also, right now, President Trump back in the air, coming back from Las Vegas at this point, expected to land in Washington at any moment tonight after meeting with these very brave individuals. You could just tell that being on the ground and be close to these folks and hear their stories was moving, really, to him and to everybody in the room today. There were people that he talked about, like Officer Tyler Peterson, who's on the second day on the job, jumped in front of flying bullets to save other people. He's now in the hospital recovering. They were all pulling for him. Officer Charles Hartfield, a veteran, husband, and father, who lost his life while he was there off-duty enjoying the concert that night. So many stories, so many personal tragedies that, really, we're just getting the full sense of as you learn these human being's stories.

There is the line about not even the devil himself knows the mind of man. I'm thinking about the president and first lady, some wonderful things that he said: we are surrounded by heroes, he said. Brings to mind Henry V, that actually -- can't remember we few, we happy few, the band of brothers. But this last sentence that we just heard: \"people will go to bed tonight, some people will go to bed and their world has been emptied.\" You know, it's interesting when Donald Trump does this and reads from a prepared speech. It's not the smooth kind of cloying delivery that you get from somebody who, you know, has practiced and practiced. He's kind of a rough and ready guy, you know, kind of a gruff New Yorker. You can see how comfortable he is, you know, just talking off the cuff, throwing paper towels out at the crowd as he was doing in Puerto Rico. But there's a real charm and I think a real attraction to what he did today because what he's doing, he's taking the personality and bordering it, boxing it in with these words. And you can almost see him thinking, I'm not going to get this wrong, I'm not going loose, I'm not going to off text because --"

And you could tell that they were all feeling the same thing. These guys are exhausted. They have been out there all week trying to make sense of this horrific, sad situation. And you know, you just -- you've felt it there today. And you know, it's sort of -- it's not written anywhere that, that's the president's duty or it's in the job description, but we have come in modern times come to expect it.

They have seen misery. They have seen the suffering of human beings. They've held their hands, they've have seen misery. They have seen suffering of human beings. They've held their hands. They've hugged them. They've seen the carnage and its consequences in Las Vegas. When they go to bed tonight, what affect does this have on them? I remember a book I read in college and it was a theology book, and said if you have ears attuned enough to hear all the suffering of the world at once it would overwhelm you. Well, the Trumps have had a pretty good portion of the suffering of the world, at least in America, in the last few weeks. And they have absorbed it very well, and presented themselves very well. I'm one American is very proud of them. I admire what they have done. I admire their composure. And I imagine this is drawing them closer, but I cannot fathom what they are thinking about. What effect this will have. The cumulative effect of all they have seen. People should have some real empathy for them such as the empathy they have shown to the people in those four places."

That's not a great day. And it comes at the end of a long period of push me-pull me strain between Trump and his secretary of state.

Tillerson used to be the head of the Boy Scouts of America, and Trump goes there a makes a whole scene at the jamboree. And this was a period of time where a lot of people in this administration, even people I talk to say I don't know if I can take this. Now things are calmer.

      "utterance": "It was a real just position between the time -- it seems like it was taking -- I was able to borrow a phone at 7:22 to call my wife and tell her that I was fine. And the other side it was either 7:06 or 7:09, so 13 minutes all of that went on, and it seems like a life time when it was happening. But it was a short period of time on elapse basis."

      "utterance": "So you're were whispering to him, you're talking to him, he's hearing it like a whisper, but those encouraging words for you. You said, when you came too, that was one of the first things that you brought up, right?"

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I knew, you know, my colleagues said -- came out to help me. And it really did give me, you know, a really good sense of calm and strength to know they're taking care of me and getting me ready. You know, you could hear paramedics coming and, you know, figured help was on the way and hoped I'll get to a hospital quick."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "BRAD WENSTRUP, U.S. CONGRESSMAN",
      "utterance": "By the grace of God, I was in a position that the second I saw the shooter go down I took off. As I was running, Jeff was on his way out there with a few other people, and they've already their shirt off and put it on at Bryan Kelly's shirt, put that right on the wound over his pant. I get out there and I knew there was more that we needed to look at and we're able to take it down. I saw the entrance wound but no exit wound, that when I knew Steve was in greater trouble than we might have imagined. And that's when we get a tourniquet put on him and try to stop any bleeding we could internally, as well as bandaging what was external."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "And that really did saved my life because the doctor said, when I got to the hospital, I was almost out of blood then if I would have lost even more. They said that tourniquet was applied perfectly and really did saved enough of my time to make it to the hospital alive, otherwise I wouldn't have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you all got a look at the shooter at some point during this. When you heard that he had a list of Republicans, that he was out there specifically seeking Republicans, Congressman Conaway, what went through your mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONAWAY",
      "utterance": "When I first heard of the list, Trent Kelly was talking to Jeff Duncan, and told Jeff that the guy had -- that Jeff told Trent that he had talked to in the parking lot, immediately before the guy asked him are these Republicans or Democrats? And Jeff said they were Republican and the guy says, OK, and just wondered off. And then later when I was talking to Jeff, he has Jeff's name in his pocket, and I asked Jeff how he felt and he's start shaking all over. But, you know, it's a time -- you know, we've got a couple of guys out there who's on that list and it was a bid deal. And I have never been shot at in anger. I did army training, low crawl through a bunch of machine gun fire but they're not shooting at you. But to be shot at is real surreal. I remember thinking as soon as the first volley went off and turn to run and seeing bullets pitch off the gravel, and I just remember thinking, us, you know, here? How could somebody look out and see a bunch of middle aged men playing baseball and see the enemy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLAKE",
      "utterance": "Perhaps both of these guys getting killed is that we won't be able to know why."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONAWAY",
      "utterance": "I mean, what triggered -- he had been at practice the day before. One of our guys have seen him sitting in the bleachers. He's been there since March. That was our last day to practice on that field before the following year. What was it -- what triggered that cause to go get his -- pull out those weapons and come shoot us? Same thing with this guy. By not being able to analyze that, it made it harder to figure out just what went through the mind to say it's not OK for me to try to take somebody's life for whatever reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So your colleague, Gabby Giffords, went through a similar situation. And I saw her husband, Mark Kelly, speaking out very forcefully about this. And saying if anybody thinks that the gun laws in this country are strong enough, they need to look again. When you look at Las Vegas -- and now I'm continuing with my own question about his comment yesterday, the machinery that appears to have been used, semiautomatic converted to automatic, which is illegal in this country but accessible, accessible on the internet that parts that you need to make -- to turn that gun into an intense killing machine that spray all those bullets across that crowded Las Vegas. Second amendment, any change of heart on this in this group?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONAWAY",
      "utterance": "Second amendment is supported as collecting guns and target shooting and hunting all those to all of us. The second amendment is not about that. Second amendment is about arm people to stand up to tyranny from a government that they would be opposed to. As so, we've need to cast the second amendment in its proper light, as we have this debate let's not lose sight on why the second amendment is most important to us. Yes, it's collecting and hunting. And yes, there's going to be time where, you know, automobiles are used improperly, and guns are used improperly, and drugs are used improperly, but let's be careful about what we do to ourselves in an attempt to try to stop people who aren't sane from doing things that they might otherwise do. So just be careful."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Senator, I think a lot of people look at Republicans on this issue and say that you're heartless. That you look at what happened at Sandy Hook, you look at what happened to Steve Scalise on the baseball field, and then Las Vegas, that we need tougher laws. What do you say to those people who claim that Republicans have a tin ear on this issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLAKE",
      "utterance": "I think we'll have discussions now about, you know, what was found in that hotel room in terms of accessibility of, you know, the ability to turn a semiautomatic into an automatic weaponry is illegal, per say. But he's seems to have access to material to change it. In terms of mental health, the ability of those with mental health -- and issues in terms of documentation and sharing of information between states and the federal government, there are areas of agreement that we can have and I think we can move ahead on."

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "You know if you look at what happen in my case, you had people onsite with guns to immediately encounter the shooter and take him down. And that happens every day in America where regular citizens that have their own guns because of the second amendment protection are able to defend themselves against criminals."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

There are reports now that three green berets were killed and two more injured in the West African nation. Fox is working to confirm these reports. We're told it was a squad of 8 to 10 special OP's that were attack in that area near Mali. So stay with us for any update on that throughout the night. So the president now back on his way as he gets this news to Washington. On the left, some of the images from his visit to the hospital today. On the right, Marine One as he lands at Andrews Air Force Base this evening. So we'll keep a close eye on those movements as well. And tonight before we go, we leave with you this."
