Now, tonight's special is going to address issues in our politics and our culture that are dividing America right into, and what we can do to remedy this. Now, we begin tonight with President Trump's decision to give Attorney General Bill Barr the authority to declassify documents that were related to the 2016 campaign surveillance. Now, first and foremost, Americans need to understand that their government has their best interest at heart always.  And when it became clear that some within the upper echelons of the DOJ, FBI and CIA and other intel organizations may have had their thumb on the political scale, a lot of Americans were rightly outraged. They want to believe in their government. That's why it is so stunning to see Democratic politicians sworn to uphold the constitution fight so hard to conceal present threats to it.  Now, take House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. He called Trump's decision to give the public more information un-American. Now, if we can't even agree upon basic set of standards under which these powerful organizations can act, especially in relation to the American people, then we are indeed at a crossroads.  Now, Trump addressed this issue from the outside - from just outside of the White House this afternoon. Let's watch.",

Great to see you all now on a Friday night. Joel, I want to start with you. Now, the left is accusing Trump of some grand cover-up.

We learn more about how they met and how they discussed the origins of this probe and their concerns about Russia and the election. So initially it was Brennan, Clapper, Comey - and I'm missing one - Brennan, Clapper, Comey and Lynch - Loretta Lynch. So it's very tight. Then it expanded and included Vice President Biden, Kerry, and Ash Carter. And I guess the President of the United States was eventually brought into the loop. This is fascinating. We're learning how Brennan would brief the President and keep the info out of the daily intel briefing. That came out in The New York Times today. I think we're going to learn a lot more just about that very interesting double cone of silence, if you will.  HARMEET DHILLON, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBER: Absolutely, Laura. And some of the other things that we're getting reminded about right now is the fact that British intelligence tipped the Obama administration in 2015 about alleged hacking by the Russians against the DNC. But they didn't do anything about it until very late in the game and until it was clear that they had lost that election. And then everything fell into place very quickly.  And so what Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues, Schiff and others, are doing today is gas-lighting the American people by calling the exposure of a cover-up and of a plot, a cover-up itself. I mean, language has no meaning with these people. This is kind of a Orwellian doublespeak that's going on right now. I think the President is exactly right to delegate this authority to somebody who has a long history of knowing how to parse out confidential and highly privileged and sensitive information.",

So we gave them cards for extra food, I think, and shelter maybe. But they found the cash payments didn't work at all. In fact, they just incentivized people to be more or less industrious, I would say. And that's about it.

There are drug problems, there is mental health issues. So giving a thousand bucks to a person who already has a mental health problem is probably not going to do the job. I mean, that's - probably that money is probably going to go - be quickly be spent on things that are going to get that individual into more problems. That's, I think, the concern of just giving cash to people because they're obviously not making good decisions, many of them, to get into the position they're in already in a very expensive city. But I want to read you a statement - hold on, Andrew - that you made just a few weeks ago to Newsweek. You said, \"When I've talked to Trump voters around the country, they've said that they're disappointed in what they've gotten from the administration. They feel like a lot of it was bluster and hot air.\" But a recent Goldman Sachs study found that wage growth has picked up sharply. Bottom 50 percent of wage earners are making more. Consumer confidence is up. Got other metrics up at 71 percent since the beginning of polling on confidence in the economy. Things - people think things are going to get better.

PAUL BOSSI, 100 PERCENT RAW POWERLIFTING FEDERATION: Well, at the beginning it was terrible. I got a lot of hate mail for the first couple days. It took place, the competition was on a Saturday, and on Sunday when this all became public knowledge on her Instagram, I started to get a lot of hate mail. And by the time I realized what was going on and was able to put a statement together, it was about a day or two after that. And while I put a statement together saying we're going to investigate, we're going to look into it, the hate mail was coming in by the dozens. It was terrible.

Joining me now is Warren Farrell, co-author of the book \"The Boy Crisis.\" Warren, what is the cause of these series of problems that boys are facing? DR. WARREN FARRELL, AUTHOR, \"THE BOY CRISIS\": In all 56 countries where they're facing this, the common denominator is these countries are developed. Their survival is not such a big problem, so there's plenty of permission for divorce and there's plenty of permission for women and boys to be raised without dads. And it's in the areas where there is a lack of father involvement that the problems exist. I'd say the boy crisis resides where fathers do not reside. So that's one part of it. And the other is, where we have single moms, we are not helping single moms know what dads typically bring to the parenting process so that the single moms can do things like roughhouse with the kids or teach the kids --",

Rolling Thunder officials tell Fox News a larger reason this is the last year, they are having problems with Pentagon officials when it comes to parking and access issues. Officials say there are logistical and financial issues they just don't want to deal with anymore. For example, those officials say vendors who have paid top dollar are being denied access to staging areas under Pentagon control. Laura, we reached out to and heard from the Pentagon about this issue, and we are told people were not denied access. I want to read a statement in part from the Pentagon, quote, \"During a review after last year's event, we were unable to identify any instances when groups we're denied access to the Pentagon Reservation. There was always the potential to experience a delay or detour transiting the Pentagon Reservation, especially during large event such as Rolling Thunder either to exist with the general traffic flow or for other reasons,\" end quote. In a statement from Sergeant Artie Muller, who runs the Rolling Thunder event, he said in part, quote, \"We are not going away. We have a lot to still do. Our military and our veterans need our support, and we are moving on. We want a full accounting of our prisoners of war and missing in action from all past wars. That's our goal,\" end quote. Now, organizers say Rolling Thunder will continue, but not in a central location like Washington D.C., but in the future there will be smaller rights in individual states.

We can never forget them. We always must honor them. And talk to your children about it and instill that in them as well. When you go by a cemetery, you'll see in that cemetery there will be members of the armed forces buried. Maybe take your kids in there, say a prayer, think about how blessed we are to live in this country where great men and women make that sacrifice willingly every day of every year. And God bless you all. Fly a flag, spend some time with your family, have a meaningful Memorial Day weekend. And don't forget to check out my podcast on PodcastOne.com.

Now, tonight's special is going to address issues in our politics and our culture that are dividing America right into, and what we can do to remedy this. Now, we begin tonight with President Trump's decision to give Attorney General Bill Barr the authority to declassify documents that were related to the 2016 campaign surveillance. Now, first and foremost, Americans need to understand that their government has their best interest at heart always. And when it became clear that some within the upper echelons of the DOJ, FBI and CIA and other intel organizations may have had their thumb on the political scale, a lot of Americans were rightly outraged. They want to believe in their government. That's why it is so stunning to see Democratic politicians sworn to uphold the constitution fight so hard to conceal present threats to it. Now, take House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. He called Trump's decision to give the public more information un-American. Now, if we can't even agree upon basic set of standards under which these powerful organizations can act, especially in relation to the American people, then we are indeed at a crossroads. Now, Trump addressed this issue from the outside - from just outside of the White House this afternoon. Let's watch."

Great to see you all now on a Friday night. Joel, I want to start with you. Now, the left is accusing Trump of some grand cover-up. Now, why would he urge the Attorney General to declassify all this information if there were all these nuggets and bits and pieces that were going to incriminate him or anyone in his campaign?"

You heal the rift by exposing what happened under the Obama- Biden at the end of their term, what was done against their political opponents, why did they let loose the FBI and other agencies to go after their political opponents. Let's put it all out there. By the way, Laura, if they have good answers, then let's move beyond this. And I think that that is the key in all of this, which is somehow we skipped over the Obama-wrongdoing, moved right to the foe-Trump crimes, and we've been stuck on this Russia collusion thing. It's time to get to the real story."

      "utterance": "Well, John Kerry is one of the people who's mentioned in some of the stories about the circle. It was a very tight circle they kept. Harmeet, I want you to chime in here. We learn more about how they met and how they discussed the origins of this probe and their concerns about Russia and the election. So initially it was Brennan, Clapper, Comey - and I'm missing one - Brennan, Clapper, Comey and Lynch - Loretta Lynch. So it's very tight. Then it expanded and included Vice President Biden, Kerry, and Ash Carter. And I guess the President of the United States was eventually brought into the loop. This is fascinating. We're learning how Brennan would brief the President and keep the info out of the daily intel briefing. That came out in The New York Times today. I think we're going to learn a lot more just about that very interesting double cone of silence, if you will. HARMEET DHILLON, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBER: Absolutely, Laura. And some of the other things that we're getting reminded about right now is the fact that British intelligence tipped the Obama administration in 2015 about alleged hacking by the Russians against the DNC. But they didn't do anything about it until very late in the game and until it was clear that they had lost that election. And then everything fell into place very quickly. And so what Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues, Schiff and others, are doing today is gas-lighting the American people by calling the exposure of a cover-up and of a plot, a cover-up itself. I mean, language has no meaning with these people. This is kind of a Orwellian doublespeak that's going on right now. I think the President is exactly right to delegate this authority to somebody who has a long history of knowing how to parse out confidential and highly privileged and sensitive information."

Drug possession is still a crime technically, but the city prosecutor won't charge people if they have a gram or less. So cops won't bother making arrest for using drugs in the open. After a library audit found people of color and the poor were getting locked out of their accounts more frequently than whites for not paying late fines, the city decided to eliminate the fines. But since that will drop revenue, voters are being asked to pass a $213 million library levy. Officials say the fines are not about personal responsibility."

Now, even The New York Times is taking note, writing an op-ed this week titled \"America's Cities are Unlivable, Blame Wealthy Liberals.\" Though I'm not sure the solution of this particular columnist is really the answer. It's kind of more left-wing policies. But what are the solutions? Now, given their track record, why should anyone trust the Democratic Party on this? Democratic Presidential hopeful, I'm delighted he's with us, Andrew Yang, thinks he has the answer and joins me now. Andrew, first of all, thank you very much for being on with us tonight. We really appreciate it. Seattle is one of the most beautiful cities in the country. It just is. I mean, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, they're spectacular places. What can be done that's not being done now in this beautiful city given the leadership that's in place and given the enormity of the problems?"

      "speaker": "ANDREW YANG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "Well, the cost-of-living in Seattle and San Francisco, both of them have skyrocketed over the last number of months. And so my plan would put a thousand dollars a month in the hands of every American adult, and that would create an economic incentive for cities to be able to invest in people who are struggling with substance abuse or homelessness and hopefully get the economic resource in place to provide them a path forward and in some cases even access to have shelter and housing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So you think a thousand bucks a month is going to make much of a difference here? Because it seems like we're way beyond that. I mean, I remember Gavin Newsom, when he was Mayor of San Francisco or on the City - in City Council, he actually came in. It was a day I started my radio show. It was back in - gosh, it was back in 2001, in April. He came in and he said, giving cash to the homeless was a disaster. So Gavin Newsom - we did cards. So we gave them cards for extra food, I think, and shelter maybe. But they found the cash payments didn't work at all. In fact, they just incentivized people to be more or less industrious, I would say. And that's about it. And Andrew, just on the money, according to Cato, I guess it was since the War on Poverty was declared, what was that, in 1964, we've spent about $23 trillion. So it didn't seem to help us, at least in the cities."

    {
      "speaker": "YANG",
      "utterance": "Well, the question is, where did that money go, Laura? And my plan would put economic resources directly into our hands. And it would create, again, an economic path forward for many people who right now are struggling and don't have access to, let's say, treatment for substance abuse problems or mental health issues because right now we have to face facts where these problems are growing in many of our cities and our current programs are not well designed to handle this particular problem, because in large part, if there's someone who's lying on the street, there's not right now an economic incentive to help that person get back on their feet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right. The problem is, though, if we give a thousand bucks to a guy on the street, not everybody, some people are just down on their luck, but there is a significant percentage of people, and we know from just two blocks from where we are now there's a homeless shelter, a lot of people have a lot of problems. There are drug problems, there is mental health issues. So giving a thousand bucks to a person who already has a mental health problem is probably not going to do the job. I mean, that's - probably that money is probably going to go - be quickly be spent on things that are going to get that individual into more problems. That's, I think, the concern of just giving cash to people because they're obviously not making good decisions, many of them, to get into the position they're in already in a very expensive city. But I want to read you a statement - hold on, Andrew - that you made just a few weeks ago to Newsweek. You said, \"When I've talked to Trump voters around the country, they've said that they're disappointed in what they've gotten from the administration. They feel like a lot of it was bluster and hot air.\" But a recent Goldman Sachs study found that wage growth has picked up sharply. Bottom 50 percent of wage earners are making more. Consumer confidence is up. Got other metrics up at 71 percent since the beginning of polling on confidence in the economy. Things - people think things are going to get better. So, this idea that nothing is working with Trump, I just think that's an overstatement at best."

And then now that he's in the White House, he's singing a very different tune. The experience I'm having when I talk to voters around the country is that 78 percent of them are living paycheck-to-paycheck, 57 percent--"

But back to leadership though, Andrew, because I think you're someone - I don't maybe agree with you, but you're someone who seems like you want to solve things, you want to solve problems, and I respect that. Forbes says the top five cities in the United States with the largest homeless populations are the following. It's not surprising. So New York, LA, Seattle, San Diego, San Jose. Now, four of five of these cities are run by Democrats. So, how is liberal governance working out for these cities? I mean, my hometown of Hartford - outside of Hartford, Connecticut - but Hartford, Connecticut, it's having real problems, had problems for a long time. Always liberal leadership in Hartford.

So why has that seemingly reasonable explanation become so controversial? He is here exclusively to explain. All right, Paul, what has the reaction been so far? PAUL BOSSI, 100 PERCENT RAW POWERLIFTING FEDERATION: Well, at the beginning it was terrible. I got a lot of hate mail for the first couple days. It took place, the competition was on a Saturday, and on Sunday when this all became public knowledge on her Instagram, I started to get a lot of hate mail. And by the time I realized what was going on and was able to put a statement together, it was about a day or two after that. And while I put a statement together saying we're going to investigate, we're going to look into it, the hate mail was coming in by the dozens. It was terrible.

And they lost pretty big to these two individuals who identify now as transgendered females, but they were born men. And that sent shockwaves through Connecticut, and now this. And people have to understand, and you can comment on this, just the biological differences regardless of hormone treatment and all of that. Females are on average nine percent shorter than men. Male bones are bigger in both size and density, affects your sport. Females have shorter arms, legs, relative to the body size, and females are around 30 to 35 percent muscle by weight, while males are 40 to 50 percent muscle by weight.

It would require you to allow transgender females to compete against biological females. What would that do to your records? What would that do to the sport of powerlifting?"

Women have worked so hard over the years for equal rights and to get their opportunity to be on the sports field, Title IX has helped them a lot. And now also women have good programs going, they have good records going, good sports organizations, lots of female divisions in all sports."

You stood by your bylines. You didn't crumble to political correctness, and I think you're going to get a lot more supports. You respect all people, but these are the rules of your federation. We really appreciate your perspective tonight. And by the way, with all the attention being paid to protecting transgender individuals, are we losing sight of the problems dogging young men and boys? My next guest says the future of America herself is at risk, and boys are facing a crisis of economic health, physical health, and mental health. Joining me now is Warren Farrell, co-author of the book \"The Boy Crisis.\" Warren, what is the cause of these series of problems that boys are facing? DR. WARREN FARRELL, AUTHOR, \"THE BOY CRISIS\": In all 56 countries where they're facing this, the common denominator is these countries are developed. Their survival is not such a big problem, so there's plenty of permission for divorce and there's plenty of permission for women and boys to be raised without dads. And it's in the areas where there is a lack of father involvement that the problems exist. I'd say the boy crisis resides where fathers do not reside. So that's one part of it. And the other is, where we have single moms, we are not helping single moms know what dads typically bring to the parenting process so that the single moms can do things like roughhouse with the kids or teach the kids --"

      "utterance": "I want to get into what we're looking at here so people get it. We're talking around the issue. Just on the issue of suicide, OK, when I saw these numbers, I have two sons, it just, it shocks me. Ages 15 to 19 years of age, boys have three times the suicide rate of girls. They have four-and-a-half times the suicide rate of girls between the ages of 20 and 24. So three times the rate and four-and-a-half times the rate for those two age groups. That is just one of the issues we have. We have dropout rate higher. We have opioid use. Jerome Powell, I think we have a sound bite, he spoke about this. Let's watch."

      "utterance": "Exactly. Your suicide rate, your depression rate, we used to always associate depression with females. But when we look at how the depression leads to suicide and what are the other characteristics, ways boys express depression, the withdrawal into video games, the withdrawal into port. And there are so many dimensions of male depression that lead to the suicide that we have been completely overlooking."

Tens of thousands of motorcycles roar through the streets as a reminder of the nearly 100,000 prisoners of war and those missing in action. Organizers say they are tired of being harassed.

      "utterance": "Laura, organizers with Rolling Thunder say that harassment stems from logistical issues. This is a Memorial Day staple that began earlier this evening with a blessing of the bikes. Rolling Thunder officials tell Fox News a larger reason this is the last year, they are having problems with Pentagon officials when it comes to parking and access issues. Officials say there are logistical and financial issues they just don't want to deal with anymore. For example, those officials say vendors who have paid top dollar are being denied access to staging areas under Pentagon control. Laura, we reached out to and heard from the Pentagon about this issue, and we are told people were not denied access. I want to read a statement in part from the Pentagon, quote, \"During a review after last year's event, we were unable to identify any instances when groups we're denied access to the Pentagon Reservation. There was always the potential to experience a delay or detour transiting the Pentagon Reservation, especially during large event such as Rolling Thunder either to exist with the general traffic flow or for other reasons,\" end quote. In a statement from Sergeant Artie Muller, who runs the Rolling Thunder event, he said in part, quote, \"We are not going away. We have a lot to still do. Our military and our veterans need our support, and we are moving on. We want a full accounting of our prisoners of war and missing in action from all past wars. That's our goal,\" end quote. Now, organizers say Rolling Thunder will continue, but not in a central location like Washington D.C., but in the future there will be smaller rights in individual states. The last ride, Rolling Thunder in Washington, takes place on Sunday. Laura?"

      "utterance": "That is all the time we have tonight. I hope you might think about taking a moment this weekend to think about what Memorial Day really is and what it means. We all like to be with our family and our friends and celebrating, but it's really commemorating the soldiers, the sailors, the airman, the marines, all the reservists, and their families, who sacrifice every day, and those who paid the ultimate price. We can never forget them. We always must honor them. And talk to your children about it and instill that in them as well. When you go by a cemetery, you'll see in that cemetery there will be members of the armed forces buried. Maybe take your kids in there, say a prayer, think about how blessed we are to live in this country where great men and women make that sacrifice willingly every day of every year. And God bless you all. Fly a flag, spend some time with your family, have a meaningful Memorial Day weekend. And don't forget to check out my podcast on PodcastOne.com.
