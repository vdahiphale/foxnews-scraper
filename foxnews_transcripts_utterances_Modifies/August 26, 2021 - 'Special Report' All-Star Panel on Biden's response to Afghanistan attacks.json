Mara, you've covered the White House for a long time.  This was the worst day of this presidency so far. Your thoughts on how the president dealt with it, and where this administration trying to get us?  MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think that the president came out, and he was very somber, he said  he took full responsibility for fundamentally everything that has happened.   I don't like he had a choice in that. He still stuck to his decision to pull out. But there is still the incredible question about why he was so 180 degrees   wrong. He keeps on saying that this is inevitable, there had to be this kind of chaotic exit. But I don't think he is saying that it inevitable that we would have lost a dozen U.S. soldiers. And up until now, we've all  been saying, and I've been saying it over and over again, that the White   House has to hope that they can evacuate Afghanistan without any loss of American life. And today it happened. And a whole lot of other assumptions  were exploded today, like you can rely on Taliban to provide security around the airport. They were wrong about that to. So this is just a really  bad day for the White House and for the country.",

MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": What we were just talking with   Ian Bremmer and Jack Keane about Bagram Air Base, one thing that's being overlooked about Bagram is that Bagram contained the largest prison in Afghanistan. The decision to hand Bagram over to the Taliban allowed them  to release between 5,000 and 7,000 prisoners, and it included a maxim  security cell where all the most hardened Al Qaeda and ISIS and Taliban leaders were. And they were released before the U.S. withdrawal and free to   go after them. Let us hope that none of those terrorists were involved in this attack today because that would be a searing indictment of decision to  withdraw from Bagram.  And then the other point is, instead of being chastened, he used today's deadly terrorist attack to justify his decision to stick with the August 31st withdrawal date. He said, this is a quote, he said this is why I'm so   determined to limit the duration of the mission. In other words, the  terrorists succeeded. By killing Americans today, they reinforced Joe Biden determination against pressure from our European allies and others to stick  with that deadline, that artificial deadline for retreat. So they succeeded  in the mission.",

And we see what happens when you do things in the wrong order. You don't pull your  troops out before you get your people out, before you get the embassy workers out and the Americans out, and the Afghans who helped us out. Then you pull our troops out. We're also seeing what happens when you trust the Taliban to help you reach   your ends. This is a terrorist group. The administrations is trying to pretend as if the Taliban is like a kinder and gentler terrorist group, unlike ISIS and Al-Qaeda and the Haqqani Network. No, they are not. All of these groups share the same ends, and none of them shed a tear at seeing  U.S. servicemen lose their lives. The Taliban have been lying from the beginning. They said that they would not host these extreme terrorist groups inside of Afghanistan. But the fact of the matter is that both ISIS  and Al Qaeda have a presence in that country. That's a violation of the deal for us leaving the place. So again, this is a misguided policy by the Biden administration that they seem to be doubling down on.",
