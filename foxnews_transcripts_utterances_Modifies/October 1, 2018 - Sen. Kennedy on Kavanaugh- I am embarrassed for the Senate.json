Well, Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, revealed late this afternoon, he will have an up or down vote later this week to determine whether or not Judge Brett Kavanaugh will be the ninth Justice to go to the court and fill it up.   That will be determined largely by this FBI investigation that you heard from the president is very much underway. They were working late at night through the weekend to get it done. And he says, the president, he's not putting any restrictions on it despite reports over the weekend to the contrary. In fact, we just learned Kavanaugh friend, Mark Judge, has talked to the FBI through his lawyer.  His lawyer says he is -- the FBI has not finished it yet though. So, maybe they have more questions for Mark Judge. Remember, a deadline of Friday was set not by the president but by the Senators who cut that deal. Republican Jeff Flake, Democrat Chris Coons, a one-week probe by the FBI to focus on what was said to be current incredible allegations like the charge from Dr. Christine Ford, not necessarily new ones.   But, Coons cracked the door open to expanding this by saying in interviews, he can't control what new allegations may pop up. Sure enough, other unverified charges are popping up. A Washington Post story quoting a former Yale classmate is claiming Kavanaugh was a violent drunk. The White House tonight putting out statements from other classmates saying that's not true. MSNBC airing an interview with Julie Swetnick who claims there were gang rapes in high school. Even though NBC itself says tonight, they could not corroborate this information with anyone else.  All of this coming as Mitch McConnell charged that Democrats are going to try to drag this FBI probe out beyond Friday. Watch.",

I don't think anybody in the Milky Way could be surprised that the Democrats are yet again moving the goalposts. There is nothing we can do to get our Democratic friends to consider voting for Judge Kavanaugh. The only way to make them happy is to pull him down and I guess dig up Bill Douglas and nominate him. And anybody else who thinks otherwise is just -- is just kidding themselves. Look, this is what the Democratic -- Democrats say, they say that Brett Kavanaugh is a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator. He's been through six FBI background checks, each of which is a cross between an endoscopy and a colonoscopy. And none of this turn -- was turned up.

Part of this midterm election campaign tour, the President is campaigning for Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn. Blackburn is trying to fill the Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Bob Corker. She faces a competitive race against former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen, so encouraging high voter turnout here in rural and conservative East Tennessee is going to be crucial. It's going to be a crucial strategy for the Republican Party and Mr. Trump's visit is a major part of that tonight. Tomorrow President Trump plans to hold a rally in Southaven Mississippi where he is campaigning for Republican Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith who faces a four-way nonpartisan special election in November.

Critics say the bill is tilted heavily in favor of accusers. The governor also signed other sexual misconduct legislation, including a bill to clean up the state capital. Last year, 140 women came forward denouncing state lawmakers for promoting a, quote, \"pervasive culture of sexual harassment.\" Three lawmakers ended up resigning, four more are facing allegations. But tonight, a Democratic congressional hopeful is no longer facing sexual harassment claims.

Well now that activist is changing Melissa Fazli is changing her tune.

Well, Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, revealed late this afternoon, he will have an up or down vote later this week to determine whether or not Judge Brett Kavanaugh will be the ninth Justice to go to the court and fill it up. That will be determined largely by this FBI investigation that you heard from the president is very much underway. They were working late at night through the weekend to get it done. And he says, the president, he's not putting any restrictions on it despite reports over the weekend to the contrary. In fact, we just learned Kavanaugh friend, Mark Judge, has talked to the FBI through his lawyer.  His lawyer says he is -- the FBI has not finished it yet though. So, maybe they have more questions for Mark Judge. Remember, a deadline of Friday was set not by the president but by the Senators who cut that deal. Republican Jeff Flake, Democrat Chris Coons, a one-week probe by the FBI to focus on what was said to be current incredible allegations like the charge from Dr. Christine Ford, not necessarily new ones. But, Coons cracked the door open to expanding this by saying in interviews, he can't control what new allegations may pop up. Sure enough, other unverified charges are popping up. A Washington Post story quoting a former Yale classmate is claiming Kavanaugh was a violent drunk. The White House tonight putting out statements from other classmates saying that's not true. MSNBC airing an interview with Julie Swetnick who claims there were gang rapes in high school. Even though NBC itself says tonight, they could not corroborate this information with anyone else. All of this coming as Mitch McConnell charged that Democrats are going to try to drag this FBI probe out beyond Friday. Watch."

She says that she attended 10 gang rapes at which Judge Kavanaugh was supposedly involved. She didn't report any of them. She is represented by Mr. Avenatti who has done his did level best to make all of this about Mr. Avenatti. I don't think anybody in the Milky Way could be surprised that the Democrats are yet again moving the goalposts. There is nothing we can do to get our Democratic friends to consider voting for Judge Kavanaugh. The only way to make them happy is to pull him down and I guess dig up Bill Douglas and nominate him. And anybody else who thinks otherwise is just -- is just kidding themselves. Look, this is what the Democratic -- Democrats say, they say that Brett Kavanaugh is a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator. He's been through six FBI background checks, each of which is a cross between an endoscopy and a colonoscopy. And none of this turn -- was turned up. Now, he's going through the seventh one which the Democrats demanded. And we're not even halfway through probably. And now they're unhappy with that. Give me a break.

The president was speaking truthfully when he said they're working around the clock on this. They are not political. They couldn't care less about Republicans or Democrats.

      "utterance": "So you know -- I mean it's fascinating to watch this unfold because what we've heard for the past year and a half is that the president was going to ruin all of our relationships with you know, all of our allies, with all the countries around the world that these trade tariffs that he was putting in place we're going to hurt the economy dramatically.  And we've seen -- you know, there's been some dings here and there for sure, but what we are starting to see is that there are bilateral relationships coming together and in this case a trilateral deal. As we know the President wanted to break these down and do them individually. So how is it working in your opinion?"

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "This is a really, really clear plan coming into play step by step.  And the first thing we should say as you've just shown, this is a very clear specific campaign promise and it's good for democracy when politicians deliver their promises. That gives people faith that the political system works. On the specifics of the deal it's very good particularly for the dairy industry and also for the car industry as you said, but also it protects intellectual property for American companies.  It's all around a good deal in itself. But the real significance I think is that it tells the world that actually this trade strategy, this new disruptive trade strategy from President Trump it's not just bluster and tweeting and having a go at the old regime, it's really serious. And if you get down and negotiate, you can get a good deal. And then the further, final point, is that the people are going to be really worried by this is China because they'll see the step by step the president is now doing deals with allies Canada, Mexico, next perhaps the E.U. or Japan, and that's going to be one big alliance against the real threat which is China."

      "speaker": "HILTON",

For far too long we've had this attitude in this country and this has been true under Democratic administrations as well as Republican ones that you've just got a deal with China, you've got to engage with China. If we -- if we're nice to them then they'll improve their record on human rights and they'll stop their plan to basically take over the world which they've set out, they've got a simple plan that they've said that just by the 100th year anniversary of the People's Republic, they want to be dominant militarily, technologically, and economically. And the truth is that that being nice to them hasn't stopped them. You've got to stand up to them and so I'm really pleased to see that we're being tough not just on trade but on military matters too. And I think we need to go even further."

Their economy is so much stronger and they've been hacking and meddling for years.  During the days, they hacked into our government systems, stole all that personal information. And so, while the whole of the political establishment in the swamp is sort of obsessed with Russia, they've taken their eye off the ball.

The California law is aimed to making sure wealthy and well-connected people can't repeatedly buy their way out of sexual misconduct allegations. Separately, this law would also allow alleged victims of sexual misconduct to remain anonymous, while the names of alleged suspects cannot be kept confidential. Critics say the bill is tilted heavily in favor of accusers. The governor also signed other sexual misconduct legislation, including a bill to clean up the state capital. Last year, 140 women came forward denouncing state lawmakers for promoting a, quote, \"pervasive culture of sexual harassment.\" Three lawmakers ended up resigning, four more are facing allegations. But tonight, a Democratic congressional hopeful is no longer facing sexual harassment claims. Earlier this year, Gil Cisneros who is running to replace retiring GOP California Congressman Ed Royce, was accused by a Democratic activist of offering her a political donation in exchange for sex. Well now that activist is changing Melissa Fazli is changing her tune. This weekend, a meeting was facilitated between Fazli and Cisneros and afterwards, she said, quoting, \"I misunderstood the conversation that I had with him Gil Cisneros at the Democratic convention and after. I don't believe that Gil sexually harassed me.\" But Cisneros is currently running against Republican Young Kim for that congressional seat, and the Republican super PAC is continuing to capitalize on the sexual harassment allegations.
