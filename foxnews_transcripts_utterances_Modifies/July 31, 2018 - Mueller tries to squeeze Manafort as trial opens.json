      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" All right. We are 98 days away from the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. We are 440 days into Robert Mueller's corrupt political witch-hunt.  And today, the trial of Paul Manafort kicked off in a northern Virginia courtroom. You would think it's the trial of the century, it's not. But he's facing potential life in prison over a tax charge that had nothing to do with Russia from 2005.  Now, today, the trial of Paul Manafort kicked off in what are about alleged crimes let me tell you right now had nothing to do with President Trump or Russia or collusion. Nothing.  Now, instead, the prosecution of Paul Manafort, it represents yet the latest in another example of Team Mueller turning the screws on a one-time Trump ally in order to extort something, anything on President Trump. Now, in moments, were going to highlight the sad two-tiered justice system in this country which we better save and we're going to tell you who should really be facing charges tonight if we had equal application of our laws and equal justice under the law without political prejudice or literally criminalizing political differences. And also tonight, President Trump gave a rousing in speech toward a rally in Tampa Florida for a gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis. We'll show you the highlights.  Meanwhile, before Trump took the stage, poor CNN Jimmy Acosta got a taste of what Trump voters really think about CNN fake news. I'm going to give some advice to fake new CNN tonight, how they can regain the trust that Americans -- well, that they've lost. I don't think they're going to take me up on it, but I'm going to try. And finally, disgusting language from the left and other never Trumpers. You won't believe what one congressional candidate called our first lady. Sit tight, buckle up, we have a jam-packed breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "There's your media obsessing over a 2005 tax case. We're going to bring you the truth tonight. Everything you're watching on the news media is all political. This is the weaponization -- it's very dangerous - - of our justice system. Yes, Paul Manafort like Lieutenant General Flynn, Michael Cohen and others being targeted because of their one-time association with Donald Trump. And, look, let me be clear, I have no idea what Paul Manafort did in 2005, '06, or '07, but it wasn't with Russia.  And I do know the special counsel investigation is literally trying to throw the book at him. They want to extract negative information only about the president. It's the only reason why this is happening.  Or as the judge in this case overseeing this case literally said early on telling Mueller's, quote, legal team led by the corrupt Andrew Weissmann: I don't see what relation this indictment has with anything the special prosecutors authorized to investigate, you don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or his impeachment or whatever. And Judge T.S. Ellis goes on to say that Mueller wanted to, quote, tighten the screws, all in an effort to make Manafort sing or compose. By the way, composing means I'll say whatever you want if you don't put me in jail. I'll make up any story you want. That's the only reason this trial is happening. Now, if found guilty, Manafort faces for a 2005 tax case up to life in prison over financial related charges. It has nothing to do with Russia at all. Nothing to do with President Trump.   I think he worked for the president less than a hundred days. In fact, witnesses have been instructed to avoid using Trump's name altogether in order to prevent political bias from playing a role with the jury.  Now, without a doubt, Manafort's aggressive prosecution from a special counsel who is supposed to be investigating Russia, Russia, Russia is just one more clear example in the United States of America today. Sadly, we have a two-tiered system of justice in this country. Anyone ever associated with President Trump is now under the legal microscope. But Hillary Clinton, 2016 exoneration before investigation. Literally, they were writing it in May. They don't interview her until July. Three days later, she's out free.  And we know she committed crimes. We know the server was hacked by foreign entities. We know she violated the Espionage Act, mishandled secret intelligence.  Where is that server? Where are those emails? Why did she destroy classified top-secret information? We all know that if any of you out there, if you would delete subpoenaed emails, acid-washed your hard drive with Bleach Bit, bust up your devices with hammers, eliminate their SIM cards after they're subpoenaed, you would be charged with obstruction of justice. So, the question really tonight is, why isn't Hillary Clinton on trial for violating the Espionage Act, for obstructing justice?  And, of course, we got Clinton's dirty Russian dossier filled with Russian lies to influence the election and literally brainwash the American people and misinformation campaigns before the election. Why is it Mueller investigating that collusion? And then there are high-ranking officials who lied to FISA judges four separate times. They didn't verify the information. They didn't corroborate the information. The information that they presented to the judges turned out to be untrue.   Why are they on trial? Why didn't they tell these judges that Hillary Clinton literally paid for that information? They purposely withheld that information from the judges. Comey signed off on the FISA application. Sally Yates signed off about -- on it.  What about Strzok and Page? They steered two investigations one in favor of the candidate they loved and one against the candidate they hate. Where's Andrew McCabe? We know the deputy FBI director is a liar and that he probably should be charged with certain crimes as well. Where's Clapper? Where's Brennan? Leaking the dossier information to people like, what, Harry Reid?   This is the sad truth tonight in America. We have a two-tier justice system. As Mark Levin says, we live in a post-constitutional America. We better get our country back. We better start demanding equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws or else we are going to lose our rights and our freedoms as a constitutional republic forever. That's why this upcoming midterm election, in 98 days, will be the single most important midterm in our lifetime, and we've only just begun to peel back the layers of this deep state. And our work, by the way, can only continue if Republicans maintain those majorities in the House and Senate. Even if you have to hold your nose and vote for a RINO that's weak and spineless, at least they're not going to be trying to impeach the president. Now, earlier tonight, while campaigning for Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis -- well, the president had this to say about the upcoming elections and so much more. Let's take a look.",

You pretend to be fair and unbiased journalists, you're not.  You're not reporting facts. You're giving your opinion. You're an opinion channel. Every minute of every day, every week, 24/7 hate Trump, and it's pretty obvious and the people see it. So, instead of maybe doubling down on your anti-Trump rage, maybe look inward. Maybe find your Zen. Maybe find your inner peace. Analyze objectively the overwhelming, nonstop, hysterical coverage against the president. In other words, maybe you will have a better luck getting an interview if you start being a little fair. Maybe, just maybe. You'll take my advice, I tend to doubt it. We do have a recent study, FOX News -- that's right, this channel, not fake news CNN, is among the most trusted brands in TV news. Now, sadly, I doubt CNN is going to take my advice. So, while CNN continues to trash the president hour after hour, minute after minute, day after day, many on the left, other Never Trumpers are engaging in rhetoric that is even worse, literally bottom of the barrel. Now, this week, on Twitter, one congressional candidate from Oregon used one of the single most vulgar terms to describe the first lady of the United States. Imagine the outrage if a Republican candidate ever said the same thing about the former first lady, Michelle Obama. The outrage from these very same people would be nonstop, but the media has largely ignored the story. So, some Republicans are calling for to get her to ban this deranged Trumpet hater from their social media platform. We're not going to hold our breath.  But with 98 short days until these important midterms, each night on this program we will do something that your mainstream media will not do. We'll actually show you the very worst rhetoric coming out of the Democratic Party. It happens every single election cycle. They will call Republicans racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, who want dirty air, dirty water, they want to throw granny over the cliff and kill children. And just like the attacks on Melania Trump. There's only one way to counter the deranged left wing in this country. If you care about your rights, if you care about this country, if you care about the president's successful agenda, you better get your ass and go vote in November because the future of the country does depend on it. Democrats have their post-election agenda in place. If they win and 98 days, you see on the screen what they will do. All right. Before we get to our guest tonight, I got to wish a good friend of mine, Pete Constantino, a happy birthday.

We are 440 days into Robert Mueller's corrupt political witch-hunt. And today, the trial of Paul Manafort kicked off in a northern Virginia courtroom. You would think it's the trial of the century, it's not. But he's facing potential life in prison over a tax charge that had nothing to do with Russia from 2005. Now, today, the trial of Paul Manafort kicked off in what are about alleged crimes let me tell you right now had nothing to do with President Trump or Russia or collusion. Nothing. Now, instead, the prosecution of Paul Manafort, it represents yet the latest in another example of Team Mueller turning the screws on a one-time Trump ally in order to extort something, anything on President Trump. Now, in moments, were going to highlight the sad two-tiered justice system in this country which we better save and we're going to tell you who should really be facing charges tonight if we had equal application of our laws and equal justice under the law without political prejudice or literally criminalizing political differences. And also tonight, President Trump gave a rousing in speech toward a rally in Tampa Florida for a gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis. We'll show you the highlights. Meanwhile, before Trump took the stage, poor CNN Jimmy Acosta got a taste of what Trump voters really think about CNN fake news. I'm going to give some advice to fake new CNN tonight, how they can regain the trust that Americans -- well, that they've lost. I don't think they're going to take me up on it, but I'm going to try. And finally, disgusting language from the left and other never Trumpers. You won't believe what one congressional candidate called our first lady. Sit tight, buckle up, we have a jam-packed breaking news opening monologue."

These charges have nothing to do at all with the president. These charges have nothing to do with Russian collusion. I'll be shocked if Russia is mentioned once in this trial.

This is the weaponization -- it's very dangerous - - of our justice system. Yes, Paul Manafort like Lieutenant General Flynn, Michael Cohen and others being targeted because of their one-time association with Donald Trump. And, look, let me be clear, I have no idea what Paul Manafort did in 2005, '06, or '07, but it wasn't with Russia. And I do know the special counsel investigation is literally trying to throw the book at him. They want to extract negative information only about the president. It's the only reason why this is happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Or as the judge in this case overseeing this case literally said early on telling Mueller's, quote, legal team led by the corrupt Andrew Weissmann",
      "utterance": "I don't see what relation this indictment has with anything the special prosecutors authorized to investigate, you don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or his impeachment or whatever. And Judge T.S. Ellis goes on to say that Mueller wanted to, quote, tighten the screws, all in an effort to make Manafort sing or compose. By the way, composing means I'll say whatever you want if you don't put me in jail. I'll make up any story you want. That's the only reason this trial is happening. Now, if found guilty, Manafort faces for a 2005 tax case up to life in prison over financial related charges. It has nothing to do with Russia at all. Nothing to do with President Trump. I think he worked for the president less than a hundred days. In fact, witnesses have been instructed to avoid using Trump's name altogether in order to prevent political bias from playing a role with the jury. Now, without a doubt, Manafort's aggressive prosecution from a special counsel who is supposed to be investigating Russia, Russia, Russia is just one more clear example in the United States of America today. Sadly, we have a two-tiered system of justice in this country. Anyone ever associated with President Trump is now under the legal microscope. But Hillary Clinton, 2016 exoneration before investigation. Literally, they were writing it in May. They don't interview her until July. Three days later, she's out free. And we know she committed crimes. We know the server was hacked by foreign entities. We know she violated the Espionage Act, mishandled secret intelligence. Where is that server? Where are those emails? Why did she destroy classified top-secret information? We all know that if any of you out there, if you would delete subpoenaed emails, acid-washed your hard drive with Bleach Bit, bust up your devices with hammers, eliminate their SIM cards after they're subpoenaed, you would be charged with obstruction of justice. So, the question really tonight is, why isn't Hillary Clinton on trial for violating the Espionage Act, for obstructing justice? And, of course, we got Clinton's dirty Russian dossier filled with Russian lies to influence the election and literally brainwash the American people and misinformation campaigns before the election. Why is it Mueller investigating that collusion? And then there are high-ranking officials who lied to FISA judges four separate times. They didn't verify the information. They didn't corroborate the information. The information that they presented to the judges turned out to be untrue. Why are they on trial? Why didn't they tell these judges that Hillary Clinton literally paid for that information? They purposely withheld that information from the judges. Comey signed off on the FISA application. Sally Yates signed off about -- on it. What about Strzok and Page? They steered two investigations one in favor of the candidate they loved and one against the candidate they hate. Where's Andrew McCabe? We know the deputy FBI director is a liar and that he probably should be charged with certain crimes as well. Where's Clapper? Where's Brennan? Leaking the dossier information to people like, what, Harry Reid? This is the sad truth tonight in America. We have a two-tier justice system. As Mark Levin says, we live in a post-constitutional America. We better get our country back. We better start demanding equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws or else we are going to lose our rights and our freedoms as a constitutional republic forever. That's why this upcoming midterm election, in 98 days, will be the single most important midterm in our lifetime, and we've only just begun to peel back the layers of this deep state. And our work, by the way, can only continue if Republicans maintain those majorities in the House and Senate. Even if you have to hold your nose and vote for a RINO that's weak and spineless, at least they're not going to be trying to impeach the president. Now, earlier tonight, while campaigning for Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis -- well, the president had this to say about the upcoming elections and so much more. Let's take a look."

You pretend to be fair and unbiased journalists, you're not. You're not reporting facts. You're giving your opinion. You're an opinion channel. Every minute of every day, every week, 24/7 hate Trump, and it's pretty obvious and the people see it. So, instead of maybe doubling down on your anti-Trump rage, maybe look inward. Maybe find your Zen. Maybe find your inner peace. Analyze objectively the overwhelming, nonstop, hysterical coverage against the president. In other words, maybe you will have a better luck getting an interview if you start being a little fair. Maybe, just maybe. You'll take my advice, I tend to doubt it. We do have a recent study, FOX News -- that's right, this channel, not fake news CNN, is among the most trusted brands in TV news. Now, sadly, I doubt CNN is going to take my advice. So, while CNN continues to trash the president hour after hour, minute after minute, day after day, many on the left, other Never Trumpers are engaging in rhetoric that is even worse, literally bottom of the barrel. Now, this week, on Twitter, one congressional candidate from Oregon used one of the single most vulgar terms to describe the first lady of the United States. Imagine the outrage if a Republican candidate ever said the same thing about the former first lady, Michelle Obama. The outrage from these very same people would be nonstop, but the media has largely ignored the story. So, some Republicans are calling for to get her to ban this deranged Trumpet hater from their social media platform. We're not going to hold our breath. But with 98 short days until these important midterms, each night on this program we will do something that your mainstream media will not do. We'll actually show you the very worst rhetoric coming out of the Democratic Party. It happens every single election cycle. They will call Republicans racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, who want dirty air, dirty water, they want to throw granny over the cliff and kill children. And just like the attacks on Melania Trump. There's only one way to counter the deranged left wing in this country. If you care about your rights, if you care about this country, if you care about the president's successful agenda, you better get your ass and go vote in November because the future of the country does depend on it. Democrats have their post-election agenda in place. If they win and 98 days, you see on the screen what they will do. All right. Before we get to our guest tonight, I got to wish a good friend of mine, Pete Constantino, a happy birthday. He is a friend, a gifted brilliant brain surgeon who has saved the lives of so many, including many in our military. Happy 50th birthday, Pete. All right. Joining us now with reaction to our opening monologue, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, author of the number one book in the country, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett.

And on the very day he cleared her, he launched the investigation of Donald Trump, meeting secretly with the author of the anti-Trump dossier who is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton and he was off to the races to destroy Trump. And really, that's the thesis of the book \"The Russia Hoax\"."

What you care about is putting the screws to Manafort so he sings or composes, so you can prosecute or impeach Donald Trump. That's the only reason we are here. All these other people whose corruption you've exposed and helped expose with Gregg, they're not on trial today. I think every American needs to be worried."

So, he gave him all this latitude. And let's not forget that Andrew Weissmann is in charge of this case, right? Andrew Weissmann who by the way have met with the Associated Press the day before the Associated Press wrote that big expose, this was before he joined the Manafort team, and the Associated Press wrote that big expose on Paul Manafort, on April 12th, 2017. And now, they are fighting that. You know, Weissmann was never removed from this case and should have been investigated because the FBI themselves, the people that were in that meeting with the \"A.P.\" had actually filed a complaint against Weissmann. And we are seeing a case that in 2014 -- 2014, the government had the opportunity to go after Paul Manafort. I don't know what he did. You don't know everything that he did. I mean, this is case."

Its insanity President Trump did rightly commute Alice's sentence and you all remember - - this was choke (ph). I'm getting goose bumps watching it now. An emotional video, Alice reuniting with her family early last month after nearly 22 years behind bars.
