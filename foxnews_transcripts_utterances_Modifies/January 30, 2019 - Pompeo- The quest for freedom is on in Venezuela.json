If you value human life, children, babies, inalienable rights, basic human decency, I want you to listen up, because tonight's watch on the radical left is more important than anything we talk about lately, because we now have people in this country, Democrats, people on the left, you know those people that claim to have a monopoly of compassion, they label conservatives, oh, as racist, sexist, heartless, misogynist, hateful, they want dirty air and water and they want to throw granny over the cliff. We hear that every two, four years. Well, as we speak, we have in this country multiple states, legislators, governors that are pushing to make abortion -- this is not about abortion - - in the 7th, 8th, even the 9th month, up until the moment of birth, pregnancy, legal. They're trying to legalize, in other words, infanticide or the destruction of viable human life. They want to make it perfectly OK, seemingly, to, in fact, terminate a baby that could easily survive outside of the womb.  Now, Virginia state delegate named Kathy Tran actually introduced a bill that would allow an abortion during birth, dilation, even when the mother's life is not at risk. Watch her body language. Watch this exchange very closely.",

No, if the law was overturned, it would go back to the states and we know how liberal these states are. And it's a divisive topic.  But I will say this, on the issue of abortion, people that I know that are friends of mine, you can have an honest disagreement about when life begins. It's not that simple for some people. But that's not what this is about. This has nothing to do really with abortion.  This is about an unconscionable, grotesque brutality. This is a piece of legislation that legalizes infanticide. It gets worse than what you just heard. Now, keep in mind, this bill applies to all situations. She was describing when the birth began, that she would support an abortion. If the mother so decided. Now, we're not talking about if the mother's life is at risk or whether or not a perfectly healthy child is formed inside the womb. Listen to Virginia's Democratic Governor Ralph Northam, perfectly supportive of what she said and worse in this radical plan. Listen to this.",

And while this family is living outside the womb alone, they'll have a discussion. A discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother, what should we do? What do you think we should do?   Really? You don't think that's cold, callous, barbaric? It's not, again, about -- you know, people can have a difference of opinion. I believe life begins at conception. Some people saying, if it's not viable first trimester, they support -- pro abortion or pro choice as they call themselves. Governor Northam once worked as a pediatric neurologist and now, he's willing to support a bill that terminates what is a viable living child in front of him and have a discussion. This is a radical, new, extreme, as I've been saying, Democratic, Socialist Party.  At that point, you know, think about infants. Think about how you feel about a little puppy being born. Think about a little child? Does that not represent everything that we think of as the ultimate in innocence?  If we as a country, we can't come together, forget Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, blue, red and agree do protect a child that is laying there comfortably, and having a discussion to do everything we can to keep that child alive, what kind of country do we want to be here? A baby defines innocence. What he described and she described is a brutality.

All Democrats voting in favor, and, of course, the governor supported it as well, as we showed you. Now, as we move forward, other similar bills, why is this the big agenda of the Democrats? Rhode Island, New Mexico, Massachusetts, when they pass the similar law in New York, the governor recently celebrated the passage of a comparable bill that makes late term abortion even into the 9th month legal, he shrugged off any criticism. He's not here to legislate religion. Well, apparently, he's only in the state house to legalize a termination of what is now a viable human life in the 9th month. Now, they're purposely vague in their legislation. They won't give you a definition of health. So, if someone says hours before, oh, I'm having emotional second thoughts and the doctor says, OK, they're allowed to commit infanticide.   Now, as it turns out, this party, these people that brag so often to lecture so often about compassion don't seem compassionate at all. And that, by the way, presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, and she's standing by her radical plan to eliminate the insurance industry, and she's flipping and flopping and flailing all over the place. But it would kick 177 million Americans off their own private healthcare plans and Medicare for all would provide one big government mandated healthcare system. No options.  And according to a study from George Mason University, the plan -- well, that's going to cost the taxpayers $3.2 trillion a year. $32 trillion-plus over ten years. How are you going to pay for that? That's about all the money we take in as a country. Spoiler alert: Kamala is coming for your crumbs.  Now, we the sent our Lawrence Jones to Senator Harris' home state to see what they thought about her radical big government agenda and ripping away the free market healthcare system in America.

Don't forget, Elizabeth Warren, she's so compassionate that after you paid your state taxes, your federal taxes, your property taxes, your sales taxes, and maybe saved a little, she wants a new plan that would allow the government to go back again and steal money legally, from whatever you have left, a brand new wealth tax she calls it.  By the way, then when you die, they take 40 percent more, in New York another 10 percent. That's $0.50 of every dollar you saved throughout your life.  Now, at least one life long Democrat is speaking out against his party's radical shift.

They want government to control your bank accounts, your businesses, your health care, education, they want open borders and, by the way, the life blood of our economy, they want to end all fossil fuel energy, in 12 years, or the world ends according to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. At the same time, the left is applauding infanticide and celebrating, yes, abortion, if you want to call that infanticide, even up to the moment of birth? Now, imagine that they care about child-parent separation, only when they can bludgeon President Trump who solved the problem that existed in the Obama years. But then again, Nancy Pelosi won't meet with Angel Moms and Dads that permanent separation because an illegal immigrant killed their kid.  Now, today, House Democrat Henry Cuellar told \"The Hill\" that his party is entering new rounds of negotiations in total opposition to funding any new border barrier, saying, quote: The bottom line is my position is no. OK, they're unwilling to negotiate? I thought they cared about Dreamers and DACA. Well, clearly, the party of compassion doesn't care about those kids or the safety and security of our nation. They're obviously standing for nothing except hating Trump. Let not your heart be troubled, as I told you, I don't think this president is caving.  Remember, he tweeted this: If the committee of Democrats and Republicans is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier, they are wasting their time. Now, the president holds all the cards, he gets no deal, February 15th, I'll give you odds. I'm 99 percent certain that he will lawfully declare a national emergency or just send down the military and start building the wall with defense funds. Now, many of you in 2016 doubted that Donald Trump would govern as a conservative. I've known him well over two decades, and I put it on the line and I said he absolutely will. And he has, hasn't he? He's going to find a way. He's tenacious, to get the money and build the wall. In the big picture, I don't care how he does it. I don't care where the money comes from, it's our money and it's an emergency. We see the growing seriousness of this every day. We have three caravans now heading this way, one 12,000 people. We had an MS-13 gang member apprehended in Rio Grande in a sector where there's no wall. Just look at the video released by the Border Patrol in Yuma, Arizona. Look at this, a three-year-old is being thrown across an outdated, run down barrier by human smugglers, no doubt encouraged to make the journey because our borders are notoriously porous.  And it gets even more disturbing. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting smugglers, they're now taking illegal border crossers on a dangerous journey through a wall free remote section of the New Mexico desert where they risk dehydration, malnourishment and even death. Our borders are a huge crisis that has to be addressed. That's why former DHS special agent Timothy Ballard, sounding the alarm at foxnews.com. He writes: As a former DHS special agent on the southern border who fought sex trafficking for over a decade, I can say with certainty that the issue of the border wall should not be about power and partisan politics. Human trafficking, abusing children, this is what reckless open border policies encourage. It's why the president is fighting so hard. What are Chuck and Nancy fighting for? Anything? No, except hating Trump. He's offering things they say they wanted. The president knows what is at stake. It's why he's been willing to change rat strategies to get the job done. Now, tonight, the left refuses to even acknowledge a serious life and death, safety and security issues at our southern border. The president should, will use his powers as the commander in chief. I'm giving you 99 to 1 percent odds he will do it himself. All right. Now, before we get to our guest, we have one important update to bring you from our HANNITY Watch on the deep state. Remember Nellie Ohr? She worked for Fusion GPS with Christopher Steele on Hillary's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier, also married to Bruce Ohr, high ranking DOJ official who proliferated the dirty dossier throughout the FBI and DOJ?  Well, today, we learned that Nellie Ohr's primary role at Fusion GPS was to dig up dirt on all of Donald Trump's children for the Clinton campaign. She even performed op research against Melania Trump, another pretty disgusting example how the far left, deep state abusing power bureaucrats, literally how far they were willing to go to destroy Donald Trump to prevent him from becoming president and destroying his presidency from day one. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, along with \"Relatable\" podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey, and Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce.

We hear that every two, four years. Well, as we speak, we have in this country multiple states, legislators, governors that are pushing to make abortion -- this is not about abortion - - in the 7th, 8th, even the 9th month, up until the moment of birth, pregnancy, legal. They're trying to legalize, in other words, infanticide or the destruction of viable human life. They want to make it perfectly OK, seemingly, to, in fact, terminate a baby that could easily survive outside of the womb. Now, Virginia state delegate named Kathy Tran actually introduced a bill that would allow an abortion during birth, dilation, even when the mother's life is not at risk. Watch her body language.

No, if the law was overturned, it would go back to the states and we know how liberal these states are. And it's a divisive topic. But I will say this, on the issue of abortion, people that I know that are friends of mine, you can have an honest disagreement about when life begins. It's not that simple for some people. But that's not what this is about. This has nothing to do really with abortion. This is about an unconscionable, grotesque brutality. This is a piece of legislation that legalizes infanticide. It gets worse than what you just heard. Now, keep in mind, this bill applies to all situations. She was describing when the birth began, that she would support an abortion. If the mother so decided. Now, we're not talking about if the mother's life is at risk or whether or not a perfectly healthy child is formed inside the womb. Listen to Virginia's Democratic Governor Ralph Northam, perfectly supportive of what she said and worse in this radical plan. Listen to this."

The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."

And while this family is living outside the womb alone, they'll have a discussion. A discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother, what should we do? What do you think we should do? Really? You don't think that's cold, callous, barbaric? It's not, again, about -- you know, people can have a difference of opinion. I believe life begins at conception. Some people saying, if it's not viable first trimester, they support -- pro abortion or pro choice as they call themselves. Governor Northam once worked as a pediatric neurologist and now, he's willing to support a bill that terminates what is a viable living child in front of him and have a discussion. This is a radical, new, extreme, as I've been saying, Democratic, Socialist Party. At that point, you know, think about infants. Think about how you feel about a little puppy being born. Think about a little child? Does that not represent everything that we think of as the ultimate in innocence? If we as a country, we can't come together, forget Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, blue, red and agree do protect a child that is laying there comfortably, and having a discussion to do everything we can to keep that child alive, what kind of country do we want to be here?

Rhode Island, New Mexico, Massachusetts, when they pass the similar law in New York, the governor recently celebrated the passage of a comparable bill that makes late term abortion even into the 9th month legal, he shrugged off any criticism. He's not here to legislate religion. Well, apparently, he's only in the state house to legalize a termination of what is now a viable human life in the 9th month. Now, they're purposely vague in their legislation. They won't give you a definition of health. So, if someone says hours before, oh, I'm having emotional second thoughts and the doctor says, OK, they're allowed to commit infanticide. Now, as it turns out, this party, these people that brag so often to lecture so often about compassion don't seem compassionate at all. And that, by the way, presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, and she's standing by her radical plan to eliminate the insurance industry, and she's flipping and flopping and flailing all over the place.

Don't forget, Elizabeth Warren, she's so compassionate that after you paid your state taxes, your federal taxes, your property taxes, your sales taxes, and maybe saved a little, she wants a new plan that would allow the government to go back again and steal money legally, from whatever you have left, a brand new wealth tax she calls it. By the way, then when you die, they take 40 percent more, in New York another 10 percent. That's $0.50 of every dollar you saved throughout your life. Now, at least one life long Democrat is speaking out against his party's radical shift.

Well, today, we learned that Nellie Ohr's primary role at Fusion GPS was to dig up dirt on all of Donald Trump's children for the Clinton campaign. She even performed op research against Melania Trump, another pretty disgusting example how the far left, deep state abusing power bureaucrats, literally how far they were willing to go to destroy Donald Trump to prevent him from becoming president and destroying his presidency from day one. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, along with \"Relatable\" podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey, and Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce. Let me go over these words with our top story tonight."

Sixty-one percent of Americans who identify as pro choice agree it should be restricted to the first three months, 92 percent of GOPers agree with that, 60 percent of Democrats agree, six out of 10 Democrats agree with just the first three months and 78 percent of independents. We are not a polarized electorate. We are not polarized nation in this regard. But for me, what is horrific, it is certainly brutal and ghoulish, is that these kinds of laws posit this notion that women who are about to give birth are willing to kill their children. And this is what we've got to stand up against."

What we know now is they are not out of touch with the American people, they are the antithesis, they are fighting for the antithesis of what we represent as individuals, whether you be pro choice or pro-life. And you know what? This is a good opportunity for people to begin to have this conversation. It's a good opportunity for Republicans and other pro- choicers and pro-lifers who want to come together and recognize that, wait a minute, we have common ground on most of this. We can talk and have conversations about when life begins. But if you are as appalled at this as I am, maybe that conversation in the 21st century now, now that we know what the dynamic is, perhaps we can begin to have that conversation. I'm willing to have it because this has been a horrific realization of where the Democratic party has gone and where people who would claim to be the recipients of the work that some of the people have done for 20 or 30 years."

They were willing to talk about it. I thought it was going to be difficult. But people wanted their voices to be heard. They were disgusted by this, shocked by it. Even those that were pro-choice, just like, you know, Tammy explained. I think having the video out there was a real game changer. A lot of these policies and legislation, it gets talked about, but it doesn't make the public media. It's not out there. So, people really don't have any idea of what is actually going on inside the law, Sean. And what I heard was people that were shocked, people that were concerned, people that wanted more information. And thankfully the law did not pass. What we see with Governor Cuomo and his statements, you know, this is not about religion, this is about the sanctity of life, about human life, about a child sitting there, after its been born, and you can't debate that life, once it's there. I mean, this is a person, a full person. I don't know how we got to a point where we no longer value the sanctity of life. And we no longer support or protect those that can't protect themselves. It's just very shocking. It was very upsetting. A lot of people were really -- some people were just so upset about it, they didn't even know how to talk about it."

Well, there is no coincidence that the expansion of government and the popularization (ph) of socialism is happening at the same time that we're denigrating life inside the womb. The sanctity of life is central to a free republic, because without life, liberty nor the pursuit of happiness can exist. So, this world that we're living in, where we are denigrating the most vulnerable, the most marginalize, the most helpless among us, it is no coincidence whatsoever that socialism is becoming more popular, becoming more mainstream. That's what happens when you grow the power of the government unfettered. Human life, unfortunately is the cost we often pay."

I've been a prosecutor, a defense attorney it seemed to be sending the wrong message. That if you cross Mueller, look what's going to happen to you.

They are so caught up in their feelings that they don't think practical - practically about issues, and this is why they're not going to win. But I would caution people, take Kamala serious. There is a group of people out here that's going to vote for her radical agenda, even if they know that it's not practical, as you just saw in the package."

That their constitution demands that Maduro not be the President of the United States and the United States is prepared to support the Venezuelan people to achieve the freedom, democracy. You talked about it. This is a so once wealthy nation with enormous natural resources and yet we have a humanitarian crisis. We've got 3 million refugees leave Venezuela. This is a catastrophe - a man-made catastrophe by the Maduro regime, and we're intent upon helping the Venezuelan people correct it."

It's pretty amazing to me the progress there, because no more rockets, it was happening on a regular basis, being fired over Japan, threatening the entire region, even threatening the United States. Hostages have been returned. The remains of American soldiers have been returned and denuclearization talks continue. What is the status now of where those negotiations are and when do you foresee another summit?"

We'll do it some place in Asia. So I think that looks good. I am dispatching a team there. They're headed that way now to lay the foundations for what I hope will be a substantial additional step towards the path for not only denuclearization of the peninsula, but a brighter future for the North Korean people, and security on the Peninsula in a way that no previous administration's been able to achieve. I think it took President Trump to convince Chairman Kim that that all the commitments that he made this past June in Singapore, now it's time for my team and all of the United States government to work with the North Koreans to execute that and to deliver on our commitment, to denuclearize that peninsula. Chairman Kim has told us he's prepared to do it, and now the mission is to deliver on that."

As it relates to intelligence interpretations of Iranian capabilities, you have the President, you have Prime Minister Netanyahu maybe disagreeing with some of the intelligence reports. I would chalk that up to maybe interpretation, but I'm guessing. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that's right. I don't think there's much dispute and having - had the chance to be the Director of the CIA, I think the intelligence supports that Iran presents a real risk and that they have the capability to enrich nuclear material, fissile material. They have increase in capacities and continue to work towards improving their missile program. Just - guess what, just last week, Sean that they attempted to launch a space launch vehicle which certainly would help them deliver on their missile program. These are all components that lead us to a place where they could one day have a system that threatens America, and President Trump has made clear, we're not going to tolerate that. We're not going to let Iran end up where North Korea is today. And we have a set of policies in place to prevent that."

Some members of Congress, some members in the Senate have disagreement. Is there a solution and what is the real status of ISIS? Is it degraded to the point where it's not anywhere near the threat it once was?"

      "utterance": "Well, the President will make a significant announcement, I think, in the State of the Union next week with respect to the status of the caliphate, the real estate, the grounds from which ISIS had been operating in Syria when this administration came in. You remember the prisoners in cages, people kneeling on the beaches and being beheaded, this was tragic. We also know that in spite of an enormous progress we've made and the success that we've had, that the threat from radical Islamic terrorism is real, and we need to continue to do all that we can to make sure that there's not a resurgence of ISIS or that all the other variants of that terror regime continue to be under pressure. This administration's committed to that. President Trump is - has made clear. It is a priority for him and as the Secretary of State, I can promise the American people, we will continue to do all that we can to keep them safe from this threat."
