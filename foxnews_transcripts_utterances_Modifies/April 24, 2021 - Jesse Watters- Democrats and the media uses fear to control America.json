There's a big problem in America that we want to address tonight. The gap between reality and people's perception of reality has become dangerously wide. So much so that people are now seeing things that just aren't there. The nation is nearing mass psychosis, people are living in an alternative universe, but this is by design.  Last week, we explained how Big Media lies to you for profit. But there's another agenda: the Democrat media tells lies to scare you and uses that fear to control you.  Millions of Americans believe a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on January 6th and murdered at Capitol Hill police officer named Brian Sicknick. This was beaten into our heads through repetition.",

Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes. The Chief Medical Examiner for Washington, D.C. this week ruled that Sicknick suffered a stroke a day after the riot. He was never struck in the head by a fire extinguisher. So, why the lie? The initial autopsy found no blunt trauma to the head. Nobody came forward on the record to \"The Times\" or anyone else claiming the officer was killed by a fire extinguisher. Sicknick's own family begged the press to stop running the story because he called them the night of January 6th, and told them that he was fine.  But the Democrat media needed the lie to scare you about a murderous mob of Trump supporters. Remember without the Capitol Hill police officer, the only ones killed that day were four Trump supporters.   Democrats in the media faked the murder of a Capitol Hill police officer and used it in the official record of President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate. Joe Biden himself got in on the lie.",

Corporate America aligned with the Democrats and a social media dragnet cracked down on free speech across America.  Now, I'm not excusing what happened on January 6th, but the Democrats in the media hung a murder on the Republican Party. That lie tasted so sweet to the left. But the media won't pay a price for it because it was good for business.   When the truth is bad for business, the media goes silent. The man who killed the Capitol Hill police officer this year wasn't a Trump supporter. He was a follower of Farrakhan. Noah Green rammed his car into two police officers at the Capitol on April 2nd, and was put down while charging them with a knife. Capitol Hill police officer William Evans was pronounced dead at the scene. Green was a Nation of Islam acolyte. His social media profile filled with hate. Maxine Waters, James Clyburn, President Barack Obama, all photographed getting chummy with Farrakhan. The media didn't hang a murder on Farrakhan and make the Democrats' accessories.  The media humanized the killer with soft profiles about his personal struggles, did no digging into Farrakhan. And the Nation of Islam, a designated hate group still stands tall on Twitter, while President Trump is banned.  This brings us to the issue of racism, a concept that has become so disfigured that if you turn on the TV, it's like we're living in the pre- Civil War South.",

      "sentences": "Now, I'm not going to sit up here as a white guy and say racism isn't an issue or it doesn't exist? Of course, it does. But there's a misperception that racism is everywhere, even as the facts tell a different story. In fact, America has never been less racist than it is today. Attitudes about housing, equality, mixed marriages, discrimination, hiring, language itself. These attitudes have never been more open-minded than they are in 2021.   In the last 20 years, race relations have been positive, hovering around 70 percent. Blacks and whites saying, they are good. That is until around 2014 when the perception of race relations started to decline a little. This is precisely the moment social media exploded, Black Lives Matter came onto the scene, and the Ferguson effect took hold, police officers pulling back and inner city crime spiking.  The Democrat media plays a massive role exploiting the racial divide. The perception of race relations also started to deteriorate just at the exact same time \"The New York Times\" began identifying a person's race in their news articles, \"So and so who is white\" or \"So and so who is black.\" These racial attributions at the time spiked in 2014, further undermining America's race relations. So when you hear the media sell a story about racist white police hunting down and murdering unarmed black men, it's important to look at the facts and these are the facts that media won't want you to know.  Last year, there were 50 million interactions between police and suspects and 10 million arrests last year. Now out of all of that, 18 unarmed black Americans were fatally shot by police, and 24 unarmed white Americans. Police have killed more unarmed whites than unarmed blacks, and that's true so far in 2021 as well.  An unarmed black American who a police officer makes contact with has a 0.000036 percent chance of being fatally shot. A study by the Manhattan Institute shows a majority of black Americans and white liberals believe young black men are more likely to be shot dead by police than die in a traffic accident. That couldn't be further from the truth. They're much more likely to die in a traffic accident.  So how did our perception of reality get so off base? Because the media uses racism to sell fear. A scared population can be controlled. The more the Democratic media can make black Americans fear whites, police and Republicans, the more likely it is for black Americans to vote Democrat. And when police, Republicans and white Americans are constantly being called racist for no reason whatsoever. That's scary. Nobody wants to be called racist. It's the worst thing you can be called in America. That freezes you with fear. You shut your mouth and you give in. That's how the Democrats divide and conquer. Make blacks afraid of whites and make whites afraid of being called racist.   The media tells black Americans that Joe Biden is their Savior and anybody who opposes Joe Biden is a racist. But the biggest lie the media told about Joe Biden was that he's a moderate.",

President Biden has shattered spending records, proposed the biggest tax hike in decades, totally opened the border, attacked pipelines and fracking. He is forcing biological boys into girls' sports, calling America racist, and now flirting with reparations in nuking the filibuster. But the media doesn't cover Joe that way. They just say Biden is to the right of the squad. Even though everybody is to the right of the squad.  Being a little right of the squad doesn't make you a moderate, it just makes you a little less crazy. It's difficult for casual news viewers to see Biden clearly when the media romanticizes his mediocrity. Fifty nine percent of Biden's coverage so far has been positive. A stark contrast to the coverage of Trump's first hundred days, which was 89 percent negative. Powerful corporate media is branding Biden as a popular moderate and in return, Biden is taking a softer stance on China, opening our southern border to cheap labor and sending Big Business hundreds of billions in fat Federal infrastructure contracts so they can go green.  Meanwhile, the mainstream media attacks any obstacle to Biden's second term.",

So they keep ordering packages from Amazon and watching Netflix?  It keeps Big Business thriving with the mom and pop shops, they stay closed and it justifies the Democrats' emergency spending. Again, fear gives Democrats more control over your lives and the economy.  Gallup found that liberals are incredibly misinformed about the dangers of coronavirus, a huge chunk of them believing that large numbers of children are dying and hospitals are overrun, which is why they've kept schools closed. That misperception allowed politicians to send billions to the teachers unions, money that will be sucked dry by graft.

Right here in Philadelphia, all the shootings, 95 percent of the shootings this year are people of color. They are the victims. Defund the police crowd is doing the exact opposite of what they're after. They are hurting people of color.",

We hate potholes, traffic, long lines at the airport, but Joe Biden's Green New Deal infrastructure deal isn't about infrastructure, and it isn't about global warming. It's crony capitalism, corporate welfare, whatever you want to call it and we caught Biden red handed. Tucked into his $2 trillion deal is $174 billion with a B for electric car production. So Biden is taking tax dollars from the American worker, and just giving it to the big three car companies in Detroit -- GM, Ford, Chrysler. Michigan better stay blue after that pay off, so these companies put up no money and manufacture a fleet of electric cars. Some have already moved production to Mexico, and they just take home all the profits. It's a transfer of wealth from workers to corporations. The companies get good PR for going green, and so does Biden. But a few thousand electric cars on the road aren't going to change the Earth's temperature at all. Even global warming czar John Kerry admits that. If Democrats were serious about reducing emissions, they'd support clean natural gas made in America, instead of attacking fracking. And Biden loves setting these little goals for reducing emissions. But he'll be long gone before his deadline in 2030. He won't pay a political price for the pain inflicted on Americans. Biden's plan is short on details, most Democrat plans are. They judge themselves by intentions, not results. But recent studies suggest a lot would need to be changed by 2030 in order to reach Joe's green goals. Ready? Number one: every other American shopping for a new car would have to buy an electric one. You don't like what they look like or how they handle? Too bad, it doesn't matter. You have to get one. And the average electric car costs 55 grand so start saving. Number two: but it is hard to say when you're going to get walloped by new taxes. Biden's plan would likely cost taxpayers an extra $3,500.00 a year and you're going to have to refit your home with new electric. That's about $5,600.00. So you're already in the hall about 10 grand. Number three: the Democrats always said they want government to stay out of the bedroom, but it looks like the government just walked downstairs into your kitchen. Because Americans are going to have to cut their red meat consumption by 90 percent in order to reduce emissions to hit Biden's target. That means you're only allowed to eat four pounds of red meat a year. That adds up to a burger a month. That's it. Let's bring in the architect, Karl Rove who relishes running against this nonsense. That's a condiment joke. All right, Karl Rove, you've got to be licking your chops here. I just feel like this guy is in over his head. He doesn't know what he is doing. Republicans surely take advantage of this nonsense. Am I right?",

In fact, the emissions in India and China and Russia are going up, not down and we're leading the world with 12 percent. To meet the goal of cutting them by 50 percent compared to that 2005 baseline means that Biden's goal in the next nine years is three times the pace that we've been doing it up until now and we've been doing it -- and again, we've been leading the world.

But it's a long time to the election and the Republicans have to do in my opinion, three things. One, they've got to make a principled case of opposition to the bad things that Biden is attempting to do. If he's doing something good, try and find a way to do find some forward progress, but make a principled case against what he is doing. Second of all, paint the picture that you want the future to look like. Share an optimistic and positive agenda of what we can achieve by relying upon conservative principles. And third, do what you can to deal with an increasingly diverse electorate. Do not think it was an accident that Republicans elected a record number of women and Members of the House of Representatives for them in the last election. And then in California for the first time since California became a state in 1850, the Republicans flipped four Democratic congressional seats, two with Asian-American women and two of them with Latino men.

Instead of training our children how to think, they are training them what to think. And the head of this push, President Biden himself. His administration is trying to incentivize woke lessons for both students and teachers by offering Federal grants to schools. And guess whose money he is using? Yours. Curriculums teaching kids to hate America and hate being white are popping up in schools all across the country. The Rhode Island Meyerholz Elementary School in Cupertino, California is forcing first graders to rank themselves based on their power and privilege. Seattle Public Schools had a training session where they told teachers they were guilty of spirit murdering black kids, killing their souls every day in the classroom, and that they must make up for their guilt by rejecting their whiteness. White teachers were told they had to bankrupt their privilege and acknowledgement of their thieved inheritance. At Cherokee Middle School in Springfield, Missouri, teachers had to rate themselves on an oppression matrix, telling them that straight white Christian men are part of the oppressor class, and have to make up for their privilege and white supremacy. The William D. Kelley School in Philly is teaching fifth graders to celebrate radical Angela Davis, accused of murder and kidnapping. They had the kids simulate a black power rally to free her. What kind of effect is this having on young minds? Here to discuss, Discovery Institute Director, Chris Rufo. So these children, their brains are sponges, Chris. They're dealing with a lot of social pressure, sports, their parents are giving them a hard time. You know, it's a very tender age, and you're going to jam into their little brains that they need to feel bad about how they were born and bad about how their father made money and I don't know, telling black kids that you know, everything is stacked against you and everybody just sees the color of their skin every time you look at them.

Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes. The Chief Medical Examiner for Washington, D.C. this week ruled that Sicknick suffered a stroke a day after the riot. He was never struck in the head by a fire extinguisher. So, why the lie? The initial autopsy found no blunt trauma to the head. Nobody came forward on the record to \"The Times\" or anyone else claiming the officer was killed by a fire extinguisher. Sicknick's own family begged the press to stop running the story because he called them the night of January 6th, and told them that he was fine. But the Democrat media needed the lie to scare you about a murderous mob of Trump supporters. Remember without the Capitol Hill police officer, the only ones killed that day were four Trump supporters. Democrats in the media faked the murder of a Capitol Hill police officer and used it in the official record of President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate. Joe Biden himself got in on the lie."

Corporate America aligned with the Democrats and a social media dragnet cracked down on free speech across America. Now, I'm not excusing what happened on January 6th, but the Democrats in the media hung a murder on the Republican Party. That lie tasted so sweet to the left. But the media won't pay a price for it because it was good for business. When the truth is bad for business, the media goes silent. The man who killed the Capitol Hill police officer this year wasn't a Trump supporter. He was a follower of Farrakhan. Noah Green rammed his car into two police officers at the Capitol on April 2nd, and was put down while charging them with a knife. Capitol Hill police officer William Evans was pronounced dead at the scene. Green was a Nation of Islam acolyte. His social media profile filled with hate. Maxine Waters, James Clyburn, President Barack Obama, all photographed getting chummy with Farrakhan. The media didn't hang a murder on Farrakhan and make the Democrats' accessories. The media humanized the killer with soft profiles about his personal struggles, did no digging into Farrakhan. And the Nation of Islam, a designated hate group still stands tall on Twitter, while President Trump is banned. This brings us to the issue of racism, a concept that has become so disfigured that if you turn on the TV, it's like we're living in the pre- Civil War South."

      "utterance": "Now, I'm not going to sit up here as a white guy and say racism isn't an issue or it doesn't exist? Of course, it does. But there's a misperception that racism is everywhere, even as the facts tell a different story. In fact, America has never been less racist than it is today. Attitudes about housing, equality, mixed marriages, discrimination, hiring, language itself. These attitudes have never been more open-minded than they are in 2021. In the last 20 years, race relations have been positive, hovering around 70 percent. Blacks and whites saying, they are good. That is until around 2014 when the perception of race relations started to decline a little. This is precisely the moment social media exploded, Black Lives Matter came onto the scene, and the Ferguson effect took hold, police officers pulling back and inner city crime spiking. The Democrat media plays a massive role exploiting the racial divide. The perception of race relations also started to deteriorate just at the exact same time \"The New York Times\" began identifying a person's race in their news articles, \"So and so who is white\" or \"So and so who is black.\" These racial attributions at the time spiked in 2014, further undermining America's race relations. So when you hear the media sell a story about racist white police hunting down and murdering unarmed black men, it's important to look at the facts and these are the facts that media won't want you to know. Last year, there were 50 million interactions between police and suspects and 10 million arrests last year. Now out of all of that, 18 unarmed black Americans were fatally shot by police, and 24 unarmed white Americans. Police have killed more unarmed whites than unarmed blacks, and that's true so far in 2021 as well. An unarmed black American who a police officer makes contact with has a 0.000036 percent chance of being fatally shot. A study by the Manhattan Institute shows a majority of black Americans and white liberals believe young black men are more likely to be shot dead by police than die in a traffic accident. That couldn't be further from the truth. They're much more likely to die in a traffic accident. So how did our perception of reality get so off base? Because the media uses racism to sell fear. A scared population can be controlled. The more the Democratic media can make black Americans fear whites, police and Republicans, the more likely it is for black Americans to vote Democrat. And when police, Republicans and white Americans are constantly being called racist for no reason whatsoever. That's scary. Nobody wants to be called racist. It's the worst thing you can be called in America. That freezes you with fear. You shut your mouth and you give in. That's how the Democrats divide and conquer. Make blacks afraid of whites and make whites afraid of being called racist. The media tells black Americans that Joe Biden is their Savior and anybody who opposes Joe Biden is a racist. But the biggest lie the media told about Joe Biden was that he's a moderate."

He is forcing biological boys into girls' sports, calling America racist, and now flirting with reparations in nuking the filibuster. But the media doesn't cover Joe that way. They just say Biden is to the right of the squad. Even though everybody is to the right of the squad. Being a little right of the squad doesn't make you a moderate, it just makes you a little less crazy. It's difficult for casual news viewers to see Biden clearly when the media romanticizes his mediocrity. Fifty nine percent of Biden's coverage so far has been positive. A stark contrast to the coverage of Trump's first hundred days, which was 89 percent negative. Powerful corporate media is branding Biden as a popular moderate and in return, Biden is taking a softer stance on China, opening our southern border to cheap labor and sending Big Business hundreds of billions in fat Federal infrastructure contracts so they can go green.

So they keep ordering packages from Amazon and watching Netflix? It keeps Big Business thriving with the mom and pop shops, they stay closed and it justifies the Democrats' emergency spending. Again, fear gives Democrats more control over your lives and the economy. Gallup found that liberals are incredibly misinformed about the dangers of coronavirus, a huge chunk of them believing that large numbers of children are dying and hospitals are overrun, which is why they've kept schools closed. That misperception allowed politicians to send billions to the teachers unions, money that will be sucked dry by graft.

The criminal is the victim. So once again, the defund the police crowd wants you to believe that the person doing the stabbing is the actual victim. It is extremely unfortunate that that woman had to lose her life. But what led to her to grab a knife? There were adults around. Where was her adult supervision or her parents? There's a lot of questions to be answered. And this police officer has to live his life knowing that he had to take a life regardless that he saved a life and for people saying de-escalation. That is a tool police officers use. The threat of death was imminent. You had fractions of a second to act. If he would have holstered his weapon and grabbed his Taser, that girl could have stabbed and killed multiple people. What would the headline have been? \"Racist cop lets black girls die from stabbing instead of intervening.\" I mean, it is ridiculous. It's a no win situation. There is a heart behind these badges. Police officers are in one of the hardest jobs in the country. Substance abuse and suicides are skyrocketing. They are being micromanaged. They're under a microscope. And actions like this where this cop should be praised and taken as a hero, and he is being vilified. I mean, you've had multimillionaire athletes going on and threatening him on Twitter, which is completely irresponsible. I mean, how do you expect police officers to come to work each day? How are you going to hire police officers? Look at Baltimore. Half their force is missing. There are 700 cops in the City of Baltimore on the street right now. That is extremely dangerous. Philadelphia is going to hit a shortfall. New York City, everywhere, these lunatics with the defund the police crowd, they're at, there are issues going on.

It's crony capitalism, corporate welfare, whatever you want to call it and we caught Biden red handed. Tucked into his $2 trillion deal is $174 billion with a B for electric car production. So Biden is taking tax dollars from the American worker, and just giving it to the big three car companies in Detroit -- GM, Ford, Chrysler. Michigan better stay blue after that pay off, so these companies put up no money and manufacture a fleet of electric cars. Some have already moved production to Mexico, and they just take home all the profits. It's a transfer of wealth from workers to corporations. The companies get good PR for going green, and so does Biden. But a few thousand electric cars on the road aren't going to change the Earth's temperature at all. Even global warming czar John Kerry admits that. If Democrats were serious about reducing emissions, they'd support clean natural gas made in America, instead of attacking fracking. And Biden loves setting these little goals for reducing emissions. But he'll be long gone before his deadline in 2030. He won't pay a political price for the pain inflicted on Americans. Biden's plan is short on details, most Democrat plans are. They judge themselves by intentions, not results. But recent studies suggest a lot would need to be changed by 2030 in order to reach Joe's green goals. Ready? Number one: every other American shopping for a new car would have to buy an electric one. You don't like what they look like or how they handle? Too bad, it doesn't matter. You have to get one.

But it's a long time to the election and the Republicans have to do in my opinion, three things. One, they've got to make a principled case of opposition to the bad things that Biden is attempting to do. If he's doing something good, try and find a way to do find some forward progress, but make a principled case against what he is doing. Second of all, paint the picture that you want the future to look like. Share an optimistic and positive agenda of what we can achieve by relying upon conservative principles. And third, do what you can to deal with an increasingly diverse electorate. Do not think it was an accident that Republicans elected a record number of women and Members of the House of Representatives for them in the last election.

      "utterance": "If you haven't heard of critical race theory, pay close attention. It's taking over our schools and permanently damaging your child's brain. It's an outgrowth of Marxism. But instead of pushing a class revolution, it's pushing a racial revolution. Same goal though, overthrow America and capitalism. Instead of training our children how to think, they are training them what to think. And the head of this push, President Biden himself. His administration is trying to incentivize woke lessons for both students and teachers by offering Federal grants to schools. And guess whose money he is using? Yours. Curriculums teaching kids to hate America and hate being white are popping up in schools all across the country. The Rhode Island Meyerholz Elementary School in Cupertino, California is forcing first graders to rank themselves based on their power and privilege. Seattle Public Schools had a training session where they told teachers they were guilty of spirit murdering black kids, killing their souls every day in the classroom, and that they must make up for their guilt by rejecting their whiteness. White teachers were told they had to bankrupt their privilege and acknowledgement of their thieved inheritance. At Cherokee Middle School in Springfield, Missouri, teachers had to rate themselves on an oppression matrix, telling them that straight white Christian men are part of the oppressor class, and have to make up for their privilege and white supremacy. The William D. Kelley School in Philly is teaching fifth graders to celebrate radical Angela Davis, accused of murder and kidnapping. They had the kids simulate a black power rally to free her. What kind of effect is this having on young minds? Here to discuss, Discovery Institute Director, Chris Rufo. So these children, their brains are sponges, Chris. They're dealing with a lot of social pressure, sports, their parents are giving them a hard time. You know, it's a very tender age, and you're going to jam into their little brains that they need to feel bad about how they were born and bad about how their father made money and I don't know, telling black kids that you know, everything is stacked against you and everybody just sees the color of their skin every time you look at them. How does that damage a young brain?"

      "utterance": "Well, it damages the brain in a number of ways, and most importantly, what we're seeing is that they're turning education into activism. At that Philadelphia Elementary School where they are teaching kids how to simulate Black Power rallies, they are celebrating Angela Davis. They are celebrating, quote, \"black communism.\" Eighty seven percent of those students don't know how to read and write at basic proficiency by the time they graduate from middle school. So what we're seeing is a total and complete failure of the education system to put children towards academic success. So they are shifting the blame by injecting politics into the classroom, shifting the blame to white supremacy, shifting the blame to systemic racism, really, to absolve themselves from the failure and channel the anger and rage and frustration of students into the American system."

      "utterance": "So this is coming at the expense of Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. It doesn't help students who have to pass, do well on their SATs and get into a good school when they're just woke, and they can't earn a living, and then they're broke because they can't read and write at the right proficiency that they should be at their age. What kind of pushback is this woke curriculum getting by parents who, if they knew the details of what we are talking about, we would be down at the principal's office immediately?"

    {
      "speaker": "RUFO",
      "utterance": "Well, luckily, we are starting to see parents fighting back. There are some grassroots groups that have emerged in the last few months and we're seeing especially Asian-American parents in California, in Virginia, and other states are rallying together to fight for academic excellence, to fight for academic meritocracy, to fight for education instead of indoctrination."

      "speaker": "And Chinese-American parents have told me explicitly that what's happening in American schools reminds them of what happened during Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution during the communist times of China. They're scared to death that some similar cultural movements are happening here. They want to put a stop to it. And you know, they want for the three Rs",
      "utterance": "Reading, Writing and Arithmetic that are rapidly being replaced by the new three R's, Racism, Racism, and Racism."

      "utterance": "LeBron James urged his nearly 50 million followers on Twitter to shoot a police officer this week. As we discussed earlier, 16-year-old, Ma'Khia Bryant was about to stab a girl before the Ohio officer fatally shot her, saving the girl's life. But the LA Laker targeted the Columbus police officer. He tweeted, \"You're next. Accountability.\" With a picture of that officer. You know his version wasn't blurred out like ours. Many accused him of inciting cop killers. He deleted the tweet, but then defended himself saying this. \"I'm so damn tired of seeing black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because it's being used to create more hate. This isn't about one officer. It's about the entire system.\" Twitter refuses to say whether LeBron violated its policy since it was deleted, and the Lakers, the NBA and sponsors, they remain silent. Joining me now for more, former MLB pitcher Curt Schilling. All right, so Curt, if you ever saw LeBron out at a restaurant, would you would you go over and say anything to him?"

There's two sets of rules and they are very clearly delineated. You know, somebody that sells kid's sweat pants, Foot Locker for kids, will tell me as a professional baseball player, just shut up and play baseball. But when you're a liberal, you're allowed to comment on anything and everything. And apparently just being a liberal allows you to be an expert. And some of the -- I mean, if you look at the last two or three years, some of the worst, stupidest, most ignorant takes on the planet have come from LeBron James' Twitter account."

      "utterance": "Yes, he was really, really adamant about cozying up to China. You can't criticize the Communist Chinese. They've got slave labor over there. He didn't want anybody criticizing them because Nike has a lot of money invested over there in the Mainland. Politics has really infected sports. Ratings have been, I think down about four million a season since the NFL started the kneeling nonsense. You saw what happened with the Major Leagues and the All-Star game over in Atlanta. I don't know. I don't I don't see a lot of people coming back from something like this. NBA ratings are down, but they weren't really high to begin with. You talk to people. Do people -- I just don't see people really getting that worked up about watching games that much anymore after all of this."

No interest in watching it because now the Boston Red Sox have LeBron James as an owner -- a part owner. And so apparently, based on the left's rules, everything that you say or do represents the entire organization you work with and work for. So LeBron James is speaking for the Boston Red Sox, about the Boston Red Sox and with the Boston Red Sox is consent approval. And I have heard nothing different, but you know, this is a guy who I mean, as he goes, so goes the NBA. No one is watching the NBA anymore for all the right reasons. The most woke and publicly ignorant sport on the planet is just continuing to shoot itself in the foot."
