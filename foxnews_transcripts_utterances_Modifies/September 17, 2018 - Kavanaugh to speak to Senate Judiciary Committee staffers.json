Brett Kavanaugh is going to call in to speak to judiciary committee staffers for about an hour to answer questions that have arisen over the weekend about new allegations of sexual misconduct. And we don't know exactly what he's going to say. We haven't seen a script, but his answers might mirror what he told Senator Orrin Hatch a little while ago. His office said this, Senator Hatch spoke to Judge Kavanaugh earlier, and Judge Kavanaugh continue to categorically deny Dr. Ford's allegations. He told Senator Hatch he was not at a party like the ones she described, and that Dr. Ford, who acknowledged to the Washington Post, that she did not remember some key details of the incident, may be mistaking him for someone else.  The top Democrat on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, sat on a letter outlining allegations of sexual misconduct for six weeks, all ten Democrats from that committee signed on to a letter earlier today calling for a delay and a committee vote set for Thursday that would send Kavanaugh to the full senate for confirmation. And all ten say, they're not going to be letting their staff dial into tonight's call, writing, with only a few hours noticed and over the objections of ranking member Feinstein, judiciary committee Republican scheduled a staff level call with Brett Kavanaugh concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a young woman. In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations, a staff only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate. So, nobody from a Democratic office is going to call in to get answers that might clear things up about Kavanaugh. Then again, all the Democratic members already said they weren't going to vote for him anyway. Dana.",

And he has no pattern of behavior like this, like some of the other men we've seen accused in the last couple of years. This came out of the blue. The woman told no one at the time, not even her best friend. And when you look into it, and I'm not saying this is something that, you know, disqualifies the allegation, she's donated to Democrats. She's donated to Bernie, to the DNC, to the Democrat congressional campaign committee. She marched in the women's march against Donald Trump. And she signed a petition against Donald Trump. With that said, all I'm saying is if you can have an uncorroborated, unsubstantiated allegation about something that happened in high school, 35 years ago, and that can derail a Supreme Court nominee without anything else, and that's the silver bullet going forward politically, and people are going to use that, whether the allegation is true or untrue, going forward, and it's just terrible.",

And so it would have been a totally anonymous allegation against the man who has been on the D.C. court of appeals, I think, 12 years, Dana. And so you have to have someone who's willing to stand up and put a face and a name to this allegation, I think, to give it any substance. I remember writing and being involved in the Clarence Thomas hearings. Let me just say, for anybody who's going to go running off that I was -- I'm a friend of Clarence Thomas. And I remember that when Anita Hill came forward, Anita Hill's allegation had been out there, and in fact, she had wanted to remain anonymous. And that then, people on the community were told about it and decided, in closed-door session, that they didn't feel it was enough there for any action to be taken. And it was subsequent to that that then the story gets into the press. And that there's pressure put on the committee and that, you know, it's very interesting time because compared to today, there were no women on the senate judiciary committee. Today, there are four women on the senate judiciary committee, including Dianne Feinstein, who was mentioned before. All four now are Democrats. Contrast that with Biden who was senator then from Delaware, not vice president, who was running the committee. And who, many people to this day feel was unfair to Anita Hill. It's a very different time. You have President Trump in the White House with his own issues with regard to women and sex. And I think that's why, you talk about not wanting to hear anything. I think at this point, it's all come down to, are you going to delay the hearing, the vote, which was supposed to be Thursday, on sending the nominee to the floor. And secondly, is she going to testify, and when is she going to testify? Because, I think, anything that's said over the phone or in the back is not going to matter.",

So it appears politically motivated in its -- therefore, it can be easily viewed with suspicion, even if they happen to be credible. And the sad thing is we're doing this all on the court of public opinion, which kind of bugs me, especially in the court of public opinion right now. You're only given two choices. Thanks to the way we do things around this world. It's either you believe her or you believe him. But there's actually another path and that is to say that an event occurred, but the memory of it could have changed. This is the way human beings are. Memory is the brains playdoh, you know. Over 35 years things could change and mistake could be made.  So, it could -- definitely it happened, but is it accurately remembered? That is an important distinction. Unfortunately, we don't like distinctions anymore. We just want to say he's guilty or she's telling the truth. Nobody wants to actually go into the nuance because we're so scared of being smeared. Like, if you say -- may be go slow and wait -- you know, you're enabling abuse. If you do not believe this right now, you're enabling abuse. No, I just happen to believe that the human mind and memory is incredibly fallible. It's a vulnerable thing. And this is a larger question for all of us because we're all vulnerable to this. It is about the accuracy of memory and its effect on the interpretation of events. And if you can't acknowledge this, you will be next. And this is the important point.",

They don't even want to spend so much as 30 seconds listening to his side of anything. He is guilty, as far as the left is concerned. He was guilty of something from the moment he was actually nominated for that position. They do not want him there. So I think that's a tragedy. Look, none of us know what happened. We will never know what happened. But, look, I feel for her. I mean, my god, no woman should ever be in that situation ever, ever, ever. But, also, if she isn't remembering everything clearly, if he wasn't the guy, if it was someone else, he's saying I'm innocent. And no man should be in a position of seeing his career derailed because of something that happened three decades ago where they can't piece all the facts together.

This stretch of road right here was washed away late Thursday into Friday morning when the storm was reaching its peak. And you see some of the workers here surveying the damages. They're getting ready to do what they need to do to try and start repairing this road. But this is 1 of 1200 roads across the state of North Carolina that are in need of some kind of repair or are flooded and impassable at this hour as floodwaters in some spots continue to rise and that created major problems. You've mentioned Wilmington was essentially cut off for a while. Authorities have opened basically one main road into the city to allow rescue workers, relief workers, and food and water to be trucked in, but that's just one road. Most of the people here are really in a tough spot and can't get out. And the power slowly beginning to come back on. We passed a gas station just down the road where the line for fuel was at least a quarter-mile long. And we were hearing some people saying they were waiting two hours or more to fill their tanks and fill their extra gas tanks, gas cans, so that they could bring them home and power their generators to try and get some comfort. The biggest threats here, Juan, remain the floods. The trees that are coming down, the power lines that are coming down, and those treacherous roads which are responsible for some of the deaths where people don't realize they drive into floodwater and they wind up losing their lives. This can be repaired and will be repaired, but the person who lives next to it isn't confident it will happen within weeks, maybe even months.",

It could reach peak historic levels here, and that's a real concern. It could produce catastrophic flooding for 1 mile around the entire area. Now there is mandatory evacuations. Deputies have been going door-to-door, knocking on doors, telling people they would not be rescued in the peak of the storm, but people are staying for the most part around here. This family here has sandbagged their house and move the valuable stuff up to higher floors. It is not easy to evacuate from here. Going 50 miles in one direction or another can take a day and night, and part of the next day. So many of the roads around here are flooded, downed power lines blocked by trees.

And it was brilliant then. I think it's brilliant now. It's very frustrating I think to them. However, I do think that the pressure about the Electoral College is going to increase a lot in the next -- probably 20 to 30 years. And that's because -- soon, you are going to have about 70 percent of the population represented by only 30 percent of the senators because of where people are moving. They're moving to the big cities. And they're going to be very frustrated if the senators from Wyoming decide to block something in the senate.

Well, a spy hop is whenever an animal jumps out of the water to get a better view of the activity near the water's surface.

Brett Kavanaugh is going to call in to speak to judiciary committee staffers for about an hour to answer questions that have arisen over the weekend about new allegations of sexual misconduct. And we don't know exactly what he's going to say. We haven't seen a script, but his answers might mirror what he told Senator Orrin Hatch a little while ago. His office said this, Senator Hatch spoke to Judge Kavanaugh earlier, and Judge Kavanaugh continue to categorically deny Dr. Ford's allegations. He told Senator Hatch he was not at a party like the ones she described, and that Dr. Ford, who acknowledged to the Washington Post, that she did not remember some key details of the incident, may be mistaking him for someone else. The top Democrat on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, sat on a letter outlining allegations of sexual misconduct for six weeks, all ten Democrats from that committee signed on to a letter earlier today calling for a delay and a committee vote set for Thursday that would send Kavanaugh to the full senate for confirmation. And all ten say, they're not going to be letting their staff dial into tonight's call, writing, with only a few hours noticed and over the objections of ranking member Feinstein, judiciary committee Republican scheduled a staff level call with Brett Kavanaugh concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a young woman. In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations, a staff only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate. So, nobody from a Democratic office is going to call in to get answers that might clear things up about Kavanaugh. Then again, all the Democratic members already said they weren't going to vote for him anyway. Dana."

Yet, on the other hand, he says, Kavanaugh, I wasn't even there at a party like that. It was probably a mistaken identity. The person who is allegedly there also denies it. And he has no pattern of behavior like this, like some of the other men we've seen accused in the last couple of years. This came out of the blue. The woman told no one at the time, not even her best friend. And when you look into it, and I'm not saying this is something that, you know, disqualifies the allegation, she's donated to Democrats. She's donated to Bernie, to the DNC, to the Democrat congressional campaign committee. She marched in the women's march against Donald Trump. And she signed a petition against Donald Trump. With that said, all I'm saying is if you can have an uncorroborated, unsubstantiated allegation about something that happened in high school, 35 years ago, and that can derail a Supreme Court nominee without anything else, and that's the silver bullet going forward politically, and people are going to use that, whether the allegation is true or untrue, going forward, and it's just terrible."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

And so the congresswoman issue -- got the original letter, sent it to Dianne Feinstein. But she's had it since July. There were 65 meetings that Kavanaugh held with senators. There was an opportunity to ask him behind closed doors. There was nothing ever until the 11th hour. Is that a problem?"

    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think the problem here is that, from what I understand, Ford did not want her identity disclosed. And so it would have been a totally anonymous allegation against the man who has been on the D.C. court of appeals, I think, 12 years, Dana. And so you have to have someone who's willing to stand up and put a face and a name to this allegation, I think, to give it any substance. I remember writing and being involved in the Clarence Thomas hearings. Let me just say, for anybody who's going to go running off that I was -- I'm a friend of Clarence Thomas. And I remember that when Anita Hill came forward, Anita Hill's allegation had been out there, and in fact, she had wanted to remain anonymous. And that then, people on the community were told about it and decided, in closed-door session, that they didn't feel it was enough there for any action to be taken. And it was subsequent to that that then the story gets into the press. And that there's pressure put on the committee and that, you know, it's very interesting time because compared to today, there were no women on the senate judiciary committee. Today, there are four women on the senate judiciary committee, including Dianne Feinstein, who was mentioned before. All four now are Democrats. Contrast that with Biden who was senator then from Delaware, not vice president, who was running the committee. And who, many people to this day feel was unfair to Anita Hill. It's a very different time. You have President Trump in the White House with his own issues with regard to women and sex. And I think that's why, you talk about not wanting to hear anything. I think at this point, it's all come down to, are you going to delay the hearing, the vote, which was supposed to be Thursday, on sending the nominee to the floor. And secondly, is she going to testify, and when is she going to testify? Because, I think, anything that's said over the phone or in the back is not going to matter."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. First of all, what Dianne Feinstein did was probably wrong, I think, because if these accusations are credible, what she did was make them look un-credible by holding on to them until the worst possible time. So it appears politically motivated in its -- therefore, it can be easily viewed with suspicion, even if they happen to be credible. And the sad thing is we're doing this all on the court of public opinion, which kind of bugs me, especially in the court of public opinion right now. You're only given two choices. Thanks to the way we do things around this world. It's either you believe her or you believe him. But there's actually another path and that is to say that an event occurred, but the memory of it could have changed. This is the way human beings are. Memory is the brains playdoh, you know. Over 35 years things could change and mistake could be made. So, it could -- definitely it happened, but is it accurately remembered? That is an important distinction. Unfortunately, we don't like distinctions anymore. We just want to say he's guilty or she's telling the truth. Nobody wants to actually go into the nuance because we're so scared of being smeared. Like, if you say -- may be go slow and wait -- you know, you're enabling abuse. If you do not believe this right now, you're enabling abuse. No, I just happen to believe that the human mind and memory is incredibly fallible. It's a vulnerable thing. And this is a larger question for all of us because we're all vulnerable to this. It is about the accuracy of memory and its effect on the interpretation of events. And if you can't acknowledge this, you will be next. And this is the important point."

I mean, but unfortunately because we are living in such a divided place where people want to say she's telling the truth. He's guilty. They don't even want to spend so much as 30 seconds listening to his side of anything. He is guilty, as far as the left is concerned. He was guilty of something from the moment he was actually nominated for that position. They do not want him there. So I think that's a tragedy. Look, none of us know what happened. We will never know what happened. But, look, I feel for her. I mean, my god, no woman should ever be in that situation ever, ever, ever. But, also, if she isn't remembering everything clearly, if he wasn't the guy, if it was someone else, he's saying I'm innocent. And no man should be in a position of seeing his career derailed because of something that happened three decades ago where they can't piece all the facts together. So this is a very troubling situation. I think it is politically motivated. Call me a cynic but, you know, happening when it's happening. I think they should have come forward a whole lot sooner, Dana."

      "utterance": "And, Juan, the governor is saying what happened to his state is a monumental disaster. And what you're seeing behind me is evidence of that. This is middle south loop road in Ogden, which is just a few miles north and east of downtown Wilmington. This stretch of road right here was washed away late Thursday into Friday morning when the storm was reaching its peak. And you see some of the workers here surveying the damages. They're getting ready to do what they need to do to try and start repairing this road. But this is 1 of 1200 roads across the state of North Carolina that are in need of some kind of repair or are flooded and impassable at this hour as floodwaters in some spots continue to rise and that created major problems. You've mentioned Wilmington was essentially cut off for a while. Authorities have opened basically one main road into the city to allow rescue workers, relief workers, and food and water to be trucked in, but that's just one road. Most of the people here are really in a tough spot and can't get out. And the power slowly beginning to come back on. We passed a gas station just down the road where the line for fuel was at least a quarter-mile long. And we were hearing some people saying they were waiting two hours or more to fill their tanks and fill their extra gas tanks, gas cans, so that they could bring them home and power their generators to try and get some comfort. The biggest threats here, Juan, remain the floods. The trees that are coming down, the power lines that are coming down, and those treacherous roads which are responsible for some of the deaths where people don't realize they drive into floodwater and they wind up losing their lives. This can be repaired and will be repaired, but the person who lives next to it isn't confident it will happen within weeks, maybe even months."

You can see behind me just how swiftly it's moving now, big trees and pieces of debris just flying down the river. The real concern is how high it's going to get into Tuesday or Wednesday? It could reach peak historic levels here, and that's a real concern. It could produce catastrophic flooding for 1 mile around the entire area. Now there is mandatory evacuations. Deputies have been going door-to-door, knocking on doors, telling people they would not be rescued in the peak of the storm, but people are staying for the most part around here. This family here has sandbagged their house and move the valuable stuff up to higher floors. It is not easy to evacuate from here. Going 50 miles in one direction or another can take a day and night, and part of the next day. So many of the roads around here are flooded, downed power lines blocked by trees. You really almost need someone to guide you to try and get to where you're going, and that's going to have a lot of detours. Juan, back to you."

So -- but when I hear this, remember, they're speaking at the human rights campaign event in Washington this weekend. And so they're largely focused, not only on the idea of civil rights but human rights and, specific, gay, lesbian, transgender rights.

But, look, if you come from a small state, as I did, in terms of population of Wyoming, you really understand the Electoral College and how important it was, and how the founders of the country to have a federal government that had relationship with the states, but a representative government to prevent majority rule. And it was brilliant then. I think it's brilliant now. It's very frustrating I think to them. However, I do think that the pressure about the Electoral College is going to increase a lot in the next -- probably 20 to 30 years. And that's because -- soon, you are going to have about 70 percent of the population represented by only 30 percent of the senators because of where people are moving. They're moving to the big cities. And they're going to be very frustrated if the senators from Wyoming decide to block something in the senate. And that pressure about the Electoral College and the whole process is going to be immense, but I still maintain that the founders had it right and that they anticipated these things."

I mean, I've said over and over again, I'm worried that our country is increasingly becoming ungovernable because two sides are so polarized against each other. By the way, remember when Donald Trump, when he was running back in '16 and he kept saying, well, you know, if I don't win, maybe this election system is rigged. And there were rumblings that it might be the fault of the Electoral College. And Hillary Clinton and company were out saying can you imagine that he would ever even -- you know, show this distrust in our system, et cetera? And now, well, he won, so now it's the reverse and she's doing the exact same thing that she worried he would do. I mean, for her -- for her to criticize the system that has worked for hundreds and hundreds of years, a system that has made us the example, I would say, for the rest of the world, in terms of democracy, in terms of governments that transfer peacefully, at least they have been in the past, transferring peacefully.

Yes, for two years, we've watched the media chase a phantom in an effort to undo an election. Meanwhile, Captain Corkboard here is meeting with the enemy, giving them cryptic advice on Trump. Now, you might think, how is this different from working with North Korea? Well, Kerry is not the secretary of state. It's not his job. And it might even be illegal to have an alternative foreign policy going on that's separate from the White House. Even more, it's worse to have it run from this guy in his basement in his spare time.

I think Kerry owes an apology to teenage girls, because when I was in high school, I was much more insecure than the girls that I was in the class with. I honestly think this is all about just giving CPR to his legacy, because when you think about his whole trajectory, he served honorably in Vietnam, and then he kind of tarnished that service when he came back and disparaged his fellow soldiers. Then he lost in kind of a humiliating fashion to George W. Bush. Now, a nuclear deal as secretary of state is kind of like the crown jewel for these people, especially Democrats. So Trump comes in, just rips up the piece of paper, and Kerry's left saying, \"What do I have left?\" So he's desperate to salvage this thing. And could you imagine if Mike Pompeo in seven and a half years, or maybe longer, goes out and tries to undermine the current Democratic presidential administration? He would get hammered by the media. I mean, you don't see Bill Clinton going down to Mexico City and trying to save NAFTA after Trump rips that up. It's unseemly, and he should be called out for it."

And I'm glad he's doing it before the midterms, because it is going to have a huge political impact. Right now, the -- you know, looks like the Democrats have a very good shot at retaking the House. If this all comes out and people can see that a lot of what's been going on in terms of surveillance and the special counsel was rigged from the jump and people were corrupt to the very highest levels when it came to political persecution and things that should never have been done. And I think people are going to take a very hard look at that and say, \"You know what?

Like, \"Why don't we just release these documents?\" This has been going back for about a year. It could be that the Justice Department and the FBI and the White House are all comfortable with these being released momentarily. But it might take them a day or two just to figure out if they need any other sources to be dealt with. I also wonder if this is a sign that things are starting to wrap up, because now you have Manafort's plea. You know, there's movement. And to me, this feels like another way to wrap this up."

So I think the president was somewhat restrained in saying, \"Hey, listen, we can't just throw a FISA warrant out there, because FISA warrants are secret for a reason. You don't want your enemies to know about your sources.\" But now after the Manafort flip, and Manafort is going to apparently cooperate with Mueller.

Well, a spy hop is whenever an animal jumps out of the water to get a better view of the activity near the water's surface. It's like, you know, when your goldfish jumps out of the tank so he can see what's happening in the living room. That's a spy hop."
