He moved to Alaska hoping the arctic air would keep audiences from leaving. But what a busy day of news. We're going to get to Joe in the next block. But first, it's insurrection part two as dozens of rioters descend into the Oval Office, as the President and Vice President are taken by surprise. Look at that chaos. Oh my god. Can you help the FBI? Dear viewers identify the insurrectionists. Our democracy is at stake. This is worse than Watergate, 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Of course, that's Madame Tussauds' new wax replicas of our president and vice president. It's the first time those two have been seen together in months. Plus, those wax figures have already held more press conferences. But also with Joe this might be the first time to so wax figure is more lifelike than its inspiration. They tell me Joe's figure was actually made out of his own ear wax. He's been collecting it in a mayonnaise jar for years, not the only one, Kat. Speaking of wax figures, did anyone catch Colbert the other night? No. Well, if laughter caused cancer, his audience has been in remission for 10 years. Talk about a change of hearts however. Remember, I was terrified that under Trump all our precious institutions would be destroyed. Well, Donald's gone, and the only folks craving destruction are Democrats, including Dear Stephen. Yes. It started with statues. And it's never stopped.",

      "sentences": "Oh. I'm thinking the only thing that should be abolished is Colbert's writing room. Damn. That was even too crazy for Liz Warren. She was ready to send a smoke signal to the tribe to come rescuer. So all the people screaming about threats to our Republican attacks in our democracy are now upbeat about burning it all down. They're happy about executive order forced vaccination. They're thrilled about the government working with big tech to censor dissent. They're A, OK with harsh treatment by the DOJ over political opponents. And why? Because they love power, but they can't persuade. And when you can't persuade you change the rules or you enforce new ones. Colbert is that guy you're beating in a monopoly game. So he flips the board over. And he wants to abolish the Senate because that abolishes the power of the states and leaves the power to the dirt bags in D.C., Chicago's, San Fran, L.A. and NYC. And you seen the good job they've done with their cities, right? Their cities are disastrous because they thought tearing down statues was a bigger priority than subway shivers. They thought people cared more about trans bathrooms than train robberies. They thought pitting people against each other was superior to protecting them from maniacs. So while the country lurches into a dark abyss, Biden once again divides us tweeting about Jim Crow 2.0. Again, falsely claiming that one-half of the country's preventing the other half from voting, and then he offers no evidence. Instead, it's just racial smears. This guy plays the race card more than Hunter plays with himself. And judging by the laptop, that's nothing to shake a stick at. Joe claims the bill is meant to prevent election fraud. But when we told that mentioning fraud undermines public faith in elections, and besides, was it 2020 a perfect election? My guess it's B.S. They really want ballots to be as insecure as the view and a spin class. Frankly, I'm confused by all this misinformation. So thank God for CNN. They're hiring new staffers to fight fake news. The only thing you need to do to land a job over there is a trench coat, a bag of candy and working knowledge of the local playgrounds. On Twitter, Alex Koppelman announced CNN is creating a new team dedicated to covering false news. That should be easy. They'll never have to leave their own building. All they're investigating will lead them to Jeff Zucker's office. It's kind of like Alec Baldwin teaching gun safety. Complements says it's about covering the uses and abuses and distortions of reality. If that's true, then start with the three C's championed by CNN. Collusion, Covington, Crime, it probably spell Kyle Rittenhouse with a C for how much they lied about him. Then throw in some Kavanaughs, Smollett, those crazy stories about Don Jr. meeting with Shady Russians. He got your first year wrapped up. And let's not forget how misinformation is made by hiding the news from underplaying riots, to hiding Hunter's laptop, to mocking the murderer's crime wave. All covered up by CNN. So they're also hiring reporters, the kind who \"Feel like you have to jump down every rabbit hole you see.\" The kind who spend more time on the internet than anyone really should. Basically they're looking to hire that 400-pound guy sitting on his bed, as Trump would say losers too fat and lazy to join Antifa. But I feel for the poor staff. Like Brian Stelter putting on leggings. They're going to have to work overtime to cover themselves. I just wonder how they're going to do it.",

He moved to Alaska hoping the arctic air would keep audiences from leaving. But what a busy day of news. We're going to get to Joe in the next block. But first, it's insurrection part two as dozens of rioters descend into the Oval Office, as the President and Vice President are taken by surprise. Look at that chaos. Oh my god. Can you help the FBI? Dear viewers identify the insurrectionists. Our democracy is at stake. This is worse than Watergate, 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Of course, that's Madame Tussauds' new wax replicas of our president and vice president. It's the first time those two have been seen together in months. Plus, those wax figures have already held more press conferences. But also with Joe this might be the first time to so wax figure is more lifelike than its inspiration. They tell me Joe's figure was actually made out of his own ear wax. He's been collecting it in a mayonnaise jar for years, not the only one, Kat. Speaking of wax figures, did anyone catch Colbert the other night? No. Well, if laughter caused cancer, his audience has been in remission for 10 years. Talk about a change of hearts however. Remember, I was terrified that under Trump all our precious institutions would be destroyed. Well, Donald's gone, and the only folks craving destruction are Democrats, including Dear Stephen. Yes.

      "utterance": "Oh. I'm thinking the only thing that should be abolished is Colbert's writing room. Damn. That was even too crazy for Liz Warren. She was ready to send a smoke signal to the tribe to come rescuer. So all the people screaming about threats to our Republican attacks in our democracy are now upbeat about burning it all down. They're happy about executive order forced vaccination. They're thrilled about the government working with big tech to censor dissent. They're A, OK with harsh treatment by the DOJ over political opponents. And why? Because they love power, but they can't persuade. And when you can't persuade you change the rules or you enforce new ones. Colbert is that guy you're beating in a monopoly game. So he flips the board over. And he wants to abolish the Senate because that abolishes the power of the states and leaves the power to the dirt bags in D.C., Chicago's, San Fran, L.A. and NYC. And you seen the good job they've done with their cities, right? Their cities are disastrous because they thought tearing down statues was a bigger priority than subway shivers. They thought people cared more about trans bathrooms than train robberies. They thought pitting people against each other was superior to protecting them from maniacs. So while the country lurches into a dark abyss, Biden once again divides us tweeting about Jim Crow 2.0. Again, falsely claiming that one-half of the country's preventing the other half from voting, and then he offers no evidence. Instead, it's just racial smears. This guy plays the race card more than Hunter plays with himself. And judging by the laptop, that's nothing to shake a stick at. Joe claims the bill is meant to prevent election fraud. But when we told that mentioning fraud undermines public faith in elections, and besides, was it 2020 a perfect election? My guess it's B.S. They really want ballots to be as insecure as the view and a spin class. Frankly, I'm confused by all this misinformation. So thank God for CNN. They're hiring new staffers to fight fake news. The only thing you need to do to land a job over there is a trench coat, a bag of candy and working knowledge of the local playgrounds. On Twitter, Alex Koppelman announced CNN is creating a new team dedicated to covering false news. That should be easy. They'll never have to leave their own building. All they're investigating will lead them to Jeff Zucker's office. It's kind of like Alec Baldwin teaching gun safety. Complements says it's about covering the uses and abuses and distortions of reality. If that's true, then start with the three C's championed by CNN. Collusion, Covington, Crime, it probably spell Kyle Rittenhouse with a C for how much they lied about him. Then throw in some Kavanaughs, Smollett, those crazy stories about Don Jr. meeting with Shady Russians. He got your first year wrapped up. And let's not forget how misinformation is made by hiding the news from underplaying riots, to hiding Hunter's laptop, to mocking the murderer's crime wave. All covered up by CNN. So they're also hiring reporters, the kind who \"Feel like you have to jump down every rabbit hole you see.\" The kind who spend more time on the internet than anyone really should. Basically they're looking to hire that 400-pound guy sitting on his bed, as Trump would say losers too fat and lazy to join Antifa. But I feel for the poor staff. Like Brian Stelter putting on leggings. They're going to have to work overtime to cover themselves. I just wonder how they're going to do it."

The Antarctic town and Villas las Estrella's which is Spanish for freezing my butt off, requires all residents to get their appendix removed before they can live there. Apparently, the reasoning is that the town is 625 miles away from a hospital and someone with a burst appendix might not be able to make it there in time. So, you got to lose your appendix to live there. Well, it's better than Miami, which requires a nose job, a boob job and a Brazilian butt lift to even be allowed outside the airport. Take it from me, best to schedule all three in one appointment. Kat, how is this different than living in New York and being an old person? If you have a heart attack in Midtown, you are not going to survive? If you have a stroke in Midtown, you are not going to survive, because it's not the snow or the distance, it's the traffic."
