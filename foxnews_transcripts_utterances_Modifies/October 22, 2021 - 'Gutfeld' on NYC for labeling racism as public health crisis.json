But all of us here in this studio have something in common. We aren't dead, at least yet. Because in New York City not getting assaulted is akin to winning the lottery. It's a violent city right now. This morning, I saw a rat with a black guy. It's a funny image, not even a real joke. But hey, murders spiked big time jumping from 319 in 2019 to 500 in 2020. Now we shy away from numbers around here because Kat hates math. But change that vowel to an E. That's another story.",

      "sentences": "That job by the way, was the largest since national record keeping began in 1960. That was the year the mob finally stopped killing all the record keepers. So yes, we may not be number one anymore in math or science, but check out how we kill each other. Where's our gold medal in that? We got to host the Olympic Games so we can add competitive drive-bys as a new sports. But as the media quickly points out all the time, if you move a murder from the statistics, crime has dropped. Well, that's a relief. So hey, Honey, did you here this year? You're less likely to get robbed. Why don't you answer me? Oh, wow, you've been murdered. But at least you weren't robbed. Now let me move your body before I get arrested for littering. Maybe I'm crazy. But if murder nearly doubles while lesser stuff is down, I'm not throwing a parade. Mainly because no one will show up since they've all been murdered. So the crime wave (INAUDIBLE) NYC either, Chicago had 771 murders last year compared to 500 the previous year. L.A. went from 258 to 351. That's why these cities are hemorrhaging residents because the residents are hemorrhaging. Murders have jumped 10 percent from 2020 in 87 cities according to The New York Times. And speaking of murder, you know what killed the Times to admit that. Still, the Times is in full denial. To them it has nothing to do with defunding and marginalizing law enforcement while cheering on the destruction of cities or releasing repeat violent offenders onto the streets which they have essentially decriminalizing crime. No, no, no, it's not that. The quota community organizer in the peace, \"People are desperate, and they don't have a lot of options. So they turn to violence as a way to solve things.\" So is that a desperate person's only option? You know, look for a job or kill someone. Congratulations, media. You've dressed the city in a short skirt and said she was asking for it. If you don't see the criminal as the perpetrator, but as a victim, you happily excuse yourself from punishing the perp. However, the media would surely change their minds if these crimes are being committed by Trump supporters. So what is New York City doing while citizens are picked off like clay pigeons at a skeet shoot? While the Board of Health has declared racism a public health crisis? Not murder, not mental illness, not drug abuse, not pumpkin spice lattes. But racism. Those victims pushed onto the subway tracks I bet there'll be so relieved. So they passed a resolution declaring that COVID has worsened the suffering among communities of color. Now if the referring to rest homes, they might be right. Black, white, brown racism didn't kill them though. The carelessness and stupidity of our politicians did. One state senator, Brad Hoylman said we need an urgent call to action. We can no longer ignore as a government or society. Yes, because we've been ignoring racism. Sorry, where's this idiot been? The only place where racism isn't being discussed ad nauseam is under the sea. And even there, the great white shark gets a bad rap. It's true. This resolution came six months after the inept CDC declared racism a serious public health threat. And now they've created a mayoral racial justice commission. Who's going to be in charge of it? The mayor's wife? No. Our mayor is stupid. (INAUDIBLE) but his wife's worse. She ran the mental health program that made 800 million bucks taxpayer money disappear. As a result, what's happening on our streets looks like the trailer for the sequel to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It's crazy. So is racism a public health crisis? Let's ask the angry black male.",

You're Joy Reid. The quickest way to end your life just be a racist. I would have added being caught whacking off on a work Zoom call. But CNN proved me wrong. But the left maintains you can be guilty of racism without any proof at all. It's like dunking witches. If they float, they're guilty. But if they're innocent, they drown. And if they get hepatitis, the water is definitely from Kat's hot tub. You call systemic or unconscious racism, no matter what you call it. It's designed to get around your denial of being a bigot. Your blood runs red, white and racist, except for the accusers who were somehow born without that evil gene. So is racism a problem? Sure. But it didn't rape that woman on the train in Philly while people filmed it. It didn't kill that Filipino nurse in Times Square two weeks ago. Racism didn't send that other Asian woman down a flight of subway stairs to her death. Racism didn't push people in front of trains, racism didn't force closures of stores that can no longer keep up with retail theft. Or wait. Maybe racism is behind this. Because what else could be fueling that denial of rising homicide rates? That's killing so many blacks? The denial exposes the underlying message from the white elite activist class. What do you expect from these people? That's the racism and it's a true public health crisis seriously, if COVID revealed anything, it's that living under Democrat leadership is the most dangerous comorbidity one could have?",

Got to be single and representative of beauty. Looks like I'm mostly back in. They've also forbidden from gaining weight, changing their hair and getting any tattoos or piercings other than in their ears. Sorry, Kat. Although, they're still free to collaborate with any Germans, because they're French. But hey, just because it was called a beauty contest, it's not like that meant these women should expect to be judged on their looks. And really, isn't everyone beautiful in their own way.

This morning, I saw a rat with a black guy. It's a funny image, not even a real joke. But hey, murders spiked big time jumping from 319 in 2019 to 500 in 2020.

So yes, we may not be number one anymore in math or science, but check out how we kill each other. Where's our gold medal in that? We got to host the Olympic Games so we can add competitive drive-bys as a new sports. But as the media quickly points out all the time, if you move a murder from the statistics, crime has dropped. Well, that's a relief. So hey, Honey, did you here this year? You're less likely to get robbed. Why don't you answer me? Oh, wow, you've been murdered. But at least you weren't robbed. Now let me move your body before I get arrested for littering. Maybe I'm crazy. But if murder nearly doubles while lesser stuff is down, I'm not throwing a parade. Mainly because no one will show up since they've all been murdered. So the crime wave (INAUDIBLE) NYC either, Chicago had 771 murders last year compared to 500 the previous year. L.A. went from 258 to 351. That's why these cities are hemorrhaging residents because the residents are hemorrhaging. Murders have jumped 10 percent from 2020 in 87 cities according to The New York Times. And speaking of murder, you know what killed the Times to admit that. Still, the Times is in full denial. To them it has nothing to do with defunding and marginalizing law enforcement while cheering on the destruction of cities or releasing repeat violent offenders onto the streets which they have essentially decriminalizing crime. No, no, no, it's not that. The quota community organizer in the peace, \"People are desperate, and they don't have a lot of options. So they turn to violence as a way to solve things.\" So is that a desperate person's only option? You know, look for a job or kill someone. Congratulations, media. You've dressed the city in a short skirt and said she was asking for it. If you don't see the criminal as the perpetrator, but as a victim, you happily excuse yourself from punishing the perp. However, the media would surely change their minds if these crimes are being committed by Trump supporters. So what is New York City doing while citizens are picked off like clay pigeons at a skeet shoot? While the Board of Health has declared racism a public health crisis? Not murder, not mental illness, not drug abuse, not pumpkin spice lattes. But racism. Those victims pushed onto the subway tracks I bet there'll be so relieved. So they passed a resolution declaring that COVID has worsened the suffering among communities of color. Now if the referring to rest homes, they might be right. Black, white, brown racism didn't kill them though. The carelessness and stupidity of our politicians did. One state senator, Brad Hoylman said we need an urgent call to action. We can no longer ignore as a government or society. Yes, because we've been ignoring racism. Sorry, where's this idiot been? The only place where racism isn't being discussed ad nauseam is under the sea. And even there, the great white shark gets a bad rap. It's true. This resolution came six months after the inept CDC declared racism a serious public health threat. And now they've created a mayoral racial justice commission. Who's going to be in charge of it? The mayor's wife? No. Our mayor is stupid. (INAUDIBLE) but his wife's worse. She ran the mental health program that made 800 million bucks taxpayer money disappear. As a result, what's happening on our streets looks like the trailer for the sequel to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It's crazy. So is racism a public health crisis? Let's ask the angry black male."

But the left maintains you can be guilty of racism without any proof at all. It's like dunking witches. If they float, they're guilty. But if they're innocent, they drown. And if they get hepatitis, the water is definitely from Kat's hot tub. You call systemic or unconscious racism, no matter what you call it. It's designed to get around your denial of being a bigot. Your blood runs red, white and racist, except for the accusers who were somehow born without that evil gene. So is racism a problem? Sure. But it didn't rape that woman on the train in Philly while people filmed it. It didn't kill that Filipino nurse in Times Square two weeks ago. Racism didn't send that other Asian woman down a flight of subway stairs to her death. Racism didn't push people in front of trains, racism didn't force closures of stores that can no longer keep up with retail theft. Or wait. Maybe racism is behind this. Because what else could be fueling that denial of rising homicide rates? That's killing so many blacks? The denial exposes the underlying message from the white elite activist class. What do you expect from these people? That's the racism and it's a true public health crisis seriously, if COVID revealed anything, it's that living under Democrat leadership is the most dangerous comorbidity one could have?"

She didn't say that the vaccine was bad and don't get it. She said she may not want to take it herself. I think of Kanye West and his support of President Trump. He was also banned.

When a group of people can write a letter to the Attorney General demanding you get targeted, and he agrees that's some seriously bad (BLEEP). I might, I might try that on my neighbor who keeps playing Coldplay. I hate Coldplay. Earlier this week, parents in Michigan and Virginia filed a lawsuit against Garland accusing him of trying to criminalize free speech.

I mean, for example, Critical Race Theory is divisive, t's un-American, it's very destructive. And I think the federal government should stay out of it. You leave it up to the states. In that way, you, you keep the authority with the parents where if you don't want your child to go to that school, they can go to a different school. And here's where it's really hurting Democrats in the polls, you look at in Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, his, his poll numbers are tanking. He said that parents should have no role in, in parenting their child. And even Democrats aren't, aren't, aren't voting for him.

But they really, they must really believe climate change is take, taking us all out by 2030 because we're barely a fifth of the way through this century, and they're doing this list. The network polled film critics, academics, and TV insiders from all around the world. Unfortunately, people who weren't dorks were uninterested in participating. Wow. Anyway, according to the experts, the number one show over the past 20 years is \"The Wire,\" not bad, followed by \"Madman,\" \"Breaking Bad,\" \"Fleabag,\" and \"Game of Thrones.\" \"The Big Bang Theory\" came in at number 56 so they also pulled people with severe head injuries.
