With grainy surveillance video fueling rumors that this hit squad entered the country carrying suitcases.  And then, at some point during the day according to reports, purchased additional luggage late in the day. Were those pieces used to remove the body of Jamal Khashoggi in hopes that no one would find out?  Regardless of what happened, today, the Saudi King was on the phone with President Trump. He said his family had nothing to do with it. Here's the president.",

Look, Jamal had long-standing ties to the Muslim Brotherhood was it -- which is at odds with the Saudi Wahhabi regime.

And perhaps, MBS as the crown prince is known, Mohammad bin Salman was threatened, felt threatened by this man with a platform in Washington and the Washington Post behind him.

The lawyer for the plaintiff went on to ask how it's possible Asians rate higher than whites in most categories and yet there is only one Asian student and campus for every two whites. But the attorneys for Harvard countered saying the university cannot achieve its educational goals without considering race, but that Harvard never considered as an applicant's race as a negative.

With grainy surveillance video fueling rumors that this hit squad entered the country carrying suitcases. And then, at some point during the day according to reports, purchased additional luggage late in the day. Were those pieces used to remove the body of Jamal Khashoggi in hopes that no one would find out? Regardless of what happened, today, the Saudi King was on the phone with President Trump.

Because the United States and Saudi Arabia, officials concerned about the relationship are both trying to find a way out of what is undoubtedly a huge diplomatic embarrassment. A mess, and something that could lead to a severe strain in one of our most important allies. So, yes, they are searching for any possible explanation, but this is impossible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "It could be a one percent, two percent chance. But it contradicts everything that they've said so far, as you pointed out, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who spoke to Bloomberg News and said, \"No, no, we have -- we have information that Jamal Khashoggi left the embassy -- that he left the consulate. He wasn't there.\" So, now they have to reverse that story. They have to retract that story and do this rogue killer story. What interests me is the fact that Donald Trump was the first one to kind of float the rogue killer idea right after he talked to King Salman. So, clearly, they are both trying to find some story that would possibly explain what happened to Jamal Khashoggi inside that consulate in Istanbul."

They had suitcases, there's another report that says in the middle of all of this they went out and bought, and got more luggage, more bags. Now, you know, if that turns out to be true, your mind goes to a lot of places about what they may have been trying to remove from this embassy.  But if you're just interrogating someone with the intention of bringing them back to Saudi Arabia, why would you need 15 people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a very good question. And why would you need a forensics expert to go along with the team at the beginning? I mean, usually, forensic people look at dead bodies, not living ones. But, look it could be because the Saudis are not known for their supreme competence but this was an interrogation session that went south, that went bad. That somebody overdosed him, that he died, and the Saudis had to scramble. That is possible."

    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "Well, this man, Jamal Khashoggi was not just a journalist. He was a political activist, and he spoke to many, many Saudis. He had a million -- over 1.7 million Twitter followers. He was someone who had decided that democracy was something he thought he ought to support. Look, Jamal had long-standing ties to the Muslim Brotherhood was it -- which is at odds with the Saudi Wahhabi regime. They are both Islamist, they are both very, very conservative, but they despise each other. And perhaps, MBS as the crown prince is known, Mohammad bin Salman was threatened, felt threatened by this man with a platform in Washington and the Washington Post behind him. Maybe he decided the time had come to silence him. And he has done other rash things that have sometimes led his friends and supporters in the CIA and the Pentagon to roll their eyebrows and say, \"Boy, maybe we made a mistake. Maybe a 33-year-old young man who buys lots of expensive things himself and then arrests 200 wealthy Saudis to basically take their money away in the Ritz-Carlton. Maybe this is not the guy who should be running Saudi Arabia, but it's too late for that because Donald Trump has really anchored his Middle Eastern policy and his Arab policy in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So, it's a mess."

You know, we've talked about the fact that there, there was this very hopeful sort of triangle that had developed between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the United States. And that the strength of that with a reformed Saudi Arabia, would isolate Iran even further in the Middle East. And that, that is a very good goal.  Is that goal in jeopardy because of this?"

Eventually, I think what will hopefully come somewhat close to what truly happened there, obviously, somebody lost his life, and somebody used some kind of an instrument to take that life. So, that -- in our book, that's murder. And I think that's what it is. I would hope that the president will separate himself from what the Saudis are complicit in doing here. I also believe he sent Secretary Pompeo there to tell them, \"Come clean. Accept some responsibility here.\" With this relationship is important, but you have got to admit what's taking place and stop the line. Because the president certainly knows that they've, they've been lying."

Do you think that -- you know they sort have called the president out on this in a way?  Because if he -- if he just sort of looks the other way and accepts this, then they can pretty much do whatever they want in this kind of operation in the future as well. But if they feel like they are on the spot, and that there might be ramifications, is that the sort of -- you know, game that's being played here right now, politically?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think Pompeo is delivering that message. And that's why he's saying come clean, accept responsibility. And obviously, there's going to be some pushback from the United States for this. But the fundamental nature of the relationship, Martha, is not going to change. And why is that? Because in United States national interest for a stable and secure Middle East, the global economy depends on Middle East oil. That is the reality of it. The anchor for the Sunni Arab Middle East is Saudi Arabia. And this president has revitalized the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arabs for the specific reason to counter Iran's malign and aggressive behavior in the region. And also to curtail the breeding ground for radical Islam which obviously still in the Middle East. Those are our two vectors that we are playing out with the Sunni Arabs led by Saudi Arabia."

Listen, here's a couple things I suspect, the number one, Jim Mattis is held in high regard by the President and the White House and the national security apparatus. He is doing a good job. He likes the job he is doing. He is honored to be in that position to rebuild the United States military at a time, at a critical juncture where it has to be done and he feels good about doing that. I think what the president is talking about here is a possibility at some point that Jim Mattis is going to say, I think it's time for me to go and to turn this over to somebody else. I don't believe for a minute the president is going to take any action dealing with Jim Mattis in terms of asking him to leave and bring somebody else in. I don't believe that is what he's actually saying. I think what he really is saying is, \"I like him. He's a good guy.\" It's kind of humorous he says, he may be a Democrat.

He understands the importance of NATO. I think the question came out on the wrong way. He misunderstood it. It wasn't criticism coming from Jim Mattis. Jim Mattis knows that the president knows what why NATO exists and what it's done for the last 70 years, it has been an indispensable political-military alliance to provide peace and security in the world."

The whole notion that you have a woman who is launching her presidential campaign and the first thing she does is takes a DNA test and announces her DNA makeup. This is crazy.

The attorney for those who filed the lawsuit said that after studying six years of Harvard admission records, it was clear that Harvard rates Asian- American applicants higher than white applicants in all factors except for personal qualities such as courage, kindness, and leadership, indicating that is the discrimination. The lawyer for the plaintiff went on to ask how it's possible Asians rate higher than whites in most categories and yet there is only one Asian student and campus for every two whites. But the attorneys for Harvard countered saying the university cannot achieve its educational goals without considering race, but that Harvard never considered as an applicant's race as a negative. Harvard has argued that only 6 percent of the U.S. population is Asian-American, but 23 percent of those accepted into Harvard are Asian-American. Listen to Harvard students on both sides.

Those, of course, would be the district that were very competitive between President Trump and Hillary Clinton. What looks -- the map looks to me as though the red areas are getting redder and the blue areas are getting bluer and the purple areas are getting more purple. So, what that suggest is that this is not going to be a walk in the park for Democrats the way the Democrats thought it was going to be even a few weeks ago, but I'm not sure that leading into a heavily contested midterm election you want your going away message to be, we don't like due process with Justice Kavanaugh and also we're not really sort of native American with Elizabeth Warren.

Now, he, of course, claimed that before the Sharman Bayers (ph) got into the woods, that they even used the used catalogs in the outhouse. So, I don't know if Amazon will ever be able to live up to that promise. I don't know if they will ever do that."

      "utterance": "It's like the horse and buggy. And it is a -- it's sad and it is definitely the end of an era, but they were $5.5 billion in debt. As a business reporter, I watched Sears try to reinvent itself over the past 20 years so many times. And you know, they -- it was just impossible, sadly."

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",

      "utterance": "And unfortunately, they were not deemed too big to fail apparently --"

      "utterance": "That's right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- because the government did not sweep in and get them. You know, it's just -- I mean we do live in such a different world now. I mean, Amazon, you know, it's almost like people who use the Sears catalog to buy things that they couldn't get. Now, everybody buys everything on Amazon. It's just -- I wonder if Amazon will go bankrupt when our kids are growing up."

Our good friend, Tucker Carlson is standing by at Washington, D.C. ready with an action-packed hour and he will -- he will join you right after this. Good night, everybody.
