      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” We start tonight with a Fox News alert as you can see in the corner of your screen. Big breaking news tonight. We are tracking several bombshell stories.  William Barr, by the way, has now been sworn in as the new attorney general. We can only hope he dual his job equal justice, equal application of our laws.  Big announcement, everybody, you see that vote, needs to calm down. It's a horrific garbage bill as I have been telling you they are just voting. It's already passed in the House and Senate. The House still voting on the spending package to avoid a government shutdown has the votes. Both Houses it's passed it will head to the president's desk. A garbage compromise swamp border security bill will make its way to the president.  The bill is awful. A -- the president knows it's awful. We're going to give you the whole behind the scenes as to what was going on as to what relates to this new seven month -- and in moments I'm going to explain exactly why it happened this way and I will explain exactly how the president will get funding for the wall and what's in store for you. Has the president kept all his other promises? There is a method to this. And at the end of the day, is it better that the wall get built? More coming up. We have a monologue later in the program just on that.  First, we have big breaking news, “Hannity” watch on the deep state. This is where we begin tonight with something that should shock and alarm every single American and I don't care if you are liberal, conservative, I don't care if you are Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter, or conservative as I am. We were right. I have been sounding the alarm in this program with a team of investigative reporters for over two years. And now, today, more confirmation than we ever thought we'd have that we are dealing with, yes, a deep state and somewhat biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in the history of this country.  We now have disgraced and, by the way, now being investigated fired FBI director, their former deputy, Director Andy McCabe, back in the news. Remember last year, the deep state Trump hater was fired for lack of candor. Well, where I grew up that's called lying.   Now, the bureau found that he was constantly lying. Not lack of candor. Lying. His conduct was so bad that he is now facing a criminal investigation over his actions as are other deep state upper echelon, not rank-and-file, in the FBI. Now, the bottom line is Andrew McCabe is a known liar. But that's not stopping CBS News from giving him a huge platform to hawk his brand new anti-Trump book. But, a lot of revelations in here that should scare the living daylights out of anybody that believes in the rule of law and our Constitution. Take a look.",

Top FBI lawyer who worked for McCabe, Lisa Page, and of course, you can add James Comey and others in this upper echelon of the FBI. Lisa Page admitting in fact in 2016 and 2017, along with Comey, that, in fact, oh, after nine months when they investigated before the appointment of the special counsel, they had nothing. Still McCabe is always peddled in the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories. Just like fake news.   However, this next revelation from McCabe's interview is much, much more alarming.

This was not perceived to be a joke. It was also said at a previous time that the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offered to wear a wire into the White House to record potentially incriminating conversations with the president. A statement was released after that, that that was never serious. It was sarcastic, et cetera.

      "sentences": "All right. They have it. More conversation. Understand, they didn't like -- their favored candidate was Hillary. They never like you had Trump. But more evidence we have high ranking members, the highest in the FBI and the Department of Justice discussing how to override the will of the American people first to influence the election and by the way, keep a candidate that should have been charged in the race and then we move a duly elected president from office because they didn't want him to win and they had an insurance policy. Now, this would sound insane if it wasn't true.  Now, remember, months ago we first reported this deep state conspiracy to oust the president, a silent coup. At the time, the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein -- remember, he first denied, oh, we never talked about wearing a wire. He said it never took place. Then he said they were just merely joking when he offered to wear a wire.   Then, later, he changed his story again saying, well, I never actually ordered the surveillance. All is good, right, Rod? Now, sadly, the high level DOJ FBI discussions to secretly surveil, remove a duly elected president from office, that's only a tiny tip of the iceberg in this abuse of power corruption scandal and what has been a year's long efforts to rig the system, upend the will of the American people. That is the danger tonight. Look at this time line. Let's start July 15th, 2015. That's when the FBI opened up a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. Why? Mishandling top secret, classified and special access programming information, that was on a mom and pop shop bathroom closet server that they even believed was hacked by six foreign intelligence agencies.  On May 2nd, 2016, Comey, the FBI director and the all-important Peter Strzok, they were drafting a letter exonerating Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing which, by the way, Comey denied. We know it's true.  It wasn't until two months later in July that Hillary and 17 others were finally interviewed by the FBI. Then only three days later because they were writing the exoneration before investigation and, by the way, the people that did the investigation Peter Strzok, well then Comey had his big announcement, remember because the attorney general at the time couldn't do it, that would be Loretta Lynch, Loretta Lynch been on the tarmac with Bill Clinton and he cleared Hillary of all charges despite Comey for nearly 14 minutes citing overwhelming evidence of criminal negligence and obstruction of justice, violation of the Espionage Act, felony. On top of that, then it got into oh, deleting subpoenaed emails, acid watching with Bleach Bit and busting things one devices, removing SIM cards. Clinton gets off scot-free. She was the favored candidate.   The person that interviewed her, Peter Strzok, remember, he said Clinton deserved to win 100 million to zero. Remember, he and the exchanges with his girlfriend Lisa Page, Trump is loathesome. Attacking Trump supporters, remember, we are all the smelly people of Walmart. He could smell us. The fix was in. She should have been charged. She got away with things no other American would ever get away with, mishandling top secret intelligence putting it on an outside server, clearly a violation of felony of the Espionage Act and she obstructed justifiable by destroying those subpoenaed emails and then everything else that we know followed, and, of course, destroying the phones with a hammer.  Meanwhile, in July, again, we are still in 2016, the very same month Clinton was exonerated, immediately thereafter, the people that saved her political career and kept her in the game because the fix was in because they favored her over Donald Trump -- well, those same people, Comey, Strzok and company, they decided to open up an investigation into Trump campaign. One month later, in August of 2016, Peter Strzok texting his FBI girlfriend, Lisa Page, that it was an nourish policy and against Trump and the likely event Donald Trump wins.  Now, the basis of the investigation appears to center around Hillary's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. In other words, a piece of campaign op research funneled money through a law firm bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, put together by the op research group that used the lawyer's money to go -- legal money to go ahead and hire a foreign agent. I thought they weren't supposed to be involved in election. That's Christopher Steele. He uses phony Russian sources, oh, with the help of a woman named Nellie Ohr. Nellie just happened to be married to the fourth highest ranking official at DOJ Bruce Ohr. And he has been demoted twice. In late August 2016, Bruce Ohr presented a campaign op research to the top, upper echelon of the FBI and the DOJ and guess who else? Andrew McCabe. And Andrew Weissmann, you know, the pit bull of Robert Mueller. Warning them that the source was tainted. Christopher Steele hated Donald Trump, and he was being paid by the Clinton campaign. She paid for it all.   Nevertheless, in the summer of 2016, the FBI used the information on the dossier in an application for a FISA warrant to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign, never ever telling the FISA court in their application Hillary paid for it and never telling the FISA court that it's unverified and never corroborated. In fact, that dossier with some circulating reporting, they pushed around, based on one source. It was the bulk of the evidence used in all four FISA warrants and the three subsequent renewals.  Now, the FISA court judges, well, they were never warned of the evidence. They withheld important information that Hillary paid for it, the DNC paid for it. It never was verified. None of that, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, all of them signing off on the FISA application. Well that would be called committing a fraud or conspiracy to commit a fraud on a court. That would be lying. That's a felony. Well, Comey and his cohorts were in the FISA court and had you other deep state officials before the election leaking the dossier to everyone and anyone in the lead-up using Russian lies to influence people's votes. Wow, sounds like collusion. And then in the fall of 2016, Obama CIA Chief John Brennan and Comey's general counsel James Baker, they were both accused of leaking the phony Russian lies and the dossier.  And just after the election, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper he leaked the dossier to fake news CNN and then lied about that under oath. And then on May 9th, 2017, President Trump rightly, thankfully, fires James Comey. Right after that, the disgraced former FBI director leaked private memos surrounding his conversations with the president in the hopes that it would lead to a special counsel investigation.  Wow, is this the United States of America? Take a look at this.",

And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square. And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with the reporter. I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.",

      "sentences": "Oh, government information, you are not allowed to you leak that. Where is that investigation? Where's the predawn raid at Comey's house? Now, as it turns out, May 17th, 2017 it did prompt the appointment of a special counsel? Any evidence? None. How do we know? Lisa Page and so many others told us so. Rod Rosenstein who is was actively plotting a way to secretly surveil the president and put a bug on him -- well, was appointed by James Comey's good friend Robert Mueller. Mueller hired a team of anti-Trump pro-Clinton zealots to investigate the Trump campaign, not a single Republican, including Hillary Clinton's lawyer as it relates to the Clinton Foundation.   Andrew Weissmann was at Hillary Clinton's election night party, probably sobbing with everyone else there. Jeannie Rhee, a former lawyer of the Clintons. Peter Strzok said that Clinton should win 100 million to zero and many others made tens of thousands of dollars in donations only to Democrats, including Hillary, Barack Obama. Zero people on Mueller's staff are Republicans. Zero. So, while Hillary treated to a light interview two months after she had already been exonerated, well, no other individuals were ever charged, none. Trump campaign, much different treatment. Dual justice under the law. That's a banana republic. That's not a constitutional republic. Search warrants, perjury traps, secret surveillance, predawn raids, lying to FISA court to get warrants, dozens of heavily armed agents accompanied by armored vehicles, frogman, amphibious vehicles, for what? Lying to Congress when we have all the Democrats on record lying to Congress.   No evidence of collusion. Oh, we learned that week from the Senate Intelligence Committee that now looked into this Democrat and Republicans for two years. Now, in fact, that's what happened.  Now, today, the witch-hunt rages on, all while two actual real examples of collusion go totally and completely ignored by the deep state. Now, we all know Hillary Clinton bought and paid for the Russian lies and the Steele dossier. Her campaign funded Christopher Steel, who hates Donald Trump to dig up those Russian lies. You know, hookers urinating on beds in Moscow in Donald Trump's room. False. Then they leaked the findings in order to influence the election. Russian lies leak to the American people. And Hillary investigation, no collusion.  Next real example of collusion, remember the Uranium One deal? Hillary Clinton signed off on the idea of giving 20 percent -- this is the foundation of America's nuclear material, uranium -- to Russian state-run company. Wow. And at the same time, Bill Clinton goes to Russia and gets three times normal speaking fees. And he wants to meet with the nuclear representatives of Russia. But instead, he couldn't meet with them because he was too busy meeting with Putin himself. You can't make this up.  After the deal, millions of dollars in cash make its way to the Clinton Foundation, including Ian Telfer. He's the chairman of Uranium One. Total, nine individuals connected to Uranium One sent a combined $145 million to the Clinton Foundation over this time period between 2009 and 2013.  By the way, we had a spy, William Campbell inside of Putin's network in the Uranium One deal, and he chronicled bribery, extortion, kick backs and money laundering. They knew it and still let it happen.  During the same time frame, we know what happened with Bill Clinton. We know about meeting with Putin. We know about everything here. Then we learn from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, the FBI uncovered a Russian bribery plot. That's when we talk about the uranium deal -- bribery, kick backs, extortion, money laundering, yes, and a relationship and meeting with Bill Clinton and Vladimir. Where is the Clinton collusion investigation into Uranium One, $145 million?  That's right. We don't live in a constitutional republic anymore, do we? We have a two tier justice system. One set of rules for Democrats and the Clintons. One set of rules, political persecution for anybody and everybody that likes Donald Trump. Predawn raids, 27 people for process crimes, amphibious vehicles, frogs, artillery, full swat gear, armed, predawn raids, why? Because Hillary was the chosen one. She is the one they saved from getting indicted. They never wanted Donald Trump to become president. They think that they know better than you, we, the people. Think about that. And they abuse their power to favor their candidate over another. They spread misinformation, Russian lies, and did not apply the law equally. No equal justice, no equal application of our laws. And they even plotted and schemed to remove a duly elected president from office, because they didn't like him or want him to win.  And they used Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies as their road map. They wanted to screw over the will of the American people and so far, it seems like they are getting away with it. We have a new attorney general hopefully that will change.  My sources telling me tonight things are happening as we speak. Tonight, three of so many deep state actors that need to be held accountable. James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, yes, Rod, Rod Rosenstein likely all committed a conspiracy to lie to a FISA court. That's right. Fraud before a court to get a warrant to deny a fellow American of their constitutional liberties. James Comey also seems to be needing of investigation for a serious crime when he intentionally leaked his FBI memos, government property about his conversations with the president to get the special counsel. When it comes to federal abuse of power, Comey, McCabe, struck were all fired. Page forced to resign in shame. Bruce Ohr demoted twice. All used their positions, their high positions in government to persecute those they disagreed with politically. And don't forget about lying to the FBI. After all, that crime shouldn't only apply American war heroes like General Flynn after you brag about, oh, we wouldn't do this in the Obama administration, and then have an Andrew McCabe say, you don't need a lawyer, when he really did need one.  And don't forget about, also, in all of this, the illicit leaking -- Baker, Brennan, Steel, Clapper. When are they going to be held accountable? Now, over the next year, with a brand new Attorney General William Barr, this country, we've got to decide. You want to save the United States? Do you want to be a constitutional republic? You want actual justice under the law? Do you want a dual justice system or do you want America to be handed off to your kids and grand kids as a banana republic? That's the choice America is facing tonight because a small group of very powerful, high ranking, unelected officials obviously were able to yield so much power over this country, our lives and your decisions and your choices at the ballot box. That's what happened. That's why every American needs to be concerned. We'll get to this issue of the border and the president in a minute.   Joining us now, former attorney to President Trump, John Dowd, and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. John Dowd, let's start with you. Am I wrong on anything?",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. We're going to get back to this bombshell abuse of power and corruption in just a minute.  First, we begin “Hannity” watch on, of course, the borders and our border promise and the president promised to secure the border because moments ago, after the Senate, the House followed through. They passed the spending bill to avert the government shutdown. As the White House explained today, the president will sign this deal but, he will be declaring probably tomorrow simultaneously a national emergency. That will allow him to redirect funds to construct barriers along our Southern border. Now, look, part of this whole saga is that Republicans sadly are weak. Democrats want open borders. To me, this bill is nothing but garbage. It is a swamp sewer bill. It has just a mere 1.375 billion for barriers. It comes with a host of restrictions, of what can be built and where. This bill gives local mayors the effective veto over it. And it also slashes detention space. And get, this at the Center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughan notes, it provides, quote, a de facto sanctuary for anyone unaccompanied minor, potentially providing a safe haven for violent gang members. So, as I called it from the beginning, it's a garbage swamp bill. The president also knows this. I'm going to give you the behind the scenes in a minute. Like I have also said, I don't really in the end care if the president signs this bill. I don't like it. But, the president gets the money because only that -- he follows through on making sure that we once and for all in this country secure the border. We need - this is our opportunity - now or never. So for those of you that are mad, I fully understand. Now we know that he's going to get the wall built by taking lawful actions. And as my sources confirm, and this is the behind the scenes that nobody else is going to report, one of the main reasons that the President is supporting this horrible bill is because weak Republicans in the Senate, behind the scenes, were afraid of the President using emergency measures.  So they made a deal that President signs this bad bill, they would support his emergency act and tomorrow and that also includes anywhere between 900 million and up to $10 billion that he has the authority to redirect and use for the border wall. So the President is fighting for safety, security. This is life and death. Democrats they aren't fighting for anything. And also Nancy Pelosi, threatening, \"Oh, we'll have a future gun national emergency\". Nice try Nancy, we both know that an emergency declaration like that, that would usurp the power of the Constitution who would never fly - good try. And by the way, how did you ever become Speaker with a reckless remark like that? Now, we know what's going to happen the next. Democrats will go forum- shopping, judge shopping, running to a place in California, Oregon, Hawaii and gets them. They'll get their win. They'll get to the Ninth Circuit. They'll probably win there. They'll get an injunction. But, because it's an emergency bill, and it deals with constitutional issues like, oh, the President's power is commander-in-chief and separation of powers. We also have laws that have been passed that are saying that President of United States has the authority to build barriers when there is drugs coming into this country. Those words as we've put up on the screen in the last few nights are there. In front of the Supreme Court, assuming they follow the Constitution, the law as it's written, the President is on solid legal ground under the 1976 National Emergencies Act. By the way, you may not know this, there are dozens, right now, of active emergencies - about 30 of them in effect today, dating back to the Carter Administration. But who cares what lawful road the President takes when it comes to upholding his constitutional oath. This is about drugs, drug cartels, this is about human trafficking, young girls being sex trafficked. This is about the homicide numbers we give you, this is about the sexual assaults, the violent assaults. Look at the big picture. President has faced an unprecedented amount of obstruction from Democrats, from the media and weak people in his own party. But he's fighting hard to keep the promise. Ask yourself this, what promise has he not kept up to this point? He's governing as a conservative, I told you he would. The American people are with him on the borders. So tomorrow the President is going to allocate, probably anywhere between $900 million to $10 billion and he's going to go it alone like he always has to.  Why? Because to the Democrats this is just the cheap political game, they want open borders. Remember there is no amnesty, there's no path to citizenship in this bill, there's no elimination of ICE which the Democrats want, it's about life and death. Joining us now for reaction of Republican Congressman Andy Biggs; Fox News Contributor, Dan Bongino. Are we really going to give local Democrats veto power over the President of the United States' stand? Republicans can't do better than that?",

And secondly, he's going to reallocate those funds, which other Presidents have done as well, and let's say it goes to $7 billion or $8 billion or even if it's just $1 billion, that keeps the process going ahead of time.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” We start tonight with a Fox News alert as you can see in the corner of your screen. Big breaking news tonight. We are tracking several bombshell stories. William Barr, by the way, has now been sworn in as the new attorney general. We can only hope he dual his job equal justice, equal application of our laws. Big announcement, everybody, you see that vote, needs to calm down. It's a horrific garbage bill as I have been telling you they are just voting. It's already passed in the House and Senate. The House still voting on the spending package to avoid a government shutdown has the votes. Both Houses it's passed it will head to the president's desk. A garbage compromise swamp border security bill will make its way to the president. The bill is awful. A -- the president knows it's awful. We're going to give you the whole behind the scenes as to what was going on as to what relates to this new seven month -- and in moments I'm going to explain exactly why it happened this way and I will explain exactly how the president will get funding for the wall and what's in store for you. Has the president kept all his other promises? There is a method to this. And at the end of the day, is it better that the wall get built? More coming up. We have a monologue later in the program just on that. First, we have big breaking news, “Hannity” watch on the deep state. This is where we begin tonight with something that should shock and alarm every single American and I don't care if you are liberal, conservative, I don't care if you are Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter, or conservative as I am. We were right. I have been sounding the alarm in this program with a team of investigative reporters for over two years. And now, today, more confirmation than we ever thought we'd have that we are dealing with, yes, a deep state and somewhat biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in the history of this country. We now have disgraced and, by the way, now being investigated fired FBI director, their former deputy, Director Andy McCabe, back in the news. Remember last year, the deep state Trump hater was fired for lack of candor. Well, where I grew up that's called lying. Now, the bureau found that he was constantly lying. Not lack of candor. Lying. His conduct was so bad that he is now facing a criminal investigation over his actions as are other deep state upper echelon, not rank-and-file, in the FBI. Now, the bottom line is Andrew McCabe is a known liar. But that's not stopping CBS News from giving him a huge platform to hawk his brand new anti-Trump book. But, a lot of revelations in here that should scare the living daylights out of anybody that believes in the rule of law and our Constitution. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

Look at the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee this week. They said they have no evidence after two years of any collusion. Now, look on your screen. Top FBI lawyer who worked for McCabe, Lisa Page, and of course, you can add James Comey and others in this upper echelon of the FBI. Lisa Page admitting in fact in 2016 and 2017, along with Comey, that, in fact, oh, after nine months when they investigated before the appointment of the special counsel, they had nothing. Still McCabe is always peddled in the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories. Just like fake news. However, this next revelation from McCabe's interview is much, much more alarming. Take a look at this."

      "speaker": "SCOTT PELLEY, CBS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "There were meetings at the Justice Department in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment. This was not perceived to be a joke. It was also said at a previous time that the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offered to wear a wire into the White House to record potentially incriminating conversations with the president. A statement was released after that, that that was never serious. It was sarcastic, et cetera. McCabe in our interview says, no, it came up more than once and it was so serious that he took it to the lawyers at the FBI to discuss it."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. They have it. More conversation. Understand, they didn't like -- their favored candidate was Hillary. They never like you had Trump. But more evidence we have high ranking members, the highest in the FBI and the Department of Justice discussing how to override the will of the American people first to influence the election and by the way, keep a candidate that should have been charged in the race and then we move a duly elected president from office because they didn't want him to win and they had an insurance policy. Now, this would sound insane if it wasn't true. Now, remember, months ago we first reported this deep state conspiracy to oust the president, a silent coup. At the time, the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein -- remember, he first denied, oh, we never talked about wearing a wire. He said it never took place. Then he said they were just merely joking when he offered to wear a wire. Then, later, he changed his story again saying, well, I never actually ordered the surveillance. All is good, right, Rod? Now, sadly, the high level DOJ FBI discussions to secretly surveil, remove a duly elected president from office, that's only a tiny tip of the iceberg in this abuse of power corruption scandal and what has been a year's long efforts to rig the system, upend the will of the American people. That is the danger tonight. Look at this time line. Let's start July 15th, 2015. That's when the FBI opened up a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton. Why? Mishandling top secret, classified and special access programming information, that was on a mom and pop shop bathroom closet server that they even believed was hacked by six foreign intelligence agencies. On May 2nd, 2016, Comey, the FBI director and the all-important Peter Strzok, they were drafting a letter exonerating Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing which, by the way, Comey denied. We know it's true. It wasn't until two months later in July that Hillary and 17 others were finally interviewed by the FBI. Then only three days later because they were writing the exoneration before investigation and, by the way, the people that did the investigation Peter Strzok, well then Comey had his big announcement, remember because the attorney general at the time couldn't do it, that would be Loretta Lynch, Loretta Lynch been on the tarmac with Bill Clinton and he cleared Hillary of all charges despite Comey for nearly 14 minutes citing overwhelming evidence of criminal negligence and obstruction of justice, violation of the Espionage Act, felony. On top of that, then it got into oh, deleting subpoenaed emails, acid watching with Bleach Bit and busting things one devices, removing SIM cards. Clinton gets off scot-free. She was the favored candidate. The person that interviewed her, Peter Strzok, remember, he said Clinton deserved to win 100 million to zero. Remember, he and the exchanges with his girlfriend Lisa Page, Trump is loathesome. Attacking Trump supporters, remember, we are all the smelly people of Walmart. He could smell us. The fix was in. She should have been charged. She got away with things no other American would ever get away with, mishandling top secret intelligence putting it on an outside server, clearly a violation of felony of the Espionage Act and she obstructed justifiable by destroying those subpoenaed emails and then everything else that we know followed, and, of course, destroying the phones with a hammer. Meanwhile, in July, again, we are still in 2016, the very same month Clinton was exonerated, immediately thereafter, the people that saved her political career and kept her in the game because the fix was in because they favored her over Donald Trump -- well, those same people, Comey, Strzok and company, they decided to open up an investigation into Trump campaign. One month later, in August of 2016, Peter Strzok texting his FBI girlfriend, Lisa Page, that it was an nourish policy and against Trump and the likely event Donald Trump wins. Now, the basis of the investigation appears to center around Hillary's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. In other words, a piece of campaign op research funneled money through a law firm bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, put together by the op research group that used the lawyer's money to go -- legal money to go ahead and hire a foreign agent. I thought they weren't supposed to be involved in election. That's Christopher Steele. He uses phony Russian sources, oh, with the help of a woman named Nellie Ohr. Nellie just happened to be married to the fourth highest ranking official at DOJ Bruce Ohr. And he has been demoted twice. In late August 2016, Bruce Ohr presented a campaign op research to the top, upper echelon of the FBI and the DOJ and guess who else? Andrew McCabe. And Andrew Weissmann, you know, the pit bull of Robert Mueller. Warning them that the source was tainted. Christopher Steele hated Donald Trump, and he was being paid by the Clinton campaign. She paid for it all. Nevertheless, in the summer of 2016, the FBI used the information on the dossier in an application for a FISA warrant to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign, never ever telling the FISA court in their application Hillary paid for it and never telling the FISA court that it's unverified and never corroborated. In fact, that dossier with some circulating reporting, they pushed around, based on one source. It was the bulk of the evidence used in all four FISA warrants and the three subsequent renewals. Now, the FISA court judges, well, they were never warned of the evidence. They withheld important information that Hillary paid for it, the DNC paid for it. It never was verified. None of that, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, all of them signing off on the FISA application. Well that would be called committing a fraud or conspiracy to commit a fraud on a court. That would be lying. That's a felony. Well, Comey and his cohorts were in the FISA court and had you other deep state officials before the election leaking the dossier to everyone and anyone in the lead-up using Russian lies to influence people's votes. Wow, sounds like collusion. And then in the fall of 2016, Obama CIA Chief John Brennan and Comey's general counsel James Baker, they were both accused of leaking the phony Russian lies and the dossier. And just after the election, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper he leaked the dossier to fake news CNN and then lied about that under oath. And then on May 9th, 2017, President Trump rightly, thankfully, fires James Comey. Right after that, the disgraced former FBI director leaked private memos surrounding his conversations with the president in the hopes that it would lead to a special counsel investigation. Wow, is this the United States of America? Take a look at this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I asked -- the president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there is not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might be a tape. And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square. And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with the reporter. I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Oh, government information, you are not allowed to you leak that. Where is that investigation? Where's the predawn raid at Comey's house? Now, as it turns out, May 17th, 2017 it did prompt the appointment of a special counsel? Any evidence? None. How do we know? Lisa Page and so many others told us so. Rod Rosenstein who is was actively plotting a way to secretly surveil the president and put a bug on him -- well, was appointed by James Comey's good friend Robert Mueller. Mueller hired a team of anti-Trump pro-Clinton zealots to investigate the Trump campaign, not a single Republican, including Hillary Clinton's lawyer as it relates to the Clinton Foundation. Andrew Weissmann was at Hillary Clinton's election night party, probably sobbing with everyone else there. Jeannie Rhee, a former lawyer of the Clintons. Peter Strzok said that Clinton should win 100 million to zero and many others made tens of thousands of dollars in donations only to Democrats, including Hillary, Barack Obama. Zero people on Mueller's staff are Republicans. Zero. So, while Hillary treated to a light interview two months after she had already been exonerated, well, no other individuals were ever charged, none. Trump campaign, much different treatment. Dual justice under the law. That's a banana republic. That's not a constitutional republic. Search warrants, perjury traps, secret surveillance, predawn raids, lying to FISA court to get warrants, dozens of heavily armed agents accompanied by armored vehicles, frogman, amphibious vehicles, for what? Lying to Congress when we have all the Democrats on record lying to Congress. No evidence of collusion. Oh, we learned that week from the Senate Intelligence Committee that now looked into this Democrat and Republicans for two years. Now, in fact, that's what happened. Now, today, the witch-hunt rages on, all while two actual real examples of collusion go totally and completely ignored by the deep state. Now, we all know Hillary Clinton bought and paid for the Russian lies and the Steele dossier. Her campaign funded Christopher Steel, who hates Donald Trump to dig up those Russian lies. You know, hookers urinating on beds in Moscow in Donald Trump's room. False. Then they leaked the findings in order to influence the election. Russian lies leak to the American people. And Hillary investigation, no collusion. Next real example of collusion, remember the Uranium One deal? Hillary Clinton signed off on the idea of giving 20 percent -- this is the foundation of America's nuclear material, uranium -- to Russian state-run company. Wow. And at the same time, Bill Clinton goes to Russia and gets three times normal speaking fees. And he wants to meet with the nuclear representatives of Russia. But instead, he couldn't meet with them because he was too busy meeting with Putin himself. You can't make this up. After the deal, millions of dollars in cash make its way to the Clinton Foundation, including Ian Telfer. He's the chairman of Uranium One. Total, nine individuals connected to Uranium One sent a combined $145 million to the Clinton Foundation over this time period between 2009 and 2013. By the way, we had a spy, William Campbell inside of Putin's network in the Uranium One deal, and he chronicled bribery, extortion, kick backs and money laundering. They knew it and still let it happen. During the same time frame, we know what happened with Bill Clinton. We know about meeting with Putin. We know about everything here. Then we learn from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, the FBI uncovered a Russian bribery plot. That's when we talk about the uranium deal -- bribery, kick backs, extortion, money laundering, yes, and a relationship and meeting with Bill Clinton and Vladimir. Where is the Clinton collusion investigation into Uranium One, $145 million? That's right. We don't live in a constitutional republic anymore, do we? We have a two tier justice system. One set of rules for Democrats and the Clintons. One set of rules, political persecution for anybody and everybody that likes Donald Trump. Predawn raids, 27 people for process crimes, amphibious vehicles, frogs, artillery, full swat gear, armed, predawn raids, why? Because Hillary was the chosen one. She is the one they saved from getting indicted. They never wanted Donald Trump to become president. They think that they know better than you, we, the people. Think about that. And they abuse their power to favor their candidate over another. They spread misinformation, Russian lies, and did not apply the law equally. No equal justice, no equal application of our laws. And they even plotted and schemed to remove a duly elected president from office, because they didn't like him or want him to win. And they used Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies as their road map. They wanted to screw over the will of the American people and so far, it seems like they are getting away with it. We have a new attorney general hopefully that will change. My sources telling me tonight things are happening as we speak. Tonight, three of so many deep state actors that need to be held accountable. James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, yes, Rod, Rod Rosenstein likely all committed a conspiracy to lie to a FISA court. That's right. Fraud before a court to get a warrant to deny a fellow American of their constitutional liberties. James Comey also seems to be needing of investigation for a serious crime when he intentionally leaked his FBI memos, government property about his conversations with the president to get the special counsel. When it comes to federal abuse of power, Comey, McCabe, struck were all fired. Page forced to resign in shame. Bruce Ohr demoted twice. All used their positions, their high positions in government to persecute those they disagreed with politically. And don't forget about lying to the FBI. After all, that crime shouldn't only apply American war heroes like General Flynn after you brag about, oh, we wouldn't do this in the Obama administration, and then have an Andrew McCabe say, you don't need a lawyer, when he really did need one. And don't forget about, also, in all of this, the illicit leaking -- Baker, Brennan, Steel, Clapper. When are they going to be held accountable? Now, over the next year, with a brand new Attorney General William Barr, this country, we've got to decide. You want to save the United States? Do you want to be a constitutional republic? You want actual justice under the law? Do you want a dual justice system or do you want America to be handed off to your kids and grand kids as a banana republic? That's the choice America is facing tonight because a small group of very powerful, high ranking, unelected officials obviously were able to yield so much power over this country, our lives and your decisions and your choices at the ballot box. That's what happened. That's why every American needs to be concerned. We'll get to this issue of the border and the president in a minute.

Andy McCabe, the ringleader in that critical eight days, this is so important, the eight days between the dates that Comey was fired and the dates that Robert Mueller was named special counsel. During that critical eight days, all the top people -- Baker, McCabe, Strzok, Page, were plotting ways to go after this president. That is what is most alarming.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. We're going to get back to this bombshell abuse of power and corruption in just a minute. First, we begin “Hannity” watch on, of course, the borders and our border promise and the president promised to secure the border because moments ago, after the Senate, the House followed through. They passed the spending bill to avert the government shutdown. As the White House explained today, the president will sign this deal but, he will be declaring probably tomorrow simultaneously a national emergency. That will allow him to redirect funds to construct barriers along our Southern border. Now, look, part of this whole saga is that Republicans sadly are weak. Democrats want open borders. To me, this bill is nothing but garbage. It is a swamp sewer bill. It has just a mere 1.375 billion for barriers. It comes with a host of restrictions, of what can be built and where. This bill gives local mayors the effective veto over it. And it also slashes detention space. And get, this at the Center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughan notes, it provides, quote, a de facto sanctuary for anyone unaccompanied minor, potentially providing a safe haven for violent gang members. So, as I called it from the beginning, it's a garbage swamp bill. The president also knows this. I'm going to give you the behind the scenes in a minute. Like I have also said, I don't really in the end care if the president signs this bill. I don't like it. But, the president gets the money because only that -- he follows through on making sure that we once and for all in this country secure the border. We need - this is our opportunity - now or never. So for those of you that are mad, I fully understand. Now we know that he's going to get the wall built by taking lawful actions. And as my sources confirm, and this is the behind the scenes that nobody else is going to report, one of the main reasons that the President is supporting this horrible bill is because weak Republicans in the Senate, behind the scenes, were afraid of the President using emergency measures. So they made a deal that President signs this bad bill, they would support his emergency act and tomorrow and that also includes anywhere between 900 million and up to $10 billion that he has the authority to redirect and use for the border wall. So the President is fighting for safety, security. This is life and death. Democrats they aren't fighting for anything. And also Nancy Pelosi, threatening, \"Oh, we'll have a future gun national emergency\". Nice try Nancy, we both know that an emergency declaration like that, that would usurp the power of the Constitution who would never fly - good try. And by the way, how did you ever become Speaker with a reckless remark like that? Now, we know what's going to happen the next. Democrats will go forum- shopping, judge shopping, running to a place in California, Oregon, Hawaii and gets them. They'll get their win. They'll get to the Ninth Circuit. They'll probably win there. They'll get an injunction. But, because it's an emergency bill, and it deals with constitutional issues like, oh, the President's power is commander-in-chief and separation of powers. We also have laws that have been passed that are saying that President of United States has the authority to build barriers when there is drugs coming into this country. Those words as we've put up on the screen in the last few nights are there. In front of the Supreme Court, assuming they follow the Constitution, the law as it's written, the President is on solid legal ground under the 1976 National Emergencies Act. By the way, you may not know this, there are dozens, right now, of active emergencies - about 30 of them in effect today, dating back to the Carter Administration. But who cares what lawful road the President takes when it comes to upholding his constitutional oath. This is about drugs, drug cartels, this is about human trafficking, young girls being sex trafficked. This is about the homicide numbers we give you, this is about the sexual assaults, the violent assaults. Look at the big picture. President has faced an unprecedented amount of obstruction from Democrats, from the media and weak people in his own party. But he's fighting hard to keep the promise. Ask yourself this, what promise has he not kept up to this point? He's governing as a conservative, I told you he would. The American people are with him on the borders. So tomorrow the President is going to allocate, probably anywhere between $900 million to $10 billion and he's going to go it alone like he always has to. Why? Because to the Democrats this is just the cheap political game, they want open borders. Remember there is no amnesty, there's no path to citizenship in this bill, there's no elimination of ICE which the Democrats want, it's about life and death. Joining us now for reaction of Republican Congressman Andy Biggs; Fox News Contributor, Dan Bongino. Are we really going to give local Democrats veto power over the President of the United States' stand? Republicans can't do better than that?"

This Section 224, Sean, prevents the DHS Secretary from deporting, removing or even referring for removal any - basically anyone that brings a child into this country. Now, Sean, what do you think that's going to do? It's going to incentivize a bunch of people to grab some children and take them across this dangerous journey in the desert. But that brings up my second point, that how do you negotiate with a party - the Democrats that have given up on America.

I think when you talk about Section 284, that is the cleanest way for him to get access to several billion dollars, because it's an active drug trafficking corridor. And we know it's true because, just in Arizona, 40 percent of drugs interdicted in this country come in that corridor - in a small corridor in Arizona. We know it's a real deal. And he has access to billions of dollars and I think he's going to use it and he's going to use it wisely. And I think the courts going to have a tough time saying that he does not have 284 Authority."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "OK. So Dan Bongino, here's how I see it. So as bad as the bill is, the one good thing is, while he will fight the predictable fight when they - Democrats go good shopping, he now has an additional $1.375 billion to keep building the wall in the process. And secondly, he's going to reallocate those funds, which other Presidents have done as well, and let's say it goes to $7 billion or $8 billion or even if it's just $1 billion, that keeps the process going ahead of time. Is that in the end the President getting the wall done and showing the American people that he's fighting to get his promise accomplished, just like tax cuts, just like trade deals, just like Supreme Court justices and everything else that he's kept his promise on. Isn't that going to matter in the end that he gets it done?"

So in the 60s after the Kennedy assassination, there was a move to provide for what happens when the President's disabled. It's not a measure to use the Constitution because you don't like the President or you don't like the President's policies. That's what happens in other countries with secret police and it's impossible to believe that the Democratic Party could stand for this. This has to be brought out all of the evidence related to this that any officials of the FBI or the Justice Department were ever even contemplating this misuse of the 25th Amendment.
